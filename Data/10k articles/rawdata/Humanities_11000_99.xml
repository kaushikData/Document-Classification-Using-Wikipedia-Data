      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2644">'''AltLaw''' was an [[United States|American]] [[academic]] project from 2007 to 2010 aimed at making [[United States Courts of Appeals|federal appellate]] and [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case law publicly available, "to make the [[common law]] a bit more common."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~cs6998/final_reports/ss2806-report.pdf AltLaw report]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Stuart Sierra (Note: this describes an early pre-release version)&lt;/ref&gt; The project was a collaboration between [[Columbia Law School]]'s Program on Law and Technology and [[University of Colorado School of Law]]'s Silicon Flatirons program.

After Google Scholar added legal case documents to its collection in November 2009, the project announced that its mission was achieved, and it shut down permanently on May 3, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100523204837/http://altlaw.org/ AltLaw.org front page], archived from [http://altlaw.org/ the original]&lt;/ref&gt;

When AltLaw was launched, digital access to US case law was dominated by [[LexisNexis]] and [[Westlaw]],&lt;ref&gt;"The structure of market relations between Lexis and Westlaw suggests elements of a noncollusive [[duopoly]]." William G. Shepherd, ''The Economics of Industrial Organization 246 (4th ed. 1997)'' (discussing examples of noncollusive duopolies such as Boeing and Airbus and Mattel and Hasbro).&lt;/ref&gt; charges for access to which can run in the hundreds of dollars per hour.

The data in AltLaw contained roughly 716,000 cases decided between 1950 and 2007, made available on US Circuit Appeals and Supreme courts web sites, all linked to from [http://www.uscourts.gov uscourts.gov], and collected by Prof. Paul K. Ohm at University of Colorado Law School and by [[Public.Resource.Org]].

'''Arvind Sharma''' is the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at [[McGill University]]. Sharma's works focus on [[comparative religion]], [[Hinduism]], [[philosophy of religion]] and the role of women in religion. Some of his more widely read works include ''Our Religions'' and ''Women in World Religions'', which were edited by him. ''Feminism in World Religions'' was selected as a [[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] Outstanding Academic Book (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.emory.edu/HSC/sharma.html Dr. Arvind Sharma], Emory University Hindu Students Council, retrieved 2015-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography== 
Arvind Sharma was born on the 13th of January 1940 in [[Varanasi]], [[India]] . Raised in a family that traditionally worked in the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), he followed suit and joined the IAS in 1962 after a distinguished academic career. 

He served in the State of Gujarat until 1968, when he moved to the United States to pursue higher studies in economics at the [[University of Syracuse]], obtaining a Masters in economics in 1970.  While pursuing the role of non-economic factors in economic development he became interested in religion and joined Harvard Divinity School in 1972.  After obtaining a Masters in Theological Studies, concentrating on comparative religion, he earned his PhD from the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies in 1978.  His doctorate work involved the first ever translation in English of Abhinavagupta's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.

While at Harvard he was recruited in 1976 by the newly founded Department of Studies in Religion at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. In 1980 he moved to the University of Sydney, from where he was hired by McGill University in Canada in 1987.  In 1994 he was appointed the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at McGill University, where he continues to teach as of 2018.

'''Atakapa''' (natively ''Ishak-koi'') is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[language isolate]] native to southwestern [[Louisiana]] and nearby coastal eastern [[Texas]]. It was spoken by the [[Atakapa]] people (also known as ''Ishak'', after the native word for "people"). The language became extinct in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithun |first=Marianne |title=The Languages of Native North America |edition=First paperback |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=0-521-23228-7 |page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical variation==

According to Swanton (1929) and Goddard (1996), Atakapa could be classified into Eastern and Western varieties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goddard|first=Ives|date=Spring 2005|title=The Indigenous Languages of the Southeast|url=|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=47|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Atakapa is known from a French-Atakapa glossary with 287 entries, compiled in 1802 by Martin Duralde.&lt;ref&gt;Durald, Martin. ''Vocabulaire de la Language des Atacapas.'' Gallatin, 1836.&lt;/ref&gt; The speakers interviewed by Duralde lived in the easternmost part of Atakapa territory, around ''Poste des Attakapas'' (Saint Martinville) — now [[Franklin, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Western Atakapa is the better-attested of the two varieties. In 1885, [[Albert Gatschet]] collected words, sentences, and texts from the last native Atakapa speakers (Louison Huntington, Delilah Moss, Teet Verdine, and Armojean Reon) in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]]. Additionally, in 1721, Jean Béranger collected a small vocabulary from captive speakers in [[Galveston Bay]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[John R. Swanton|John Swanton]] argued that the Béranger vocabulary represented the Akokisa language, spoken by a people somewhat inland from Galveston Bay, but there is little evidence to support this assertion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===

Atakapa has five vowels as presented in Swadesh (1946). Vowel length is not contrastive in Atakapa.

=== Consonants ===

According to Swadesh (1946), Atakapa has the consonants presented in the following chart.

Underlying /ŋ/ surfaces as [k] when it appears at the end of a syllable. Swadesh further notes that /m/ often surfaces as [n] or [ŋ] word-finally in some adjectives, but "irregular variations in [Gatschet's] writing" preclude him from settling on any further conditions for this.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swadesh|first=Morris|date=July 1946|title=Phonologic Formulas for Atakapa-Chitimacha|jstor=1262991|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=12|pages=113–132|doi=10.1086/463901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it is unclear whether /n/ is indeed a distinct phoneme from /ŋ/; if this is the case, argues Swadesh, then words containing final /n/ must have arrived in a later period.

Consonant clusters consisting of a stop followed by a sibilant — themselves arising from vowel epenthesis — are generally contracted to /c/. For example, ''kec-k'' ("liver") arose from *''keks'', which arose from [[epenthesis]] and final-vowel deletion processes in ''*kekesi'', which itself is the reduplicated form of *''kesi''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there are words in which the suffix -''kš'' appears, suggesting that this contraction rule ran its course in an earlier period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Syllable structure and stress ===
The typical Atakapa syllable is of the structure CVC. Swanton (1929) observes that clusters of more than two consonants are rare in the language. From his analysis of Gatschet's data, he concludes that consonant clusters of any size are ''not'' permitted in the syllable onset, but that they ''are'' permitted in the coda.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanton|first=John R.|date=July 1929|title=A Sketch of the Atakapa Language|url=|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=5|pages=121–149|doi=10.1086/463777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress is "a purely mechanical function of phrase rhythm" in Atakapa; it is generally the final syllable of a phrase that receives stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Morphology ==
The Atakapa language is a mostly [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]], somewhat [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] language of the [[Templatic morphology|templatic]] type. This meaning that the language stacks (primarily within the verbal complex) a number of affixes to express [[Locative case|locatives]], [[Tense (grammar)|tense]], [[Aspect (grammar)|aspect]], [[Modality (grammar)|modality]], [[Valency (linguistics)|valency adjustment]], and person/number (as both subject and object), which are assembled in a rather specific order. Person marking is one of the only instances of fusion within the language, fusing both person and number. Nouns have only a handful of suffixes and usually take only one suffix at a time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The language is largely [[Head-marking language|head-marking]]; however, reduplication of an adjectival stem tends to show [[Dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]], as it often expresses the plurality of the noun it describes.
# ''shāk tōl'' "good man"
# ''shāk tōltōl'' "good men"

=== Pronominal morphology ===
Object pronouns are prefixed to verbs, while subject pronouns are suffixed. There are independent forms of each pronoun as well: in the first person singular and plural, this form appears to be distinct from either affix, but in the second and third persons, the affixes seem to be related to the independent forms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Grammatical gender appears not to occur in Atakapa, though evidence for it in nearby languages (e.g. Chitimacha) has been found.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The following table&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; of pronominal forms is presented in Swanton (1919).

!3

|hak-
| -ūl, -ti (with intransitives)
|}
In addition, Swanton notes the existence of a reflexive prefix ''hat-'' and a reciprocal prefix ''hak-.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, the reflexive form may be a circumfix rather than a prefix: Kaufman cites the example of ''hat-yul-šo'' ("paint themselves"), in which both ''hat-'' and ''-šo'' indicate reflexivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Nominal morphology ===
There are multiple ways to indicate a noun's plurality in Atakapa:

# attachment to the noun of the suffix ''-heu'' ("many")&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
# attachment to the noun of the prefix ''-šak'' (to indicate an indefinite plural)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# reduplication of the accompanying adjective
# employment of the plural suffix in the accompanying adjective and/or verb

According to Swanton (1919), a noun-forming affix ''-nen'' or ''-nan'' exists in Atakapa.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Verbal morphology ===
The full order&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=David|date=2014|title=Another Look at Atakapa|url=https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/15949/KWPL-35-Kaufman.pdf;sequence=1|journal=Kansas Working Papers in Linguistics|volume=35|pages=72–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of morphemes within the verb complex is:

# Objective pronominal prefix
# Locative prefixes (if applicable)
# Verb stem
# Plural suffix ''-m'' or usitative suffix ''-u'' (if applicable)
# Infinitive or emphatic suffix ''-c'' (if applicable)
# Future suffix ''-ti'' (if applicable)
# Aspectual suffixes: continuative ''-k'', intentional ''-n'', etc. (if applicable)
# Assertive suffix: ''-š'' (if applicable)
# Subjective pronominal suffix
# Tense suffixes: past perfective ''-at'', past imperfective ''-hinst'' (if applicable)
# Negative (if applicable)

It is unclear whether or not a distinct class of auxiliary verbs exists in Atakapa; the difference between a stem-plus-auxiliary construction and a two-verb-serialization construction is not well marked.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Additionally, there is no mention of the assertive suffix ''-š'' in Swanton's work; Kaufman (2014) derives it by analogizing Atakapa and [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Verb serialization ====
[[Serial verb construction|Verb serialization]] is a productive process in Atakapa.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# ''pam-nima'' (lit. "beat-die"): beat to death.
# ''ta-wat-ten'' (lit. "stand-come-talk"): pray.

== Syntax ==
Atakapa exhibits strict [[Subject–object–verb|subject-object-verb]] word order. While verbs are typically found in sentence-final position, it is common for [[Adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts,]] or even [[subordinate clauses]], to follow the verb of the [[principal clause]]. The suffixes ''-ne'' and ''-n'' are used to indicate the subordination of a clause to the main clause, as in ''tsanuk micat penene'' ("she gave a horse [for curing her]").&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

With occasional exceptions, adjectives follow the nouns they describe. Adverbs follow nouns and adjectives, but precede verbs.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Structural and Lexical Comparison of the Tunica, Chitimacha, and Atakapa Languages|last=Swanton|first=John R.|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=1919|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case marking===
Atakapa marks only the [[Locative case|locative]] case. The language has four locative suffixes, in addition to a series of locative postpositions. These suffixes and postpositions may be placed after nouns, adjectives, and demonstratives.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* ''-kin'', the most frequently-occurring suffix, expresses the sense of English "in" or "on," as in ''nun-kin tōhulāt'' ("they lived in villages").
** ''-ki'' (occasionally ''-ke'') occurs in similar contexts.
* ''-ip'' corresponds roughly to English "at," and is very commonly used with ''nē'', "down," to form ''nēp'', "below."
* ''-ik'' generally parallels English "with," as in ''hatyūlcō nōhik'' ("they painted themselves with red").

=== Noun incorporation ===
Swanton (1919) asserts that noun incorporation is present in Atakapa, but he provides no examples of this.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Deixis ===
Three demonstratives serve as deictics in Atakapa:

# ''ha'' or ''a'', "this" — co-present with the speaker.
# ''ya'', distant from the speaker.
# ''ma'', still more distant from the speaker.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Genealogical relations==

While considered an isolate, there have been attempts to connect Atakapa with other languages of the Southeast. In 1919 [[John R. Swanton]] proposed a Tunican language family that would include Atakapa, [[Tunica language|Tunica]], and [[Chitimacha language|Chitimacha]]; [[Morris Swadesh]] would later provide work focusing on connections between Atakapa and Chitimacha. [[Mary Haas]] later expanded the proposal by adding [[Natchez language|Natchez]] and the [[Muskogean languages]], a hypothesis known as [[Gulf languages|Gulf]]. These proposed families have not been proven.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The similarities between Atakapa and Chitimacha, at least, may be attributable to periods of "intense contact [between speakers of the two languages] owing to their geographic proximity."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4364">'''Beçin''' (also known as Berçin or Peçin) was a historical fort in [[Turkey]].

==Geography==

Beçin is situated on a low hill just south west of a modern village bearing the same name, in [[Milas]] [[ilçe]] (district center) of [[Muğla Province]] at {{coord| 37|16|30|N|27|47|21|E}}. Its distance to Milas is {{convert|4|km}} and to [[Muğla]]  is {{convert|66|km}}.

==History==
The site has remains from the Hellenistic period, including a 4th-century temple. A [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] church indicates the settlement continued to exist into the medieval period - though its minor importance is suggested by the small dimensions of the church. According to a contemporary Italian source its name was ''Pezona''.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5730 Unesco page]&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 13th century it was captured by the [[Menteşe Beylik]], a principality founded by a [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]] tribe. Beçin became the capital of the [[Anatolian beyliks|beylik]] and it expanded rapidly in size. In 1333 [[Ibn Battuta]] visited Beçin, described it as a newly founded city, and mentioned its houses and mosques.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''Türkiye tarihi Cilt I'', AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p 217&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the surviving monuments originate from the 14th century. In the 15th century the beylik of Menteşe was annexed by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. An indication of the town's subsequent decay is revealed in [[Evliya Çelebi]]'s account of his visit there: he wrote that the town did not have a [[Turkish bath|hammam]], yet excavations have revealed the remains of five hammams. A settlement continued to exist inside the site until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Ottoman Art - The Legacy of the Emirates", Vienna, 2002. p73-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monuments==
The '''Ahmet Gazi Madrasa''', named after the Bey who commissioned it, dates from 1375 according to the Arabic inscription above its entrance. The entrance portal, while retaining the components of a traditional Seljuk-era portal, has details that resemble European Gothic architecture, possibly indicating an influence deriving from the Menteşe Beylik's commercial activities with the Aegean islands, Italy and southern France (the Bey is described as "Sultan of the Coasts" in the inscription). Modern reconstruction work has rebuilt large sections of the entrance façade on each side of its portal. The madrasa has eight chambers and two [[iwan]]s, opening directly onto a rectangular central courtyard (the usual portico is not present here). The grave of Ahmet Gazi is located in the main iwan, an adjoining grave may be that of another Menteşe ruler - Shujaeddin Bey.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Ottoman Art - The Legacy of the Emirates", Vienna, 2002. p75-76.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Kizil Han''', a caravanserai, is a two story structure and one of two hans surviving in Beçin. It is plain and unimposing, and is partially ruined with its upper floor collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Ottoman Art - The Legacy of the Emirates", Vienna, 2002. p77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
'''Buyuk Hammam''', (the "large bathhouse"), is one of five hammams that once existed in the town. All are now in ruins. The Buyuk Hammam must have once been one of the town's most imposing structures - though now most of its roof has collapsed. Excavations have revealed its internal rooms and exposed its original floor level which is paved with marble blocks.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Ottoman Art - The Legacy of the Emirates", Vienna, 2002. p74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Heritage Site status==
The medieval city (both the fort and the village) was added to the tentative list in the cultural category of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] on April 13, 2012. Buildings such as ''Kızıl Han, Kara Paşa Han'' and ''Emir Courtyard'', the ''Orman Lodge'', the ''New Church'' and the ''Byzantine Chapel'' are among the archaeological remains.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt; According to the Ministry of Culture, Beçin reflects the architecture of the beylik (mainly 14th century) era and the characteristics of the early Turkish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,45342/becin-ortacag-kenti-mugla.html Ministry of Culture page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bookworm''' is a popular generalization for any [[insect]] that supposedly bores through [[book]]s.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/bookworm|title=Bookworm insect|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], inc.|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wiener|first1=Ann Elizabeth  |title=What’s That Smell You’re Reading? |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/whats-that-smell-youre-reading |journal=Distillations |publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|date=2018|volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36-39|accessdate=July 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual book-borers are uncommon. Two moths, the [[Tineola bisselliella|common clothes moth]] and the [[Hofmannophila pseudospretella|brown house moth]], will attack cloth bindings.&lt;ref name=controllingpests&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/pest-insects/identifying-and-controlling-clothes-moths-carpet-beetles-and-silver%EF%AC%81sh|title=Identifying and controlling clothes moths, carpet beetles and silverﬁsh|publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/storage-entrepose/sip-irs/bhm-tds-eng.htm|title=Brown house moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella (Stainton)|publisher=Canadian Grain Commission|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leather-bound books attract various beetles, such as the [[Dermestes lardarius|larder beetle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/storage-entrepose/sip-irs/lb-dl-eng.htm|title=Larder beetle|publisher=Canadian Grain Commission|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the larva of the [[Attagenus unicolor|black carpet beetle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/black-carpet-beetle|title=Black Carpet Beetle|publisher=[[Penn State]]|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Stegobium paniceum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/stored/drugstore_beetle.htm|title=Drugstore beetle|publisher=[[University of Florda]]|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larval [[Xestobium rufovillosum|death watch beetle]]s and [[Anobium punctatum|common furniture beetle]]s will tunnel through wood and paper (if it is nearby the wood).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/woodworm/woodworm.htm|title=Woodworm Anobium Punctatum|publisher=buildingconservation.com|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/deathwatch-beetle|title=Deathwatch beetle|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], inc.|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Booklice==
A major book-feeding insect is the book or paper louse (also known as booklouse or paperlouse). These are tiny (under 1&amp;nbsp;mm), soft-bodied wingless ''[[Psocoptera]]ns'' (usually ''Trogium pulsatorium''), which actually feed on microscopic [[mold]]s and other organic matter found in ill-maintained works (e.g., cool, damp, dark, and undisturbed areas of archives, libraries, and museums), although they will also attack bindings and other book parts. The booklouse is not a true [[louse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialpest.com/bugs-that-eat-books/|title=Bugs That Eat Books!|publisher=Colonial Pest Control Inc.|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the twentieth century, modern bookbinding materials thwarted much of the damage done to books by various types of book-boring insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, NY|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canton El Tablón''' belonged to the Municipality of [[Suchitoto]], [[Cuscatlán Department|Cuscatlan]], [[El Salvador]]. El Tablón was one of many [[Canton (country subdivision)|''cantons'']] in the surrounding area that was flooded as a result of the ''[[Cerron Grande Hydroelectric Dam]]'' built in El Salvador between 1972-1976 that created the artificial Lago Suchitlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-07-21|title=Suchitoto|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suchitoto&amp;oldid=791589150|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former residents of El Tablon, the area was divided up into four main ''[[wikt:caserío]]s'' or hamlets, '''''Caserio La Hacienda Vieja''''', '''''Caserio Los Figueroas''''', '''''Caserio Valle El Tablón''''', and '''''Caserio Los Palitos'''''. It is unclear where the name El Tablon originated from, but according to local historians, an ''[[wikt:aldea#Noun 3|aldea]]'' or village/hamlet of El Tablón existed prior to 1860 that was formed through a municipal ''[[ejido]]''. An ''ejido'' was commonly-owned municipal land granted by the [[Spanish Crown]] to governing bodies in the [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Una republica agraria: los campesinos en la economia y la politica de El Salvador en el siglo XIX.|last=Lauria-Santiago|first=Aldo|publisher=Direccion de Publicaciones e Impresos|year=2003|isbn=|location=San Salvador|pages=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lands were considered ''vacant'' or ''unused land'' in some cases belonging to existing indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suchitoto, tierra memorial de lucha y esperanza|last=|first=|publisher=Fundabril|year=2013|isbn=|location=El Salvador|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Una republica agraria: los campesinos en la economia y la politica de El Salvador en el siglo XIX|last=Lauria-Santiago|first=Aldo|publisher=Direccion de Publicaciones e Impresos|year=2003|isbn=|location=San Salvador|pages=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== The Barca of Rio Lempa ===
According to various first-hand accounts, the '''''Barca del Rio Lempa''''' was a boating transportation system that would transport people and goods across the Rio Lempa between the Departments of Cuscatlan and [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chalatenangosv.com/la-barca-del-rio-lempa|title=La barca del rio Lempa|last=Calero|first=Mario|date=2015|website=ChalatenangoSV|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous decades, the shortest way to go from Chalatenango to the capital city of [[San Salvador]], residents would use the San Francisco Lempa road that would take them to the [[Rio Lempa]] where they would cross from Canton Los Zepedas, in the municipality of [[San Francisco Lempa]], Chalatenango to Canton El Tablon, in the municipality of Suchitoto, Cuscatlan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The location of the boat crossing was about 13 kilometres from the city of Chalatenango, in the Department with the same name, and about 10 kilometres northeast of the city of Suchitoto, Cuscatlan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the early 20th century, a large number of people were transported across the Rio Lempa on a daily basis. It became an essential part of the local economy and the tourism industry of both departments. As a result of this high usage, the departmental governments of Chalatenango and Cuscatlan agreed to build a suspension bridge named ''Cayetano Bosque'' that was destroyed by a severe storm in 1934.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That same year, the municipality of San Francisco Lempa decided to build a boat that would be able to transport people and good across the Rio Lempa as the demand was still very high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That first boat was named ''Tablon Cayetano Bosque''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was used to not only transport people and goods but also vehicles such as local buses that traveled between the city of Chalatenango and the city of San Salvador.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The initiative to build and use these boats as transportation was headed by Don Teodulo Zepeda, son of General Juan Orlando Zepeda.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Local Oral History from Roberto Arturo Zepeda from Chalatenango, El Salvador.&lt;/ref&gt; Don Teodulo Zepeda became the administrator of the first boat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These boats were built of wood with a lifespan of at least five years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to some former users of the transportation system, the boat was susceptible to sinking when there was too much weight on top and would occur most often when transporting buses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To address this issue, the boat was attached to a cable above the boat that crossed the river and was attached to the shorelines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  At some point after the construction of the ''Tablon Cayetano Bosque'' bridge, another bridge was built across the Rio Lempa known by locals as ''Puente Remolino'' that was also destroyed not long after its construction by another severe storm.&lt;ref&gt;Local Oral History from Santiago Arteaga former resident of Caserio Hacienda Vieja, Canton El Tablon, Suchitoto, Cuscatlan, El Salvador.&lt;/ref&gt; These bridges were never rebuilt and so the Barca del Rio Lempa continued to be of great use for local residents of the area until 1976 when the ''Cerron Grande Hydroelectric Dam'' was fully built and the lands surround the river in the ''Paraiso Basin'' were flooded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Diaspora, Internal Displacement &amp; the Construction of the Cerron Grande Hydroelectric Dam ===
What is known today as Lake Suchitlan, a man-made lake, was formed in the mid-1970s as a result of the [[Cerrón Grande Dam|Cerron Grande Hydroelectric Dam]] construction. It was named Lago Suchitlan by the now deceased local Alejandro Coto after Municipality of Suchitoto and the Department of Cuscatlan. It was a project initiated by the central federal government of El Salvador to produce hydro electricity for the country. As a result of the flooding associated with the project, 13,339 people were internally displaced from their family homes and lands in the Paraiso Basin of El Salvador, with around 9,000 people relocating to other communities and the rest receiving a small lump sum of money for their properties.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suchitoto, tierra memorial de lucha y esperanza|last=|first=|publisher=Fundabril|year=2013|isbn=|location=El Salvador|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosas503.wordpress.com/2014/11/26/cerron-grande-un-proyecto-sin-historia/|title=Cerron Grande: Un Proyecto Sin Historia|last=Barrientos|first=Luis|date=26 November 2014|website=WordPress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project affected four Departments, 1.Chalatenango, 2.Cuscatlan, 3.San Salvador, and 4.Cabanas, with the Department of Chalatenango seeing the most municipalities affected including Tejutla, El Paraiso, San Rafael, Santa Rita, Chalatenango, Azacualpa, San Francisco Lempa, San Luis del Carmen, and Potonico; San Salvador seeing the municipality of El Paisnal affected, and Cuscatlan seeing the municipality of Suchitoto affected.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The project was initiated on August 4, 1972 by the newly elected government of former President Arturo Armando Molina who had discussed the project as part of his government's platform. The project was to create a dam on the [[Lempa River|Rio Lempa]] where two Francis turbines, with a capacity to produce 67.5 MW each, would be constructed as additions to the two turbine system already built on the Rio Guajoyo and Rio Lempa. The project was advertised as the best resource for the country's energy problem, and was to be built 22 kilometres upstream from the Central dam on the Rio Lempa, between the municipality of Potonico, Chalatenango and Jutiapa, Cabanas. As a result of this construction, 2,180 million cubic metres of water flooded an area of around 13,500 hectares of land and formed the 135 kilometres squared artificial lake called Lago Suchitlan. As a result of the lake, 24+ archaeological sites were flooded and multiple ''cantons'' and ''caserios'' or hamlets disappeared. In Suchitoto, only two cantons disappeared, Canton El Tablon, and Canton San Juan.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The displacement of such a huge population had severe effects on the way of life for thousands of Salvadorians. In Canton El Tablon, there was a population of an estimated 2000 people at the time of the ''llena'' or "filling," as described by former residents of the affected areas. The ''lleno'' literally means ''filling'' in Spanish and refers to the filling of water or flooding of the Basin. Many displaced peoples from the cantons in Chalatenango, were relocated by the federal government to three newly built ''reurbanicaciones'', or ''residential communities''. These Reurbanicaciones are located in the Department of Chalatenango and are called ''Reurbanicacion Nucleo #1 "Areneros," Reurbanicacion Nucleo #2, and Reurbanicacion #3.''

First-hand accounts of former residents of Canton El Tablon, describe how a group of residents belonging to the Arteaga family came together during this time and instead of relocating to federally-built urban residential communities, they decided to sell their lands to the federal government and collectively purchase a large farmable piece of land in another location where they could continue their rural way of living. The piece of farmland they eventually purchased among themselves was outside of the municipality of Suchitoto and the Department of Cuscatlan. The Arteaga family had purchased a piece of land in the [[La Libertad Department (El Salvador)|Department of La Libertad]], in the municipality of [[San José Villanueva|San Jose Villanueva]], Caserio Santa Maria. It was here that the Arteaga clan, who had lived in Suchitoto Cuscatlan since the mid-19th century, chose to start a new life, not knowing that only a few years after settling into their new homes that many had built themselves, they would once again be internally displaced due to the outbreak of civil war in El Salvador and the [[Massacre of Santa Maria]] on September 22, 1980.

'''Charlottenburg Palace''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Schloss Charlottenburg'') is the largest palace in [[Berlin]],&lt;ref name=tourinf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin-tourist-information.de/cgi-bin/sehenswertes.pl?id=13357&amp;sprache=english |title=Schloss Charlottenburg |accessdate=2008-07-16 |publisher=Berlin Tourismus Marketing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172115/http://www.berlin-tourist-information.de/cgi-bin/sehenswertes.pl?id=13357&amp;sprache=english |archivedate=2008-05-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Editorial Fisa Escudo de Oro, S.

The palace was built at the end of the 17th century and was greatly expanded during the 18th century. It includes much lavish internal decoration in [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] and [[rococo]] styles. A large formal garden surrounded by woodland was added behind the palace, including a [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]], a [[mausoleum]], a theatre and a pavilion. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the palace was badly damaged but has since been reconstructed. The palace with its gardens are a major tourist attraction.

[[File:Baugeschichte-des-Schlosses-Charlottenburg-aus-Gundlach-1905.jpg|mini|thumb|upright=2.0|The building history of Charlottenburg Palace&lt;ref&gt;aus: Wilhelm Gundlach (Hrsg.): Geschichte der Stadt Charlottenburg, Berlin 1905, I. Band, Seite 174&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The original palace was commissioned by [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover|Sophie Charlotte]], the wife of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Friedrich I]], [[Elector of Brandenburg]] in what was then the village of Lietzow. Named ''Lietzenburg'', the palace was designed by [[Johann Arnold Nering]] in [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style. It consisted of one wing and was built in {{frac|2|1|2}} storeys with a central [[cupola]]. The façade was decorated with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster]]s. On the top was a [[cornice]] on which were statues. At the rear in the centre of the palace were two oval halls, the upper one being a ceremonial hall and the lower giving access to the gardens. Nering died during the construction of the palace and the work was completed by [[Martin Grünberg]] and [[Andreas Schlüter]]. The inauguration of the palace was celebrated on 11 July 1699, Frederick's 42nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|pp=7–8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich crowned himself as King Friedrich I in Prussia in 1701 (Friedrich II, known as Frederick the Great, would later achieve the title King of Prussia). Two years previously, he had appointed [[Johann Friedrich von Eosander]] (also known as Eosander von Göthe) as the royal architect and sent him to study architectural developments in Italy and France, particularly the [[Palace of Versailles]]. On his return in 1702, Eosander began to extend the palace, starting with two side wings to enclose a large courtyard, and the main palace was extended on both sides. Sophie Charlotte died in 1705 and Friedrich named the palace and its estate ''Charlottenburg'' in her memory. In the following years, the [[Orangery]] was built on the west of the palace and the central area was extended with a large domed tower and a larger vestibule. On top of the dome is a wind vane in the form of a gilded statue representing [[Fortuna|Fortune]] designed by [[Andreas Heidt]]. The Orangery was originally used to overwinter rare plants. During the summer months, when over 500 orange, citrus and sour orange trees decorated the baroque garden, the Orangery regularly was the gorgeous scene of courtly festivities.

[[File:Berlin belvedere schlossgarten charlottenburg 01 20080423.JPG|thumb|right|Tea house "Belvedere" in palace garden]]
Various artists were invited to decorate the interior of the palace.  As the court painter of Friedrich I, the Flemish artist [[Jan Anthonie Coxie]] was commissioned to paint the walls and ceilings in various rooms of the palace. Coxie painted between 1701 and 1713 frescos and an altarpiece in the Palace Chapel and frescos in the Gobelin Gallery and Porcelain Room.&lt;ref name=roel&gt;Roeland van Eijnden, [[Adriaan van der Willigen]], ''Johan Anhonij Coxie'', in 'Geschiedenis der vaderlandsche schilderkunst, sedert de helft der XVIII eeuw', Volume 1, A. Loosjes, Pz., 1816, p. 285-286 {{link language|nl|Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The frescos in the Porcelain Room were blatant propaganda for the glorious rule of Friedrich I.  They represent Aurora, the Goddess of Dawn, in her seven-horsed chariot chasing away Night and clearing the way for the Sun-God Apollo, who approaches in his chariot in a blaze of light. Hovering overhead, Mercury heralds the arrival of the life-giving god and Saturn ushers in the Golden Age with his scythe.  Coxie also included images of the Four Continents as well as the Four Seasons, which are familiar allusions to political power and thus affirm the greatness of Friedrich I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&amp;dvs=1414860114050~762 Tania Solweig Shamy, ''Frederick the Great‟s Porcelain Diversion: The Chinese Tea House at Sanssouci''], Department of Art History and Communication Studies, McGill University, Montreal, October 2009, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the palace, was a room described as "the eighth wonder of the world", the [[Amber Room]] (''Bernsteinzimmer''), a room with its walls surfaced in decorative [[amber]]. It was designed by Andreas Schlüter and its construction by the Danish amber craftsman [[Gottfried Wolfram]] started in 1701. Friedrich Wilhelm I gave the Amber Room to [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] as a present in 1716.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/brief_amber.html |title=A Brief History of the Amber Room |magazine=Smithsonian |accessdate=2008-07-16 |last=Blumberg |first= Jess |date=1 August 2007 |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berlin Schloss Charlottenburg Orangerie 20080423.jpg|thumb|290px|Charlottenburg Palace, Orangerie]]
When Friedrich I died in 1713, he was succeeded by his son, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]] whose building plans were less ambitious, although he did ensure that the building was properly maintained. Building was resumed after his son [[Frederick II of Prussia|Friedrich II]] (Frederick the Great) came to the throne in 1740. During that year, stables for his personal guard regiment were completed to the south of the Orangery wing and work was started on the east wing. The building of the new wing was supervised by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]], the Superintendent of all the Royal Palaces, who largely followed Eosander's design. The decoration of the exterior was relatively simple but the interior furnishings were rich with painting and sculpture,textiles and mirror. The ground floor was intended for Frederick's wife [[Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern|Elisabeth Christine]], who, preferring [[Schönhausen Palace]] however, was only an occasional visitor. The especially splendid decoration of the upper floor, which included the White Hall, the Banqueting Hall, the Throne Room and the Golden Gallery, was designed mainly by [[Johann August Nahl]]. In 1747, a second apartment for the king was prepared in the distant eastern part of the wing. During this time, [[Sanssouci]] was being built at [[Potsdam]], and once this was completed Frederick was only an occasional visitor to Charlottenburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|pp=19–21.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786, Frederick was succeeded by his nephew [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm II]] who transformed five rooms on the ground floor of the east wing into his summer quarters and part of the upper floor into Winter Chambers, although he did not live long enough to use them. His son, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm III]] came to the throne in 1797 and reigned with his wife, [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Luise]] for 43 years. They spent much of this time living in the east wing of Charlottenburg. Their eldest son, [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm IV]], who reigned from 1840 to 1861, lived in the upper storey of the central palace building. After Friedrich Wilhelm IV died, the only other royal resident of the palace was [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Friedrich III]] who reigned for 99 days in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|pp=22–26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace was badly damaged in 1943 during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aviewoncities.com/berlin/charlottenburg.htm |title=Charlottenburg Palace |accessdate=2008-07-16 |publisher=A View on Cities}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, the war-damaged [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] in East Berlin was demolished and, as the damage to Charlottenburg was at least as serious, it was feared that it would also be demolished. However, following the efforts of Margarete Kühn, the Director of the State Palaces and Gardens, it was rebuilt to its former condition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|p=26.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with gigantic modern ceiling paintings by [[Hann Trier]]. From 2004 till early 2006, Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany, whilst [[Schloss Bellevue]] was being renovated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[File:Schloss-Charlottenburg Schlosspark.jpg|thumbnail|400px|right| Gardens of Charlottenburg Palace]]
The garden was designed in 1697 in baroque style by Simeon Godeau who had been influenced by [[André Le Nôtre]], designer of the gardens at Versailles. Godeau's design consisted of geometric patterns, with avenues and moats, which separated the garden from its natural surroundings. Beyond the formal gardens was the Carp Pond. Towards the end of the 18th century, a less formal, more natural-looking garden design became fashionable. In 1787 the Royal Gardener [[Georg Steiner]] redesigned the garden in the [[English garden|English landscape]] style for Friedrich Wilhelm II, the work being directed by [[Peter Joseph Lenné]]. After the Second World War, the centre of the garden was restored to its previous baroque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|pp=13–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1788, Friedrich Wilhelm II arranged for the building of the [[Belvedere (structure)|Belvedere]], designed by [[Carl Gotthard Langhans]], in the grounds beyond the Carp Pond. The building was used as a teahouse and as a viewing-tower. Langhans also designed the Palace Theatre, which was built between 1788 and 1791 to the west of the Orangery wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|pp=22–24.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mausoleum]] was built as a tomb for Queen Luise between 1810 and 1812 in [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] to a design by [[Heinrich Gentz]]. After the death of Friedrich Wilhelm III, it was extended; this design being by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. It was extended again in 1890–91 by [[Albert Geyer]] to accommodate the graves of [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] and his wife [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar|Augusta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|pp=25–26.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, Friedrich Wilhelm III added the ''Neuer Pavilion'', an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] villa designed by Schinkel, to the north of the palace. This was damaged in the war in 1943 and was reconstructed between 1957 and 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace and grounds are a major visitor attraction.
* For an admission charge, parts of the interior of the palace are open to visitors, including the Old Palace (''Alte Schloss'') and the New Wing (''Neuer Flügel''). The Old Palace contains many rooms with [[baroque]] decoration, and includes a room called the Porcelain Cabinet, which holds thousands of [[porcelain]] objects. On special display are the crown jewels and the royal silver and fine porcelain tableware. The New Wing includes the opulent [[rococo]] State Apartments of Frederick the Great and the more modest Winter Chambers of Friedrich Wilhelm II. The formal and informal gardens are freely open to the public.
* For an admission charge, the Mausoleum, the Belvedere and the Neue Pavilion are open to visitors.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The Mausoleum contains the graves of, and memorials to, members of the Hohenzollern family. The memorial to Queen Luise includes her reclining [[effigy]], which is made from [[Carrara]] [[marble]] and was designed by [[Christian Daniel Rauch]].
* Also open to the public are the Belvedere, which contains a collection of Berlin porcelain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.kpm-berlin.com/manufaktur/philosophie/schloss_belvedere/default.aspx |title=KPM - Königliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Berlin I Manufacture &amp;#124; Philosophy &amp;#124; Belvedere Palace |publisher=En.kpm-berlin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519050851/http://en.kpm-berlin.com/manufaktur/philosophie/schloss_belvedere/default.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Neue Pavilion, which houses a collection of arts and crafts of the period when Schinkel was active.
* The former Orangery houses a restaurant and café.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Rimmer |editor-first=Dave |title=Time Out: Berlin |publisher=Ebury Publishing |year=2006 |location=London |pages=109–112 |isbn=978-1-904978-56-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Destroyed during World War II, the Great Orangery was reconstructed on the model of the baroque building. Today, it shines in its old brilliance again. The light-flooded festival room provides a pleasant framework for cultural events, concerts and banquets.
* In addition, a large [[equestrian statue]] of Friedrich Wilhelm I is the focus of the palace courtyard. This was designed by [[Andreas Schlüter]] and made between 1696 and 1700. From 1703, it stood on the Langen Brücke (now the [[Rathausbrücke, Berlin|Rathausbrücke]]) but was moved to a place of safety in the Second World War. On its return after the war, the barge carrying it sank and it was not salvaged until 1949. In 1952, it was erected on its present site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hertzsch|1998|p=18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the street of the palace are two more museums, the [[Bröhan Museum]], which contains [[art nouveau]] and [[art deco]] articles, and the [[Berggruen Museum]], which houses modern art, in particular works by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Paul Klee|Klee]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt;On the left you can find the Scharf-Gerstenberg Collection.  Its collection of paintings, graphics and sculptures, spanning the period from French Romanticism to Surrealism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1078">'''Chestnut''' is a British slang term for an old joke, often as '''old chestnut'''. 
The term is also used for a piece of music in the repertoire that has grown stale or hackneyed with too much repetition. 

A plausible explanation for the term given by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is that it originates from a play named "The Broken Sword" by [[William Dimond]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-che3.htm World Wide Words: "Chestnut"]&lt;/ref&gt; in which one character keeps repeating the same stories, one of them about a [[cork tree]], and is interrupted each time by another character who says: ''Chestnut, you mean ... I have heard you tell the joke twenty-seven times and I am sure it was a chestnut''.  The play was first performed in 1816, but the term did not come into widespread usage until the 1880s.

[[File:Dutchclogs.jpg|thumb|Clogs are often associated with whole foot style [[klomp]]en from the Netherlands]]

'''Clogs''' are a type of [[footwear]] made in part or completely from [[wood]]. Clogs are used worldwide and although the form may vary by culture, within a culture the form often remained unchanged for centuries.

[[Tradition]]al clogs remain in use as [[protective clothing|protective footwear]] in [[agriculture]] and in some [[factory|factories]] and [[Mining|mine]]s. Although clogs are sometimes negatively associated with cheap and folkloric footwear of [[farmer]]s and the [[working class]], some types of clogs are considered [[fashion]] wear today, such as Swedish [[träskor]] or Japanese [[Geta (footwear)|geta]].

Clogs are also used in several different styles of [[clogging|dance]]. When worn for dancing an important feature is the sound of the clog against the floor. This is one of the fundamental roots of [[tap dancing|tap]], but with the tap shoes the taps are free to click against each other and produce a different sound from clogs.

==Types==
[[File:Red Lancashire clogs (side view).jpg|thumb|Wooden soled type [[clog (British)|English clogs]]]]
[[File:Fraumünster Mittelalter Spectaculum 2011-05-20 14-37-32.JPG|thumb|Overshoes type of clogs ([[pattens]]) with leather shoes (German), reconstruction of the Middle Ages]]
The Oxford English Dictionary&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|clog}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines a clog as a "thick piece of wood", and later as a "wooden soled overshoe" and a "shoe with a thick wooden sole".

Welsh traditional clog maker Trefor Owen identified three main varieties of clogs: wooden upper, wooden soled and overshoes. {{sfn|Owen: CPRW|2012}}
* Wooden upper clogs; are made by hollowing out a lump of solid wood to make a combined upper and lower. Two main variants can be seen:
** whole foot clogs; where the wooden upper covers the whole of the foot to near the ankle, such as the familiar Dutch [[klomp]]. They are also known as "wooden shoes".  Whole foot clogs can give sufficient protection to be used as [[safety boot|safety footwear]] without additional reinforcements.
** half open clogs; where the wooden upper extends over the toes or slightly further, such as the Italian "zoccolo" or Belgian sabots. The upper is similar in outline to a [[court shoe]]. Half open clogs may have additional covering or securing straps in some sort of fabric or leather.
* Wooden soled clogs; use wood for the sole only. Wooden soled clogs come with a variety of uppers:
** complete uppers made from leather or similar material, such as [[clog (British)|English clogs]]. For more protection, they may have steel toecaps and/or steel reinforcing inserts in the undersides of the soles
** open sandal type fitting. For example, Japanese [[Geta (footwear)|geta]]
** toe peg styles. For example, Indian [[paduka]]
* Overshoes; are wooden soles with straps designed to be worn over other footwear for protection, commonly known as [[Patten (shoe)|pattens]]. Patten style clogs are not used anymore. However the derivative [[galoshes]] are common worldwide.
These divisions are not fixed: some overshoes look more like whole foot clogs, like Spanish [[albarca]], whilst other wooden soled clogs raise and protect clothing in the way that overshoes do, such as Japanese [[Geta (footwear)|geta]].

The type of upper determines how the clogs are worn. Whole foot clogs need to be close fitting and can be secured by curling the toes. In contrast wooden soled clogs are fastened by laces or buckles on the welt and therefore the toes are relaxed as in shoes. Half open clogs may either be secured like whole foot clogs, or have an additional strap over the top of the foot. Some sandal types, and in particular toe peg styles, are worn more like "[[flip-flops]]" and rely on the grip between the big and next toe.

Being wood, clogs cannot flex under the ball of the foot as softer shoes do. To allow the foot to roll forward most clogs have the bottom of the toe curved up, known as the cast.&lt;ref&gt;Note that some thick-soled women's shoes (stilleto or wedge), which while not wooden soled, are as rigid as clogs. They likewise have to have a noticeable cast.&lt;/ref&gt; Some styles of clogs have "feet", such as Spanish [[albarca]]. The clog rotates around the front edge of the front "feet". Japanese and Indian clogs may have "teeth" or very high pegs attached to the soles. The clog can rotate around the front edge of the front "tooth" as the wearer strides forward. Some medieval pattens were in two pieces, heel through to ball and ball to toes. Joining the two was a leather strip forming a hinge, thus allowing the shoe above to flex.&lt;ref&gt;Grew and De Neergaard, chapter on pattens&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The origin of wooden footwear in Europe is not precisely known. De Boer-Olij reference to the high, thick-soled boots of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy actors in Antiquity (the [[buskin]]) and to the shoes worn by [[Roman empire|Roman]] soldiers (the [[caligae]]).&lt;ref&gt;De Boer-Olij p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a possibility that the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples from Southern- and Northern Europe were familiar with some sort of wooden foot covering. Archaeological finds of these are not known. Wooden footwear often ended up as firewood and, because of its nature, wood will rot away in the long run. The oldest surviving wooden footwear in Europe is found in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], and dates from 1230 and 1280.&lt;ref&gt;Wiedijk p.2&lt;/ref&gt; These finds look very similar to the wooden shoes that are still worn in The Netherlands.

==Manufacture==
Since wooden footwear was a hand-made product, the shape of the footwear, as well as its production process showed great local and regional diversity in style. At the beginning of the 20th century machine-made wooden footwear was introduced. After WW2, in particular, wooden shoes disappeared from sight. They were replaced by more fashionable all-leather and synthetic footwear. At present, only the so-called Swedish clogs (wooden bottom and leather top) is still seen as a trendy fashion item, often as ladies’ high-heeled boots. Nevertheless, traditional wooden footwear is still popular in several regions in Europe and in some occupations, for its practical use. Some historic local variations have recently been replaced by uniform national models.

More information on the various methods of manufacture can be found from the gallery below.

==Gallery==
Presented below are typical clogs from the countries where they are found. Like many folk items the boundaries of manufacture and use are regional and therefore do not always exactly follow those of modern states. So, in some countries two or more different types can be found. It is also possible that one type can be found in bordering countries. For example, Danish, German, Dutch, Belgian and clogs from Northwest France look quite similar.

== Fashion clogs ==
In the 1970s and 1980s, Swedish clogs became popular fashion accessories for both sexes. They were usually worn without socks and were considered suitable [[attire]] for the ''[[avant-garde]]'' man.

In the 1980s and 1990s clogs based on Swedish clogs returned in fashion for women. Platform clogs or sandals, often raised as high as 6 or even 8&amp;nbsp;inches right through between sole and insole, were worn in many western countries. The large mid layer was often made of solid cork, although some were merely of plastic with a cork covering. The sole, more often than not, was made of a light sandy-colored rubber. Some of the platforms of these clogs were encompassed about with a string-laced effect.

In 2007 Dutch designers [[Viktor &amp; Rolf]] introduced high heeled Dutch clogs on the catwalk, with their winter collection of 2007/08.&lt;ref&gt;De Greef&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Every Clog has its Day&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Swedish clogs for women returned again in [[Chanel|Chanel's]] and [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vuitton's]] Spring / Summer 2010 collection.&lt;ref&gt;Dykes&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16080">'''Consciousness-Raising''' (also called '''awareness raising''') is a form of [[activism]], popularized by [[United States]] [[Women's Movement in the United States (1963-1982)|feminists]] in the late 1960s. It often takes the form of a group of people attempting to focus the attention of a wider group of people on some cause or condition. Common issues include diseases (e.g. [[breast cancer awareness|breast cancer]], [[AIDS]]), conflicts (e.g. the [[Darfur genocide]], [[global warming]]), movements (e.g. [[Greenpeace]], [[PETA]], [[Earth Hour]]), and [[partisan (politics)|political parties]] or politicians. Since informing the populace of a public concern is often regarded as the first step to changing how the institutions handle it, raising awareness is often the first activity in which any [[advocacy group]] engages.

However, in practice, raising awareness is often combined with other activities, such as [[fundraising]], membership drives, or [[advocacy]], in order to harness and/or sustain the motivation of new supporters, which may be at its highest just after they have learned and digested the new information.

The term ''awareness raising'' is used in the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] against [[discrimination|discriminatory]] attitudes&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, Article 2, 9, 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[LGBT stereotypes]], as well as the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] to combat [[stereotype]]s, [[prejudice]]s, and harmful practices toward [[disability|people with disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], Article 8 "Awareness raising"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Until the early 17th century, consciousness was used in the sense of moral knowledge of right or wrong, which today is referred to as conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, C. (2004). Introduction to the Study of Consciousness. In The quest for consciousness: A neurobiological approach (p. 1). Denver, CO: Roberts and.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism: Methods of Consciousness Raising==

===Feminism===
Consciousness raising groups were formed by [[New York Radical Women]], an early [[Women's Liberation]] group in [[New York City]], and quickly spread throughout the United States. In November 1967, a group including [[Shulamith Firestone]], [[Anne Koedt]], [[Kathie Sarachild]] (originally Kathie Amatniek), and [[Carol Hanisch]] began meeting in Koedt's apartment. Meetings often involved "going around the room and talking" about issues in their own lives. The phrase "consciousness raising" was coined to describe the process when [[Kathie Sarachild]] took up the phrase from [[Anne Forer]]:

{{quote|"In the Old Left, they used to say that the workers don't know they're oppressed, so we have to raise their consciousness. One night at a meeting I said, 'Would everybody please give me an example from their own life on how they experienced oppression as a woman? I need to hear it to raise my own consciousness.' Kathie was sitting behind me and the words rang in her mind. From then on she sort of made it an institution and called it consciousness-raising."|[[Anne Forer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution | page = 21 | author = Susan Brownmiller}} (quoted by [[Susan Brownmiller]])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On [[Thanksgiving]] 1968, Kathie Sarachild presented ''A Program for Feminist Consciousness Raising'', at the [[First National Women's Liberation Conference]] near [[Chicago, Illinois]], in which she explained the principles behind consciousness-raising, and outlined a program for the process that the New York groups had developed over the past year. Groups founded by former members of New York Radical Women—in particular [[Redstockings]], founded out of the breakup of the NYRW in 1969, and [[New York Radical Feminists]]—promoted consciousness raising and distributed [[mimeograph]]ed sheets of suggesting topics for consciousness raising group meetings. New York Radical Feminists organized neighborhood-based c.r. groups in [[Manhattan]], [[Brooklyn]], and [[Queens]], involving as many as four hundred women in c.r. groups at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, small-group consciousness raising spread rapidly in cities and suburbs throughout the [[United States]]. By 1971, the [[Chicago Women's Liberation Union]], which had already organized several consciousness raising groups in Chicago, described small consciousness raising groups as "the backbone of the Women's Liberation Movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to start your own consciousness-raising group|url=http://www.cwluherstory.com/CWLUArchive/crcwlu.html|website=Cwluherstory.com|publisher=The Chicago Women's Liberation Institution|accessdate=18 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040212200503/http://www.cwluherstory.com/CWLUArchive/crcwlu.html|archivedate=12 February 2004|format=Leaflet|date=1971|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Brownmiller, a member of the West Village{{efn|A consciousness raising group organized by the New York Radical Feminists.}} would later write that small-group consciousness raising "was the movement's most successful form of [[female bonding]], and the source of most of its creative thinking. Some of the small groups stayed together for more than a decade".&lt;ref&gt;Brownmiller, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

"In 1973, probably the height of CR, 100,000 women in the United States belonged to CR groups."&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Living in the Lap of the Goddess'', ''op. cit.'', p. 43 &amp; n. 8 (p. 43 n. 8 citing Shreve, Anita, ''Women Together, Women Alone'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 5–6 &amp; 9–14).&lt;/ref&gt;

Early mid-century [[feminism|feminists]] argued that women were isolated from each other, and as a result many problems in women's lives were misunderstood as "personal," or as the results of conflicts between the personalities of individual men and women, rather than systematic forms of oppression. Raising consciousness meant helping oneself and helping others to become [[politically conscious]].  Consciousness raising groups aimed to get a better understanding of women's oppression by bringing women together to discuss and analyze their lives, without interference from the presence of men.{{citation needed | date = February 2015}}

While explaining the theory behind consciousness raising in a 1973 talk, Kathie Sarachild remarked that "From the beginning of consciousness-raising ... there has been no one method of raising consciousness. What really counts in consciousness-raising are not methods, but results. The only 'methods' of consciousness raising are essentially principles. They are the basic radical political principles of going to the original sources, both historic and personal, going to people—women themselves, and going to experience for theory and strategy".&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist Revolution'', p. 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; However, most consciousness raising groups did follow a similar pattern for meeting and discussion. Meetings would usually be held about once a week, with a small group of women, often in the living room of one of the members. Meetings were women-only, and usually involved going around the room for each woman to talk about a predetermined subject—for example, "When you think about having a child, would you rather have a boy or a girl?"{{citation needed | date = February 2015}}—speaking from her own experience, with no formal leader for the discussion and few rules for directing or limiting discussion. (Some c.r. groups did implement rules designed to give every woman a chance to speak, to prevent interruptions, etc.) Speaking from personal experience was used as a basis for further discussion and analysis based on the first-hand knowledge that was shared.{{citation needed | date = February 2015}}

Some feminist advocates of consciousness raising argued that the process allowed women to analyze the conditions of their own lives, and to discover ways in which what had seemed like isolated, individual problems (such as needing an [[abortion]], surviving [[rape]], conflicts between husbands and wives over housework, etc.) actually reflected common conditions faced by all women.{{citation needed | date = February 2015}} As Sarachild wrote in 1969, "We assume that our feelings are telling us something from which we can learn... that our feelings mean something worth analyzing... that our feelings are saying something ''political'', something reflecting fear that something bad will happen to us or hope, desire, knowledge that something good will happen to us. ... In our groups, let's share our feelings and pool them. Let's let ourselves go and see where our feelings lead us. Our feelings will lead us to ideas and then to actions".&lt;ref&gt;''Feminist Revolution'', Appendix, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen Willis]] wrote in 1984 that consciousness raising has often been "misunderstood and disparaged as a form of therapy", but that it was, in fact, in its time and context, "the primary method of understanding women's condition" and constituted "the movement's most successful organizing tool." At the same time, she saw the lack of theory and emphasis on personal experience as concealing "prior political and philosophical assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;Willis, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some in the feminist movement criticised consciousness raising groups as "trivial" and [[apolitical]].&lt;ref&gt;Eller, Cynthia, ''Living in the Lap of the Goddess: The Feminist Spirituality Movement in America'' (Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, 1995 ({{ISBN|0-8070-6507-2}})), p. 188 &amp; n. 3 (author, with doctorate in religion from Univ. of Southern Calif., taught at Yale Divinity School &amp; Fairleigh Dickinson Univ.) (p. 188 n. 3 citing Shreve, Anita, ''Women Together, Women Alone: The Legacy of the Consciousness-Raising Movement'' (N.Y.: Fawcett Columbine, 1989), pp. 10–11).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poetry ===
Historically, Poetry has been utilized as a consciousness-raising tactic by consciousness-raising groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59138260|title=The art of protest : culture and activism from the civil rights movement to the streets of Seattle|last=Vernon)|first=Reed, T. V. (Thomas|date=2005|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0816637709|location=Minneapolis|oclc=59138260}}&lt;/ref&gt;Activist and writer [[Audre Lorde]] was noted to have been one of many scholars who wrote of poetry as a means of communication for women of color activist and resistance groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/773898749|title=Sister outsider : essays and speeches|last=Audre.|first=Lorde,|date=2007|publisher=Crossing Press|isbn=9780307809049|oclc=773898749}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This focus has also been studied by other feminist scholars as a new approach to women's literary writing experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castelao-Gómez|first=Isabel|date=February 2016|title=Looking back at Feminism and Poetry: An interview with Jan Montefiore|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F1350506815607838|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=93–105|doi=10.1177/1350506815607838|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;and the usage of critical consciousness through the creation of art as a liberatory praxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Yu|first=Nilan|title=Consciousness-raising and critical practice|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315107851-1|work=Consciousness-Raising|pages=1–13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315107851|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art as a liberatory praxis has also been explored through a radical queer lens through a number of publications and journals such as ''Sinister Wisdom''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sinisterwisdom.org|title=Journal {{!}} Sinister Wisdom|website=www.sinisterwisdom.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Conditions''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/post/conditions-five|title=Conditions: Five|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, online publications with an emphasis on lesbian writing.

===LGBT rights===
In the 1960s, consciousness-raising caught on with [[gay liberation]] activists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gayleft1970s.org/intro.asp|title=Gay Left: An Overview by Jeffrey Weeks|author=Jeffrey Weeks|publisher=Gay Left|format=Journal|quote=We said we could 'best explore our sexual attitudes most truthfully in an all-male group', and in many ways we did indeed operate as an awareness or conscious raising group as well as an editorial collective.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who formed the first "coming-out groups" which helped participants [[coming out|come out]] of the [[closeted|closet]] among welcoming, tolerant individuals and share personal stories about coming out. The idea of coming out as a tool of consciousness-raising had been preceded by even earlier opinions from German theorists such as [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Iwan Bloch]] and [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], all of whom saw self-disclosure as a means of self-emancipation, the raising of consciousness among fellow un-closeted individuals and a means of raising awareness in the wider society.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Atheism===
In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', anti-religion activist [[Richard Dawkins]] uses the term "consciousness raising" for several other things, explicitly describing these as analogous to the feminist case.&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; These include replacing references to children as Catholic, Muslim, etc. with references to children of the adults who are members of these religions (which he compares to our using non-sexist terminology) and Darwin as "raising our consciousness" in biology to the possibility of explaining complexity naturalistically and, in principle, raising our consciousness to the possibility of doing such things elsewhere (especially in physics).&lt;ref name="preface"/&gt; Earlier in the book, he uses the term (without explicitly referring to feminism) to refer to making people aware that leaving their parents' faith is an option.&lt;ref name="preface"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2006 |isbn=0-618-68000-4 |oclc= | authorlink = Richard Dawkins |page=406}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Downloads/News/GodDelusion_extract_revised.pdf |title=on-line |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228072308/http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Downloads/News/GodDelusion_extract_revised.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-28 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(101&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conspiracy thriller''' (or '''paranoid thriller''') is a subgenre of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller fiction]]. The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that ultimately goes "all the way to the top."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=1613 | work=The New York Times | first=Manohla | last=Dargis | accessdate=2010-04-30 | title=We're Sorry | date=2005-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complexities of historical fact are recast as a [[morality play]] in which bad people cause bad events, and good people identify and defeat them. Conspiracies are often played out as "man-in-peril" (or "woman-in-peril")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070525/ENT/705250305/1042] {{deadlink|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; stories, or yield [[quest]] narratives similar to those found in [[whodunnit]]s and [[detective fiction|detective stories]]. 

A common theme in such works is that characters uncovering the conspiracy encounter difficulty ascertaining the truth amid the deceptions: rumors, lies, [[propaganda]], and counter-propaganda build upon one another until what is conspiracy and what is coincidence become entangled. Many conspiracy fiction works also include the theme of [[secret history]].

==Literature==
[[John Buchan]]'s 1915 novel ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' weaves elements of conspiracy and man-on-the-run archetypes. [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s 1924 short story "[[Nightmare Town (short story)|Nightmare Town]]" is conspiracy fiction on a small scale, depicting an Arizona town that exists as part of an insurance-fraud scheme, and a detective slowly uncovering the truth. [[Graham Greene]]'s 1943 novel ''[[Ministry of Fear]]'' (brought to the big screen by [[Fritz Lang]] in 1944) combines all the ingredients of paranoia and conspiracy familiar to aficionados of the 1970s thrillers, with additional urgency and depth added by its wartime backdrop. Greene himself credited [[Michael Innes]] as the inspiration for his "entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catswhiskers.fsnet.co.uk/reviews.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212004028/http://www.catswhiskers.fsnet.co.uk/reviews.html |archivedate=2006-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conspiracy fiction in the US reached its zenith in the 1960s and 1970s in the wake of a number of high-profile scandals and controversies, most notably the [[Vietnam War]], the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert Kennedy]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], as well as the [[Watergate scandal]] and the subsequent resignation of [[Richard Nixon]] from the presidency. Several fictional works explored the clandestine machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life. American novelist [[Richard Condon]] wrote a number of conspiracy thrillers, including the seminal ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1959), and ''[[Winter Kills]]'', which was made into a film by [[William Richert]] in 1979. ''[[The Illuminatus Trilogy|Illuminatus!]]'' (1969–1971), a trilogy by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], is regarded by many as the definitive work of 20th-century conspiracy fiction. Set in the late '60s, it is a psychedelic tale which fuses mystery, science fiction, horror, and comedy in its exhibition (and mourning, and mocking) of one of the more paranoid periods of recent history. [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' (1966) includes a secretive conflict between cartels dating back to the Middle Ages. ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' also draws heavily on conspiracy theory in describing the motives and operations of the [[Phoebus cartel]] as well as the development of [[ballistic missiles]] during [[World War II]]. ''[[Inherent Vice]]'' also involves an intentionally ambiguous conspiracy involving a group known as the Golden Fang. 

John Macgregor's 1986 novel ''[[Propinquity (novel)|Propinquity]]'' describes an attempt by a modern couple to revive the frozen body of a gnostic medieval Queen, buried deep under Westminster Abbey. Their attempt to expose the feminine aspect of Christianity's origins results in fierce Church opposition and, eventually, an international manhunt. [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[Foucault's Pendulum (book)|Foucault's Pendulum]]'' (1988) features a story in which the staff of a publishing firm, intending to create a series of popular occult books, invent their own occult conspiracy, over which they lose control as it begins to supplant the truth. The popular 2003 [[novel]] ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]] draws on conspiracy theories involving the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Opus Dei]] and the [[Priory of Sion]]. Other contemporary authors who have used elements of conspiracy theory in their work include [[Margaret Atwood]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Don DeLillo]], [[James Ellroy]], [[Joseph Heller]], [[Robert Ludlum]], [[David Morrell]] and [[James Clancy Phelan]].

One of the first science fiction novels to deal with a full-blown conspiracy theory was [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s ''[[Dreadful Sanctuary]]'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/damned.html |title=SF Books of the Damned |website=Ansible.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deals with a number of sabotaged space missions and the apparent discovery that Earth is being quarantined by aliens from other planets of the [[Solar System]]. However, as the novel progresses it emerges that this view is a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] delusion perpetuated by a small but powerful [[secret society]]. [[Philip K. Dick]] wrote a large number of short stories where vast conspiracies were employed (usually by an oppressive government or other hostile powers) to keep common people under control or enforce a given agenda. Other popular science fiction writers whose work features conspiracy theories include [[William Ford Gibson|William Gibson]], [[John Twelve Hawks]], and [[Neal Stephenson]].

'''Crime in Haiti''' is investigated by the [[Haitian police]].

== Crime by type ==

=== Murders in Haiti ===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate|List of cities by murder rate|Estimated number of guns per capita by country}}

Reliable crime statistics for Haiti is difficult to come by. A comparative analysis of figures from various police/security entities operating throughout Haiti indicates that incidents of crimes tend to be inaccurately or under-reported.&lt;ref name=Haiti2014&gt;[https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=15745 "Haiti 2014 Crime and Safety Report", Overseas Security Advisory Council, US State Department, 28 May 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, the United Nations office on Drugs and Crime [[UNODC]] documented 1,033 murders, for a murder rate of 10.2 per 100,000 people, in 2012, and as few as 486 (5.1 per 100,000 people) in 2007.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 22 months after the ouster of [[Jean Bertrand Aristide|President Aristide]] in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au-Prince reached an all time high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents.&lt;ref name="cepr.net"&gt;[http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/relief-and-reconstruction-watch/kolbe-political-and-social-marginalization-behind-increases-in-crime "Kolbe: Political and Social Marginalization Behind Increases in Crime", Haiti: Relief and Reconstruction Watch, [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], 22 March 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an independent study tracking a large number of households in [[List of cities in Haiti|urban areas of Haiti]] recorded 11 murders among 15690 tracked residents during a 7-month period from August 2011 to February 2012.&lt;ref name="igarape.org.br"&gt;[http://igarape.org.br/wp-content/themes/igarape_v2/pdf/Strategic_Note_1.pdf  "Haiti’s Urban Crime Wave? Results from Monthly Household Surveys August 2011 - February 2012", Rio de Janeiro: Instituto Igarape. Kolbe, Athena R &amp; Muggah, Robert (2012), p.3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary results of the assessment found: ''The number of reported homicides across all urban settings increased considerably between November 2011 and February 2012. Half of the reported murders occurred during armed robbery or attempted armed robbery. While Port-au-Prince's overall homicide is low in comparison to other Caribbean cities, this nevertheless represents a rate of 60.9 per 100,000, one of the highest recorded rates since 2004'';&lt;ref name="Haiti Urban Crime Wave"&gt;[http://igarape.org.br/wp-content/themes/igarape_v2/pdf/Strategic_Note_1.pdf  "Haiti’s Urban Crime Wave? Results from Monthly Household Surveys August 2011 - February 2012", Rio de Janeiro: Instituto Igarape. Kolbe, Athena R &amp; Muggah, Robert (2012), p.1.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
All but one of the murders occurred in Port-au-Prince. See {[[Crime in Haiti#Port-au-Prince|crime in Port-au-Prince]]}

=== Sexual violence ===
{{Further|Sexual violence in Haiti}}

Sexual violence in Haiti is a common phenomenon. Being raped is considered shameful in Haitian society, and victims may find themselves abandoned by loved ones or with reduced marriageability.  Until 2005, rape was not legally considered a serious crime and a rapist could avoid jail by marrying his victim.  Reporting a rape to police in Haiti is a difficult and convoluted process, a factor that contributes to underreporting and difficulty in obtaining accurate statistics about [[sexual violence]]. Few rapists face any punishment.

A [[UN Security Council]] study in 2006 reported 35,000 [[sexual assault]]s against women and girls between 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref name="IRIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/94118/FILM-Haiti-s-Rape-Survivors |title=Haiti's Rape Survivors |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2011-11-02 |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The UN reported in 2006 that half of the women living in the capital city [[Port au Prince|Port au Prince's]] slums had been raped.&lt;ref name="McVeigh"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracy McVeigh|url=http://www.global-sisterhood-network.org/content/view/2279/76/ |title=Haiti: Government inertia towards poverty-stricken young girls &amp; women raped by criminal gangs |publisher=global-sisterhood-network.org |date=2009-03-08 |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  United Nations peacekeepers stationed in Haiti since 2004 have drawn widespread resentment after reports emerged of the soldiers raping Haitian civilians.

The [[2010 Haitian earthquake]] caused over a million Haitians to move to [[refugee camps]] where conditions are dangerous and poor.&lt;ref name=CNNTorgan2012&gt;{{cite news

=== Illegal drug trade ===
{{Further|Illegal drug trade in Haiti}}

The illegal drug trade in Haiti involves trans-shipment of [[cocaine]] and [[marijuana]] to the [[United States]]. It is a major shipment route. The island of [[Hispaniola]], which Haiti shares with the [[Dominican Republic]] places Haiti in an ideal location for drug smuggling between [[Colombia]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. Because Puerto Rico is a [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth of the United States]], shipments are generally not subject to further U.S. Customs inspection after reaching the territory. Cocaine is also often smuggled directly to [[Miami]] in freighters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/haiti/drugs.htm Haiti: Drug Trafficking Crossroads]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. government agencies estimate that 83 metric tons or about eight percent of the cocaine entering the United States in 2006 transited either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Institute of Peace]], June 2007, [http://www.usip.org/resources/haitis-drug-problem Haiti's Drug Problem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805080704/http://www.usip.org/resources/haitis-drug-problem# |date=August 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s, leading members of the [[Haitian military]], intelligence and police were involved in the illegal drug trade in Haiti, assisting Colombian drug traffickers smuggling drugs into the United States.&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;Whitney, Kathleen Marie (1996), "Sin, Fraph, and the CIA: U.S. Covert Action in Haiti", ''Southwestern Journal of Law and Trade in the Americas'', Vol. 3, Issue 2 (1996), pp. 303-332&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kidnapping, robbery ===
Crimes such as kidnappings, death threats, murders, armed robberies, home break-ins and car-jacking are not uncommon in Haiti. In recent years, the security situation has changed with a considerable decrease in the incidence of kidnapping of U.S. citizens, but a rise in armed robberies.  The incidence of kidnapping in Haiti has diminished from its peak in 2006 when 60 U.S. citizens were reported kidnapped to one kidnapping in 2014.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Since May 2014, there have been incidents involving travelers arriving in Port-au-Prince who are attacked and robbed after driving away from the airport. The US Embassy is aware of cases involving 64 U.S. citizens, resulting in three fatalities and several injuries. All cases have involved armed robbers by thieves on motorcycles pulling alongside vehicles in congested traffic. U.S. citizens of [[Haitian Americans|Haitian]] descent have accounted for almost all of the victims. Police authorities believe criminals may target travelers arriving on flights from the United States based on advance information gained from local contacts.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

== By location ==

=== Port-au-Prince ===
[[File:US Navy 100316-N-5961C-020 An aerial view of Port-au-Prince, Haiti shows the proximity of homes, many damaged in a major earthquake and subsequent aftershocks.jpg|thumb|400px|A dense slum in [[Port-au-Prince]].]]

A 2012 independent study found that the murder rate in the capital Port-au-Prince was 60.9 murders per 100,000 residents in February 2012.&lt;ref name="igarape.org.br"/&gt; In the 22 months after the end of the President Aristide era in 2004, the murder rate for Port-au-Prince reached a high of 219 murders per 100,000 residents per year.&lt;ref name="cepr.net"/&gt;

High-crime zones in the [[Port-au-Prince]] area include [[Croix-des-Bouquets]], [[Cite-Soleil]], [[Carrefour, Haiti|Carrefour]], [[Bel Air, Haiti|Bel Air]], Martissant, the port road (Boulevard La Saline), urban route Nationale#1, the airport road (Boulevard Toussaint L'Ouverture) and its adjoining connectors to the New ("American") Road via Route Nationale#1. This latter area in particular has been the scene of numerous robberies, carjackings, and murders.&lt;ref name=us&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/haiti.html "Haiti: Country-Specific Information". [[U.S. Department of State]] (December 4, 2014). Accessed April 12, 2015.]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{PD-notice}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bel Air, Haiti|Bel Air neighbourhood of Port-au-Prince]], the murder rate reached 50 murders per 100,000 residents at the end of 2011, up from 19 murders per 100,000 residents in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://igarape.org.br/wp-content/themes/igarape_v2/pdf/Strategic_Note_1.pdf  "Haiti’s Urban Crime Wave? Results from Monthly Household Surveys August 2011 - February 2012", Rio de Janeiro: Instituto Igarape. Kolbe, Athena R &amp; Muggah, Robert (2012), p.4.]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime dynamics ==
While the Haitian National Police (HNP) and the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) personnel patrol many areas, travel within Port-au-Prince can be particularly challenging and certain areas of the city have more crime.

Criminal perpetrators often operate in groups of three to four individuals, and may occasionally be confrontational and gratuitously violent.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; Criminals sometimes will seriously injure or kill those who resist their attempts to commit crime. In robberies or home invasions, it is not uncommon for the assailants to beat or shoot the victim in order to limit the victim's ability to resist.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

=== Carnival ===
Holiday periods, especially Christmas and [[Carnival]], often bring a significant increase in criminal activity. [[Haitian Carnival|Haiti's Carnival season]] is marked by street celebrations in the days leading up to [[Ash Wednesday]]. In recent years, Carnival has been accompanied by civil disturbances, altercations and severe traffic disruptions.&lt;ref name=us/&gt; People attending Carnival events or simply caught in the resulting celebrations have been injured and killed.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

Roving musical bands called "[[rara|rah-rah]]s" operate during the period from New Year's Day through Carnival. The potential for injury and the destruction of property during rah-rahs is high. A [[mob mentality]] can develop unexpectedly leaving people and cars engulfed and at risk. During Carnival, rah-rahs continuously form without warning; some rah-rahs have identified themselves with political entities, lending further potential for violence.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

=== Haitian police ===
While the size of the Haitian National Police (HNP) is increasing and its capabilities are improving, it is still understaffed and,  under-equipped.  As a result, it is unable to respond to all calls for assistance. There are allegations of police complicity in criminal activity. The response and enforcement capabilities of the HNP and the weakness of the judiciary often frustrate victims of crime in Haiti.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

'''Minister of Development''' ({{lang-he|שר הפיתוח}}, ''Sar HaPituah'') was a portfolio in the [[cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] between 1953 and 1974. The ministry was responsible for government-owned mineral extraction companies and the country's geology institute. The department also set up both the quarry rehabilitation fund and the [[Dead Sea Works]].

The post was scrapped in 1974, and succeeded three years later by the [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources|Energy and Infrastructure portfolio]]. Since 2005 there has also been a [[Ministry for the Development of the Negev and Galilee|Minister for the Development of the Negev and Galilee]].

'''Earthscope''' is an [[earth science]] program using geological and geophysical techniques to explore the structure and evolution of the [[North America]]n continent and to understand the processes controlling earthquakes and [[volcanoes]]. The project has three components: [[USARRAY]], the [[Plate Boundary Observatory]], and the [[San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth]].

The project is funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF), and the data produced is publicly accessible in real-time. Organizations associated with the project include [[UNAVCO]], the [[Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology]] (IRIS), [[Stanford University]], the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) and [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). Several international organizations also contribute to the initiative.

== Observatories ==
There are three EarthScope observatories, these include the [[San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth]] (SAFOD), the [[Plate Boundary Observatory PBO|Plate Boundary Observatory]] (PBO), and the [[USARRAY|Seismic and Magnetotelluric Observatory]] (USArray). These observatories consist of [[boreholes]] into an [[active fault]] zone, [[global positioning system]] (GPS) receivers, [[tiltmeter]]s, long-baseline laser [[strainmeter]]s, borehole strainmeters, permanent and portable [[seismographs]], and [[magnetotelluric]] stations. The various EarthScope components will provide integrated and highly accessible data on [[geochronology]] and [[thermochronology]], [[petrology]] and [[geochemistry]], structure and [[tectonics]], surficial processes and [[geomorphology]], [[geodynamic]] modeling, [[rock physics]], and [[hydrogeology]].

=== Seismic and Magnetotelluric Observatory (USArray) ===
{{main article|USARRAY}}
USArray, managed by IRIS, is a 15-year program to place a dense network of permanent and portable seismographs across the continental United States. These seismographs record the seismic waves released by earthquakes that occur around the world. [[Seismic waves]] are indicators of energy disbursement within the earth. By analyzing the records of earthquakes obtained from this dense grid of seismometers, scientists can learn about Earth structure and dynamics and the physical processes controlling earthquakes and volcanoes. The goal of USArray is primarily to gain a better understanding of the structure and evolution of the [[continental crust]], [[lithosphere]], and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] underneath North America.

The USArray is composed of four facilities: a Transportable Array, a Flexible Array, a Reference Network, and a Magnetotelluric Facility.

The Transportable Array is composed of 400 seismometers that are being deployed in a rolling grid across the United States over a period of 10 years. The stations are placed 70&amp;nbsp;km apart, and can map the upper 70&amp;nbsp;km of the Earth. After approximately two years, stations are moved east to the next site on the grid – unless adopted by an organization and made a permanent installation. Once the sweep across the United States is completed, over 2000 locations will have been occupied. The [[Array Network Facility]] is responsible for data collection from the Transportable Array stations.

The Flexible Array is composed of 291 broadband stations, 120 short period stations, and 1700 active source stations. The Flexible Array allows sites to be targeted in a more focused manner than the broad Transportable Array. Natural or artificially created seismic waves can be used to map structures in the Earth.

The Reference Network is composed of permanent seismic stations spaced about 300&amp;nbsp;km apart. The Reference Network provides a baseline for the Transportable Array and Flexible Array. EarthScope added and upgraded 39 stations to the already existing [[Advanced National Seismic System]], which is part of the Reference Network.

The Magnetotelluric Facility is composed of seven permanent and 20 portable sensors that record [[electromagnetic field]]s. It is the electromagnetic equivalent of the seismic arrays. The portable sensors are moved in a rolling grid similar to the Transportable Array grid, but are only in place about a month before they are moved to the next location. A magnetotelluric station consists of a [[magnetometer]], four [[electrodes]], and a data recording unit that are buried in shallow holes. The electrodes are oriented north-south and east-west and are saturated in a salt solution to improve conductivity with the ground.
[[Image:EarthScope-geosensor.jpg|thumb|left|An EarthScope GPS Geosensor, a component of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO)]]

=== Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) ===
{{main article|Plate Boundary Observatory PBO}}
The Plate Boundary Observatory PBO consists of a series of [[geodesy|geodetic]] instruments, Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and borehole strainmeters, that have been installed to help understand the boundary between the [[North American Plate]] and [[Pacific Plate]]. The PBO network includes several major observatory components: a network of 1100 permanent, continuously operating [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) stations many of which provide data at high-rate and in real-time, 78 borehole [[seismometers]], 74 borehole strainmeters, 26 shallow borehole tiltmeters, and six long baseline laser strainmeters. These instruments are complemented by InSAR ([[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]]) and LiDAR ([[light detection and ranging]]) imagery and [[geochronology]] acquired as part of the GeoEarthScope initiative. PBO also includes comprehensive data products, data management and education and outreach efforts. These permanent networks are supplemented by a pool of portable [[GPS]] receivers that can be deployed for temporary networks to researchers, to measure the crustal motion at a specific target or in response to a geologic event. The Plate Boundary Observatory portion of EarthScope is operated by [[UNAVCO]], Inc. UNAVCO is a non-profit, university-governed consortium that facilitates research and education using [[geodesy]].
[[Image:San Andreas Fault SAFOD Project.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic representation of the SAFOD main borehole and pilot hole]]

=== San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) ===
{{main article|San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth}}
The San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) consists of a main borehole that cuts across the active [[San Andreas Fault]] at a depth of approximately 3&amp;nbsp;km and a pilot hole about 2&amp;nbsp;km southwest of San Andreas Fault. Data from the instruments installed in the holes, which consist of [[geophone]] sensors, data acquisition systems, and GPS clocks, as well as samples collected during drilling, will help to better understand the processes that control the behavior of the San Andreas Fault.

== Data Products ==
Data collected from the various observatories are used to create different types of data products. Each data product addresses a different scientific problem.

=== P-Wave Tomography ===
[[Tomography]] is a method of producing a three-dimensional image of the internal structures of a solid object (such as the human body or the earth) by the observation and recording of differences in the effects on the passage of energy waves impinging on those structures. The waves of energy are P-waves generated by earthquakes and are recording the wave velocities. The high quality data that is being collected by the permanent seismic stations of USArray and the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) will allow the creation of high resolution seismic imaging of the Earth’s interior below the United States. Seismic tomography helps constrain mantle velocity structure and aids in the understanding of chemical and geodynamic processes that are at work. With the use of the data collected by USArray and global travel-time data, a global tomography model of P-wave velocity heterogeneity in the mantle can be created. The range and resolution of this technique will allow investigation into the suite of problems that are of concern in the North American mantle lithosphere, including the nature of the major tectonic features. This method gives evidence for differences in thickness and the velocity anomaly of the [[mantle lithosphere]] between the stable center of the continent and the more active western North America. This data is vital for the understanding of local lithosphere evolution, and when combined with additional global data, will allow the mantle to be imaged beyond the current extent of USArray.

=== Receiver Reference Models ===
EarthScope Automated Receiver Survey (EARS), has created a prototype of a system that will be used to address several key elements of the production of EarthScope products. One of the prototype systems is the receiver reference model. It will provide crustal thickness and average crustal Vp/Vs ratios beneath USArray transportable array stations.
[[Image:Seismogram.gif|thumb|P-waves and S-waves from a seismograph]]

=== Ambient Seismic Noise ===
The main function of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) and USArray, is to provide high quality data for earthquake monitoring, source studies and Earth structure research. The utility of seismic data is greatly increased when noise levels, unwanted vibrations, are reduced; however broadband seismograms will always contain a certain level of noise. The dominant sources of noise are either from the instrumentation itself or from ambient Earth vibrations. Normally, seismometer self noise will be well below the seismic noise level, and every station will have a characteristic noise pattern that can be calculated or observed. Sources of [[seismic noise]] within the Earth are caused by any of the following: the actions of human beings at or near the surface of the Earth, objects moved by wind with the movement being transferred to the ground, running water (river flow), surf, volcanic activity, or long period tilt due to thermal instabilities from poor station design.

A new approach to seismic noise studies will be introduced with the EarthScope project, in that there are no attempts to screen the continuous waveforms to eliminate body and [[surface waves]] from the naturally occurring earthquakes. Earthquake signals are not generally included in the processing of noise data, because they are generally low probability occurrences, even at low power levels. The two objectives behind the collection of the seismic noise data are to provide and document a standard method to calculate ambient seismic background noise, and to characterize the variation of ambient background seismic noise levels across the United States as a function of [[geography]], season, and time of day. The new statistical approach will provide the ability to compute probability density functions (PDFs) to evaluate the full range of noise at a given seismic station, allowing the estimation of noise levels over a broad range of frequencies from 0.01–16&amp;nbsp;Hz (100-0.0625s period). With the use of this new method it will be much easier to compare seismic noise characteristics between different networks in different regions.

=== Earthquake Ground Motion Animations ===
Seismometers of USArray transportable array record the passage of numerous seismic waves through a given point near the Earth’s surface, and classically these seismograms are analyzed to deduce properties of the Earth’s structure and the seismic source. Given a spatially dense set of seismic recordings, these signals can also be used to visualize the actual continuous seismic waves, providing new insights and interpretation techniques into complex wave propagation effects. Using signals recorded by the array of seismometers, the EarthScope project will be able to animate seismic waves as they sweep across the USArray transportable array for selected larger earthquakes. This will be able to illustrate the regional and teleseismic wave propagation phenomena. The seismic data collected from both permanent and transportable seismic stations will be used to provide these computer generated animations.

=== Regional Moment Tensors ===
The seismic moment tensor is one of the fundamental parameters of earthquakes that can be determined from seismic observations. It is directly related to earthquake fault orientation and rupture direction. The [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]], Mw derived from the moment tensor magnitude, is the most reliable quantity for comparing and measuring the size of an earthquake with other earthquake magnitudes. Moment tensors are used in a wide range of seismological research fields, such as earthquake statistics, earthquake scaling relationships, and stress inversion. The creation of regional moment tensor solutions, with the appropriate software, for moderate-to-large earthquakes in the U.S. will be from USArray transportable array and Advance National Seismic System broadband seismic stations. Results are obtained in the time and the frequency domain. Waveform fit and amplitude-phase match figures are provided to allow users to evaluate moment tensor quality.

=== Geodetic Monitoring of the Western US and Hawaii ===
Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment and techniques provide a unique opportunity for earth scientists to study regional and local tectonic plate motions and conduct natural hazards monitoring. Cleaned network solutions from several GPS arrays have merged into regional clusters in conjunction with the EarthScope project. The arrays include the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array, EarthScope's Plate Boundary Observatory, the Western Canadian Deformation Array, and networks run by the US Geological Survey. The daily GPS measurements from ~1500 stations along the Pacific/North American [[plate boundary]] provide millimeter-scale accuracy and can be used monitor the displacements of the earths crust. With the use of data modeling software and the recorded GPS data, the opportunity to quantify crustal deformation caused by [[plate tectonics]], earthquakes, [[landslides]] and volcanic eruptions will be possible.

=== Time-dependent Strain ===
The goal is to provide models of time-dependent strain associated with a number of recent earthquakes and other geologic events as constrained by GPS data. With the use of [[InSAR]] (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), a remote-sensing technique, and PBO (Plate Boundary Observatory), a fixed array of GPS receivers and strainmeters, the EarthScope project will provide spatially continuous strain measurements over wide geographic areas with decimeter to centimeter resolution.

=== Global Strain Rate Map ===
The Global Strain Rate Map (GSRM) is a project of the International Lithosphere Program whose mission is to determine a globally self-consistent strain rate and velocity field model, consistent with geodetic and geologic field observations collected by GPS, seismometers, and strainmeters. GSRM is a digital model of the global velocity gradient tensor field associated with the accommodation of present-day crustal motions. The overall mission also includes: (1) contributions of global, regional, and local models by individual researchers; (2) archive existing data sets of geologic, geodetic, and seismic information that can contribute toward a greater understanding of strain phenomena; and (3) archive existing methods for modeling strain rates and strain transients. A completed global strain rate map will provide a large amount of information which will contribute to the understanding of continental dynamics and for the quantification of seismic hazards.

== Science ==
There are seven topics that EarthScope will address with the use of the observatories.

=== Convergent Margin Processes ===
[[File:Active Margin.svg|thumb|Oceanic-Continental convergent margin]]
Convergent margins, also known as [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], are active regions of deformation between two or more [[tectonic plates]] colliding with one another. Convergent margins create areas of [[tectonic uplift]], such as [[mountain ranges]] or volcanoes. EarthScope is focusing on the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate in the western United States. EarthScope will provide GPS geodetic data, seismic images, detailed seismicity, magnetotelluric data, [[InSAR]], stress field maps, [[digital elevation model]]s, baseline geology, and [[paleoseismology]] for a better understanding of convergent margin processes.

A few questions hoping to be answered by EarthScope include:
* What controls the lithospheric architecture?
* What controls the locus of volcanism?
* How do convergent margin processes contribute to growth of the continent through time?

=== Crustal Strain and Deformation ===
Crustal [[strain (materials science)|strain]] and [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] is the change in shape and volume of continental and oceanic crust caused by stress applied to rock through tectonic forces. An array of variables including composition, temperature, pressure, etc., determines how the crust will deform.

A few questions hoping to be answered by EarthScope include:
* How do crust and mantle [[rheology]] vary with rock type and with depth?
* How does lithospheric rheology change in the vicinity of a fault zone?
* What is the distribution of stress in the lithosphere?

=== Continental Deformation ===
Continental deformation is driven by plate interactions through active tectonic processes such as continental transform systems with extensional, strike-slip, and contractional regimes. EarthScope will provide velocity field data, portable and continuous GPS data, fault-zone drilling and sampling, reflection seismology, modern seismicity, pre-[[Holocene]] seismicity, and magnetotelluric and potential field data for a better understanding of continental deformation.

A few questions hoping to be answered by EarthScope include:
* What are the fundamental controls on deformation of the continent?
* What is the strength profile(s) of the lithosphere?
* What defines tectonic regimes within the continent?

=== Continent Structure and Evolution ===
Earth's continents are compositionally distinct from the oceanic crust. The continents record four billion years of geologic history, while the oceanic crust gets recycled about every 180&amp;nbsp;million years. Because of the age of continental crusts, the ancient structural evolution of the continents can be studied. Data from EarthScope will be used to find the mean seismic structure of the continental crust, associated mantle, and crust-mantle transition. Variability in that structure will also be studied. EarthScope will attempt to define continental lithosphere formation and continent structure and to identify the relationship between continental structure and deformation.

A few questions hoping to be answered by EarthScope include:
* How does magmatism modify, enlarge, and deform continental lithosphere?
* How are the crust and lithospheric mantle related?
* What is the role of extension, [[orogenic]] collapse, and [[rifting]] in constructing the continents?

=== Faults and Earthquake Processes ===
EarthScope is acquiring 3D and 4D data that will give scientists a more detailed insight into faulting and earthquakes than ever before. This project is providing a much needed data upgrade from work done in previous years thanks to many technological advances. New data will enable an improved study and understanding of faults and earthquakes that will increase our knowledge of the complete earthquake process, allowing for the continued development of building predictive models. Detailed information on internal fault zone architecture, crust and upper mantle structure, strain rates, and transitions between fault systems and deformation types; as well as heat flow, electromagnetic/magnetotelluric, and seismic waveform data, will all be made available.

A few questions hoping to be answered by EarthScope include:
* How does strain accumulate and release at plate boundaries and within the North American plate?
* How do earthquakes start, rupture, and stop?
* What is the absolute strength of faults and the surrounding lithosphere?

=== Deep Earth Structure ===
Through the use of seismology, scientists will be able to collect and evaluate data from the deepest parts of our planet, from the continental lithosphere down to the core. The relationship between lithospheric and the upper mantle processes is something that is not completely known, including upper mantle processes below the United States and their effects on the continental lithosphere. There are many issues of interest, such as determining the source of forces originating in the upper mantle and their effects on the continental lithosphere. Seismic data will also give scientists more understanding and insight into the lower mantle and the Earth’s core, as well as activity at the [[core-mantle boundary]].

A few questions hoping to be answered by EarthScope include:
* How is evolution of the continents linked to processes in the upper mantle?
* What is the level of heterogeneity in the mid-mantle?
* What is the nature and heterogeneity of the lower mantle and core-mantle boundary?

=== Fluids and Magmas ===
EarthScope hopes to provide a better understanding of the physics of fluids and magmas in active volcanic systems in relation to the deep Earth and how the evolution of continental lithosphere is related to [[upper mantle]] processes. The basic idea of how the various melts are formed is known, but not the volumes and rates of [[magma]] production outside of [[Mid-ocean ridge basalts]]. EarthScope will provide seismic data and tomographic images of the mantle to better understand these processes.

A few questions hoping to be answered by EarthScope include:
* Over what temporal and spatial scales do earthquake deformation and volcanic eruptions couple?
* What controls eruption style?
* What are the predictive signs of imminent volcanic eruption? What are the structural, [[rheological]], and chemical controls on fluid flow in the crust?

== Education and Outreach ==
The Education and Outreach Program is designed to integrate EarthScope into both the classroom and the community. The program must reach out to scientific educators and students as well as industry professionals (engineers, land/resource managers, technical application/data users), partners of the project ([[UNAVCO]], IRIS, USGS, NASA, etc.), and the general public. To accomplish this, the EOP offers a wide array of educational workshops and seminars, directed at various audiences, to offer support on data interpretation and implementation of data products into the classroom. Their job is to make sure that everyone understands what EarthScope is, what it’s doing in the community, and how to use the data it is producing. By generating new research opportunities for students in the scientific community, the program also hopes to expand recruitment for future generations of earth scientists.

=== Mission ===
"To use EarthScope data, products, and results to create a measurable and lasting change on the way that Earth science is taught and perceived in the United States."

=== Goals ===
* Create a high-profile public identity for EarthScope that emphasizes the integrated nature of the scientific discoveries and the importance of EarthScope research initiatives.
* Establish a sense of ownership among scientific, professional, and educational communities and the public so that a diverse group of individuals and organizations can and will make contributions to EarthScope.
* Promote [[scientific literacy|science literacy]] and understanding of EarthScope among all audiences through informal education venues.
* Advance formal Earth science education by promoting inquiry-based classroom investigations that focus on understanding Earth and the interdisciplinary nature of EarthScope.
* Encourage use of EarthScope data, discoveries, and new technology in resolving challenging problems and improving our quality of life.

=== EarthScope In the Classroom ===
Education and outreach will be developing tools for educators and students across the United States to interpret and apply this information for solving a wide range of scientific issues within the earth sciences. The project tailors its products to the specified needs and requests of educators.

==== K-12 Education ====
One tool that has already been put into action is the EarthScope Education and Outreach Bulletin. The bulletin, targeted for grades 5-8, summarizes a volcanic or tectonic event documented by EarthScope and puts it into an easily interpretable format, complete with diagrams and 3D models. They follow specific content standards based on what a child should be learning at those grade levels. Another is the EarthScope Voyager, Jr. which allows students to explore and visualize the various types of data that are being collected. In this interactive map, the user can add various types of base maps, features, and plate velocities. Educators have access to real time GPS data of plate movement and influences through the UNAVCO website.

==== University Level ====
EarthScope promises to produce a large amount of geological and geophysical data that will open the door for numerous research opportunities in the scientific community. As the USArray Big Foot project moves across the country, universities are adopting seismic stations near their areas. These stations are then monitored and maintained by not only the professors, but their students as well. Scouting for future seismic station locations has created field work opportunities for students. The influx of data has already begun creating projects for undergraduate research, master’s thesis, and doctoral dissertations. A list of currently funded proposals can be found on the NSF website.

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Earthscope timelime.jpg|450px|right]]
Many applications for EarthScope data currently exist, as mentioned above, and many more will arise as more data becomes available. The EarthScope program is dedicated to determining the three dimensional structure of the North American continent. Future uses of the data that it produces might include [[hydrocarbon exploration]], [[aquifer]] boundary establishment, [[remote sensing]] technique development, and earthquake risk assessment. Due to the open and free-to-the-public data portals that EarthScope and its partners maintain, the applications are limited only by the creativity of those who wish to sort through the gigabytes of data. Also, because of its scale, the program will undoubtedly be the topic of casual conversation for many people outside of the geologic community. EarthScope chatter will be made by people in political, educational, social, and scientific arenas.

=== Geologic Legacy ===
The multidisciplinary character of EarthScope will create stronger network connections between geologists of all types and from around the country. Building an Earth model of this scale requires a complex community effort, and this model is likely to be the first EarthScope legacy. Researchers analyzing the data will leave us with a greater scientific understanding of [[geologic resources]] in the [[Great Basin]] and of the evolution of the [[plate boundary]] on the North American west coast. Another geologic legacy desired by the initiative, is to invigorate the Earth sciences community. Invigoration is self-perpetuating as evidenced by participation from thousands of organizations from around the world and from all levels of students and researchers. This leads to a significantly heightened awareness within the general public, including the next cohort of prospective Earth scientists. With further evolution of the EarthScope project, there may even be opportunities to create new observatories with greater capabilities, including extending the USArray over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Gulf of California]]. There is much promise for EarthScope tools and observatories, even after retirement, to be used by universities and professional [[geologists]]. These tools include the physical equipment, software invented to analyze the data, and other data and educational products initiated or inspired by EarthScope.

=== Political Legacy ===
The science produced by EarthScope and the researchers using its data products will guide lawmakers in environmental policy, hazard identification, and ultimately, federal funding of more large-scale projects like this one. Besides the three physical dimensions of North America’s structure, a fourth dimension of the continent is being described through [[geochronology]] using EarthScope data. Improving the understanding of our continent’s geologic history will allow us and future generations to more efficiently manage and utilize geologic resources and live with [[geologic hazards]]. [[Environmental policy]] laws have been the subject of some controversy since the European settlement of North America. Specifically, water and [[mineral rights]] issues have been the focus of dispute. Our representatives in Washington D.C. and the state capitals require guidance from authoritative science in drafting the soundest environmental laws for our country. The EarthScope research community is in a position to provide the most reliable course for our government to take concerning environmental policy.

Hazard identification with EarthScope is an application already in use. In fact, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has awarded the [[Arizona Geological Survey]] and its partner universities funding to adopt and maintain eight Transportable Array stations. The stations will be used to update Arizona’s earthquake risk assessment.

=== Social Legacy ===
For EarthScope to live up to its potential in the [[Earth sciences]], the connections between the research and the education and outreach communities must continue to be cultivated. Enhanced public outreach to museums, the [[National Park System]], and public schools will ensure that these forward-thinking connections are fostered. National media collaboration with high-profile outlets such as [[Discovery Channel]], [[Science Channel]], and [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] may secure a lasting legacy within the social consciousness of the world. Earth science has already been promoted as a vital modern discipline, especially in today’s “green” culture, to which EarthScope is contributing. The size of the EarthScope project augments the growing public awareness of the broad structure of the planet on which we live.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4871">'''Edward Gaylord Bourne, Ph. D.''' (June 24, 1860 &amp;ndash; February 24, 1908) was an [[United States|American historian]], born in [[Strykersville, New York]], and educated at [[Yale University|Yale]] graduating in 1883 with high honors. He taught at [[Adelbert College]], Cleveland from 1888 - 1895 when he became a Professor of History at Yale. Bourne is considered one of the founders of [[Latin American history]] as a field in the United States.  The publication of his ''Spain in America'' (1904), was "a major landmark in the development of the field," which "gave a lucid synthesis of the institutional life of Spanish America, ranging also through economic, social, and cultural developments...."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Latin American History: Development of Its Study and Teaching in the United States since 1898," in ''Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching, 1898-1965''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1967, vol. 1, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an assessment of Bourne's work, [[Charles Gibson (historian)|Charles Gibson]] and [[Benjamin Keen]] state that "He may justifiably be termed the first scientific historian of the United States to view the Spanish colonial process dispassionately and thereby to escape the conventional Anglo-Protestant attitudes of outraged or tolerant disparagement."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson and Benjamin Keen, "Trends of United States Studies in Latin American History," [[The American Historical Review]], LXII (July 1957), 857.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Bourne published many critical papers on historical subjects.  One of them, "[[wikisource:en:The American Historical Review/Volume 6/The Legend of Marcus Whitman|The Legend of Marcus Whitman]]," is considered to have settled the [[Marcus Whitman|Whitman question]], determining that there was no basis in fact for the widespread notion that Whitman "saved" Oregon to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=[[wikisource:en:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Whitman, Marcus|Whitman, Marcus]] | year=1911 | work=Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[[wikisource:en:The American Catholic Historical Researches/Volume 18/"The Legend of Marcus Whitman," Founded on Anti-Catholic Hatred|"The Legend of Marcus Whitman," Founded on Anti-Catholic Hatred]] | work=The American Catholic Historical Researches |volume=18 |year=1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicsentinel.org/Content/About-Us/About-Us/Article/History-of-the-Catholic-Sentinel/15/60/11769&lt;/ref&gt; His four-volume ''Spain in America'' is credited with "an unequivocally scholarly presentation, in laying a positive assessment of early Hispanic colonization before the [U.S.] American public."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson and Benjamin Keen, "Trends of United States Studies in Latin American History," American Historical Review, LXII (July 1957), 857.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was reissued in 1962, indicating its enduring importance to the field.&lt;ref&gt;''Spain in America, 1450-1580'' (1904) 4 vols. Reissued 1962. with a new introduction and supplementary bibliography''. New York: Barnes and Noble 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourne published:  
* ''The History of the Surplus Revenue of 1837'' (1885)
* ''Historical Introduction to the Philippine Islands'' (1903)
* ''Spain in America, 1450-1580'' (1904) 4 vols. Reissued 1962.
* ''Life of J. L. Motley'' (1905)
* ''Discovery, Conquest, and History of the Philippine Islands'' (1907)
  
Bourne edited:  
* ''Rocher's Spanish Colonial System'' (1904), and translated ''The Narrative of De Soto'' (1904) and ''The Voyage of Champlain'' (1905).

==Honors==
Bourne was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[textual criticism]], an '''exemplar''' is the text used to produce another text. In the study of the history of a text an especially important exemplar is that which precedes any split in the tradition of that text, that is, before significant textual variations occur in different versions--such an exemplar is called an [[Archetype (disambiguation)|archetype]].

*confirmation of Magna Carta by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] to [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in 1216, 1217, and 1225
*''Confirmatio Cartarum'' ([[Confirmation of Charters]]) 1253
*a multitude of subsequent corroborating statutes, from [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] to [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]
*the [[Petition of Right]], a parliamentary declaration in 1628 of the liberties of the people, assented to by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]
*more concessions made by King Charles I to his Parliament
*many laws, particularly the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], passed under [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]
*the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] assented to by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]]
*the [[Act of Settlement 1701]]

Blackstone's list was an 18th-century constitutional view, and the [[Union of the Crowns]] had occurred in 1603 between [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and the 1628 Petition of Right had already referred to the ''fundamental laws'' being violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-24.htm|title=1625-29: Charles I - the first crisis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=wisc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded usage==

The phrase ''Fundamental Laws of England'' has often been used by those opposing particular legislative, royal or religious initiatives.

For example, in 1641 the [[House of Commons of England]] protested that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was "... subverting the fundamental laws of England and Ireland....",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/protests.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2004-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407010049/http://personal.pitnet.net/primarysources/protests.html |archive-date=2004-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; part of a campaign ending in 1649 with the [[beheading]] of King Charles I.

Subsequently, the phrase was used by the [[Leveller]] Lieut. Col. [[John Lilburne]] (later to become a [[Quaker]]) accusing the [[House of Lords]] and House of Commons of tyranny in ''The Just Defence of John Lilburne, Against Such as charge him with Turbulency of Spirit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/defence2.html|title=The Just Defence of John Lilburne (Part 2)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219101110/http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/defence2.html|archive-date=2003-12-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilburne also wrote a 1646 book called ''The Legal Fundamental Liberties of the People of England, asserted, revived and vindicated''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/vindicated2.html|title=The Levellers (False so called) Vindicated|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040102172147/http://www.strecorsoc.org/docs/vindicated2.html|archive-date=2004-01-02|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1646, the [[General Court of Massachusetts]] referred to the Fundamental Laws of England in regard to the Magna Carta, while defending their representative and legislative autonomy in their address to the [[Long Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/sourcesconstitut00stev|title=Sources of the Constitution of the United States, considered in relation to colonial and English history|first=C. Ellis (Charles Ellis)|last=Stevens|date=3 August 1894|publisher=New York : Macmillan and co.|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1670 trial, [[William Penn]] called upon the phrase many times, including "... However, this I leave upon your Consciences, who are of the Jury (and my sole Judges) that if these Ancient Fundamental Laws, which relate to Liberty and Property, and (are not limited to particular Persuasions in Matters of Religion) must not be indispensably maintained and observed, Who can say he hath Right to the Coat upon his Back? ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/globalrights/religion/penn-trial.html |title=The Tryal of Wm.

In the 1774 pamphlet [[American Claim of Rights]], South Carolina's [[William Henry Drayton|Chief Justice William Drayton]] wrote 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That the Americans being descended from the same ancestors with the people of England, and owing fealty to the same [[The Crown|Crown]], are therefore equally with them, entitled to the common law of England formed by their common ancestors; and to all and singular the benefits, rights, liberties and claims specified in Magna Charta, in the petition of Rights, in the Bill of Rights, and in the Act of Settlement. They being no more than principally declaratory of the grounds of the fundamental laws of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.schistory.org/displays/RevWar/archives-online/Gibbes__v__1__p__011b.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2004-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040312142152/http://www.schistory.org/displays/RevWar/archives-online/Gibbes__v__1__p__011b.html |archive-date=2004-03-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other famous subscribers to the phrase include [[Edward Coke|Lord Coke]] (1522&amp;ndash;1634), [[Emerich de Vattel]] (1714&amp;ndash;1767), and [[Samuel Adams]] (1722&amp;ndash;1803).

==Unwritten history==

[[John Locke|Locke]]'s view in ''... Civil Government'' 1690 was "..., that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions; ...". This philosophy was in keeping with the view that the Fundamental Laws predated the Magna Carta in both [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[natural law]]. Influenced by Locke, the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]] stated: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

For those who believed that the Fundamental Laws of England predated the Magna Carta, there was debate about whether they arose from [[time immemorial]], were somehow immanent to society, from post-[[Roman law|Roman]] [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] times, or from various combinations of these and other origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/rpw_center/pdfs/PARKER.PDF|title=Constructing a Juridical Memory: The Antiquarian Response to the Union of Kingdoms|last=Parker|first=Brett|date=2002-08-04|website=vanderbilt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century and later==

In ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' (1953), an action over the legitimacy of the numeric [[Style of the British Sovereign]], asserting only the style [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II#Royal titles and styles|Elizabeth I for Elizabeth II]] would only carry legal authority in Scotland [[Lord President Cooper]] gave judicial recognition to the concept of a "fundamental law" of Scotland that merged with that of England into the law of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time of the [[Act of Union 1707]], a corpus of law which the supremacy of Parliament may not extend to altering as “the principle of unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle and has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law”. He raised as a hypothetical consideration the question of whether such fundamental laws could be judged by an English or Scottish [[court]] in the same manner as other countries consider constitutional cases. However, he left the matter open, saying "I reserve my opinion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case8.html Transcript]from Law Scot website {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421023411/http://www.lawscot.org.uk/whatis/case8.html |date=2004-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of [[parliamentary supremacy]] was upheld in the highest court by [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]] in 1969:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is often said that it would be unconstitutional for the United Kingdom Parliament to do certain things, meaning that the moral, political and other reasons against doing them are so strong that most people would regard it as highly improper if Parliament did these things. But that does not mean that it is beyond the power of Parliament to do such things. If Parliament chose to do any of them the courts would not hold the Act of Parliament invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke|vol=1|reporter=AC|opinion=645|pinpoint=723|court=UKPC|date=1969|url=http://iclr.co.uk/document/1961002667/casereport_71129/html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under this precedent, Parliament has the legal authority to do anything, even though its Acts might contradict common-law [[principles of natural justice]]. The classic rebuttal or at least qualification is expressed by [[Albert Venn Dicey]], whose 1885 text ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' argues that the [[democratic legitimacy|will of the electorate]] must ultimately prevail over any attempt at tyranny: it is "a political, not a legal fact" that fundamental principles of natural justice cannot be denied. This implies that in most scenarios principles of the Fundamental Laws can be upheld by [[statutory interpretation]] or as an alternative since 1998 by issuing a [[Declaration of incompatibility]].

Laws LJ in ''[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]]'' [2002] EWHC 195 (Admin) at [62] recognised what he called "constitutional statutes":

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the present state of its maturity the common law has come to recognise that there exist rights which should properly be classified as constitutional or fundamental: see for example such cases as Simms [2000] 2 AC 115 per Lord Hoffmann at 131, Pierson v Secretary of State [1998] AC 539, [R v] Leech [1994] QB 198, Derbyshire County Council v Times Newspapers Ltd. [1993] AC 534, and [R v] Witham [1998] QB 575. And from this a further insight follows. We should recognise a hierarchy of Acts of Parliament as it were: "ordinary" statutes and "constitutional" statutes. The two categories must be distinguished on a principled basis. In my opinion a constitutional statute is one which (a) conditions the legal relationship between citizen and State in some general, overarching manner, or (b) enlarges or diminishes the scope of what we would now regard as fundamental constitutional rights. (a) and (b) are of necessity closely related: it is difficult to think of an instance of (a) that is not also an instance of (b). The special status of constitutional statutes follows the special status of constitutional rights. Examples are the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Union, the Reform Acts which distributed and enlarged the franchise, the HRA, the Scotland Act 1998 and the Government of Wales Act 1998. The [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|ECA]] clearly belongs in this family. It incorporated the whole corpus of substantive Community rights and obligations, and gave overriding domestic effect to the judicial and administrative machinery of Community law. It may be there has never been a statute having such profound effects on so many dimensions of our daily lives. The ECA is, by force of the common law, a constitutional statute. (cf [[obiter dictum|obiter]] remarks by the House of Lords in ''Watkins v Home Office'' [2006] UKHL 17 at [62])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004 the [[Joint Committee]] (of the House of Commons and House of Lords) overseeing the drafting of the Civil Contingencies Bill published its first report in which, among other things, suggested:
*Amending the proposed clauses, operative in a State of Emergency, that would grant [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]], by Emergency Regulations, the power "to disapply or modify any [[Act of Parliament]]" on the grounds that such a clause is overly wide.
*An amendment to preclude changes to the following Acts, which, it suggested, formed "the fundamental parts of constitutional law" of the United Kingdom:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200203/jtselect/jtdcc/184/18407.htm#a44|title=Joint Committee on Draft Civil Contingencies Bill - First Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Lords/Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gifted art''' (or '''free art''') is any form or piece of art that is given freely, whether to a city, a group of people, a community or an individual. It refers to any [[art]] that is distributed at no direct cost. It is a form of [[conceptual art]]. It comes from a belief that art should be available for all people to enjoy, whether rich or poor, university graduate or junior high dropout. Since Gifted Art is an expressive form of art - an idea, it encompasses virtually all forms of art: [[movie]]s, [[literature]], [[music record]]ings, [[sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DF103AF935A25751C1A96F948260&lt;/ref&gt; [[painting]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/7730285.stm&lt;/ref&gt; [[graffiti]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/france24Public/en/archives/news/culture/20070512-swoon-street-art-moma-urban-new-york-paris-l-j-beaubourg.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital art]], [[street performance]]s, [[performance art]], [[sticker art]], [[comic]]s, coffeehouse poetry and [[Internet art|Internet]]-distributed art etc.

== Short History ==
Gifted Art has a long history in the arts. Many artists have been known to give art freely to each other, in an effort to pass along ideas, etc. [[Picasso]] and many of his contemporaries were fond of this.
[[Duchamp]] was one of the first modern day artists to Gift to the public with his piece, ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', for an art show in 1917. He gave the piece under the name of "R. Mutt," presumably to hide his identity as the artist. He actually had to pay $7 to have the piece exhibited in the show, and never intended on making any money from it. He gave it freely for all to see and to push forward the [[Dada]] movement.
In the 50's, [[Ray Johnson]] started doing [[Mail art]]. He spread the idea to many other artists&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegalleriesatmoore.org/publications/johnsoncp.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and it still occurs today. In 2002, a 6&amp;nbsp;ft X 53&amp;nbsp;ft mural by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] was installed in the Times Square Subway Station in New York City. It was gifted by the artist to all New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/36702/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, Gifted Art has primarily been embraced by graffiti and urban artists. Many graffiti artists consider the work they do to be art for the public. Banksy writes in his books that he believes art is more important and more enjoyable when it is out on the street where people can view it in their everyday lives than when it hangs in a museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Graded readers''' are "easy reading" books used to support the [[extensive reading]] approach to teaching [[English as a second or foreign language]], and other languages. While many graded readers are written for native speaker children, more often they are targeted at young adults and above, since children's books are already widely available and deal with topics not relevant to more mature language learners.

Graded readers can be adapted from literary classics, films, biographies, travel books, etc., or they can be original works written at a less demanding language level. Although they employ simplified language, graded readers do not necessarily lack narrative depth or avoid complex themes; often, they cover the same range of 'serious' themes as books written for native speaker audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Graded Reader?|url=http://erfoundation.org/wordpress/?page_id=136|publisher=Extensive Reading Foundation|accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graded readers are written with specific levels of grammatical complexity in mind and with vocabulary that is limited by frequency [[headword]] counts. For example, Level 1 in a series might be restricted to 500 headwords, Level 2 to 600 headwords, and Level 3 to 700 headwords. [[:simple:Wikipedia:Simple English Wikipedia|Simple English Wikipedia]] is designed along similar lines. Other factors taken into consideration when selecting titles to publish, or determining levels, might include, the number and range of characters; the complexity of the plot; the expected background of the target audience; compliance requirements for certain markets (regarding e.g., sex, dating, religion, gender roles and sexuality etc.), among other factors.  

Graded readers are not to be confused with [[Basal reader]]s, such as [[Dick and Jane]], which tend to target specific language features, and therefore are more like [[textbooks]] in nature.

'''Hans Reichenbach''' (September 26, 1891 – April 9, 1953) was a leading [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], educator, and proponent of [[Logical positivism|logical empiricism]]. He was influential in the areas of science, education, and of logical empiricism. He founded the ''Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie'' (Society for Empirical Philosophy) in Berlin in 1928, also known as the “[[Berlin Circle]]”. [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Richard von Mises]], [[David Hilbert]] and [[Kurt Grelling]] all became members of the Berlin Circle. He authored ''The Rise of Scientific Philosophy''. In 1930, Reichenbach and [[Rudolf Carnap]] became editors of the journal ''Erkenntnis'' (Knowledge). He also made lasting contributions to the study of empiricism based on a theory of probability; the logic and the philosophy of mathematics; space, time, and relativity theory; analysis of probabilistic reasoning; and quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;

==Life and work==
After completing secondary school in [[Hamburg]], Hans studied civil [[engineering]] at the [[Hochschule für Technik Stuttgart]], and [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy]] at various universities, including [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[University of Munich|Munich]]. Among his teachers were [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Max Planck]], [[Max Born]] and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]. Reichenbach was active in youth movements and student organizations, and published articles about the university reform, the freedom of research, and against anti-Semitic infiltrations in student organizations. His older brother [[Bernhard Reichenbach]] shared in this activism and went on to become a member of the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany]], representing this organisation on the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]]. He also worked with [[Alexander Schwab]] at this time.

Hans wrote the Platform of the [[Socialist Student Party Berlin]] which was published in 1918. The party had remained clandestine until the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919|November Revolution]] when it was formally founded with Hans as Chairman.

Reichenbach received a degree in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1915 and his [[Dr.phil.]] [[dissertation]] on the [[theory of probability]], titled ''Der Begriff der Wahrscheinlichkeit für die mathematische Darstellung der Wirklichkeit'' (''The Concept of Probability for the Mathematical Representation of Reality'') and supervised by [[Paul Hensel]] and [[Max Noether]], was published in 1916. Reichenbach served during [[World War I]] on the Russian front, in the German army radio troops. In 1917 he was removed from active duty, due to an illness, and returned in [[Berlin]]. While working as a physicist and engineer, Reichenbach attended [[Albert Einstein]]'s lectures on the [[theory of relativity]] in [[Berlin]] from 1917 to 1920.

In 1920 Reichenbach began teaching at the Technische Hochschule at [[Stuttgart]] as ''[[Privatdozent]]''. In the same year, he published his first book on the philosophical implications of the [[theory of relativity]], ''The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge'', which criticized the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] notion of synthetic ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. He subsequently published ''Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity'' (1924), ''From Copernicus to Einstein'' (1927) and ''The Philosophy of Space and Time'' (1928), the last stating the logical positivist view on the theory of relativity.

In 1926, with the help of Albert Einstein, Max Planck and [[Max von Laue]], Reichenbach became assistant professor in the physics department of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. He gained notice for his methods of teaching, as he was easily approached and his courses were open to discussion and debate. This was highly unusual at the time, although the practice is nowadays a common one.

In 1928, Reichenbach founded the so-called "[[Berlin Circle]]" ({{lang-de|Die Gesellschaft für empirische Philosophie}}; {{lang-en|Society for Empirical Philosophy}}). Among its members were [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Richard von Mises]], David Hilbert and [[Kurt Grelling]]. The [[Vienna Circle]] manifesto lists 30 of Reichenbach's publications in a bibliography of closely related authors. In 1930 he and [[Rudolf Carnap]] began editing the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]'' ("Knowledge").

When [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, Reichenbach was immediately dismissed from his appointment at the University of Berlin under the government's so called "Race Laws" due to his Jewish ancestry. Reichenbach himself did not practise Judaism, and his mother was a German Protestant, but he nevertheless suffered problems. He thereupon emigrated to [[Turkey]], where he headed the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Istanbul]]. He introduced [[interdisciplinary]] seminars and courses on scientific subjects, and in 1935 he published ''The Theory of Probability''.

In 1938, with the help of [[Charles W. Morris]], Reichenbach moved to the [[United States]] to take up a professorship at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in its [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|Philosophy Department]]. His work on the philosophical foundations of [[quantum mechanics]] was published in 1944, followed by ''Elements of Symbolic Logic'' in 1947, and ''The Rise of Scientific Philosophy'' (his most popular book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Printonly/Reichenbach.html www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1951.

Reichenbach helped establish UCLA as a leading philosophy department in the United States in the post-war period. [[Carl Hempel]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Wesley Salmon]] are perhaps his most prominent students.

Reichenbach died in Los Angeles on April 9, 1953, while working on problems in the [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophy of time]] and on the nature of [[scientific law]]s. As part of this he proposed a three part model of time in language, involving speech time, event time and - critically - reference time, which has been used by linguists since for describing tenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Derczynski|first=L|author2=Gaizauskas, R|title=Empirical Validation of Reichenbach's Tense Framework|journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Semantics|year=2013|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/sigsem.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work resulted in two books published posthumously: ''The Direction of Time'' and ''Nomological Statements and Admissible Operations''.

'''Hipponax''' ({{lang-grc|Ἱππῶναξ}}; ''gen''.: Ἱππώνακτος), of [[Ephesus]] and later [[Clazomenae]], was an [[Ancient Greek]] [[Iambus (genre)|iambic]] [[Greek lyric|poet]] who composed verses depicting the vulgar side of life in Ionian society in the sixth century BC. He was celebrated by ancient authors for his malicious wit (especially for his attacks on some contemporary sculptors, [[Bupalus|Bupalus and Athenis]]), and he was reputed to be [[deformity|physically deformed]] (a reputation that might have been inspired by the nature of his poetry).&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, 'Hipponax' in ''A Companion to Greek Lyric Poets'', Douglas E. Gerber (ed.), Brill (1997) pages 84&lt;/ref&gt; Little of his work survives despite its interest to Alexandrian scholars, who collected it in two or three books.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 374&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced Alexandrian poets searching for alternative styles and uses of language, such as [[Callimachus]] and [[Herodas]],&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, 'Hipponax' in ''A Companion to Greek Lyric Poets'', Douglas E. Gerber (ed.), Brill (1997) pages 80, 82&lt;/ref&gt; and his colourful reputation as an acerbic, social critic also made him a popular subject for verse, as in this epigram by [[Theocritus]]:
:''Here lies the poet Hipponax. If you are a scoundrel, do not approach the tomb; but if you are honest and from worthy stock, sit down in confidence and, if you like, fall asleep.''&lt;ref&gt;Theocritus ''epig.'' 19 Gow, cited by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 347&lt;/ref&gt;
Ancient literary critics credited him with inventing literary parody&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus 15.698b, cited by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 459&lt;/ref&gt; and "lame" poetic meters suitable for vigorous abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius ''de eloc.'' 301, cited and translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 351&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with influencing comic dramatists such as [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Tzetzes on Aristophanes, 'Plutus', cited by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 383&lt;/ref&gt; His witty, abusive style appears for example in this quote by [[Aelius Herodianus|Herodian]], who however was mainly interested in its linguistic aspects (many of the extant verses were preserved for us by lexicographers and grammarians interested in rare words):
:{{lang|grc|τίς ὀμφαλητόμος σε τὸν διοπλῆγα}}
:{{lang|grc|ἔψησε κἀπέλουσεν ἀσκαρίζοντα;}}

:''What navel-snipper wiped and washed you as you squirmed about, you crack-brained creature?''
where 'navel-snipper' signifies a midwife.&lt;ref&gt;Herodian 'On Inflections', cited by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 367&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ancient authorities record the barest details about his life (sometimes contradicting each other) and his extant poetry is too fragmentary to support autobiographical interpretation (a hazardous exercise even at the best of times).&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, 'Hipponax', in ''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', Douglas E. Gerber (ed), BRILL, 1997. {{ISBN|90-04-09944-1}}. Cf. p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marmor Parium]], only partially preserved in the relevant place, dates him to 541/40 BC, a date supported by [[Pliny The Elder]] in this comment on the theme of sculpture:
{{quotation|There lived in the island of [[Chios]] a sculptor Melas who was succeeded by his son Micciades and his grandson Achermus; the latter's sons, [[Bupalus|Bupalus and Athenis]], had the very greatest fame in that art at the time of the poet Hipponax who was clearly alive in the 60th Olympiad (540-37).—[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] 36.4.11}}
Archeological corroboration for these dates is found on the pedestal of a statue in [[Delos]], inscribed with the names Micciades and Achermus and dated to 550-30 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History', translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), including archeological notes 1 and 2, page 343&lt;/ref&gt; The poet therefore can be safely dated to the second half of the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 373&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Athenaeus]], he was small, thin and surprisingly strong&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus 12.552c-d, cited by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 347&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine encyclopaedia [[Suda]], recorded that he was expelled from [[Ephesus]] by the tyrants Athenagoras and Comas, then settled in [[Clazomenae]], and that he wrote verses satirising Bupalis and Athenis because they made insulting likenesses of him.&lt;ref&gt;''Suda'', translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 345&lt;/ref&gt; A [[scholiast]] commenting on [[Horace]]'s ''Epodes'' recorded two differing accounts of the dispute with Bupalus, characterized however as "a painter in Clazomenae": Hipponax sought to marry Bupalus's daughter but was rejected ''because'' of his physical ugliness, and Bupalus portrayed him as ugly ''in order'' to provoke laughter. According to the same scholiast, Hipponax retaliated in verse so savagely that Bupalus hanged himself.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Acron on Horace, ''Epodes'', cited by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 351&lt;/ref&gt;
Hipponax in that case closely resembles [[Archilochus|Archilochus of Paros]], an earlier iambic poet, who reportedly drove a certain Lycambes and his daughters to hang themselves after he too was rejected in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, 'Hipponax', in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zzlnqb_64SYC&amp;pg=PA50 ''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets''], Douglas E. Gerber (ed.), BRILL, 1997. {{ISBN|90-04-09944-1}}. Cf. p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Such a coincidence invites scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 159&lt;/ref&gt; The comic poet [[Diphilus]] took the similarity between the two iambic poets even further, representing them as rival lovers of the poet [[Sappho]]&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, 'Hipponax' in''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', Douglas E. Gerber (ed.), BRILL, 1997. {{ISBN|90-04-09944-1}}. Cf. p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of Hipponax, as revealed in the poems, resembles a low-life saga centred on his private enmities, his amorous escapades and his poverty&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 373&lt;/ref&gt; but it is probable he was another [[Petronius]], depicting low-life characters while actually moving in higher social circles.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, 'Hipponax' in''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', Douglas E. Gerber (ed.), BRILL, 1997. {{ISBN|90-04-09944-1}}. Cf. p.80&lt;/ref&gt; In one fragment, Hipponax decries "Bupalus, the mother-fucker ({{lang|grc|μητροκοίτης}}) with Arete", the latter evidently being the mother of Bupalus, yet Arete is presented as performing [[fellatio]] on Hipponax in another fragment and, elsewhere, Hipponax complains "Why did you go to bed with that rogue Bupalus?", again apparently referring to Arete (whose name ironically is Greek for 'virtue').&lt;ref&gt;fragments 12, 17, translated and annotated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 363 and 367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;fragment 15, translated by B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 160&lt;/ref&gt; The poet is a man of action but, unlike Archilochus, who served as a warrior on Thasos, his battlefields are close to home:
{{quote|''Take my cloak, I'll hit Bupalus in the eye! For I have two right hands and I don't miss with my punches.''&lt;ref&gt;fragments 120, 121 translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 453&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Hipponax's quarrelsome disposition is also illustrated in verses quoted by [[Tzetzes]], where the bard abuses a painter called Mimnes, and advises him thus:
{{quote|''when you paint the serpent on the trireme's full-oared side, quit making it run back from the prow-ram to the pilot. What a disaster it will be and what a sensation—you low-born slave, you scum—if the snake should bite the pilot on the shin''—fragment 28&lt;ref&gt;Fr. 28, translated by B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 160&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Work==
Hipponax composed within the [[Iambus (genre)|Iambus]] tradition which, in the work of Archilochus, a hundred years earlier, appears to have functioned as ritualized abuse and obscenity associated with the religious cults of [[Demeter]] and [[Dionysus]] but which, in Hipponax's day, seems rather to have had the purpose of entertainment. In both cases, the genre featured scornful abuse, a bitter tone and sexual permissiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), pags 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--
The nature of Hipponax's attack on Bupalus is more doubtful than the nature of Archilochus's attack on Lycambes.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, 'Hipponax' in ''A Companion to Greek Lyric Poets'', Douglas E. Gerber (ed.), Brill (1997) pages 87&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;
Unlike Archilochus, however, he frequently refers to himself by name, emerging as a highly self-conscious figure, and his poetry is more narrow and insistently vulgar in scope:&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, 'Hipponax' in''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', Douglas E. Gerber (ed.), BRILL, 1997. {{ISBN|90-04-09944-1}}. pages 80, 83&lt;/ref&gt; "with Hipponax, we are in an unheroic, in fact, a very sordid world",&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 159&lt;/ref&gt; amounting to "a new conception of the poet's function."&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 374&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
He was considered the inventor of a peculiar metre, the scazon ("halting iambic" as Murray calls it&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Murray, 1897, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;) or [[choliamb]], which substitutes a [[spondee]] or [[trochee]] for the final iambus of an iambic senarius, and is an appropriate form for the [[burlesque]] character of his poems. As an ancient scholar once put it:
{{quotation|"In his desire to abuse his enemies he shattered the meter, making it lame instead of straightforward, and unrhythmical, i.e. suitable for vigorous abuse, since what is rhythmical and pleasing to the ear would be more suitable for words of praise than blame."—[[Demetrius of Phalerum]]&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius ''de. eloc.'' 301, cited and translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 351&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Most of the surviving fragments are in choliambs but others feature [[trochaic tetrameter]] and even [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyls]], the latter sometimes in combination with [[Iamb (foot)|iambs]] and even on their own in [[dactylic hexameter]], imitating epic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 8&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient scholars in fact credited him with inventing [[parody]] and [[Athenaeus]] quoted this diatribe against a glutton 'Euromedontiades', composed in dactylic hexameter in mock-heroic imitation of Homer's [[Odyssey]]:
:''Muse, sing of Eurymedontiades, sea-swilling [[Charybdis]],''
:''his belly a sharp-slicing knife, his table manners atrocious;''
:''sing how, condemned by public decree, he will perish obscenely''
:''under a rain of stones, on the beach of the barren salt ocean''''—fragment 128&lt;ref&gt;fragment 128, translated by B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'Euromedontiades' means 'son of Euromedon', who was a king of giants mentioned by Homer (Odyssey 7.58f.); Charybdis is also mentioned by Homer (Odyssey 12.104); Aristotle named [[Hegemon of Thasos]] as the founder of parody (''Poetics'' 1448a12) but he meant thereby that Hegemon was the first to make parody a profession—Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), notes 4, 6, 8 page 459&lt;/ref&gt;
Most archaic poets (including the iambic poets Archilochus and [[Semonides]]) were influenced by the Ionian epic tradition, as represented in the work of Homer. Except for parody, Hipponax composed as if Homer never existed, avoiding not only heroic sentiment but even epic phrasing and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 158&lt;/ref&gt; He employed a form of [[Ionic dialect|Ionic]] Greek that included an unusually high proportion of [[Anatolia]]n and particularly [[Lydian language|Lydian]] [[loanword]]s,&lt;ref&gt;J.Adiego 'Greek and Lydian', in ''A History of Ancient Greek: from the beginnings to late antiquity'', A.F.Christidis (ed.), Cambridge University Press (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=WJbd0m6YaFkC&amp;pg=PA768&amp;dq=Hipponax+Lydian+language#v=onepage&amp;q=Hipponax%20Lydian%20language&amp;f=false Page 768-72] {{ISBN|978-0-521-83307-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as for example here where he addresses Zeus with the outlandish Lydian word for 'king' (nominative {{lang|grc|πάλμυς}}):
:{{lang|grc|Ὦ Ζεῦ, πάτερ Ζεῦ, θεῶν Ὀλυμπίων πάλμυ,}}
:{{lang|grc|τί μ᾽ οὐκ ἔδωκας χρυσόν...}}
:''Zeus, father Zeus, sultan of the Olympian gods,''
:''why have you not given me gold...?''—fragment 38&lt;ref&gt;fragment 38, translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 385&lt;/ref&gt;

Eating, defecating and fornicating are frequent themes and often they are employed together, as in fragment 92, a tattered papyrus which narrates a sexual encounter in a malodorous privy, where a Lydian-speaking woman performs some esoteric and obscene rites on the narrator, including beating his genitals with a fig branch and inserting something up his anus, provoking incontinence and finally an attack by [[dung beetles]]—a wild scene that possibly inspired the 'Oenothea' episode in [[Petronius]]'s ''Satyricon''.&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 163&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
{{quote|"Hipponax remains a mystery. We have lost the matrix of these fascinating but puzzling fragments; ripped from their frame they leave us in doubt whether to take them seriously as autobiographical material (unlikely, but it has been done), as complete fiction (but there is no doubt that Bupalus and Athenis were real people), as part of a literary adaptation of some ritual of abuse (a ''komos'' or something similar), or as dramatic scripts for some abusive proto-comic performance. Whatever they were, they are a pungent reminder of the variety and vitality of archaic Greek literature and of how much we have lost."—B.M. Knox&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 164&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The extant work also includes fragments of [[epodes]] (fr. 115-118) but the authorship is disputed by many modern scholars, who attribute them to Archilochus on various grounds, including for example the earlier poet's superior skill in invective and the fragments' resemblance to the tenth epode of [[Horace]] (an avowed imitator of Archilochus).&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 157&lt;/ref&gt; Archilochus might also have been the source for an unusually beautiful line attributed to Hipponax&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Hipponax fragment 119 might have been a contamination of the Archilochus fragments 118 ({{lang|grc|εἴ μοι γένοιτο χεῖρα Νεοβούλης θιγεῖν}} / ''Would that I might thus touch Neoboule on her hand'') and 196a.6 ({{lang|grc|καλὴ τέρεινα παρθένος}} / ''a beautiful, tender maiden'')—Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), note 1 for fr. 119 page 159&lt;/ref&gt; (a line that has also been described "as clear, melodious and spare as a line of [[Sappho]]"):&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 164&lt;/ref&gt; 
:{{lang|grc|εἴ μοι γένοιτο παρθένος καλή τε καὶ τέρεινα}}—fr. 119
:''If only I might have a maiden who is both beautiful and tender.''&lt;ref&gt;Fragment 119, translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 451&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission and reception===
Few fragments of his work survived through the Byzantine period despite his earlier popularity with Alexandrian poets and scholars. The Christian fathers disapproved of his abusive and obscene verses and he was also singled out as unedifying by [[Julian the Apostate]], the pagan emperor, who instructed his priests to "abstain not only from impure and lascivious acts but also from speech and reading of the same character...No initiate shall read Archilochus or Hipponax or any of the authors who write the same kind of thing."&lt;ref&gt;''Ep.'' 48, translated by B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Hipponax's Ionic dialect and his extensive use of foreign words made his work unsuited to an ancient education system that promoted [[Attica|Attic]], the dialect of classical Athens. Today the longest fragment of complete, consecutive verses comprises only six lines.&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologists working at [[Oxyrhynchus]] have added to the meagre collection with tattered scraps of papyrus, of which the longest, published in 1941, has ''parts'' of over fifty [[choliambics]].&lt;ref&gt;David A. Campbell, ''Greek Lyric Poetry'', Bristol Classical Press (1982), page 373&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Comedy]], as a medium for invective and abuse, was a natural successor to [[Iambus (genre)|iambus]] from the viewpoint of [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'' 1449a2ff, cited by E.W. Handley 'Comedy' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), note 2 page 363&lt;/ref&gt; and Aristophanes, the master of Old Comedy, certainly borrowed inspiration from Hipponax: "Someone ought to give them a Bupalus or two on the jaw—that might shut them up for a bit" the men's chorus says about the women's chorus in [[Lysistrata]],&lt;ref&gt;Lysistrata lines 360-61, translated by Alan H. Sommerstein, ''Aristophanes: Lysistrata, The Acharnians, The Clouds'', Penguin Classics (1973), page 194&lt;/ref&gt; and "Wonderful poet, Hipponax!" Dionysus exclaims in [[Frogs (play)|Frogs]], while trying to disguise the pain inflicted on himself during a flogging.&lt;ref&gt;Frogs line 660, translated by David Barrett, ''Aristophanes: The Frogs an Other Plays'', Penguin Classics (1964), page 180&lt;/ref&gt; A quote attributed to Hipponax by [[Stobaeus]] actually appears to have been composed by a [[New Comedy]] poet.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;"The best marriage for a sensible man is to get a woman's good character as a wedding gift: for this dowry alone preserves the household..."—fr. 182, translated and annotated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 497&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some Hipponactean sayings===
*"There are two days when a woman is a pleasure: the day one marries her and the day one carries out her dead body." ({{lang|grc|δύ᾿ ἡμέραι γυναικός εἰσιν ἥδισται, ὅταν γαμῇ τις κἀκφέρῃ τεθνηκυῖαν}}) &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;(Attribution to Hipponax is not accepted by all scholars—Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 405&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Palladas+of+Alexandria+on+women-a0221920139 A variant of these lines] was used nearly a thousand years later by [[Palladas]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"drank like a lizard in a privy."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 481&lt;/ref&gt;
*"croaking like a raven in a privy."&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Knox, 'Elegy and Iambus: Hipponax' in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature'', P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 162&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Mimnes, you who gape open all the way to the shoulders." ({{lang|grc|Μιμνῆ κατωμόχανε}}): &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Mimnes was a painter, here addressed hyperbolically as a sodomite (wide-arse, or {{lang|grc|ευρύπρωκτος}}, ''euryproktos'', in this case gaping all the way to the shoulders)—cited and translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 375&lt;/ref&gt;
*"interprandial pooper" ({{lang|grc|μεσσηγυδορποχέστης}})&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A comic word coined by Hipponax, defined by [[Suetonius]] in ''On Defamatory Words'' as "...one who often retires to defecate in the midst of a meal so that he may fill himself up again."—cited and translated by Douglas Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), page 437&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Instituto de Estudos Medievais''' ('''IEM''', Institute for Medieval Studies) is a centre for advanced research on [[medieval studies]] attached to the [[Faculty of Social and Human Sciences]] (FCSH) of [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]], in Portugal. Founded in 2002 by Portuguese medieval historians Luis Krus and [[José Mattoso]], the IEM is one of the largest centres of its kind in the Portuguese and Spanish-speaking world and the largest in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iem.fcsh.unl.pt/section2.aspx?kind=apresentacao |title=FCSH : Missao|language=pt|website=Iem.fcsh.unl.pt |accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEM emphasizes a strong collaborative and interdisciplinary tradition, spanning history, [[archaeology]], [[medieval languages]]] (including [[Arabi language|Arabi]]), art history, manuscript studies and [[musicology]]. The centre's research and teaching activities focus primarily on the society, culture, and institutions of the westernmost region of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] between 700 and 1500, and its framing in the wider backdrop of Europe.

== Governance ==

The IEM's internal structure resembles that of most academic research institutions in Portugal. It is modeled on guidelines set by the [[Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia|Portuguese Science Foundation (FCT)]]. The centre is overseen by a steering committee that is chaired by Maria João Branco, and advised by a general assembly and an external audit commission. 

It is divided into two broad research clusters that together reflect the centre's current research rationale:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iem.fcsh.unl.pt/section2.aspx?kind=apresentacao&amp;id=16 |title=Grupos de Investigacao |language=pt|website=Fcsh.unl.pt |accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Images, texts and representations 
* Territories and powers: A global perspective. The IEM's core membership includes more than forty integrated researchers in addition to dozens of associated researchers, whose primary affiliations are NOVA and similar academic institutions.

==Activities==
Activities revolve around advanced research in medieval studies in the form of individual and collaborative projects. Annually since 2001 the IEM has published the peer-reviewed e-journal ''Medievalista Online'', as well as a book series on medieval topics in Portuguese, French and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fcsh.unl.pt/iem/medievalista/informations.html#arbitagem|title=MEDIEVALISTA : Arbitragem Científica 2015 : Peer Reviewing 2015|language=pt|website=Fcsh.unl.pt|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; IEM has often been a partner to public institutions in Portugal for activities such as the curation of exhibitions. The centre provides undergraduate and advanced teaching for NOVA, and it has begun to award and administer graduate scholarships.

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for symbol is ''ot'', which, in early Judaism, denoted not only a sign, but also a visible religious token of the relation between [[God]] and man.

==Shabbat and circumcision==
{{Judaism}}
The Shabbat, according to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign ("ot") between Him and His people. It states, "Moreover also I gave them my shabbats, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them."  The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means He set it apart for only Holy use.  The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, "six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work".

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], while the [[Israelites]] were living in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] for forty years, they built a Tabernacle ({{lang-he|משכן}} [[transliteration|translit]]: ''mishkan'', "Place of [Divine] dwelling"); this was viewed as the abode of the Shekhinah (the presence of YHWH) on Earth, and the place where the priests could minister to God on behalf of the nation of Israel.

==The priests==
The Hebrew for priest is ''Kohen''; the ''Kohanim'' (plural) mediated between God and man by offering sacrifices, and by other services in the Temple. The leader of them the ''Kohen Gadol'', the high priest.

The vestments of the high priest were interpreted in three ways. The explanation of Philo is as follows ("Vita Mosis," iii. 209): His upper garment was the symbol of the ether, while the blossoms represented the earth, the [[pomegranate]]s typified running water, and the [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s denoted the music of the water. The [[ephod]] corresponded to heaven, and the stones on both shoulders to the two hemispheres, one above and the other below the earth. The six names on each of the stones were the six signs of the [[zodiac]], which were denoted also by the twelve names on [[Priestly breastplate|the breastplate]]. The miter was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.

[[Josephus]]' explanation is this:&lt;ref&gt;"Ant." iii. 7, § 7&lt;/ref&gt; The coat was the symbol of the earth, the upper garment emblemized heaven, while the bells and pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The [[ephod]] typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was in the center of the ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the [[girdle]] symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the miter was a token of heaven.

The [[Talmud|Jerusalem Talmud]]&lt;ref&gt;Menachot vii. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Midrash]] ''Leviticus Rabbah'' (x.) give the following interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder or for the sin of wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement for unchastity. The miter denoted atonement for pride, and the belt for theft or trickery. The breastplate represented atonement for any perversion of the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.

==The symbolic values of numbers==
{{See also|Significance of numbers of Judaism|Hebrew numerology}}

The number [[3 (number)|three]] was the symbol of holiness and love. The Holy of Holies occupied one-third, and the Holy Place two-thirds, of the entire Temple. The tapestries were ten times three [[ell]]s in length, and there were three vessels each for the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, and the Ark. The candlestick had twice three arms (besides the shaft, which also held a lamp), and each arm had three knobs. The blessing of the priest consisted of three sections,&lt;ref&gt;Num. vi. 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt; and in the invocation of God the word "holy" was repeated thrice.

The symbolism of the number [[4 (number)|four]] was based on the contemplation of the quaternity as found in the universe, which included both heaven and earth&lt;ref&gt;comp. Job xxxvii. I Copied from wikipedia3; Isa. xi. 12; Ezek. vii. 2; I Chron. ix. 24; Dan. viii. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number four connoted [[heaven]] as the throne of God.

The Holy of Holies was in the form of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], and the Holy Place was a double cube in length. All the vessels of the Temple in Jerusalem (except the candlestick) were rectangular. According to Ezekiel i. 26-28, the number four symbolized the divine revelation, while in the view of Philo it was the number of complete harmony.&lt;ref&gt;"De Opificio Mundi," pp.&amp;nbsp;13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The number [[5 (number)|five]] typified semicompletion. The dimensions of the curtain of the Holy of Holies were four ells by five; the altar in the court covered a surface of five square ells; and there were five pillars at the entrance to the Tabernacle.

The number [[6 (number)|six]] symbolizes imperfection.

The number [[7 (number)|seven]] was the general symbol for all association with God, and was the favorite religious number of Judaism, typifying the covenant of holiness and sanctification, and also all that was holy and sanctifying in purpose. The candlestick had seven lamps, and the acts of atonement and purification were accompanied by a sevenfold sprinkling. The establishment of the Sabbath, the [[shmita|Sabbatical year]], and the year of jubilee was based on the number seven, as were the periods of purification and of mourning.
The number 7 is the Divine number of completion.

The number [[8 (number)|eight]] symbolizes new beginnings. According to [[Kaballah]] in the [[Zohar]] the number eight signifies this because the eighth day was the first day after creation when God returned to work; the week began again.

The number [[10 (number)|ten]] symbolized absolute completeness. The court to the Tabernacle was ten times ten ells long, and five times ten ells wide, and in the Holy of Holies the [[Ten Commandments]] were preserved.

The number [[12 (number)|twelve]], being the product of three and four, typified the union of the people with God.&lt;ref name="Maude-1862"&gt;[[#MAUDE 1862|Maude 1862]]: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8oMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;pg=PA509#v=onepage&amp;q=%22union%20of%20the%20people%20with%20god%22%20israel&amp;f=false 509]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:31-38|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|32:24-30|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the table were twelve loaves of show-bread, and the breastplate of the priest contained twelve precious stones as emblems of the [[twelve tribes of Israel]], which camped round about the Sanctuary.

The number [[13 (number)|thirteen]] symbolizes the principles of faith and God's mercy.

The number [[18 (number)|eighteen]] is considered significant because the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for "life" is חי (''[[Chai (symbol)|chai]]''), which has a [[gematria|numerical value]] of 18.

The number [[26 (number)|twenty six]] symbolizes God's name.

==Metals and minerals==
[[Gold]] was the symbol of the divine or celestial light, the glory of God.&lt;ref&gt;Zech. vi. 11; Dan. xi. 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silver]] was the emblem of moral innocence and of holiness.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. i. 22; Jer. vi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brass]] symbolized hardness, strength, and firmness.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xxvi. 19; Jer. xv. 12; Job xl. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Brass was a substitute for gold, and iron for silver.&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salt]] was declared to be necessary in every meal-offering, in which it takes the place of the blood in the animal sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. ii. 13; but comp. Ezek. xliii. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmud salt symbolizes the [[Torah]], for as the world cannot exist without salt, so it can not endure without the Torah.&lt;ref&gt;Soferim xv. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colors==

The Israelites used an [[indigo]]-colored dye called ''tekhelet''; this dye was likely made from snail ''[[murex trunculus]]''. This dye was very important in both Jewish and non-Jewish cultures of this time, and was used by royalty and the upper-class in dyeing their clothing, sheets, curtains, etc. This dye is known as [[Tyrian purple]].

In the Torah the Israelites are commanded to dye one of the threads of their [[tallit]] (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; when they look at this dye they will think of the blue sky, and of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) [[Blue in Judaism]] has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.

"Argaman" was the symbol of power, and of glory,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. lx. 6; Judges viii. 26&lt;/ref&gt; so that [[Alexander Balas]] robed Jonathan in purple,&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20&lt;/ref&gt; which was especially used to designate royal dignity.&lt;ref&gt;I Macc. x. 20, xi. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tola'at" and "shani" ("[[scarlet (color)|scarlet]]," "[[crimson]]") symbolized blood, and thus frequently typified life, although this color often designated sin, as well as joy and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. xxxviii. 28; Josh. ii. 18, 21; Jer. iv. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Purification from sin was also symbolized by purple.&lt;ref&gt;Lev. xvi. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

"Shesh" ([[white]]) was the symbol of physical and intellectual purity, being the true color of light, without any modification.&lt;ref&gt;Cant. v. 10; Dan. iv. 10, 14, 20; Zech. xiv. 5&lt;/ref&gt; White also symbolizes death.  In some cases, it can also symbolize life.

Yellow has an association with an anti-Semitic forced identification mark (see [[Yellow badge]]).

==Festivals and holy days==
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|Jewish ritual objects shown on a gold goblet (2nd century CE) excavated in Rome]]
The Torah delineates three [[pilgrimage]] festivals, [[Passover]], [[Shavuot]] (The Feasts of Weeks) and [[Sukkot]] (Tabernacles). Each of these was tied to the agricultural cycle of the Israelites, and was also given a theological symbolism.

[[Passover]] celebrated the rebirth of nature, and symbolized the origin of the Jewish people.

The eating of bitter herbs symbolized the miseries of the [[The Exodus#Bondage in Egypt|Egyptian bondage]]. In the evenings four cups of wine were drunk, to symbolize the four world-kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Yerushalmi Pesachim 37c; Midrash Gen. Rabbah lxxx&lt;/ref&gt; People eating during the Passover meal reclined, in the style of free rich aristocrats, to represent their liberation from [[slavery]].

A discussion of the meaning of [[Shavuot]] (the Feast of Weeks) and of [[Sukkot]], the Feast of [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacles]], is found in the entries on those subjects.

A discussion of symbolism inherent in [[Rosh Hashanah]] (The New Year) and [[Yom Kippur]] (the Day of Atonement) is found in the entries on those subjects. The Day of Atonement was considered the most holy day of the entire year, and was regarded as the symbol of the complete atonement of the people and of their absolution from their sins committed against God.

==Symbolic visions of the Prophets==
[[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] beheld an [[almond]]-tree as a token of the speedy fulfillment of the word of God.

[[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] saw a basket of summer fruit as a symbol of the approaching end of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Amos viii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahijah the Shilonite tore Jeroboam's mantle into twelve pieces, to typify the division of the kingdom of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xi. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and Zedekiah made horns of iron to encourage Ahab to engage in war with Ramoth-gilead.&lt;ref&gt;I Kings xxii. 11&lt;/ref&gt; King Joash, at the command of the prophet Elisha, shot arrows from the open window into the air, to symbolize the destruction of his enemies.&lt;ref&gt;II Kings xiii. 15-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah walked naked and barefoot to show how the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] would be treated when taken captive by the Assyrians,&lt;ref&gt;Isa. xx. 2&lt;/ref&gt; while Jeremiah wore a [[yoke]] upon his neck to induce the nations to submit to the King of Assyria.&lt;ref&gt;Jer. xxvii. 2-4, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezekiel]] was commanded to inscribe the names of certain tribes upon separate pieces of wood, to show that God would reunite those tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Ezek. xxxvii. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]

==On tombstones==
Some common themes appear on many Jewish tombstones. Two hands with outspread fingers indicated that the dead man was descended from priestly stock (''[[Kohen|Kohanim]]'') who blessed the people in this fashion, and a jug was carved on the tombstones of the [[Levite]]s as an emblem of those who washed the priest's hands before he pronounced the blessing.

Some gravestones show a tree with branches either outspread or broken off, symbolizing the death of a young man or an old man respectively; or they have a cluster of [[grape]]s as an emblem of Israel.

The [[Star of David]] (''Magen David'') occurs frequently.

Sometimes figures symbolized the name of the deceased, as the figure of a lion for Loeb, a wolf for Benjamin, and a rose for the name Bluma/Blume.

==Influence on Christian symbols==
The influence of Judaism upon [[Christian symbolism]] as early as the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D., is apparent both in painting and in sculpture, the most frequent motives being those that occur in the [[Mishnah]] as formulas for prayer on fast-days. The prayer beginning with the words "Mi she-'anah," which was included in the [[selihah]] at an early date, was adopted in the Christian ritual as the litany "Libera domine." This litany was figuratively used in a certain sequence as a symbol, for the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] was regarded as a symbol of the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]], since the early religions, and the act of sacrifice emblemized the death on the cross.

Abraham was represented as the symbol of the power of faith and Isaac as the sacrificed redeemer. The ascension of [[Elijah]] was believed to typify the [[ascension of Jesus Christ]], who was regarded by Christian symbolism as an analogue to Elijah, although this ascension was also taken as a type of the general [[resurrection]] from the dead. Job sitting among the ashes was the symbol of patience and of the power of resistance of the flesh; and [[Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael|Hananiah]], [[Meshach|Mishael]], and [[Abednego|Azariah]] in the fiery furnace typified steadfastness in persecution and faith in the aid of God. Christian [[sarcophagi]] contained artistic representations of the fall of man, [[Noah]] and the ark, scenes from the life of [[Moses]] in three variations, [[Joshua]], [[David]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].

==The land of Zion==
{{Main|Land of Israel}}

[[Zion]] is a Biblical term that refers to [[Jerusalem]], and is the source for the modern term [[Zionism]].

A '''''khachkar''''', also known as an '''Armenian cross-stone'''&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; ({{lang-hy|խաչքար}}, {{IPA-hy|χɑtʃʰˈkʰɑɾ|pron}}, խաչ xačʿ "cross" + քար kʿar "stone") is a carved, memorial [[stele]] bearing a cross, and often with additional motifs such as [[rosette (design)|rosette]]s, interlaces, and botanical motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Thierry, cover sleeve.{{ref|Thiery|Thierry 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Khachkars'' are characteristic of [[Medieval]] [[Christian]] [[Armenian art]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture. — [[Oxford University Press]], 2012. — Vol. 2. — P. 222.''"'Khatck'ar' [Armen.:'cross-stone'] Typical Armenian stone monument, comprising an upright slab (h. c. 1—3 m) carved with a cross design, usually set on a plinth or rectangular base. "''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gough M., ''The Origins of Christian Art'', London, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, khachkars, their symbolism and craftsmanship are inscribed in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Armenian cross-stones art. Symbolism and craftsmanship of Khachkars |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00434|publisher=UNESCO Culture Sector |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The most common ''khachkar'' feature is a [[cross]] surmounting a [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] or a [[solar symbol|solar disc]]. The remainder of the stone face is typically filled with elaborate patterns of leaves, [[grape]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, and bands of interlace. Occasionally a ''khachkar'' is surmounted by a [[cornice]] sometimes containing [[Bible|biblical]] or saintly figures.

Most early ''khachkars'' were erected for the salvation of the soul of either a living or a deceased person. Otherwise they were intended to commemorate a military victory, the construction of a church, or as a form of protection from natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;"Armenian Khatchkars" (Editions Erebuni, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common location for early ''khachkars'' was in a graveyard. However, Armenian gravestones take many other forms, and only a minority are ''khachkars''.

==History==
The first true ''khachkars'' appeared in the 9th century,&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; during the time of [[Armenians|Armenian]] revival after liberation from [[Arab]] rule. The oldest ''khachkar'' with a known date was carved in 879 (though earlier, cruder, examples exist). Erected in [[Garni]], it is dedicated to queen [[Katranide I]], the wife of king [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot I Bagratuni]]. The peak of the khachkar carving art was between the 12th and the 14th centuries. The art declined during the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasion at the end of the 14th century. It revived in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the artistic heights of the 14th century were never achieved again. Today, the tradition still remains, and one can still see khachkar carvers in some parts of [[Yerevan]].&lt;ref&gt;Anatoli L. Yakobson. Armenian Khachkars, Moscow, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

About 40,000 khachkars survive today. Most of them are free standing, though those recording donations are usually built into monastery walls. The following three khachkars are believed{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to be the finest examples of the art form:
*One in [[Geghard]], carved in 1213, probably by master ''Timot'' and master ''Mkhitar''
*The Holy Redeemer khachkar in [[Haghpat]] (see gallery), carved in 1273 by master ''Vahram''
*A khachkar in [[Goshavank]], carved in 1291 by master ''Poghos''.

A number of good examples have been transferred to the Historical Museum in [[Yerevan]] and beside the cathedral in [[Echmiadzin]]. The largest surviving collection of khachkars is in Armenia, at [[Noraduz cemetery]] on the western shore of the [[Lake Sevan]], where an old graveyard with around 900 khachkars from various periods and of various styles can be seen.  The largest number was formerly located at [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]] in the [[Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic]] of [[Azerbaijan]], but the entire medieval cemetery was destroyed by Azeri soldiers in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Present==
The art of carving khachkars has witnessed a rebirth as a symbol of [[Culture of Armenia|Armenian culture]] in the 20th century. There are hundreds of khachkars worldwide, many of which are memorials to commemorate the victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. According to one count, there are nearly 30 khachkars on public locations in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toponymie et Monuments arméniens|url=http://www.acam-france.org/contacts/index_lieux.php|website=acam-france.org|publisher=Association Culturelle Arménienne de Marne-la-Vallée (France)|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered khachkars==
A large portion of khachkars, which were created in historic Armenia and surrounding regions, in modern times have become the possession of Turkey, Azerbaijan, and partly Georgia and Iran. As a result of systematic eradication of khachkars in [[Turkey]], today only a few examples survive. Unfortunately these few survivors are not cataloged and properly photographed. Thus, it is difficult to follow up with the current situation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sirarpie Der-Nersessian|Der Nersessian S.]] Armenian Art, Paris, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  One documented example took place in the [[Armenian Cemetery in Jugha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=261191&amp;apc_state=henh | title = Azerbaijan: Famous Medieval Cemetery Vanishes | work = Caucasus Reporting Service, [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]] |date=April 19, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = World Watches In Silence As Azerbaijan Wipes Out Armenian Culture | publisher = [[The Art Newspaper]] | date = 2006-05-25 | url =http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=281 | accessdate = 2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = Tragedy on the Araxes | publisher = [[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] | date = 2006-06-30 | url =http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/djulfa/index.html | accessdate = 2006-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source says that khachkars are being damaged, neglected, or moved in Armenia.&lt;ref name="Khachkar.am"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khachkar.am/en/endangered.php |title=Endangered Khachkars |publisher=Khachkar.am |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reasons cited for moving these khachkars include; decoration, to create new holy places, or to make space for new burials.

The government of [[Azerbaijan]] has denied claims that members of the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces]] smashed khackars with sledgehammers in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]] in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Castle| first = Stephen| title = Azerbaijan 'flattened' sacred Armenian site| work = Belfast Telegraph| accessdate = 2018-05-14| date = 2006-05-30| url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10731370.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
'''Amenaprkich''' ({{lang-hy|Ամէնափրկիչ}}, meaning ''Holy Saviour'') is a particular type of khachkar in which on the cross is a depiction of the crucified [[Christ]]. Only a few such designs are known, and most date from the late 13th century.

'''Law practice management''' ('''LPM''') is the [[management]] of a [[law practice]]. In the [[United States]], [[law firm]]s may be composed of a single [[lawyer|attorney]], of several attorneys, or of many attorneys, plus support staff such as [[paralegal|paralegals/legal assistants]], [[Secretary|secretaries]] (including [[legal secretary|legal secretaries]]), and other personnel.

Debate over law as a [[profession]] versus a [[business]] has occurred for over a century; a number of observers believe that it is both.&lt;ref&gt;Champ S. Andrews, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/784941 The Law: A Business or a Profession?] (June 1908), ''Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 107, No. 7, pp. 602-610.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy M. Miller, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=929749 Is Law a Business or a Profession-And Does it Really Matter?] (1994), ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' Vol. 107, No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lippe, [http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/law_is_both_a_profession_and_a_business--forget_that_at_your_own_peril/ Law Is Both a Profession and a Business—Forget That at Your Own Peril] (January 27, 2011). Legal Rebels, ABA Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law practice management is the study and practice of [[business administration]] in the legal context, including such topics as [[workload]] and [[staff management]]; [[Managerial finance|financial management]]; [[office management]]; and [[marketing]], including [[legal advertising]].

Many lawyers have commented on the difficulty of balancing the management functions of a law firm with client matters.&lt;ref&gt;Anita J. Cicero, as told to Elizabeth Olson. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/jobs/04pre.html Preoccupations: The Tightrope of Managing a Law Office] (January 3, 2009). ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lawyers started practicing centuries ago. Law firms as an institution date back to the 19th century, and in the United States began appearing in the period before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. and Angelo Dondi, ''Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study'' (2004). Stanford University Press, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; predating the development of modern [[management theory]].

Today, the [[George Washington University]] College of Professional Studies (CPS) offers a [[Master of Professional Studies]] and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nearyou.gwu.edu/lawfirm/index1.html Master of Professional Studies and Graduate Certificate in Law Firm Management], George Washington University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ABA Law Practice Division==
The leading organization focused on law practice management is the Law Practice Division of the [[American Bar Association]] which traces its history back to the creation of the ABA Special Committee on Economics of Law Practice by the ABA Board of Governors on July 30, 1957.  In August 1957, when Charles S. Rhyne became President of the ABA, he made one of his major objectives the institution of a “comprehensive program to aid members of the ABA in the field of economics of law practice”.  He appointed the first Committee which consisted of five members and was increased in May of the following year to seven by action of the Board.  The first Chair of the Special Committee was John C. Satterfield of Yazoo City, Mississippi.

The Committee was charged with the duty of laying the groundwork for the development of practical suggestions to lawyers, designed to improve their economic status.  Combined with this, there was to be an increase in coordination of assistance to lawyers in the business phase of the practice of law, achieved by ABA through its staff, committees and sections and by the state and local bar associations.

An early publication from the Committee was ''The 1958 Lawyer and His 1938 Dollar''. Satterfield was elected President of the [[American Bar Association]] in 1961 during which ''The Lawyers Handbook'' was first published and distributed to all attorneys who joined the ABA that year.

By action of the Board of Governors at the ABA Annual Meeting in August 1961, the Special Committee was made a standing committee of the Association and [[Lewis F. Powell]] of Richmond, Virginia, was appointed as the first Chair of the ABA Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice.  Shortly after the completion of his term as Chair in 1962, he was elected President of the American Bar Association and subsequently became an Associate Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1972.

The Standing Committee on Economics of Law Practice published a bimonthly newsletter, Legal Economics News, and more than 30 books and pamphlets, three educational films, and an audio cassette program.  The Committee continued to publish The Lawyer’s Handbook.  The Committee’s staff answered over one hundred inquiries a month from attorneys regarding the application of sound management principles to the law office operation.  In addition, a small group of attorneys led by J. Harris Morgan of Greenville, Texas, Kline Strong of Salt Lake City, Utah, Lee Turner of Great Bend, Kansas and Jimmy Brill of Houston, Texas, traveled throughout the US, presenting programs on law firm management. Their efforts created the need for the Section.

Commencing in 1965 when John D. Connor served as Chair, the Committee presented the first of six National Conferences of Law Office Economics and Management in Chicago, which attracted approximately 500 lawyers throughout the country and several foreign countries.

As activities expanded and lawyer interest in law office management increased, it became apparent that the committee structure could not meet the demonstrated need of American lawyers for assistance in law practice issues and limited the participation and contribution of interested and informed lawyers in the vital economics and efficiency programs of the Association.  Accordingly, two members of the Committee, Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle, Washington, the former Chair of the Young Lawyers Section, and Richard A. Williams of Little Rock, Arkansas were joined by William J. Fuchs of Haverford, Pennsylvania; John “Buddy” Thomason of Memphis, Tennessee; and  Robert P. Wilkins of Columbia, South Carolina, and commenced efforts to form a section to address the subject of law office economics and management.

Proponents for a new Section originally proposed that the Board of Governors recommend to the House the creation of a Section of Law Office Practice and Efficiency, but after deliberation it was determined that the new Section should be called by the Standing Committee name.  At the ABA Midyear Meeting in Houston, Texas in February 1974, the House of Delegates approved establishing the Section of Economics of Law Practice.  This action culminated a two-year effort to expand the Committee’s work to a much wider lawyer population.

The organizational meeting of the Section was held in April 1974 at the close of the Sixth National Conference of Law Office Economics and Management.  Robert S. Mucklestone of Seattle Washington, who had served as the Chair of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice was elected the new Section chair with 1074 charter members. Those chosen to serve on the initial Section Council were selected from the members of the ABA Committee on Economics of Law Practice and the Committee on Legal Assistants, other ABA contacts, speakers from the National Conferences and attorneys active at the state level.

The current chair of the American Bar Association Law Practice Division is Tom Bolt, a St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands lawyer with BoltNagi PC.

==Other Organizations and Consultants==
The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) [[professional association]], which was founded in 1971 is another organization that is concerned with law practice management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of law practice [[consulting firm]]s also exist. Many [[bar association]]s have a law practice section or division which they allow non-attorney members due to the technical, non-legal basis of law office management.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.michbar.org/lawpractice/ Law Practice Management and Legal Administrators Section] of the [[State Bar of Michigan]]; the [http://www.massbar.org/member-groups/sections/law-practice-management Law Practice Management Section] of the [[Massachusetts Bar Association]]; and the [http://lpmt.calbar.ca.gov/ Law Practice Management and Technology Section] of the [[State Bar of California]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of law-practice management==
Law practice management includes management of people (clients, staff, vendors), workplace facilities and equipment, internal processes and policies, and financial matters such as collection, [[budgeting]], [[Internal control|financial controls]], [[payroll]], and client [[trust account]]s.

===Software and legal research===
{{Main|Law practice management software}}

Software applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Calloway, [http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf Picking the "Best" Law Office Software] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015452/http://www.okbar.org/members/map/Picking%20the%20Best%20Law%20Office%20Software.pdf |date=2009-12-29 }}. Oklahoma Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Law practice management software|Practice management software]], a form of [[customer relationship management]] software, is among the most important, and features and functions of such management software often include case management ([[database]]s, [[conflict of interest]] checking, [[statute of limitations]] checking), time tracking (for billing), [[document assembly]], [[contact management]], and calendaring and [[Docket (court)|docket]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/groups/departments_offices/legal_technology_resources/resources/charts_fyis/casemanagementcomparison.html Practice and Case Management Software: Comparison Chart]. American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Other software used includes [[password]] security, [[disk encryption]], [[mindmapping]], desktop notes, [[word processing]], and [[email management]]. Some firms use modified versions of [[Open-source software|open source]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Steph Kimbro, [http://lawyerist.com/open-source-virtual-law-firm/ Open Source and the Virtual Law Firm] (May 3, 2011). Laywerist.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greg Lambert, [http://www.geeklawblog.com/2009/07/open-source-in-law-firms-unimaginable.html Open Source in Law Firms - Unimaginable or Brilliant?] (July 8, 2009), ''3 Geeks and a Law Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law firms also subscribe to a [[computer-assisted legal research]] database for [[legal research]]. Such databases provide [[case law]] from [[Law report|case reporters]], and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are [[Westlaw]] (part of [[West (publisher)|West]], which is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]) and [[LexisNexis]], but other databases also exist, such the free [[Google Scholar]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Carton, [http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2011/01/improved-google-scholar-becomes-more-useful-to-lawyers.html Improved Google Scholar More Useful to Lawyers] (January 18, 2011). ''Law.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geri L. Dreiling, [http://lawyertechreview.com/2011/how-to-use-google-scholar-for-legal-research/ How to Use Google Scholar for Legal Research] (May 11, 2011). ''Lawyer Tech Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtney Minick and David Tsai, [http://www.sfbar.org/articles/google_scholar.aspx Google Scholar:  A New Way to Search for Cases and Related Legal Publications]. [[Bar Association of San Francisco]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the newer [[Bloomberg Law]], as well as [[Loislaw]] (operated by [[Wolters Kluwer]]) and several smaller databases.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Schachner Chanen, [http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/exclusive_inside_the_new_westlaw_lexis_bloomberg_platforms/ Exclusive: Inside the New Westlaw, Lexis &amp; Bloomberg Platforms] (January 24, 2010). ''ABA Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alyssa Altshuler, [http://www.vsb.org/publications/valawyer/oct01/altshuler.pdf An Overview of Five Internet Legal Research Alternatives to Westlaw and LexisNexis] (October 2011). ''Virginia Lawyer''. Virginia State Bar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tami Kamin-Meyer, ''Westlaw Versus Lexis: The Debate Rages On'' (2008). ''Plaintiff''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Document automation has also become a crucial part of legal practice management, with companies like Thomson Reuters,  HotDocs (acquired by AbacusNext)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/sites/legaltechnews/2017/11/13/abacusnext-acquires-document-automation-company-hotdocs/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=35e92ab8-ab46-45b4-86d7-ce963c2f8ec8&lt;/ref&gt; and HelpSelf Legal (web-based platform)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.helpselflegal.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/helpself-uses-simple-ai-to-help-those-in-legal-trouble/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt; providing document automation services that allow lawyers to customize their own interview workflows to merge into legal documents.  These and other sites are incorporating artificial intelligence into their document automation software.&lt;ref&gt;https://mashable.com/2017/12/15/artificial-intelligence-domestic-violence-restraining-orders/#GdGZX570Xmqi&lt;/ref&gt;.  

These document automation tools allow any lawyer to create their own workflows, in the same way that companies like LegalZoom and RocketLawyer offer standardized automated document production for individuals and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-buy-legal-documents-online-without-reading-this-story-2015-11-23 Article:Don’t buy legal documents online without reading this story]&lt;/ref&gt;.  Some [[bar association]]s and lawyers' organizations have their own software; for example, the American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys' CounselPro program is designed for [[estate planning]] lawyers and assists in producing [[Will (law)|wills]], [[Trust law|trusts]], and other [[legal document]]s, as well as other documents such as thank-you letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx/ American Academy of Estate Planning Attorneys] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125101/http://www.aaepa.com/cpdf.aspx |date=2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firm personnel===
[[Human resource management]] (managing personnel) is an important aspect of law practice management, and many books and other resources offer advice to firms on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v35_is7_pg34.html Resources for Managing Law Firm Personnel - Shape Up! Practice Management Tips for 2010] (November/December 2009). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 35, No. 7, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Law firms often employ a number of non-legal personnel or support staff; according to one figure, the average attorney to non-attorney ratio is 1 to 1.3.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm? (2005). Freedman Consulting, Inc. (version of article originally appearing in the ''Pennsylvania Lawyer'' (March/April 2001 issue).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many firms and other organizations employ a professional non-attorney legal administrator, or law firm administrator, to manage non-attorney personnel and the administrative aspects of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [http://nysbar.com/blogs/Tipoftheweek/2010/02/role_of_law_firm_administrator.html Role of Law Firm Administrator] (February 18, 2010). ''Law Practice Management Tip of the Week''. [[New York State Bar Association]], Committee on Law Practice Management.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[professional association]] for legal administrators is the Association of Legal Administrators (ALA), founded in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alanet.org/about/ About ALA], Association of Legal Administrators.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past two decades, the role of legal administrator has changes as duties have expanded and become more complex, and as more firms hired administrators; the ALA grew from less than a thousand members in 1976 to over 8,000 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weilandco.com/new/article.html Deciding When And How To Effectively Use A Legal Administrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110031330/http://weilandco.com/new/article.html |date=2012-01-10 }}, John P. Weil &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ALA, in 2007 some 76 percent of legal administrators were women in their 40s and 50s. The main duties of legal administrators are the financial, operation, and human resource management of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ott Mayer, [http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/stories/2007/04/30/focus3.html Role of legal administrators changing as duties expand, become more complex] (April 29, 2007). ''Memphis Business Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Denney, [http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v34_is3_pg35.html Evolution of the Professional Administrator] (April/May 2008). ''Law Practice'' Vol. 34, No. 3, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Smith and Ashby Jones, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303630404577388180888033106 Practicing Business: Professional Managers Gain Wider Presence at Law Firms] (May 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

A legal administrator is similar to an [[office manager]] or [[executive director]], but often with some expanded duties. Depending on the size, needs, and type of law firm, the firm may employ a separate [[database manager]], [[network administrator]], [[marketing director]], [[computer systems]] or [[Information technology management|information technology manager]], [[bookkeeper]], [[accounts payable]] and [[accounts receivable]] clerk, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Freedman, How Many Non-Lawyers Does It Take to Run a Law Firm?

'''Microforms''' are scaled-down reproductions of documents, typically either [[photographic film|films]] or paper, made for the purposes of transmission, storage, reading, and printing. Microform images are commonly reduced to about one twenty-fifth of the original document size. For special purposes, greater optical reductions may be used.

All microform images may be provided as positives or negatives, more often the latter.

Three formats are common: '''microfilm''' (reels), '''microfiche''' (flat sheets), and [[aperture card]]s. '''Microcards''', a format no longer produced, were similar to microfiche, but printed on cardboard rather than photographic film.

==History==
{{Expert needed|Libraries|section|talk=Microform from the 1940s onward|date=April 2015}}
Using the [[daguerreotype]] process, [[John Benjamin Dancer]] was one of the first to produce [[microphotograph]]s, in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He achieved a reduction ratio of 160:1. Dancer perfected his reduction procedures with [[Frederick Scott Archer]]'s wet [[collodion process]], developed in 1850–51, but he dismissed his decades-long work on microphotographs as a personal hobby, and did not document his procedures. The idea that microphotography could be no more than a novelty was an opinion shared by the 1858 ''Dictionary of Photography,'' which called the process "somewhat trifling and childish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sutton, Thomas |chapter=Microphotography |editor=Veaner, Allen B. |title=Studies in micropublishing, 1853–1976: documentary sources |publisher=Microform Review Inc |location=Westport, Conn |year=1976 |page=88 |isbn=0-913672-07-6 }} Originally published in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DXQCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA295 Dictionary of Photography]'' (1858).&lt;/ref&gt;

Microphotography was first suggested as a document preservation method in 1851 by [[James Glaisher]], an astronomer, and in 1853 by [[John Herschel]]. Both men attended the 1851 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] in London, where the exhibit on photography greatly influenced Glaisher. He called it "the most remarkable discovery of modern times", and argued in his official report for using microphotography to preserve documents.&lt;ref&gt;''Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations 1851.  Reports by the Juries on the Subject in the Thirty Classes into which the Exhibition was Divided.'' (London: John Weale, 1852).&lt;/ref&gt;

The developments in microphotography continued through the next decades, but it was not until the turn of the century that its potential for practical usage was seized by a wider audience. In 1896, Canadian engineer [[Reginald A. Fessenden]] suggested microforms were a compact solution to engineers' unwieldy but frequently consulted materials.  He proposed that up to 150,000,000 words could be made to fit in a square inch, and that a one-foot cube could contain 1.5 million volumes.&lt;ref name=Meckler82/&gt;

In 1906, [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Robert Goldschmidt]] proposed the ''livre microphotographique'' as a way to alleviate the cost and space limitations imposed by the [[codex]] format.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldschmidt and Paul Otlet, ''Sur une forme nouvelle du livre— le livre microphotographique,'' L'Institut international de bibliographie, Bulletin, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;  Otlet’s overarching goal was to create a World Center Library of Juridical, Social and Cultural Documentation, and he saw microfiche as a way to offer a stable and durable format that was inexpensive, easy to use, easy to reproduce, and extremely compact.  In 1925, the team spoke of a massive library where each volume existed as master negatives and positives, and where items were printed on demand for interested patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Goldschmidt and Paul Otlet, "La Conseration et la Diffusion Internationale de la Pensée."  Publication no. 144 of the Institut International de Bibliographie (Brussels).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s microfilm began to be used in a commercial setting. New York City banker George McCarthy was issued a patent in 1925 for his "Checkograph" machine, designed to make micrographic copies of cancelled checks for permanent storage by financial institutions. In 1928, the [[Eastman Kodak Company]] bought McCarthy's invention and began marketing check microfilming devices under its "Recordak" division.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;[http://www.heritagearchives.org/history.html "Brief History of Microfilm,"] Heritage Microfilm, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1927 and 1935, the [[Library of Congress]] microfilmed more than three million pages of books and manuscripts in the [[British Library]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saffady|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1929 the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] joined to create a Joint Committee on Materials for Research, chaired for most of its existence by [[Robert C. Binkley]], which looked closely at microform’s potential to serve small print runs of academic or technical materials. In 1933, Charles C. Peters developed a method to microformat dissertations, and in 1934 the United States [[National Agriculture Library]] implemented the first microform print-on-demand service, which was quickly followed by a similar commercial concern, Science Service.&lt;ref name=Meckler82&gt;{{cite book |author=Meckler, Alan M. |title=Micropublishing: a history of scholarly micropublishing in America, 1938–1980 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, CT |year=1982 |isbn=0-313-23096-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Kodak's Recordak division began filming and publishing ''[[The New York Times]]'' on reels of 35 millimeter microfilm, ushering in the era of newspaper preservation on film.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; This method of information storage received the sanction of the [[American Library Association]] at its annual meeting in 1936, when it officially endorsed microforms.

[[Harvard University Library]] was the first major institution to realize the potential of microfilm to preserve [[broadsheet]]s printed on high-acid newsprint and it launched its "Foreign Newspaper Project" to preserve such ephemeral publications in 1938.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; Roll microfilm proved far more satisfactory as a storage medium than earlier methods of film information storage, such as the Photoscope, the Film-O-Graph, the Fiske-O-Scope, and filmslides.

The year 1938 also saw another major event in the history of microfilm when [[University Microfilms International]] (UMI) was established by [[Eugene Power]].&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; For the next half century, UMI would dominate the field, filming and distributing microfilm editions of current and past publications and academic dissertations. After another short-lived name change, UMI was made a part of [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]] in 2001.

Systems that mount microfilm images in [[punched card]]s have been widely used for archival storage of engineering information.

For example, when [[airline]]s demand archival engineering drawings to support purchased equipment (in case the vendor goes out of business, for example), they normally specify punch-card-mounted microfilm with an industry-standard indexing system punched into the card. This permits automated reproduction, as well as permitting mechanical card-sorting equipment to sort and select microfilm drawings.

Aperture card mounted microfilm is roughly 3% of the size and space of conventional paper or vellum engineering drawings. Some military contracts around 1980 began to specify digital storage of engineering and maintenance data because the expenses were even lower than microfilm, but these programs are now finding it difficult to purchase new readers for the old formats.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Microfilm first saw military use during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71. During the [[Siege de Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]], the only way for the provincial government in [[Tours]] to communicate with Paris was by [[pigeon post]]. As the pigeons could not carry paper dispatches, the Tours government turned to microfilm. Using a microphotography unit evacuated from [[Paris]] before the siege, clerks in Tours photographed paper dispatches and compressed them to microfilm, which were carried by homing pigeons into Paris and projected by [[magic lantern]] while clerks copied the dispatches onto paper.&lt;ref name=ucla&gt;{{cite web|work=The History of Microfilm: 1839 To The Present|title=The Pigeon Post into Paris 1870–1871 |url=http://www.srlf.ucla.edu/exhibit/text/hist_page4.htm |publisher=University of California, Southern Regional Library Facility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the US [[V-mail|Victory Mail]], and the British "Airgraph" system it was based on, were used for delivering mail between those at home and troops serving overseas during [[World War II]]. The systems worked by photographing large amounts of [[Postal censorship|censored mail]] reduced to thumb-nail size onto reels of microfilm, which weighed much less than the originals would have. The film reels were shipped by priority air freight to and from the home fronts, sent to their prescribed destinations for enlarging at receiving stations near the recipients, and printed out on lightweight photo paper. These facsimiles of the [[Letter sheet|letter-sheets]] were reproduced about one-quarter the original size and the miniature mails were then delivered to the addressee. Use of these microfilm systems saved significant volumes of cargo capacity needed for vital war supplies. An additional benefit was that the small, lightweight reels of microfilm were almost always transported by air, and as such were delivered much more quickly than any surface [[mail]] service could have managed.

[[Libraries]] began using microfilm in the mid-20th century as a preservation strategy for deteriorating newspaper collections. Books and newspapers that were deemed in danger of decay could be preserved on film and thus access and use could be increased. Microfilming was also a space-saving measure. In his 1945 book, ''The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library'', [[Fremont Rider]] calculated that research libraries were doubling in space every sixteen years.  His suggested solution was microfilming, specifically with his invention, the microcard. Once items were put onto film, they could be removed from circulation and additional shelf space would be made available for rapidly expanding collections. The microcard was superseded by microfiche. By the 1960s, microfilming had become standard policy.

Around the same time, Licensed Betting Offices in the UK began using microphotography as a means of keeping compact records of bets taken.  Betting shop customers would sometimes attempt to amend their betting slip receipt to attempt fraud, and so the microphotography camera (which also generally contained its own independent time-piece) found use as a definitive means of recording the exact details of each and every bet taken.  The use of microphotography has now largely been replaced by digital 'bet capture' systems, which also allow a computer to settle the returns for each bet once the details of the wager have been 'translated' into the system by an employee.  The added efficiency of this digital system has ensured that there are now very few, if indeed any, betting offices continuing to use microfilm cameras in the UK.

[[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[National City Corp.|National City]] use microfilm (roll microfilm and fiche) to store financial, personal, and legal records.

[[Source code]] for computer programs was printed to microfiche during the 1970s and distributed to customers in this form.

Additionally, microfiche was used to write out long casework for some proofs such as the [[four color theorem]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Advantages==
The medium has numerous advantages:
* It enables libraries to greatly expand access to collections without putting rare, fragile, or valuable items at risk of theft or damage.
* It is compact, with far smaller storage costs than paper documents. Normally 98 document size pages fit on one fiche, reducing to about 0.25% original material.  When compared to filing paper, microforms can reduce space storage requirements by up to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saffady|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is cheaper to distribute than paper copy. Most microfiche services get a bulk discount on reproduction rights, and have lower reproduction and carriage costs than a comparable amount of printed paper.
* It is a stable archival form when properly processed and stored. Preservation standard microfilms use the [[silver halide]] process, creating [[silver]] images in hard [[gelatin]] emulsion on a [[polyester]] base. With appropriate storage conditions, this film has a life expectancy of 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saffady|2000|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in tropical climates with high humidity, [[fungus]] eats the gelatin used to bind the silver halide. Thus, [[diazo]]-based systems with lower archival lives (20 years) which have polyester or [[epoxy]] surfaces are used.
* Since it is analog (an actual image of the original data), it is easy to view. Unlike [[Digital data|digital]] media, the format requires no software to decode the data stored thereon. It is instantly comprehensible to persons literate in the written language; the only equipment that is needed is a simple magnifying glass. This eliminates the problem of software obsolescence.
* It is virtually impossible to mutilate.  Users cannot tear pages from or deface microforms.
* It has low intrinsic value and does not attract thieves.  Few heavily used microform collections suffer major losses due to theft.
* Prints from microfilm are accepted in legal proceedings as substitutes for original documents.

==Disadvantages==
* The principal disadvantage of microforms is that the image is (usually) too small to read with the naked eye and requires analog or digital magnification to be read.
* Reader machines used to view microform are often difficult to use; microfiche is very time consuming and microfilm requires users to carefully wind and rewind until they have arrived at the point where the data they are looking for is stored.
* Photographic illustrations reproduce poorly in microform format, with loss of clarity and halftones. The latest electronic digital viewer/scanners can scan in gray shade, which greatly increases the quality of photographs; but the inherent bi-tonal nature of microfilm limits its ability to convey much subtlety of tone.
* Reader-printers are not always available, limiting the user's ability to make copies for their own purposes.  Conventional photocopy machines cannot be used.&lt;ref name="Sanders-Martin"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sanders, Mark |author2=Martin, Mark |title=Extra!  Extra!  Read all about it!  Newspaper access in the academic library |journal=Louisiana Libraries |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=18–24 |date=Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Color microform is extremely expensive, thus discouraging most libraries supplying color films.  Color photographic dyes also tend to degrade over the long term.  This results in the loss of information, as color materials are usually photographed using black and white film.&lt;ref name="Sanders-Martin" /&gt; The lack of quality and color images in microfilm, when libraries were discarding paper originals, was a major impetus to [[Bill Blackbeard]] and other comic historians' work to rescue and maintain original paper archives of color pages from the history of newspaper comics.  Many non-comics color images were not targeted by these efforts and were lost.
* When stored in the highest-density drawers, it is easy to misfile a fiche, which is thereafter unavailable. As a result, some libraries store microfiche in a restricted area and retrieve it on demand.  Some fiche services use lower-density drawers with labeled pockets for each card.
* Like all analog media formats, microfiche is lacking in features enjoyed by users of digital media.  Analog copies degrade with each generation, while some digital copies have much higher copying fidelity. Digital data can also be indexed and searched easily.
* Reading microfilms on a machine for some time may cause headache and/or eyestrain.

==Readers and printers==
[[File:Library microfiche reader.jpg|thumb|A microfiche reader in a library]]
Desktop readers are boxes with a translucent screen at the front on to which is projected an image from a microform.  They have suitable fittings for whatever microform is in use. They may offer a choice of magnifications. They usually have motors to advance and rewind film.  When coding blips are recorded on the film a reader is used that can read the blips to find any required image.

Portable readers are plastic devices that fold for carrying; when open they project an image from microfiche on to a reflective screen. For example, with [[M. de Saint Rat]], [[Atherton Seidell]] developed a simple, inexpensive ($2.00 in 1950), monocular microfilm viewing device, known as the "Seidell viewer", that was sold during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seidell Microfilm Viewer in Production |journal=American Documentation |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=118 |date=April 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A microfilm printer contains a xerographic copying process, like a [[photocopier]]. The image to be printed is projected with synchronised movement on to the drum. These devices offer either small image preview for the operator or full size image preview, when it is called a reader printer.  Microform printers can accept positive or negative films and positive or negative images on paper.  New machines allow the user to scan a microform image and save it as a digital file: see the section below on digital conversion.

=== Flat film ===

105 x 148&amp;nbsp;mm flat film is used for micro images of very large engineering drawings. These may carry a title photographed or written along one edge. Typical reduction is about 20, representing a drawing that is 2.00 x 2.80 metres, that is 79 x 110 in. These films are stored as microfiche.

=== Microfilm ===

[[16 mm film|16 mm]] or [[35 mm film]] to [[motion picture]] standard is used, usually unperforated. Roll microfilm is stored on open reels or put into cassettes.  The standard lengths for using roll film is 30.48&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) for 35mm rolls, and 100&amp;nbsp;ft, 130&amp;nbsp;ft and 215 feet for 16mm rolls. One roll of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film may carry 600 images of large engineering drawings or 800 images of broadsheet newspaper pages. 16&amp;nbsp;mm film may carry 2,400 images of letter sized images as a single stream of micro images along the film set so that lines of text are parallel to the sides of the film or 10,000 small documents, perhaps cheques or betting slips, with both sides of the originals set side by side on the film.

=== Aperture cards ===

[[Aperture card]]s are [[Punched card#Card formats|Hollerith cards]] into which a hole has been cut. A 35&amp;nbsp;mm microfilm chip is mounted in the hole inside of a clear plastic sleeve, or secured over the aperture by an adhesive tape.  They are used for engineering drawings, for all engineering disciplines. There are libraries of these containing over 3 million cards. Aperture cards may be stored in drawers or in freestanding rotary units.

=== Microfiche ===

[[File:Microfiche_holder.jpg|thumb|alt=Microfiche|A Microfiche holder with microfiches]]
A microfiche is a sheet of flat film, 105 x 148&amp;nbsp;mm in size, the same size as the international standard for paper size [[paper size|ISO A6]]. It carries a matrix of micro images. All microfiche are read with their text parallel to the long side of the [[wikt:fiche|fiche]]. Frames may be [[Page orientation|landscape or portrait in orientation]]. Along the top of the fiche a title may be recorded for visual identification. 

The most commonly used format is a portrait image of about 10 x 14&amp;nbsp;mm. Office-size papers or magazine pages require a reduction of 24 or 25 in size. Microfiche are stored in open-top envelopes which are put in drawers or boxes as [[index cards|file cards]], or fitted into pockets in purpose-made books.

=== Ultrafiche ===

(also 'ultramicrofiche') is an exceptionally compact version of a microfiche or microfilm, storing analog data at much higher densities. Ultrafiche can be created directly from computers using appropriate peripherals. They are typically used for storing data gathered from extremely data-intensive operations such as remote sensing.

==Image creation==
To create microform media, a planetary [[camera]] is mounted with the vertical axis above a copy that is stationary during exposure. High volume output is possible with a rotary camera which moves the copy smoothly through the camera to expose film which moves with the reduced image. Alternatively, it may be produced by computers, i.e. COM (computer output microfilm).

===Film===
Normally microfilming uses high resolution [[panchromatic]] monochrome stock. Positive color film giving good reproduction and high resolution can also be used. Roll film is provided 16, 35 and 105&amp;nbsp;mm wide in lengths of 30 metres (100&amp;nbsp;ft) and longer, and is usually unperforated. Roll film is developed, fixed and washed by continuous processors.

Sheet film is supplied in ISO A6 size. This is either processed by hand or using a dental X-ray processor. Camera film is supplied ready mounted in aperture cards. Aperture cards are developed, fixed and washed immediately after exposure by equipment fitted to the camera.

Early cut sheet microforms and microfilms (to the 1930s) were printed on [[nitrate film]], which poses high risks to their holding institutions, as nitrate film is explosive and flammable. From the late 1930s to the 1980s, microfilms were usually printed on a [[cellulose acetate]] base, which is prone to tears, [[vinegar syndrome]], and redox blemishes.  Vinegar syndrome is the result of chemical decay and produces "buckling and shrinking, embrittlement, and bubbling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/mfir.1994.23.1.15 |author=Bourke, Thomas A. |title=The Curse of Acetate; or a Base conundrum Confronted |journal=Microform Review |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=15–17 |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Redox blemishes are yellow, orange or red spots 15–150 micrometres in diameter created by oxidative attacks on the film, and are largely due to poor storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saffady|2000|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cameras===
;Flat film
The simplest microfilm camera that is still in use is a rail mounted structure at the top of which is a bellows camera for 105 x 148&amp;nbsp;mm film. A frame or copy board holds the original drawing vertical. The camera has a horizontal axis which passes through the center of the copy. The structure may be moved horizontally on rails.

In a [[darkroom]] a single film may be inserted into a dark slide or the camera may be fitted with a roll film holder which after an exposure advances the film into a box and cuts the frame off the roll for processing as a single film.

;Roll film
For engineering drawings a freestanding open steel structure is often provided. A camera may be moved vertically on a track. Drawings are placed on a large table for filming, with centres under the lens. Fixed lights illuminate the copy. These cameras are often over '''4''' metres (10&amp;nbsp;feet) high. These cameras accept roll film stock of 35 or 16&amp;nbsp;mm.

For office documents a similar design may be used but bench standing. This is a smaller version of the camera described above. These are provided either with the choice of 16 or 35&amp;nbsp;mm film or accepting 16&amp;nbsp;mm film only. Non adjustable versions of the office camera are provided. These have a rigid frame or an enveloping box that holds a camera at a fixed position over a copy board. If this is to work at more than one reduction ratio there are a choice of lenses.

Some cameras expose a pattern of light, referred to as blips, to digitally identify each adjacent frame. This pattern is copied whenever the film is copied for searching.

;Flow roll film cameras
A camera is built into a box. In some versions this is for bench top use, other versions are portable. The operator maintains a stack of material to be filmed in a tray, the camera automatically takes one document after another for advancement through the machine. The camera lens sees the documents as they pass a slot. Film behind the lens advances exactly with the image.

Special purpose flow cameras film both sides of documents, putting both images side by side on 16&amp;nbsp;mm film. These cameras are used to record cheques and betting slips.

;Microfiche camera
All microfiche cameras are planetary with a step and repeat mechanism to advance the film after each exposure. The simpler versions use a dark slide loaded by the operator in a dark room; after exposure the film is individually processed, which may be by hand or using a dental X-ray processor. Cameras for high output are loaded with a roll of 105&amp;nbsp;mm film. The exposed film is developed as a roll; this is sometimes cut to individual fiche after processing or kept in roll form for duplication.

;Computer Output Microfilm
[[File:COM card.JPG|left|thumb|Computer Output Microfilm card]]
Equipment is available that accepts a data stream from a mainframe computer. This exposes film to produce images as if the stream had been sent to a line printer and the listing had been microfilmed. Because of the source one run may represent many thousands of pages.

Within the equipment character images are made by a light source; this is the negative of text on paper. COM is sometimes processed normally. Other applications require that image appears as a conventional negative; the film is then reversal processed. This outputs either 16&amp;nbsp;mm film or fiche pages on a 105&amp;nbsp;mm roll.

Because listing characters are a simple design, a reduction ratio of 50 gives good quality and puts about 300 pages on a microfiche. A microfilm plotter, sometimes called an aperture card plotter, accepts a stream that might be sent to a computer pen plotter. It produces corresponding frames of microfilm. These produce microfilm as 35 or 16&amp;nbsp;mm film or aperture cards.

==Duplication==
All regular microfilm copying involves contact exposure under pressure. Then the film is [[Photographic processing|processed]] to provide a permanent image. Hand copying of a single fiche or aperture card involves [[Contact print|exposure]] over a light box and then individually processing the film. Roll films are contact exposed via motor, either round a glass cylinder or through a vacuum, under a controlled light source.  Processing may be in the same machine or separately.

[[Silver halide]] film is a slow version of camera film with a robust top coat. It is suitable for prints or for use as an intermediate from which further prints may be produced. The result is a negative copy.  Preservation standards require a master negative, a duplicate negative, and a service copy (positive).  Master negatives are kept in deep storage, and duplicate negatives are used to create service copies, which are the copies available to researchers.  This multi-generational structure ensures the preservation of the master negative.

[[Diazo dye|Diazo]]-sensitised film for dye coupling in [[ammonia]] gives blue or black dye positive copies. The black image film can be used for further copying.

Vesicular film is sensitised with a diazo dye, which after exposure is developed by heat. Where light has come to the film remains clear, in the areas under the dark image the diazo compound is destroyed quickly, releasing millions of minute bubbles of nitrogen into the film. This produces an image that diffuses light. It produces a good black appearance in a reader, but it cannot be used for further copying.

Modern microfilming standards require that a master set of films be produced and set aside for safe storage, used only to make service copies.  When service copies get lost or damaged, another set can be produced from the masters, thus reducing the image degradation that results from making copies of copies.

==Format conversion==
These conversions may be applied to camera output or to release copies. Single microfiche are cut from rolls of 105&amp;nbsp;mm film. A bench top device is available that enables an operator to cut exposed frames of roll film and fit these into ready made aperture cards.

Transparent jackets are made A5 size each with 6 pockets into which strips of 16&amp;nbsp;mm film may be inserted (or fewer pockets for 35&amp;nbsp;mm strips), so creating microfiche jackets or jacketed microfiche. Equipment allows an operator to insert strips from a roll of film. This is particularly useful as frames may be added to a fiche at any time. The pockets are made using a thin film so that duplicates may be made from the assembled fiche.

==Digital conversion==
Another type of conversion is microform to digital. This is done using an [[Image scanner|optical scanner]] that projects the film onto a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] array and captures it in a raw digital format. Until recently{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}, since the different types of microform are dissimilar in shape and size, the scanners were usually able to handle only one type of microform at a time. Some scanners offer swappable modules for the different microform types, and the latest viewer/scanner can accept any microform (roll, fiche, opaque cards, fiche, or aperture cards). [[Software]] (normally on the scanner itself, but more recently in an attached PC) is then used to convert the raw capture into a standard image format for archival.

The physical condition of microfilm greatly impacts the quality of the digitized copy.  Microfilm with a cellulose acetate base (popular through the 1970s) is frequently subject to [[vinegar syndrome]], redox blemishes, and tears, and even preservation standard [[silver halide]] film on a [[polyester]] base can be subject to silvering and degradation of the emulsion—all issues which affect the quality of the scanned image.

Digitizing microfilm can be inexpensive when automated scanners are employed.  The Utah Digital Newspapers Program has found that, with automated equipment, scanning can be performed at $0.15 per page.&lt;ref name="Arlitsch-Herbert"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Arlitsch, Kenning |author2=Herbert, John |title=Microfilm, Paper, and OCR: Issues in Newspaper Digitization |journal=Microform &amp; Imaging Review |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=59–67 |date=Spring 2004 |doi=10.1515/mfir.2004.59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent additions to the digital scanner field have brought the cost of scanning down substantially so that when large projects are scanned (millions of pages) the price per scan can be pennies.

Modern microform scanners utilize 8 bit gray shade scanning arrays and are thus able to provide quite high quality scans in a wealth of different digital formats: CCITT Group IV which is compressed black &amp; white -bitonal, JPG or JPEG which is gray or color compression, bitmaps which are not compressed, or a number of other formats such as PDF, LZW, GIF, etc.  These modern scanners are also able to scan at "Archival" resolution up to 600 dpi.

For the resulting files to be useful, they must be organized in some way. This can be accomplished in a variety of different ways, dependent on the source media and the desired usage. In this regard, [[Punched card#Card formats|aperture cards]] with Hollerith information are probably the easiest since image data can be extracted from the card itself if the scanner supports it. Often, the digital image produced is better than the visual quality available prescan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=Joe|title=Aperture Card Scanning|url=http://www.microcomseattle.com/solutions/document-scanning/aperture-card/|website=Micro Com Seattle|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of microfilm will contain a counter next to the images; these can be referenced to an already existing [[database]]. Other microfilm reels will have a 'blip' system: small marks next to the images of varying lengths used to indicate document hierarchy (longest: root, long: branch, short: leaf). If the scanner is able to capture and process these then the image files can be arranged in the same manner. [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) is also frequently employed to provide automated full-text searchable files. Common issues that affect the accuracy of OCR applied to scanned images of microfilm include unusual fonts, faded printing, shaded backgrounds, fragmented letters, skewed text, curved lines and bleed through on the originals.&lt;ref name="Arlitsch-Herbert" /&gt; For film types with no distinguishing marks, or when OCR is impossible (handwriting, layout issues, degraded text), the data must be entered in manually, a very time-consuming process.

==History of the site==
Mitla is one of many well-preserved archeological sites of the [[Valley of Oaxaca|Oaxaca Valley]], where the dry climate has conserved sites as old as 10,000 years. This valley was settled by the Zapotecs who over the centuries developed a hierarchical society governed by kings and nobles. While the valley was relatively isolated, the Zapotecs did have contacts with other [[Mesoamerica]]n peoples. By the time the Spanish arrived, the Zapotec state had a population of over 500,000, sophisticated construction techniques, a [[Mesoamerican writing systems#Zapotec writing|writing system]], two calendar systems and agriculture that included the growing of [[maize]], [[Common bean|beans]], [[Squash (plant)|squash]], and [[chili pepper]]s, using irrigation and terraces in the mountains to grow food for a mostly urban population.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt;

Mitla itself was inhabited at least since the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] (100-650 CE) and perhaps from as early as 900 BCE.&lt;ref name="2oaxmio"/&gt; It began as a fortified village on the outer edge of the valley and later became the main religious center for the area.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt; The [[Mixtec]]s took control of the area around 1000 CE, although the area remained populated by the Zapotec.&lt;ref name="zap"/&gt; The city reached its height and largest size between 750 and 1521,&lt;ref name="zap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2oaxmio"/&gt; with both Zapotec and Mixtec influences in its [[Mesoamerican architecture|architecture]] during that time.&lt;ref name="artes"/&gt;  Mitla is one of the pre-Columbian sites that represent the Mesoamerican belief that death was the most consequential part of life after birth. It was built as a gateway between the world of the living and the world of the dead.&lt;ref name="marin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquioaxaca.com/sitios/mitla.htm |title=Mitla:La Ciudad de los Muertos |first=Guillermo |last=Marín |date=2005-11-25 |publisher=Aquí Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mitla:The City of the Dead |accessdate=2009-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318043228/http://www.aquioaxaca.com/sitios/mitla.htm |archivedate=2010-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitla was still occupied and functioning as the main religious center when the Spanish arrived in the 1520s. The high priest, called the Uija-tào, resided at Mitla, and the Spanish likened him to the pope. Nobles buried at Mitla were destined to become “cloud people” who would intercede on behalf of the population below.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt; At that time the urban center covered an area of {{convert|1|to|2|km2|sqmi}} with suburban areas surrounding it. In the rural areas, intensive agriculture was practiced over an area of more than {{convert|20|km2|sqmi}} to feed the city.&lt;ref name="artes"/&gt;

During the early colonial period, some of the best descriptions of the site come from the soldiers and missionaries who arrived first in the valley. One of the first to write formally about Mitla was Friar [[Toribio de Benavente Motolina]] in the mid 16th century.  He states that the name meant “hell.”&lt;ref name="robles"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robles Garcia |first=Nelly M. |title=Viajeros y cronistas en la arqueología de Mitla, Oaxaca |trans-title=Travelers and chroniclers of the archeology of Mitla, Oaxaca |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |location=Mexico City |url=http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nMitla99.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103035056/http://arqueomex.com/S2N3nMitla99.html |archivedate=January 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the site held great political and religious significance for the area, most of the buildings suffered destruction, dismantling and sacking, with a few buildings spared.&lt;ref name="conservan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robles"/&gt; Some of the rooms of the site were inhabited by the Spanish clergy.&lt;ref name="sanchez"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mitla padece por el grafiti |first= Luis Carlos |last= Sánchez |url= http://www.exonline.com.mx/diario/noticia/comunidad/expresiones/mitla_padece_por_el_grafiti/712899 |newspaper= Excelsior |location= Mexico City |date= 2009-09-05 |accessdate= 2009-12-10 |language= Spanish |trans-title= Mitla suffering because of graffiti }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This destruction was ordered by Oaxacan Archbishop Albuquerque in 1553. The remains were used as building materials for churches, including the Church of San Pablo, which sits on top of part of the ruins. The north side of the Cathedral of Oaxaca also has design features from Mitla to symbolize the new religious order.&lt;ref name="marin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robles"/&gt;

In the state of Oaxaca, Mitla is second in importance as an archeological site only to Monte Alban.&lt;ref name="2oaxmio"/&gt; At the beginning of the 20th century, the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]] chose Mitla to be one of the emblematic symbols of pre-Hispanic Mexico for Centennial celebrations of Mexico’s Independence.&lt;ref name="conservan"/&gt; [[Alfonso Caso]], the archaeologist who excavated Monte Albán, also did work at Mitla in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-Caso-Alf.html |title=Alfonso Caso |publisher= The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition.  |accessdate=December 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitla has been the site of further excavations since the 1980s with important work done on the North Group as well as the colonial church around the start of the 20th century. For the [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010|bicentennial celebrations in 2010]], [[INAH]] has been intensifying efforts to conserve the ancient ruins.&lt;ref name="conservan"/&gt;

==Description of site==
Instead of being a group of [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] on a hill, as at Monte Albán, Mitla is a group of constructions built on the valley floor, and it lacks the wide and far vistas of Monte Alban. The architecture is geared more for the comfort of the residents than for magnificence.&lt;ref name="zwollo"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zwollo |first1=Tonny |title=Una Vez un Paraiso Arquitectura y Ecologia en el Valle de Oaxaca |trans-title=Once a Paradise:Architecture y Ecology of the Valley of Oaxaca |year=1993 |publisher= |location= |language=Spanish |isbn=90-801489-2-X |pages=47–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of Mitla as a ceremonial center began in 850, and the city was still being expanded when the Spaniards arrived and destroyed it.&lt;ref name="1siglo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mitla, patrimonio de la humanidad |author=Conaculta |url= http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/30877.mitla-patrimonio-de-la-humanidad.html |newspaper=ElSiglo de Torreón |location=Torreón, Coahuila |date=2003-05-11 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mitla, patrimony of humanity }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest group of buildings has been dated to between 450 and 700 CE and shows architectural features similar to those found at the earlier Monte Alban. Mitla is one of the few sites that originated in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]].&lt;ref name="marin"/&gt; The site represents the most developed architecture of the Zapotecs and is the product of the [[syncretism]] of Mixtec and Zapotec design features which reached its height in 1200. Such syncretism can also be seen in the Catholic churches built over the foundations of destroyed temples in this area, such as the San Pedro Church located in the North Group and the Calvario Chapel, located in the Adobe Group.&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite news |title= Arqueología y magia en la zona de Mitla |url= http://www.terra.com.mx/articulo.aspx?articuloid=125936  |newspaper=Terra |location=Mexico City |accessdate=December 10, 2009 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Archeology and magic in the zone of Mitla }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the stone walls appears to have been the same for all groups: a core of mud and stone covered with plaster or well-cut [[trachyte]] rock.&lt;ref name="zap"/&gt; Some of the large stones, such as those used as columns and lintels, weigh as much as 18 tons.&lt;ref name="1siglo"/&gt;

Today the archeological consists of five groups of buildings with a fence of cactus plants surrounding much of it.&lt;ref name="sanchez"/&gt; The five groups of constructions are called the South Group, the Adobe Group, the Arroyo Group, the Columns or Palace Group and the Church or North Group.&lt;ref name="2oaxmio"/&gt; All of the groups’ buildings are aligned with the cardinal directions.&lt;ref name="marin"/&gt; The South Group and the Adobe Group have been classified as ceremonial centers with central plazas surrounded by mound structures. The South, Columns and Church Groups have been classified as palaces with rooms surrounding square courtyards. The two best preserved groups are the Columns Group and the Church Group, both at the north end of the site.&lt;ref name="2oaxmio"/&gt;

The Columns Group and the Church Group were both fully excavated and restored by the early 1980s and are open to the public.&lt;ref name="zap"/&gt; Both consists of rectangular courtyards surrounded by one story rectangular buildings with long narrow rooms.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zap"/&gt;

===Church Group===
[[File:Mexico.Oax.Mitla.01.jpg|thumb|Church of San Pedro]]
The Church or North Group lies at the entrance to the site.&lt;ref name="1oaxmio"/&gt; In the 16th century, the Spanish built the Church of San Pablo here, which remains on top of a large pre-Hispanic platform which serves as the church [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. It was believed that in this group lived the lord and lady of the underworld, so the church was built here to keep the “devil” from escaping.&lt;ref name="marin"/&gt; The group also contains the main temple, called the ''yohopàe'', which translates to “house of the vital force.” This temple faces a large courtyard. The portal to the temple is flanked by two large columns, which leads into an antechamber. This antechamber once had a roof, supported by six columns, but only the columns and walls remain. Beyond the antechamber is the main one, where priests burned incense, made sacrifices and performed other rites. Behind the main chamber is the living quarters of the priests.&lt;ref name="stevens"/&gt; Walls everywhere in this building are covered by intricate mosaic fretwork and murals depicting mythological scenes and characters.&lt;ref name="terra"/&gt; There are tombs under some of the buildings. These tombs have stairs that descend from the patio area and have a cross layout. Inside they are decorated with mosaics. One of the tombs has an entrance that is divided by a thick column.  This column is popularly known as the "Columna de la Vida" (Column of Life). According to legend, one is supposed to wrap one's arms around the column, and the space remaining between the hands indicate the amount of life the individual has left.&lt;ref name="garza"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garza T. de Gonzalez |first1=Silvia |last2=Tommasi de Magrelli |first2=Wanda |title=Atlas Cultural de México Arqueología |trans-title=Cultural Atlas of Mexico - Archeology |year=1987 |publisher=SEP INAH and Grupo Editorial Planeta |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=968-406-039-4 |pages=75–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columns Group===
[[File:Mexico.Oax.Mitla.03.jpg|thumb|Part of the Columns Group]]
To the south of the Church Group is the Columns Group, whose main building is called the Palace.&lt;ref name="zap"/&gt; This group has two entrances to the outside that face south. The entrance room contains immense columns which support the roof. The north wall has a small opening facing the patio, supposedly for crossing into the afterlife.&lt;ref name="marin"/&gt; The main building is called the Palace or the Grand Hall of Columns. It measures {{convert|120|by|21|ft|m}} and has six columns of volcanic stone that once supported the roof.&lt;ref name="zap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2oaxmio"/&gt; After passing through a small corridor, access is gained to the courtyard, which is intricately decorated in mosaic fretwork and geometric designs. The north and east buildings of the group have elaborate tombs where high priests and Zapotec rulers were buried. In front of the stairs of the north building is a cross-shaped tomb with an antechamber. The ceiling has large beams made of stone and the walls are decorated with tablets and stone fretwork. The east building is characterized by a monolithic stone column which supports the roof.&lt;ref name="2oaxmio"/&gt;

===Friezes===
[[File:12-05oaxaca077.jpg|thumb|Close up of some of the fretwork]]
[[File:Ancient frescos in Mitla.JPG|thumb|Ancient frescos in Mitla]]
The main distinguishing feature of Mitla is the intricate mosaic fretwork and geometric designs that profusely adorn the walls of both the Church and Columns groups.&lt;ref name="artes"/&gt; The geometric patterns called ''grecas'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] seen on some of the stone walls and door frames are made from thousands of cut, polished stones that are fitted together without mortar.

==Conservation of the site==
The two main concerns for the Mitla site are the eroding effects of wind, rain etc. and graffiti.&lt;ref name="conservan"/&gt; The latter, which is mostly painted or etched, has been a serious problem at least since the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="conservan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sanchez"/&gt; To protect the ruins, especially the grecas, shelters have been constructed over a number of the rooms of the Palace or Columns Group. These shelters are palm thatched roofs supported by wooden beams and columns, and are intended to mimic roofs that were common in the Mesoamerican period.&lt;ref name="conservan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grecas"&gt;{{cite news |title= INAH protege grecas de Mitla |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/631490.html |agency=Notimex |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |language=Spanish |trans-title=INAH to protect the fretwork of Mitla }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconstruction projects planned or underway include, rebuilding the 17th century wall of a room used as a priests’ residence in the Church Group, laying stucco floors in the Columns Group, the sealing of platforms and fortifications walls, landscaping and the restoration of a colonial era rainwater collection tank. The last was the only one of its kind built in the valley during the colonial period.&lt;ref name="conservan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acciones"/&gt;

Mitla is one of the sites to be included in a planned program called the Archeology Corridor of Oaxaca Valley (Corredor Arqueológico del Valle de Oaxaca) with goals of maintaining and restoring ruins as well as making the site more accessible for visitors.&lt;ref name="acciones"/&gt; In addition, there are efforts to get the site of Mitla designated as a [[World Heritage site]] by archeologists such as Nelly Robles. It is listed on Mexico’s list of national heritage sites called the Lista Indicativa del Patromonio Nacional. The entry on the list includes the Mitla ruins along with the Tree of Tule and nearby caves which have paintings and show human habitation for 80,000 years.&lt;ref name="1siglo"/&gt;

==Tourism==
Mitla is the second most visited archeological site in the state of Oaxaca.&lt;ref name="conservan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acciones"/&gt; The Mitla site is very important to the modern town of San Pablo Villa de Mitla, as tourist related activities support most of the economy, but many residents here feel that neither the site or the town is promoted sufficiently by the government. Authorities who administer the site state that tourism is rising. Most visitors are Mexicans who visit on weekends from [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]] states, and most foreigners who visit are European. On average 500 people per day visit the site.&lt;ref name="ramirez"/&gt;

The '''Nooitgedacht Glacial Pavements''' comprise a geological feature between [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and [[Barkly West]], [[South Africa]], pertaining to the Palaeozoic-age [[Dwyka Group|Dwyka]] Ice Age, or [[Karoo Ice Age]], (some 300 million years ago) where the glacially scoured (smoothed and striated) ancient bedrock (re-exposed by erosion) was used, substantially more recently, during the [[Later Stone Age]] period in the late [[Holocene]] as panels for [[petroglyphs|rock engravings]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, T. &amp; Rubidge, B. 2005. The story of earth and life: a Southern African perspective on a 4.6-billion-year journey. Kumba Resources. p 195-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice Age==

Some 300-290 million years ago, during [[Dwyka Group|Dwyka]] times, what is now [[Southern Africa]] was, as a result of [[plate tectonics]], near the [[South Pole]] and large ice sheets or [[glaciers]] covered high-lying areas. Geologists term this upland the [[Cargonian Highlands]], stretching from what is now the [[Northern Cape]] through [[Gauteng]] to [[Mpumalanga]]. As the Dwyka glaciers moved, grinding their way southwards, the rocks and rubble that became embedded in their belly smoothed the underlying [[Andesite]] rock pavements and scoured out scratch marks, known as [[Glacial striation|striations]]. As the ice shaped the landscape, the continent of [[Gondwanaland]] continued to drift slowly northwards, ultimately bringing this area into warmer latitudes. As the glaciers melted, a mixture of clay and rock was left behind which eventually consolidated into a rock called [[Tillite]] – the lower-most layer in the [[Karoo sequence]]. Quite large erratics or drop stones carried here by glacial action are found at Nooitgedacht. The changing local environment also created conditions conducive for the burgeoning of life, reflected in the rich fossil record of the Karoo.

==River of diamonds==

Along this portion of its course, the adjacent [[Vaal River]], and earlier generations of rivers and erosion processes, have cut through and swept away a vast mass of Karoo rock and sediment, to re-expose the volcanic Andesite landscape formed 2.7 billion years ago and shaped by glacial action 300 million years ago. At one time – when the diamondiferous pipes penetrated to the surface between 120 and 90 million years ago – it is estimated that about 1&amp;nbsp;km of Karoo sediment overlay the Kimberley-Barkly West area. Diamonds were eroded out of these pipes and caught in pockets of sediment and gravels which, once discovered, changed the course of modern South African history.

Since 1869, the various gravels along the Vaal River have been worked intensively for their content of high-grade alluvial diamonds. The Nooitgedacht diggings were opened in 1949 and closed in 1981. During these 32 years, a total of 80 000 diamonds were found here. The [[Venter Diamond]], a {{convert|511|carat|g|adj=on}} yellow stone, was the largest. 

The standard size of a digger's claim was 15 x 15 metres. The diamond-bearing gravels, covered by a layer of sterile red sand, were washed by hand in simple rotary pans. The left-over concentrate of heavy material was then carefully sorted for diamonds. 

The search for diamonds continues along the Vaal River in the Windsorton, Barkly West and Delportshoop areas and further downstream. 

Diggings on Nooitgedacht itself were opened again in the late 1990s.

Some small-scale diggers in the region still use pick and shovel to eke out a meagre return, but miners using heavy earth-moving equipment obtain far better results. The impacts of this on the environment and on heritage resources are not small.

==Rock Art==

The images found on the andesite glacial pavements at Nooitgedacht are a form of rock art called rock engravings (the term [[petroglyph]] is also sometimes used). They were produced by pecking out the outlines or silhouettes of animals, or ‘geometric’ designs, with a pointed stone (there is no evidence that the artists used metal tools, nor indeed diamonds). They were made by ancestors of San and Khoe people, probably during the past 1500 years. The engravings include depictions of humans, eland, rhinoceros, ostrich, giraffe and anteater. The more abstract forms may depict bags and aprons, as well as ‘geometric’ images such as are common at other sites in the region, particularly [[Driekops Eiland]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

What these different images mean is subject to debate. One argument suggests that whereas sites such as the nearby Wildebeest Kuil, with its profusion of engravings of animals and some human figures, is  quintessentially San/hunter-gatherer in character, sites such as Nooitgedacht and [[Driekops Eiland]], where geometric engravings occur in great numbers, may belong to a different tradition of rock art, a separate Khoekhoe herder rock art tradition. A different perspective does not discount this possibility, but questions whether assigning variability in terms of ethnic or cultural differences in the first instance does not overlook other possible factors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} 

Research at Driekops Eiland suggests that sites such as this, and the ‘geometric’ engravings, bags and aprons present, may have been produced as part of girls’ coming-of-age rites, potentially across the spectrum of both San and Khoekhoe contexts, given the similarities in beliefs and ritual practices.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Diamond Fields Land Dispute==
[[File:Nicolaas Waterboer - Griqua leader and politician of the Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|[[Griqua people|Griqua]] leader and Captain, Nicolaas Waterboer]]
Various claims and counter claims to ownership of this territory were made following the discovery of diamonds in 1869-70. Nooitgedacht featured early on, when the Presidents of the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] Republics met here with the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] Chief [[Nicolaas Waterboer]] and his agent [[David Arnot (Griqua lawyer and diplomat)|David Arnot]], on 18 August 1870. [[File:David Arnot - Griqua agent and diplomat in the Cape Colony.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|David Arnot, [[Griqua people|Griqua]] lawyer and diplomat]]The Griqua representatives walked out in a huff and the Free State proclaimed the territory theirs. But this was not the end of the story, the dispute being settled eventually by the Keate Award (in favour of Waterboer, who placed himself under British protection), and the proclamation of the Crown Colony of [[Griqualand West]] on 27 October 1871.

==Preservation as Heritage Site==
The site was declared a National Monument in 1936 and under South Africa's Act 25 of 1999 is now a Grade 2 Provincial Heritage Site.

'''Philosophy and literature''' involves the [[literature|literary]] treatment of [[philosopher]]s and [[philosophy|philosophical]] themes (the literature of philosophy), and the philosophical treatment of issues raised by literature (the philosophy of literature).

[[Image:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|''[[The Clouds]]'' by [[Aristophanes]] presented [[Socrates]] as a comic figure.]]

==The philosophy of literature==
Strictly speaking, the philosophy of literature is a branch of [[aesthetics]], the branch of philosophy that deals with the question, "what is [[art]]"?  Much of aesthetic philosophy has traditionally focused on the plastic arts or [[music]], however, at the expense of the verbal arts.  In fact, much traditional discussion of aesthetic philosophy seeks to establish criteria of artistic quality that are indifferent to the subject matter being depicted.  Since all literary works, almost by definition, contain notional content, aesthetic theories that rely on purely formal qualities tend to overlook literature.

The very existence of [[narrative]] raises philosophical issues.  In narrative, a creator can embody, and readers be led to imagine, [[fiction]]al characters, and even [[fantasy|fantastic]] creatures or technologies.  The ability of the human mind to imagine, and even to experience [[empathy]] with, these fictional characters is itself revealing about the nature of the human mind.  Some fiction can be thought of as a sort of a [[thought experiment]] in [[ethics]]: it describes fictional characters, their [[Motivation|motive]]s, their actions, and the consequences of their actions.  It is in this light that some philosophers have chosen various narrative forms to teach their philosophy (''see below'').

===Literature and language===
[[Plato]], for instance, believed that literary culture and even the [[lyrics]] of [[popular music]] had a strong impact on the ethical outlook of its consumers.  In ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]'', Plato displays a strong hostility to the contents of the literary culture of his period, and proposes a strong [[censorship]] of popular literature in his [[utopia]].

More recently, however, philosophers of various stripes have taken different and less hostile approaches to literature.  Since the work of the [[British Empiricists]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] in the late eighteenth century, Western philosophy has been preoccupied with a fundamental question of [[epistemology]]: the question of the relationship between [[idea]]s in the human mind and the world existing outside the mind, if in fact such a world exists.  In more recent years, these epistemological issues have turned instead to an extended discussion of [[word]]s and meaning: can [[language]] in fact bridge the barrier between minds?  This cluster of issues concerning the meaning of language and of "[[writing]]s" sometimes goes by the name of ''the [[linguistic turn]]''.

As such, techniques and tools developed for [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] rose to greater prominence in Western philosophy of the late twentieth century.  Philosophers of various stripes paid more attention to literature than their predecessors did.  Some sought to examine the question of whether it was in fact truly possible to communicate using words, whether it was possible for an author's intended meaning to be communicated to a reader.  Others sought to use literary works as examples of contemporary [[culture]], and sought to reveal unconscious attitudes they felt present in these works for the purpose of social criticism.

===The truth of fiction===
Literary works also pose issues concerning [[truth]] and the [[philosophy of language]].  In educated opinion, at least, it is commonly reputed as true that ''[[Sherlock Holmes]] lived in London''. (see David Lewis 'Truth in Fiction', American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 15. No. 1, January 1978)  It is also considered true that ''[[Samuel Pepys]] lived in London''.  Yet Sherlock Holmes never lived anywhere at all; he is a fictional character.  Samuel Pepys, contrarily, is judged to have been a real person.  Contemporary interest in Holmes and in Pepys share strong similarities; the only reason why anyone knows either of their names is because of an abiding interest in reading about their alleged deeds and words.  These two statements would appear to belong to two different orders of truth.  Further problems arise concerning the [[truth value]] of statements about fictional worlds and characters that can be implied but are nowhere explicitly stated by the sources for our knowledge about them, such as ''Sherlock Holmes had only one head'' or ''Sherlock Holmes never travelled to the moon''.

==The literature of philosophy==

===Philosophical poems===
{{Literature}}
A number of [[poetry|poets]] have written poems on philosophical themes, and some important philosophers have expressed their philosophy in verse.  The [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] and the ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' of [[Lucretius]] are important philosophical poems. The genre of [[epic poetry]] was also used to teach philosophy. [[Vyasa]] narrated the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in order to teach [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]]. [[Homer]] also presented some philosophical teachings in his ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Many of the [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophers]] worked out their thought in poetical fashion. Some of the important names include:

* [[Vyasa]]
* [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi]]
* [[Omar Khayyám]]
* [[Nizami Ganjavi]]
* [[Saadi (poet)|Sheikh Saadi]]
* [[Hafez|Hafiz Shirazi]]
* [[Muhammad Iqbal]]
* [[Matsuo Bashō]]
* [[Farid ud-Din Attar]]
* [[Salah Abd El-sabur]]
* [[Mahmoud Darwish]]
* [[Karim Elsaiad]]

Notable Western [[philosophical poets]] include:

* [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]
* [[St. John of the Cross]]
* [[T. S. Eliot]]
* [[Hildegard von Bingen]]
* [[Homer]]
* [[John Milton]]
* [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]
* [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]]
* [[Marianne Moore]]
* [[Pablo Neruda]]
* [[William Carlos Williams]]
* [[Mary Oliver]]
* [[ Rainer Maria Rilke]]
* [[Leslie Marmon Silko]]
* [[Robert Creeley]]
* [[Fernando Pessoa]]
* [[Søren Kierkegaard]]
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
* [[Georges Bataille]]
* [[Lucretius]]

===Philosophical fiction===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Borges.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote philosophical fiction.]] --&gt;
Some philosophers have undertaken to write philosophy in the form of [[fiction]], including novels and short stories (see separate article on [[philosophical fiction]]).  This is apparent early on in the literature of philosophy, where philosophers such as [[Plato]] wrote [[dialogue]]s in which fictional or fictionalized characters discuss philosophical subjects; [[Socrates]] frequently appears as a protagonist in Plato's dialogues, and the dialogues are one of the prime sources of knowledge about Socrates' teaching, though at this remove it is sometimes hard to distinguish Socrates' actual positions from Plato's own. Numerous early Christian writers, including [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Boethius]], and [[Peter Abelard]] produced dialogues; several early modern philosophers, such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], wrote occasionally in this genre.

Other philosophers have resorted to [[narrative]] to get their teachings across. The classical 12th century [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]] (Ibn Tufail), wrote a fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic narrative]] ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then the 13th century [[Kalam|Islamic theologian]]-philosopher [[Ibn al-Nafis]] also wrote a fictional narrative ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a response to Abubacer's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] often articulated his ideas in literary modes, most notably in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', a re-imagined account of the teachings of [[Zoroaster]]. [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Ayn Rand]] wrote novels in which characters served as mouthpieces for philosophical positions, and act in accordance with them in the plot. [[George Santayana]] was also a philosopher who wrote novels and poetry; the relationship between Santayana's characters and his beliefs is more complex.  The [[existentialism|existentialists]] include among their numbers important [[French language|French]] authors who used fiction to convey their philosophical views; these include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s novel ''[[Nausea (Book)|Nausea]]'' and play ''[[No Exit]]'', and [[Albert Camus]]'s  ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''. [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s entire fictional production, whose titles include ''[[The Step Not Beyond]]'', ''[[The madness of the Day]]'', and ''[[The Writing of Disaster]]'', among others, constitutes an indispensable corpus for the treatment of the relationship between philosophy and literature. So does [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ''[[The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond]]''.

A number of philosophers have had important influence on literature.  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], largely as a result of his [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics|system of aesthetics]], is perhaps the most influential recent philosopher in the history of literature; [[Thomas Hardy]]'s later novels frequently allude to Schopenhauerian themes, particularly in ''[[Jude the Obscure]]''.  Schopenhauer also had an important influence on [[Joseph Conrad]].  Schopenhauer also had a less specific but more  widely diffused influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in European literature.  [[Lionel Johnson]] also refers to Schopenhauer's aesthetics in his essay ''The Cultured Faun''. [[Jacques Derrida]]'s entire oeuvre has been hugely influential for so-called continental philosophy and the understanding of the role of literature in modernity.

Other works of fiction considered to have philosophical content include:

*Abubacer, ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]''
*Albert Camus, ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Outsider]]''
*Joseph Conrad, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''
*Fyodor Dostoevsky, ''[[Crime and Punishment]]
*Jostein Gaarder, ''[[Sophie's World]]
* Hermann Hesse, ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]
*James Joyce, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''
*Franz Kafka, ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''
*Milan Kundera, ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''
*Ibn al-Nafis, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]''
*Thomas Mann, ''[[The Magic Mountain]]''
*Iris Murdoch, ''[[The Sea, the Sea]]''
*Robert M. Pirsig, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''
*Marcel Proust, ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]
*William Shakespeare, ''[[Hamlet]]''
*Leo Tolstoy, ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''
*Sergio Troncoso, ''[[The Nature of Truth]]''
*Marguerite Yourcenar, ''[[Memoirs of Hadrian]]''

===Philosophical writing as literature===
A number of philosophers are still read for the literary merits of their works apart from their philosophical content.  The philosophy in the ''[[Meditations]]'' of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] is unoriginal [[Stoicism]], but the ''Meditations'' are still read for their literary merit and for the insight they give into the workings of the emperor's mind.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy is noted for the quality and readability of its prose, as are some of the works of the [[British Empiricism|British Empiricists]], such as [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]].  [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s style is frequently regarded as poetic artistry as well as philosophical, especially in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Either/Or]]''.  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works such as ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' frequently resemble [[prose poetry]] and contain imagery and allusion instead of argument.

==Philosophy in literature==

===Philosophers in literature===
Socrates appears in a highly fictionalized guise, as a comic figure and the object of mockery, in ''[[The Clouds]]'' by [[Aristophanes]].  In the play, Socrates appears hanging from a basket, where he delivers oracles such as:

:I'd never come up with a single thing&lt;br&gt; about celestial phenomena,&lt;br&gt;if I did not suspend my mind up high,&lt;br&gt;to mix my subtle thoughts with what's like them—&lt;br&gt;the air. If I turned my mind to lofty things,&lt;br&gt;but stayed there on the ground, I'd never make&lt;br&gt;the least discovery. For the earth, you see,&lt;br&gt;draws moist thoughts down by force into itself—&lt;br&gt;the same process takes place with water cress.

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] is perhaps the twentieth century's preeminent author of philosophical fiction.  He wrote a short story in which the philosopher [[Averroes]] is the chief protagonist, ''[[Averroes's Search]]''.  Many plot points in his stories accurately paraphrase and epitomize the thought of major philosophers, including [[George Berkeley]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and [[Bertrand Russell]]; he also attributes various opinions to figures including [[George Dalgarno]].

A key plot point in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' turns on the discovery of a mysterious book that turns out to contain a lost manuscript by [[Aristotle]].  Eco's later novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum (book)|Foucault's Pendulum]]'' became the forerunner of a run of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s or [[detective fiction]] that toss around learned allusions and the names of historical thinkers; more recent examples include [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and ''[[The Rule of Four (book)|The Rule of Four]]'' by [[Ian Caldwell]] and [[Dustin Thomason]].

Also, [[Philip K. Dick]], who has often been compared to Borges, raises a significant number of philosophical issues in his novels, everything from the problem of [[solipsism]] to many questions of [[perception]] and [[reality]].

===Fictional philosophers===
Jorge Luis Borges introduces many philosophical themes, and a number of fictional philosophers, in his [[short story|short stories]].  A fictional philosophical movement is a part of the premise of his story ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', and the unnamed narrator of his story ''[[The Library of Babel]]'' could also be called a fictional philosopher.  A fictional [[theology|theologian]] is the subject of his story ''[[Three Versions of Judas]]''.

Fictional philosophers occasionally occur throughout the works of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].  Heinlein's ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' contains long passages that could be considered as successors to the fictionalized philosophical dialogues of the ancient world, set within the plot.

{{Roman Curia}}
{{Canon Law}}
The '''Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts''' is a [[dicastery]] of the [[Roman Curia]]. Its work "consists mainly in interpreting the laws of the Church". (''[[Pastor Bonus]]'', 154).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19880628_pastor-bonus-roman-curia_en.html#PONTIFICAL%20COUNCILS|title=Pastor Bonus, - John Paul II - Apostolic Constitution (June 28, 1988) {{!}} John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from the highest tribunal or court in the Church, which is the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], and does not have law-making authority to the degree the Pope and the Holy See's tribunals do. Its charge is the interpretation of existing canon laws, and it works closely with the Signatura and the other Tribunals and the Pope. Like the Signatura and the other two final appellate Tribunals, the Roman Rota and the Apostolic Penitentiary, it is led by a prefect who is a bishop or archbishop.

The current President of the Pontifical Council is Archbishop [[Filippo Iannone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/analysis-who-is-the-popes-new-canon-law-expert-57820 | title = Analysis: Who is the Pope’s new canon law expert? | accessdate = 27 October 2018 | date= 11 April 2018 | first = Andrea | last = Gagliarducci | work = Catholic News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current Secretary is Bishop [[Juan Ignacio Arrieta Ochoa de Chinchetru]].

==History and field of competence==

The Pontifical Commission for Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law that [[Pope Benedict XV]] established on 5 September 1917 continued in existence until replaced on 28 March 1963 by [[Pope John XXIII]]'s Pontifical Commission for the Revision of the Code of Canon Law, a revision called for by the [[Second Vatican Council]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] established on 11 July 1967 the Pontifical Commission for Interpretation of the Decrees of the Second Vatican Council and, two years later, extended its mandate to the interpretation also of the documents issued by the Holy See to implement those decrees.

On 2 January 1984, [[Pope John Paul II]] set up the Pontifical Commission for Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law, with competence regarding the new [[Code of Canon Law]] promulgated the year before and the universal laws for the [[Latin Rite]]. This Commission replaced those mentioned in the previous paragraph. On 28 June 1988, it was given its present name.

On 18 October 1990, its competence was extended to interpreting the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] and the laws shared in common by the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

==History==
===Colonial period===
During the slave period, slaves could sometimes be hired as prostitutes.&lt;ref name="plant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trotman|first1=David Vincent|title=Crime in Trinidad : conflict and control in a plantation society, 1838-1900|date=1986|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville, TN|isbn=978-0870494918|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the abolition of slavery (1838), many [[mulatto]] women became prostitutes or brothel madams, often moving from rural areas to towns such as Port of Spain.&lt;ref name="plant" /&gt;

In an effort to control the spread of [[sexually transmitted infections|STIs]] the Contagious Diseases Ordinance was introduced in 1869.&lt;ref name="plant" /&gt; This was based in the similar [[Contagious Diseases Acts|British Act of 1864]]. Prostitutes were required to be registered and have regular examinations for STIs.&lt;ref name="plant" /&gt; The ordinance was suspended in 1872 and reintroduced in 1875.&lt;ref name="plant" /&gt; The register showed a significant number of prostitutes to be working in Port of Spain and [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]].&lt;ref name="colonial" /&gt; Unscrupulous policemen took advantage of the ordinance to demand sexual favours. In  Port of Spain, a Sergeant Holder was given unlimited power to enforce the ordinance. He abused his position and, following an investigation brought about by a complaint, was dismissed from the force.&lt;ref name="plant" /&gt; The ordinance was abolished in 1887.&lt;ref name="plant" /&gt;

The sugar slump of the 1880s&lt;ref name="colonial" /&gt; brought many more women to the towns, turning to prostitution to try and make a living.&lt;ref name="plant" /&gt; At this time, Port of Spain was reported to have more prostitutes than any other town in the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name="colonial"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brereton|first1=Bridget|title=Race relations in colonial Trinidad, 1870-1900|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521523134|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the taverns in the town were brothels, and the best brothel was reputed to be the "British Coffee House", run by a Mrs Peery.&lt;ref name="plant" /&gt; Many of the prostitutes were underage and lived on the streets.&lt;ref name="colonial" /&gt;

===1930's===
During the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s, more women turned to prostitution. In his book, ''Calypso and Society'', [[Gordon Rohlehr]] noted: "Some singers, indeed, presented the vocation of prostitution as the only alternative to that of housewifery, and warned young girls against leaving their mothers' homes."&lt;ref name="expr"&gt;{{cite web|title='Tis the season for prostitution?|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/_Tis_the_season_for_prostitution_-116547743.html|website=The Trinidad Express|accessdate=4 January 2018|date=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)]] (1960) concluded: "Commercialised prostitution is not common as a profession in the West Indies. The high percentage of promiscuity in the Colonies puts prostitution into the category of a luxury profession. When this profession is followed, it is usually for economic reasons and because the wages earned by the woman in her other occupation are often too low to obtain the necessities of life for her."&lt;ref name="expr" /&gt;

===World War 2===
Prostitution was a boom industry in the 1940s after the allied troops, especially American, were stationed on the islands during [[WW2]],&lt;ref name="donald"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O6lYKkEakd8C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Prostitution%20in%20Trinidad%20and%20Tobago#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitution%20in%20Trinidad%20and%20Tobago&amp;f=false|title=Trinidad and Tobago: Democracy and Development in the Caribbean|first=Scott B.|last=MacDonald|date=1 January 1986|publisher=ABC-CLIO|accessdate=11 January 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780275920043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in wartime|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/commentaries/Women-in-wartime-232759751.html|website=The Trinidad Express|first=Bridget| last=Brereton |date=20 November 2013|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="essay"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinidad And Tobago By World War II History Essay|url=https://www.ukessays.com/essays/history/trinidad-and-tobago-by-world-war-ii-history-essay.php|website=UK Essays|accessdate=4 January 2018|date=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially around Port of Spain [[Arima]].&lt;ref name="brereton"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uNrUU360mzsC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Prostitution%20in%20Trinidad%20and%20Tobago#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitution%20in%20Trinidad%20and%20Tobago&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to the History of Trinidad and Tobago|first=Bridget|last=Brereton|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Heinemann|accessdate=11 January 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780435984748}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 100,000 troops,&lt;ref name="friend" /&gt; the construction workers building the new American bases at [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] and [[Waller Field]]&lt;ref name="donald" /&gt; added to the demand for prostitution.&lt;ref name="brereton" /&gt;

The spread of STIs was a problem in this era. The Governor of Trinidad and Tobago considered licencing the brothels in the country to ensure proper testing of the women, but this was never brought into force.&lt;ref name="friend"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCollin,|first1=Debbie|title=Friend or foe?

===Post WW2===
After the closure of the US Air base at Waller Field in 1949, the demand for prostitution dropped.&lt;ref name="essay" /&gt;

Sociologist Lloyd Braithwaite noted in his 1953 survey Social Stratification in Trinidad wrote: "In the lower-class sections of the town many well-known prostitutes abide, even though technically some have no fixed place of abode...the straitened and precarious economic circumstances that face working-class girls, particularly in the towns, must constantly make prostitution a temptation to them."&lt;ref name="expr" /&gt;

The demand for prostitutes further dropped when the US Naval base at Chaguaramas was scaled back in 1956 and finally closed in 1963.&lt;ref name="essay" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chagdev.com/Pages/Chag-HistoryChaguaramas.htm Chaguaramas History at the Chaguaramas Development Authority] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820034747/http://www.chagdev.com/Pages/Chag-HistoryChaguaramas.htm |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption==
The [[United States Department of State]] reports that prostitution is historically dependent on police corruption.&lt;ref name="state16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinidad and Tobago 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258880.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also corruption of immigration officials&lt;ref name="state16" /&gt; and police in regard to human trafficking.&lt;ref name="newsday1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; Police provide protection for brothels. Some moonlight at the brothels and provide tip-offs of raids.&lt;ref name="newsday1" /&gt; Part of their payment can be sex with the prostitutes.&lt;ref name="newsday1" /&gt;

In 2013, PC Valentine Eastman, a police officer for 23 years, was charged with 13&lt;ref name="ttguard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Sascha|title=Cop to stand trial on 13 charges of human trafficking|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2016-03-14/cop-stand-trial-13-charges-human-trafficking|website=The Trinidad Guardian Newspaper|accessdate=3 January 2018|date=16  March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; human trafficking charges around 3 Colombian women trafficked to a brothel in [[Marabella]].&lt;ref name="newsday1" /&gt; He was the first person in the [[British West Indies|British Caribbean]] to be charged with Human trafficking.&lt;ref name="newsday1" /&gt; In 2016 he was committed to High Court for trial.&lt;ref name="ttguard" /&gt;

===Female sex tourism===
Tobago is known as a destination for [[female sex tourism]].&lt;ref name="guard" /&gt; European and American women come to the island seeking local men.&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt; There is an organised tourist trade for the sex tourism; sometimes a local male is included in the price.&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt;

In 2016, Shadae Lamar Smith directed the short film ''The Resort'' based on sex tourism in Tobago. It was featured on [[Issa Rae]]'s [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Lauren R.D.|title=Issa Rae's #ShortFilmSundays Presents "The Resort," An Exposé On Sex Tourism|url=http://madamenoire.com/625550/sex-tourism/|website=Madame Noir|accessdate=23 December 2017|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago}}
[[Trinidad and Tobago]] is a destination, transit, and source country for adults and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls from the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Guyana]], Venezuela, and Colombia are subjected to sex trafficking in brothels and clubs, often lured by offers of legitimate employment, with young women from Venezuela especially vulnerable. NGOs have previously heard reports about the availability of [[child sex trafficking]] victims advertised through classified ads and children are subjected to sex trafficking for commercial sex by Trinbagonians and foreign sex tourists. International criminal organisations are increasingly involved in trafficking. Police corruption has in the past been associated with facilitating prostitution and sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trinidad and Tobago 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271301.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=3 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the victims of sex trafficking are brought into the country by boat, landing on southern peninsula of Trinidad in [[Icacos Point|Icacos]], [[Cedros, Trinidad and Tobago|Cedros]] and other neighbouring fishing villages.&lt;ref name="newsday1" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Trinidad and Tobago as a [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]] country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''Rational reconstruction''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] term with several distinct meanings. It is found in the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Imre Lakatos]].

== Habermas ==

For Habermas, rational reconstruction is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] method that systematically translates [[intuitive knowledge]] of rules into a [[logical form]].&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1979"&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas, Jürgen]]. (1979). ''Communication and the Evolution of Society.'' Toronto: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is an approach to [[science]] and philosophy which attempts to put meanings into language properly.

The type of formal analysis called rational reconstruction is used by Habermas to name the task that he sees as appropriate for [[philosophy]]. This mode of philosophical reflection can be compared to procedures traditionally taken up in philosophy and is concerned with the questions traditionally posed. That is, rational reconstruction involves making explicit and theoretically systematizing the universal and inescapable conditions for the possibility of certain types of phenomena. Put more specifically, it can be said that rational reconstruction is a manner of explicating the deep generative structures that give rise to and allow for particular performances, behaviours, and other symbolically pre-structured realities.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1979"/&gt;

{{quote|Once it has renounced its claim to be a first science or an [[encyclopedia]], philosophy can maintain its status within the scientific system neither by assimilating itself to particular exemplary sciences nor by the exclusive distancing of itself from science in general. Philosophy has to implicate itself in the fallibilistic self-understanding and procedural rationality of the empirical sciences; it may not lay claim to a privileged access to [[truth]], or to a method, an object realm, or even just a style of intuition that is specifically its own. Only thus can philosophy contribute its best to a nonexclusive division of labor, namely, its persistent tenacity in posing questions universalistically, and its procedure of rationally reconstructing the intuitive pretheoretical knowledge of competently speaking, acting and judging subjects. ... This dowry recommends philosophy as an indispensable partner in the collaboration of those who are concerned with [the progress of reason, knowledge and truth].|Habermas, 1992}}

Rational reconstruction is limited to the analysis of symbolically pre-structured realities because it is a procedure that is intimately tied to the interpretation of [[reality]] as opposed to its description. So, while the natural sciences generate theoretical knowledge about the general structures of an observable reality, rational reconstructions (sometimes called the reconstructive sciences) generate a theoretical knowledge of the deep structures of a reality accessible only through interpretation.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1979"/&gt; Some questions cannot be dealt with through the process of rational reconstruction, but an extremely broad range of questions can be. It is hard to point out a phenomenon that is not in some way symbolically pre-structured, that is without some meaning to someone.

While the meaning of any phenomenon must in some way be generated, and the interpretation of symbols is dependent upon intelligence, the bestowal of meaning is not arbitrary. Rational reconstruction attempts to make clear the underlying processes that generate particular meanings. It is concerned with the deep structures of [[intelligence]] that generate the knowledge, judgments and actions of subjects as well as the meaning, import and validity of objects. Because of this, those sciences that systematically explicate the intuitive knowledge of competent subjects by reconstructing the pretheoretical know-how of certain human capabilities can be seen as representative of this procedure of rational reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1979"/&gt;

Habermas suggests along these lines that "we can distinguish between know-how, the ability of a competent subject who understands how to produce or accomplish something, and know-that, the explicit knowledge of how it is that he is able to do so" (Habermas, 1979). This should be understood in the context of rational reconstruction as two levels of the explication of meaning, two ways of understanding a symbolically pre-structured reality. The difference between the two levels is, in Habermas's terms, the content and the intuitively master rule-consciousness that allows for it, or in other terms, surface structures and deep structures. It is worth quoting Habermas at length to clarify this. Here he is discussing these two levels of analysis as applied to the interpretation of a text:

"...the understanding of content pursues the connections that link the surface structures of an incomprehensible [symbolic] formation with surface structures, of other, familiar formations. Thus, linguistic expressions can be explicated through paraphrase in the same language [etc.]…. If she cannot attain her end in this way, the interpreter may find it necessary to alter her attitude. She then exchanges the attitude of understanding content (directed towards surface structures)…for an attitude in which she focuses on the generative structures of the expressions themselves. The interpreter then attempts to explicate the meaning of a symbolic formation with the help of the rules according to which the author must have produced it….The attitude changes as soon as the interpreter tries not only to apply the intuitive knowledge of speakers but to reconstruct it. She then turns away from the surface structure of the symbolic formation….She attempts instead to peer into the symbolic formation- penetrating through the surface as it were- in order to discover the rules according to which this symbolic formation was produced…. The object of understanding is no longer the content…but the intuitive rule consciousness. (Habermas, 1979)."

Furthermore, following this distinction between surface and deep structures, Habermas views the task of the reconstructive sciences as moving in two directions, horizontal and vertical. The "horizontal" direction seeks to reconstruct fundamental and important competencies, while the "vertical" direction seeks to reconstruct the (genetic) logic of the development of these competencies. So there are surface structures and deep structures related to competencies and sub-competencies, and these are teased apart and reconstructed by engaging two distinct modes of understanding symbolically pre-structured realities.

This should clarify what it is that rational reconstructions seek to accomplish. It should also be said that the results of systematized reconstructions claim to explicate "universal capabilities and not merely the particular competencies of individual groups" (Habermas, 1979). The theoretical claims of such rational reconstructions have the status of general theories of human competencies and behavior. "When the pretheoretical knowledge to be reconstructed expresses a universal capability, a general cognitive, linguistic, or interactive competence (or sub-competence), then what begins as an explication of meaning aims at the reconstruction of species competencies" (Habermas, 1979).

These kinds of rational reconstructions are notably different from the purely philosophical but comparable solutions and methods offered up as definitive answers to such issues in the past. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s transcendental analysis sought to deduce the categorical framework that structured and determined experience. [[Hegel]]'s dialectic sought to systematize the process of knowing, fitting each stage of insight as a defined moment to be subsumed in the development of [[absolute knowledge]]. These great systems were conceived as being [[A priori knowledge|a-priori]], inescapably generative of all experience and knowledge, and they were understood to be factual, to be the truth. Habermas sees rational reconstruction as a similar, but less grandiose, undertaking:

"Marked down in price the transcendental and dialectical modes of justification may still come in handy. All they can fairly be expected to furnish, however, is reconstructive hypotheses for use in empirical settings….[Rational reconstructions are] [[Fallibilism|fallibilistic]] in orientation, they reject the dubious faith in philosophy's ability to do things single handedly, hoping instead that the success that has for so long eluded it might come from an auspicious matching of different theoretical fragments (Habermas, 1990a)."

Furthermore:

"….[In rational reconstruction] the distinction between drawing on a-priori knowledge and drawing on [[a-posteriori]] knowledge becomes blurred. On the one hand, the rule consciousness [i.e. intuitive know-how] of competent subjects is for them an a-priori knowledge; on the other hand, the reconstruction of this calls for inquiries undertaken with empirical [methods] (Habermas, 1979)."

In this respect Habermas sees those theorists whose projects represented a blend of philosophy and scientific methods as important exemplars. He identifies [[Freud]], [[Durkheim]], [[Margaret Mead|Mead]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[Chomsky]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] as those who "inserted a genuinely philosophical idea like a detonator into a particular context of research…[initiating] paradigms in which a philosophical idea is present in embryo while at the same time empirical, yet universal, questions are being posed" (Habermas, 1990).&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1990"&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas, Jürgen]]. (1990). ''Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists approximated the ideal division of labor between philosophy and science that Habermas understands as crucial for progress to be achieved across disciplines; the human sciences in particular represent fertile ground for such cooperation.

== Lakatos ==
{{also|Historiographical internalism}}
Lakatos distinguishes between the "internal" and "external" history of science. Internal history focuses on normative concerns and the reasons scientists can be said to have for accepting or rejecting scientific theories according to some account of the logic of science. External history, on the other hand, focuses on the contingent non-rational factors that influenced the scientific process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos, Imre]]. (1970).

The '''San Diego Museum of Man''' is a [[museum]] of [[anthropology]] located in [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]], [[San Diego, California]] and housed in the historic landmark buildings of the [[California Quadrangle]].

==History==
The museum traces its origins to the [[Panama-California Exposition (1915)|Panama-California Exposition]], which opened in 1915 on the occasion of the inauguration of the [[Panama Canal]]. The central exhibit of the exposition, "The Story of Man through the Ages", was assembled under the direction of noted  [[archaeologist]] Dr. [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] of the School of American Archaeology (later renamed the School of American Research, and since 2007 the [[School for Advanced Research]]&lt;ref name="SanDiego"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofman.org/history|title=San Diego Museum of Man History - Balboa Park History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Hewett organized expeditions to gather pre-Columbian pottery from the [[American Southwest]] and to [[Guatemala]] for objects and reproductions of [[Maya stelae|Maya civilization monuments]].

Numerous other materials were gathered from expeditions sent by [[anthropologist]] [[Aleš Hrdlička]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], who gathered casts and specimens from Africa, Siberia, Alaska and [[Southeast Asia]]. Osteological remains and [[trepanation|trepanated crania]] from [[Peru]]vian sites were also obtained.&lt;ref name="Aboutthe"&gt;[http://www.museumofman.org/html/about_history.html "About the Museum — History"], San Diego Museum of Man (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Exposition drew to a close, a group of citizens led by [[George Marston]] formed the San Diego Museum Association to retain the collection and convert it into a permanent museum, with Dr. Hewett as the first director. Notable additions to the museum’s collection after the Exposition included the Jessop Weapons Collection and a rare collection of artifacts from the ancient Egyptian city of [[Amarna]], donated by [[Ellen Browning Scripps]] and the Egyptian Exploration Society.

Between 1935 and 1936, the museum’s name briefly changed to the Palace of Science in order to correspond with other exhibit buildings participating in the California-Pacific International Exposition. During this exposition, the museum housed several special exhibitions from a variety of sources, such as the Monte Alban exhibit, which featured many artifacts on loan from the Mexican government.

The name was changed to "Museum of Man" in 1942 to emphasize the museum's concentration on anthropology. "San Diego" was added in 1978.&lt;ref name="SanDiego" /&gt; The museum was converted into a hospital during World War II, and its exhibits and collections were temporarily moved into storage. Following the war, the museum began to focus its collections on the peoples of the Western Americas. The museum’s collections grew substantially from the 1980s through the early 1990s, and today contains nearly two million individual objects.

The museum is housed in four original buildings from the 1915 Exposition. Those include the [[California Quadrangle]], which was designed for the Exposition by American architect [[Bertram G. Goodhue]], and the California Tower, one of the most prominent landmarks in San Diego. The Quadrangle and Tower are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/ca/ca4.htm|title=California Quadrangle|work=National Park Service|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exterior sculpture on the building was created by the [[Piccirilli Brothers]].

The main museum, including exhibits and gift shop, is housed in the ornate California Building with its landmark tower. The tower, closed to the public for nearly 80 years, reopened on January 1, 2015, in time for the 2015 centennial of the [[Panama-California Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chute|first1=James|last2=Rocha|first2=Michael James|title=Iconic California Tower Reopens  in Balboa Park Today|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/jan/01/california-tower-balboa-park-reopens/|accessdate=14 June 2016|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower contains a [[carillon]] and quarterly-hour chimes which can be heard all over Balboa Park.

The museum also occupies three other original 1915 buildings. Administrative offices and an auditorium are housed in the Gill Administration Building, immediately adjacent to the Museum on the west. Originally known as the Balboa Park Administration Building, it was built in 1911 and designed by architect [[Irving Gill]]. It was the first building erected in Balboa Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofman.org/california-building|title=The California Building|work=Museum of Man website|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite (south) side of the California Quadrangle, housed in what was originally the Fine Arts Building, is Evernham Hall, a banquet room which is also used for temporary exhibits. Immediately adjacent is the Saint Francis Chapel, a non-denominational Spanish-style chapel available for private events such as weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofman.org/private-event-planning|title=Private events at the Museum of Man|work=Museum of Man website|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The museum's cultural resources and permanent exhibits focus on the [[pre-Columbian]] history of the western [[Americas]], with materials drawn from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures of the [[Southern California]] region, and [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. The museum also holds one of the most important collections of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian antiquities in the United States, which includes burial masks, figurines, and seven painted wooden coffins. The most extraordinary of these is an extremely rare Ptolemaic child's coffin — only six others are known to exist worldwide. Total holdings include more than 100,000 documented ethnographic items, more than 300,000 archaeological items, and more than 25,000 photographic images.

'''Admissions and Gift Shop'''

'''BEERology''': This special exhibit features 10,000 years of beer history and brewing practices among the Ancient Egyptians, Sumerians, Chinese, Amazonian headhunters, and other cultures throughout the world. The exhibit explores ancient and modern beer types and brewing practices, as well as their influential connections to agriculture, religion, and social meaning-making.

Highlights include the solid gold beer cup of an Incan king (1250 to 1533 A.D.); Peruvian [[Moche culture|Moche]] pots, the ancient equivalent to modern day beer [[Beer bottle#Growler|growlers]]; a modern [[Homebrewing|homebrew]] equipment set; and a short documentary on the San Diego craft beer industry and tradition.

The exhibit also includes a full, hand-crafted bar, which provides the space for regular [[beer sommelier|beer tasting]] events and other private functions. This exhibit will be open through 2018.
 
'''Maya: Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth''': displays several huge Maya monuments, or stelae, in the Rotunda Gallery. These are casts of the original monuments in Quirigua, a site in Guatemala. The casts were made for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition and have been on display ever since, except during [[World War II]], when the [[United States Navy|Navy]] took control of most of Balboa Park and turned the Museum into a hospital. Today these casts are studied by researchers tracing the history of the Maya through their hieroglyphic writing because the casts are in better condition than the original monuments, which have suffered some weathering and erosion since the casts were made. The exhibition also includes archaeological discoveries highlighting the creativity and beliefs of the ancient Maya: masks, bowls, figurines, etc.

'''Monsters!''' is a child-friendly special exhibit that blends interactive activities with displays of folk art and other artifacts to tell the stories of more than 50 different monsters and mythical creatures from around the world. Visitors explore the exhibit through the perspective of two children who discover the origins and mythology behind creatures that have captivated world-audiences throughout time.

As visitors learn about creatures such as [[dragons]], the [[yeti]], the [[kraken]], [[unicorns]], and [[bogeyman]], they move through various thematic areas, such as a child’s bedroom, a forest, a cave and the ocean, which represent various monsters’ habitats.

Interactive activities include a book nook for reading monster storybooks, a magnetic monster wall where children can create their own monsters, and a puppet theater where children can act out monster origin stories. This exhibit was open through 2016.

===Second floor===

'''Race: Are We So Different?''': This exhibit explores the social and historical origins of race, and how most of what we think about race is based on myth, folklore, or assumptions unsupported by genetics or biology. It explains the origins of race and racism and helps us understand how to deal with them in productive and enlightening ways. Visitors explore these ideas with hands-on interactive activities, videos, and more.

'''Post Secret''': This exhibit explores secrets as the currency of intimacy. They reflect our darkest thoughts, brightest hopes, and every emotion in between. They’re deeply personal but extremely relatable. They allow us to feel alone, together. For over a decade, millions of people from all over the world have been anonymously sharing their secrets with Frank Warren, founder of the community art project, PostSecret. Each postcard submission is a unique work of art handmade by people who needed to share and release their secret into the world.

'''Living With Animals''': This exhibit explores our relationship to and with animals. Over 15,000 years ago humans began sharing their meals with wolves, forging the first friendship between humans and animals–but where did we go from there?Since then, we’ve formed all kinds of relationships with all kinds of animals, and we encounter them everywhere in our daily lives: they cuddle up with us on the couch, crawl silently through our walls, sit on our dinner plates, and more. But whether we see an animal as a pet, a pest, or food has changed over time and across cultures, making our relationships with them dynamic and complex, to say the least.

'''Kumeyaay: Native Californians''': This exhibit explores traditional [[Kumeyaay]] lifeways, featuring the art of pottery and basket making, food procurement, dress and adornment, traditional medicine, games, and ceremonies. Artifacts and photographs from the museum's collection highlight the rich cultural heritage of the Kumeyaay, offering a glimpse of the life of the ancestors of today's present-day people.

'''Ancient Egypt''': This core exhibit blends history and science in its presentation of the [[mummification]] traditions of [[Ancient Egypt]] and other examples of mummification from around the world. 

Artifacts include the authentic remains of two Egyptian mummies, painted mummy coffins and masks, amulets, pottery, and [[ushabti]] — all of which date primarily from the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] and from the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]]. The exhibit also includes a rare child sarcophagus (305-30 B.C.E.), one of seven known to exist in all museum collections around the world. Also on display are several artifacts from the ancient city of [[Amarna]] that [[Akhenaten]], father of [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]], ruled. One of the artifacts from the Amarna collection, gifted to the museum from San Diego philanthropist [[Ellen Browning Scripps]], is known as ‘The Missing Cartouche of Nefertiti’, one of the most significant findings from the excavations of the ancient city.

'''Adventure Kids in Egypt''': This family-oriented exhibit gives younger visitors an opportunity for interactive, sensory learning about ancient Egyptian civilization, and about the role of [[anthropologists]] and [[archaeologists]] in the research and interpretation of the culture. Highlights include an interactive computer game that test skills in archaeology and exploration, an archaeological dig box with artifacts to uncover, a child-sized sarcophagus puzzle, and costumes based on ancient Egyptian garb for children to wear.

===Evernham Hall ===
'''Cannibals: Myth &amp; Reality''': This special exhibit opened in March 2016. Exhibits explore what makes a person a cannibal; how cannibals have been portrayed in popular culture; famous incidents where people resorted to cannibalism to survive; how the human body has been used as medicine; and why some cultures have been falsely labeled as "cannibal".

==Special events==
The museum also hosts regular beer tastings featuring local San Diego and national craft breweries in conjunction with its ''BEERology'' exhibit.

The museum also participates in the annual "December Nights" at Balboa Park. 

==In popular culture==
The California Building and its tower were used by [[Orson Welles]] as the principal features of the fictitious Xanadu estate in the classic film ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/california/san-diego/review-147534.html|title=San Diego Museum of Man San Diego Review|website=www.fodors.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chuck Norris]] film ''[[Top Dog (1995 film)|Top Dog]]'' contains scenes filmed at the Museum of Man.{{cn|date=October 2016}} 

A building with great resemblance to the museum is featured in the San Diego level of the 2003 video game ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground]]''.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''Self-incrimination''' is the act of exposing oneself generally, by making a statement, "to an accusation or charge of crime; to involve oneself or another [person] in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |title= Black's Law Dictionary |page= 690 |edition= 5th |date= 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-incrimination can occur either directly or indirectly: directly, by means of interrogation where information of a self-incriminatory nature is disclosed; or indirectly, when information of a self-incriminatory nature is disclosed voluntarily without pressure from another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960166637|title=Essentials of criminal justice |last=1947-|first=Siegel, Larry J., |others=Worrall, John L.|isbn=1305633768 |edition= Tenth |location= Australia |oclc= 960166637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many legal systems, accused criminals cannot be compelled to incriminate themselves—they may choose to speak to [[police]] or other authorities, but they cannot be punished for refusing to do so. There are 108 countries and jurisdictions that currently have Miranda-type warnings, which include the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2016/06/miranda/|title=The Right to Remain Silent Around the World|last=Aftergood|first=Steven|date=|website=Federation of American Scientists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are not uniform across the world, however members of the European Union have developed their laws around the EU's guide regarding Miranda-type law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miranda Warning Equvalents|url=https://fas.org/sgp/eprint/miranda.pdf|website=Federation of American Scientists|publisher=The Law Library of Congress|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian law==
In Canada, similar rights exist pursuant to the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Section 11 of the Charter provides that one cannot be compelled to be a witness in a proceeding against oneself. [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 11(c)]] states:

{{quote|11. Any person charged with an offence has the right&amp;nbsp;... c) not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the offence&amp;nbsp;...}}

An important caveat in Canadian law is that this does not apply to a person who is not charged in the case in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/455870865|title=International and transnational criminal law|last1=Luban|first1=David|date=2010|publisher=Aspen Publishers|last2=O'Sullivan|first2=Julie R.|last3=Stewart|first3=David P.|isbn=0735562148|location=New York|oclc=455870865}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person issued a subpoena, who is not charged in respect of the offence being considered, must give testimony.  However, this testimony cannot later be used against the person in another case. [[Section Thirteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 13]] of the Charter states:

{{quote|13. A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence.}}

Historically, in Canadian common law, witnesses could refuse to give testimony that would self-incriminate. However, section 5(1) of the ''[[Canada Evidence Act]]'' eliminated that absolute common law privilege by instead compelling witnesses to testify. In exchange, section 5(2) of the same act granted the witnesses immunity from having that evidence used against them in the future except in the case of [[perjury]] or [[Witness impeachment|impeachment]]. While these provisions of the ''Canada Evidence Act'' are still operational, they have been overtaken in their application by the immunities granted by sections 13 and [[Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|7 of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evidence: A Canadian Casebook|last=|first=|publisher=Emond Montgomery Publications|year=2016|isbn=978-1-55239-680-3|editor-last=Stewart|editor-first=Hamish|editor-link=|location=[[Toronto]]|pages=624|editor-last2=Berger|editor-first2=Benjamin L.|editor-last3=Murphy|editor-first3=Ronalda|editor-last4=Cunliffe|editor-first4=Emma|editor-last5=Steven|editor-first5=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chinese law ==
{{see also|Human rights in China}}
After the 1996 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 15 states that "It shall be strictly prohibited to extort confessions by [[torture]], gather evidence by threat, enticement, [[deceit]], or other illegal means, or force anyone to commit self-incrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/847517553|title=Values of our times : contemporary axiological research in China|date=2013|publisher=Springer|others=Li, Deshun.|isbn=3642382584|location=Berlin|oclc=847517553}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the law was also re-amended to strengthen the [[human rights]] protection of criminal suspects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/china-amendment-of-criminal-procedure-law/ China: Amendment of Criminal Procedure Law].&lt;/ref&gt; China has since recognized the right against self-incrimination and forced confessions are prohibited by the law. However in practice as human rights violations in China continue to be committed, it is still common practice for police to use torture on suspects to obtain forced confessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.businessinsider.in/Report-Torture-is-routinely-used-in-China-to-obtain-confessions-and-silence-human-rights-lawyers/articleshow/49764534.cms |title= Report: Torture is routinely used in China to obtain confessions and silence human-rights lawyers |last=Jacobs |first=Harrison |date= November 13, 2015 |accessdate=November 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's accession to the [[United Nations]]'s [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] in 1998 also guarantees Chinese citizens the right against self-incrimination; however, China has not ratified the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/10/08/china-ratify-key-international-human-rights-treaty|title=China: Ratify Key International Human Rights Treaty|date=2013-10-08|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian law==
{{See also|Judiciary of India}}

In India, under Article 20 (3) of the Constitution, the defendant has the right against self-incrimination, but witnesses are not given the same right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/article/l466-Privilege-Against-Self----Incrimination.html|title=Privilege Against Self - Incrimination|first=|last=aDvantage|date=|website=www.legalserviceindia.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A defendant must be informed of their rights before making any statements that may incriminate them. Defendants must not be compelled to give any statements. In the case that a defendant is pressured into giving a statement that is self-incriminating, the statement will not be admissible in a court of law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Constitution give defendants the Right to Silence, i.e. the right to withhold self-incriminating information to authorities. The defendant must inform the authorities that he or she is exercising their Right to Silence; withholding information is not considered using their right to withhold information that can potentially be self-incriminating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to exercise their right to remain silent, the defendant must verbally and clearly state that they are doing so. For example, a defendant can say, "I am exercising my right to remain silent and will not be answering any further questions."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Article 20 (3) does not pertain to those who made a confession willingly without being intimidated or coerced into making such statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khare|first1=Harshit|title=Privilege Against Self-Incrimination|url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/article/l466-Privilege-Against-Self----Incrimination.html|website=Legal Service India|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English and Welsh law==
{{see also|Right to silence in England and Wales}}
The right against self-incrimination originated in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard. H. Helmholz, "Origins of the Privilege against Self-Incrimination: The Role of the European Ius Commune," 65 New York University Law Review 962 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; In countries deriving their laws as an extension of the history of English [[Common Law]], a body of law has grown around the concept of providing individuals with the means to protect themselves from self-incrimination.

Applying to England and Wales, the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] amended the [[right to silence]] by allowing inferences to be drawn by the [[jury]] in cases where a suspect refuses to explain something, and then later produces an explanation. In other words, the jury is entitled to infer that the accused fabricated the explanation at a later date, as he or she refused to provide the explanation during the time of the police questioning. The jury is also free not to make such an inference.&lt;ref&gt;’lai Oshitokunbo Oshisanya, ''An Almanac of Contemporary Judicial Re-statements'' (Almanac vols i-iii) Revised edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scots law==
In Scots criminal and civil law, both common and statute law originated and operate separately from that in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-02|title=Scots law|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scots_law&amp;oldid=833899403|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scots law, the right to silence remains unchanged by the above, and juries' rights to draw inferences are severely curtailed.

On January 25, 2018 the law in Scotland changed in regards to people being detained by police.  These changes only affect people who are arrested after January 25, 2018.  Those who are arrested have 'the right to remain silent' and are not obligated to answer questions asked by police.  However, although someone being detained by police does not need to answer questions regarding the crime they are accused of, it is mandatory for detainees to answer basic questions of identity such as: name, date of birth, address, and nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Being arrested: your rights|url=https://www.mygov.scot/arrested-your-rights/when-youre-arrested/|website=mygov.scot|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States law==
The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] protects the accused from being forced to incriminate themselves in a crime. The Amendment reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime&amp;nbsp;... nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-v|title=The 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution|website=National Constitution Center – The 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, under the [[Miranda Rights|Miranda ruling]], a person also has the right to remain silent while in police custody so as to not reveal any incriminating information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_silence|title=Right to Silence|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} In order to invoke this constitutional right to remain silent, a person must explicitly and unambiguously tell officers that they are exercising this right to remain silent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-rights/invoking-the-right-to-remain-silent.html|title=Invoking the Right to Remain Silent|work=Findlaw|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, staying silent without a prior exclamation that you are exercising this constitutional right does not invoke the right.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' (1966) the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination requires law enforcement officials to [[Miranda warning|advise a suspect]] interrogated in custody of them their [[Right to silence|right to remain silent]] and their right to an attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1965/1965_759 | title =MIRANDA v. ARIZONA | author =[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] [[Chicago–Kent College of Law]] | publisher =oyez.org | date =July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/landmark_miranda.html | title =SUPREME COURT HISTORY EXPANDING CIVIL RIGHTS Miranda v. Arizona (1966) | author =Alex McBride | publisher =pbs.org | date =December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] further notes that "any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;''Watts v. Indiana'', {{ussc|338|49|1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Miranda'' warnings must be given before there is any "questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0384_0436_ZS.html | title =Syllabus SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 384 U.S. 436 Miranda v. Arizona CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARIZONA | author =[[Cornell University Law School]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suspects must be warned, prior to the interrogation, that they have the right to remain silent, that anything they say may be used against them in a court of law, that they have the right to have an attorney and if one cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to defend such person. Further, only after such warnings are given and understood, may the individual knowingly waive them and agree to answer questions or make a statement.&lt;ref&gt;''Miranda v. Arizona'', 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important to note that the Fifth Amendment protects certain types of evidence, specifically [[Testimony|testimonial evidence]], which are statements that are spoken by the person in question that are made under oath.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Crime: The Language of Criminal Justice|last=Solan|first=Lawrence M.|last2=Tiersma|first2=Peter M.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0226767932|location=Chicago &amp; London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of other different types of evidence, see [[Evidence (law)]].

===Legal definitions and privileges===

{{unordered list
|'''''Black's Law Dictionary''''' (US):
&lt;blockquote&gt;SELF-INCRIMINATION: Acts or declarations either as testimony at trial or prior to trial by which one implicates himself in a crime. The Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. as well as provisions in many state constitutions and laws, prohibit the government from requiring a person to be a witness against himself involuntarily or to furnish evidence against himself.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|'''''Barron's Law Dictionary''''' (US):
&lt;blockquote&gt;SELF-INCRIMINATION, PRIVILEGE AGAINST the constitutional right of a person to refuse to answer questions or otherwise give testimony against himself or herself which will subject him or her to an incrimination. This right under the Fifth Amendment (often called simply PLEADING THE FIFTH) is now applicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 378 U.S. 1,8, and is applicable in any situation, civil or criminal where the state attempts to compel incriminating testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|last=Black|first=Henry Campbell|publisher=|year=1910|isbn=|location=|pages=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

===Truthful statements by an innocent person===

An incriminating statement includes any statement that tends to increase the danger that the person making the statement will be accused, charged or prosecuted – even if the statement is true, and even if the person is innocent of any crime. Thus, even a person who is innocent of any crime who testifies truthfully can be incriminated by that testimony. The United States Supreme Court has stated that the Fifth Amendment privilege

{{quote|protects the innocent as well as the guilty.&amp;nbsp;... one of the Fifth Amendment's basic functions ... is to protect innocent men ... who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.&amp;nbsp;... truthful responses of an innocent witness, as well as those of a wrongdoer, may provide the government with incriminating evidence from the speaker's own mouth.&lt;ref&gt;''Ohio v. Reiner'', 532 U.S. 17 (2001) (''per curiam'').&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The U.S. Supreme Court has also stated:

{{quote|Too many, even those who should be better advised, view this privilege as a shelter for wrongdoers. They too readily assume that those who invoke it are either guilty of crime or commit perjury in claiming the privilege.&lt;ref&gt;''Ullmann v. United States'', 350 U.S. 422, 426 (1956) (footnote omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3392">{{Expand Polish|Stanisław Urbańczyk|date=November 2015}}
'''Stanisław Urbańczyk''' (1909–2001) was a [[Poland|Polish]] linguist and academic, a professor at the universities of [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń|Toruń]], [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań|Poznań]] and [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków]]. He was the head of the Institute of the Polish Language at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in 1973–79.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ijp-pan.krakow.pl/en/historia-instytutu&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanisław Urbańczyk was born in a peasant family of Kwaczała. He completed 4-class elementary school in Kwaczała and started learning in St. Anne's Secondary School (today I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Bartłomieja Nowodworskiego w Krakowie). In the years 1929-1934 he studied Polish and Slavic philology&lt;ref&gt;[http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/16235,,,,urbanczyk_stanislaw,haslo.html Urbańczyk Stanisław]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Jagiellonian University]]. In 1937 he became an academic teacher. Among his students was young Karol Wojtyła, later the pope [[John Paul II]]. In 1939 he was arrested by the Nazis during [[Sonderaktion Krakau]] and imprisoned in concentration camps in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and [[Dachau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rep.up.krakow.pl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11716/1208/profesor_stanislaw_urbanczyk_i_t_zarebina_maria_000191.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Maria Zarębina, Profesor Stanisław Urbańczyk i tajne nauczanie w Uniwersytecie Jagiellońskim (in Polish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of many books, articles and reviews. Among his scholarly interests were synchronical and diachronical Polish grammar, dialectology, history of language, [[Slavic mythology|Slavic native religion and mythology]], biblical translation and influence of Czech unto Polish in [[Middle Ages]].

'''"The Kipper and the Corpse"''' is the fourth episode of the second series of the British [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''. It first aired at 9.00pm on 12 March 1979 on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].&lt;ref name=FullyBooked&gt;{{cite news|url=|title=Fawlty Towers – Fully Booked|first=Morris|last=Bright|first2=Robert|last2=Ross|publisher=[[BBC]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguishing it from other episodes is its heavy use of [[black comedy]].

==Background==
During the early 1970s, John Cleese met a young hotelier called Andrew Leeman. They went on holiday together to the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] with their girlfriends between the first and second series of ''Fawlty Towers'', a time when Cleese was looking for ideas for plots. During the holiday, Leeman told him how when he was working at the [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]] he found a guest dead in his room, and was told to discreetly dispose of the body. Cleese turned this into "The Kipper and the Corpse" and the character who died was named Mr. Leeman in his honour.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/28/db2803.xml|title=Obituary – Andrew Leeman|first=|last=|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Basil and Sybil are working the bar where Mrs. Chase is fussing over her [[shih-tzu]] dog and Dr. Price wants some [[sausages]], but all they can offer him are sandwiches. During the evening, a guest, Mr. Leeman, returns to ''Fawlty Towers'' feeling unwell; his business colleagues leave, after sympathising and making arrangements for a meeting the next morning. As Leeman picks up his key, he asks for breakfast in bed, much to Basil's disdain. Not particularly interested in discussing food the way he is feeling, he opts for the Continental breakfast; Sybil offers [[kipper]]s and he agrees.&lt;ref name=FullyBooked/&gt;

The following morning, Dr. Price still yearns for some sausages, while Mrs. Chase makes a fuss of her dog, which bites Manuel and Polly for no reason.  They exact revenge by putting liberal lashings of pepper and tabasco sauce on its food, causing it a severe stomach ache. In the kitchen Basil spots that the kippers Terry is cooking for Leeman are out of date. Despite his protestations, he is reassured by Terry and overruled by Sybil, who orders him to take the breakfast upstairs. So distracted by fury at industrial action reported in that morning's papers, he fails to notice that Leeman has died, assuming that his silence is due simply to rudeness, and instead rants about the [[Strike action|strike]] while tidying the room and opening the curtains. Moments later, Polly takes up the milk which had been mistakenly omitted from Leeman's breakfast tray, realises immediately that Leeman is dead and hurries downstairs to tell everyone. Recalling the "Sell-By" date he spotted earlier, Basil immediately panics that the kippers killed him, but Dr. Price examines Leeman's body and concludes that he actually died at least ten hours ago, much to Basil's initial delight.

Basil, Manuel, and Polly are then burdened with the task of trying to move the body from the room without the guests seeing. However, while moving him across the upstairs hall, Miss Tibbs sees the body and gets [[Hysteria|hysterical]]. On Basil's advice Polly slaps her, knocking her out. The unconscious Miss Tibbs and the dead body are hidden in a bedroom cupboard. The room's occupants Mr. and Mrs. White want to enter their room there and then, so Basil, Polly, and Manuel have to create a distraction, but Mr. and Mrs. White still hear Miss Tibbs moaning in the cupboard and force Basil to let her out. Whilst Basil tells them that she is a mad woman who likes to hide in people's wardrobes, Polly notices that Leeman's arm is sticking out of the cupboard and desperately tries to signal this to Basil, only resulting in more confusion.&lt;ref name=FullyBooked/&gt;

The body is finally moved to the office, where Major Gowen stumbles across it and assumes that Leeman was shot dead as he slept. Meanwhile, Dr. Price is still waiting for his sausages, and gets into a brief quarrel with Manuel about breakfast time until Basil clears the misunderstanding up, poking Manuel in the eye. Miss Tibbs, now recovered, goes to the office to confront Basil, but sees the dead body once more and faints. Mr. Leeman is then moved to the kitchen in the linen basket, until Dr. Price insists he be moved, and ends up in reception. When his business associates arrive at reception asking about Mr. Leeman, Basil thinks they are the undertakers. While he is talking to them, the linen basket with Leeman inside is taken away by the laundry men. Acting fast, the staff get him back and again try to hide him in several places, but Manuel loses his strength and gives up ("Mr. Fawlty, I no want to work here anymore!"), instead hiding himself in the basket until Polly gets him out. Leeman's colleagues are informed of his death by Sybil and prepare to leave, while Basil hides the body behind the hat rack. A commotion occurs, and all the guests who were neglected, including Miss Tibbs (still in shock), Dr. Price (who had to cook his own sausages before realising that they were off), Mr. and Mrs. White (whose room was once again intruded upon), and Mrs. Chase (whose dog is ill from the tabasco sauce and the vet she requested hasn't been called), begin complaining.

Basil discreetly calls the laundry men and tells the guests that Sybil (who has done little while Basil, Manuel, and Polly have been trying to hide the body) will explain everything. As the guests round on Sybil, Basil hides in the basket and is taken away by the laundry men. Leeman is subsequently seen by all the guests, including a horrified Miss Tibbs, as Sybil desperately calls out Basil's name.&lt;ref name=FullyBooked/&gt;

===Recent career===
The pair made recurring appearances in various series of ''[[French &amp; Saunders]]''. Janette played, for example, Anadin Skywalker in the ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|Star Wars: The Phantom Menace]]'' parody "The Phantom Millennium", and they both appeared in several other movie parodies throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchandsaunders.com/specials/christmas1999/ |title=French &amp; Saunders - Christmas Special 1999 |publisher=Frenchandsaunders.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her most recent appearance was on the 2005 Christmas Special, in which she appeared in the mock theatre trailers for ''[[The Graduate]]'' and ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]''. She also appeared in the fifth series of ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' playing both a midwife and nightmare baby in the episode "Book Clubbin."

In 1999 Janette Tough made a cameo appearance in a season 4 episode of ''[[Murder Most Horrid]]'' ("Elvis, Jesus, and Zack"). The episode concerns an artist who fakes his death to gain popularity. Janette is seen at the end of the episode, calling Dawn French's character for help faking her own death. Also in 1999 she appeared as Janice, friend of Petula in an episode of ''[[Dinnerladies]]'' entitled 'Christmas'.

In 2003, "Wee Jimmy Krankie" was voted "The Most Scottish Person in the World" by the readers of ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]''. In 2004, Janette was badly injured in a fall during a performance in the pantomime ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', but has since made a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4099391.stm |title=Krankie hurt in beanstalk tumble |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-12-15 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4101211.stm |title=Soap stars save Krankies panto |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-12-16 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6218482.stm |title=Payout after beanstalk accident |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-12-07 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Krankies appeared in a widely seen advertising campaign for 'stv Bingo'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stv.tv/content/bingo_and_games/Krankies ''stv Bingo''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429144529/http://www.stv.tv/content/bingo_and_games/Krankies |date=29 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, The Krankies appeared in the video for the [[Comic Relief]] remake of [[The Proclaimers]]' song "[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]", which featured Brian Potter and Andy Pipkin (fictional characters portrayed by [[Peter Kay]] and [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] respectively).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On the 12 June 2008 they appeared as guests on ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'', where they appeared in character at the beginning, before coming on later in the show as themselves. They were promoting a forthcoming tour in which they performed with other "semi-retired" acts such as [[Frank Carson]], [[Brotherhood of Man]], and [[Jimmy Cricket]] (all best known in the 1970s and 1980s).

In a 2008 interview, [[David Tennant]] (jokingly) suggested that he would like Wee Jimmy Krankie to take over the role of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2008/oct/30/doctorwho-bbc |title=David Tennant discusses his exit from Doctor Who |work=Guardian |date= 2008-10-30|accessdate=2010-04-22 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 14 December, they once again were on the Paul O'Grady show for the pantomime special of 'Sleeping Beauty' where Janette played a hooker and Ian played a rampant camel. The duo appeared on ITV's daytime show ''[[Loose Women]]'' on 25 February 2010.

During the 2010 panto season, the Krankies made a re-appearance to Scottish panto alongside [[John Barrowman]] at the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|SECC]] for Aladdin. They appeared as the Police, with Janette parodying [[Susan Boyle]] and [[Lady Gaga]], and making an appearance as Wee Jimmy Krankie. The Krankies returned alongside Barrowman in 2011 and soon became SECC Veterans, after Five Years Barrowman announced he would not return. [[David Hassellhoff]] joined the Krankies for the 2015 Pantomime. In 2016 The Krankies joined  Barrowman  again in panto at Birmingham Hippodrome, and in 2017 at Manchester Opera House.

In December 2011, during an appearance on [[BBC Radio Scotland]]'s ''Stark Talk'' programme, Ian Tough revealed the couple had enjoyed a colourful sex life at the time when their profile was at its highest in the 1980s, admitting to episodes of [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]]. He told the story of one amorous incident where the pair almost sailed off course to France in a small boat while partaking in a sex act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wardrop|first=Murray|title=The Krankies: 'We used to be swingers'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8965006/The-Krankies-We-used-to-be-swingers.html|accessdate=20 December 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, ''[[Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie]]'' sparked controversy and accusations of racism when it was announced that Janette Tough would be playing a male Japanese character named Huki Muki.&lt;ref name="Cho"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/absolutely-fabulous/ab-fab-movie-janette-krankie-racism-margaret-cho/ |title=''Ab Fab'' movie accused of racism |first=Amy |last=Blumsom |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/absolutely-fabulous-movie-yellowface-why-offensive-racial-stereotyping-still-blights-hollywood-1533640 |title=''Absolutely Fabulous'' movie and yellowface: Why offensive racial stereotyping still blights Hollywood |author=Lydia Smith|work=[[International Business Times|International Business Times UK]] |date=December 16, 2015 |accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean American comedian [[Margaret Cho]] accused Janette Tough of "[[yellowface]]", which she described as "when white people portray Asian people.

When asked about the controversy Jennifer Saunders replied "the whole film is about people being what they're not, Huki Muki is a brand, she is the designer and she looks a bit Japanese, but the moment she opens her mouth she's from Glasgow.

'''''The Sly Old Cat''''' is a children's book written and illustrated by [[Beatrix Potter]] in 1906, and first published by Frederick Warne &amp; Co. in 1971, almost thirty years after her death. The story tells of a cat who invites a rat to a tea party with the intention of eating him, but the rat outwits her and leaves the party with a muffin in a paper bag.

The story was written in 1906 for her publisher's daughter, and was intended to be published in 1907 as a panorama book, a long strip of paper with text and illustrations that folded into a wallet. Booksellers objected to the format, because the item was too difficult to keep folded and in its place once customers opened it for examination. The tale was set aside. In 1916, it was again considered for publication but, again, set aside. Potter's eyesight was failing and she did not want to become involved in the labour of developing a book for publication. It was first published in 1971 with Potter's rough sketches. The book was critically well received.

==Plot==
A cat invites a rat to her tea party. She eats her bread and leaves only crumbs for the rat. She drinks her tea and leaves only drops of milk for the rat. The rat believes she will eat him for dessert and wishes he had not come. When the cat raises the milk jug to drink the last of the milk, the rat gives the jug a pat and it slips down over the cat's head. She bangs about the kitchen unable to free herself. The rat sips some tea, puts a muffin in a paper bag, and leaves. Later, he eats the muffin.

==Composition and publication==
Potter wrote the book in 1906 for her publisher's daughter, Nellie Warne. Publication was intended for 1907 as a companion piece to the panorama books, ''[[The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit]]'' and ''[[The Story of Miss Moppet]]'', but booksellers objected to the panorama format which was nothing more than a long paper strip of illustrations and text that folded accordion-fashion into a wallet and was tied with a ribbon. It was difficult to keep such a book folded and enclosed in its wallet after curious customers opened it for examination. The story was set aside.&lt;ref name="Taylor130"&gt;Taylor 1987, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the story was again considered for publication but in the standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit library rather than the panorama format.&lt;ref name="Lear280"&gt;Lear 2007, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The title was announced on an [[endpaper]] as ''The Story of the Sly Old Cat'' but Potter's watercolours were never prepared for printing.  Her eyesight was failing and she did not look forward to the work involved in preparing the book for publication.  She suggested [[Ernest Aris]] for the job, but the book only reached a rough draft stage.  The story was first published in 1971 with Potter's rough sketches.  The book is not included in the standard small format library of 23 Peter Rabbit books.&lt;ref name="MacDonald50"&gt;MacDonald 1986, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical commentary==
''The Sly Old Cat'' is told mainly in monosyllables, and is critically considered "perfect in its fusion of word and picture, and visually reminiscent of [[Randolph Caldecott]] in its rythmic narrative flow."&lt;ref name="Taylor130"/&gt;

'''Toca da Tira Peia''' is a rock shelter site, located in the municipality [[Coronel José Dias]], [[Piauí]] state, near the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]], [[Brazil]],&lt;ref name=re/&gt; thought to hold evidence of prehistoric human presence in South America dating to 22,000 years ago.

== Site ==
The Toca da Tira Peia [[rockshelter]] was discovered in 2008. There are four well preserved sediment layers, the youngest of which dates to 4,000 years BP. 113 knapped stone tools and artifacts have been recovered.

The site has been dated through [[optically stimulated luminescence]] technique.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Digging turned up 113 stone artifacts consisting of tools and tool debris in five soil layers. Using a technique that measures natural radiation damage in excavated quartz grains, the scientists estimated that the last exposure of soil to sunlight ranged from about 4,000 years ago in the top layer to 22,000 years ago in the third layer."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the authors, this site offers some advantages to the other sites such as Pedra Furada in regard to dating. As opposed to the Pedra Furada sites, Toca da Tira Peia doesn't have so many naturally occurring pebbles that can be confused with those that “were brought and knapped by human beings”.

Also, the authors claim that the Toca da Tira Peia artifacts “are in their original position; they had not been subject to movements since their burial”.&lt;ref name=re&gt;C.

'''Walter D. Mignolo''' (born May 1, 1941) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] semiotician ([[École pratique des hautes études|École des Hautes Études]]) and professor at [[Duke University]], who has published extensively on [[semiotics]] and [[literary theory]], and worked on different aspects of the modern and colonial world, exploring concepts such as global coloniality, the geopolitics of knowledge, transmodernity, [[Border-Thinking]], and pluriversality.&lt;ref&gt;http://waltermignolo.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Mignolo received his BA in Philosophy from the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina in 1969. In 1974 he obtained his Ph.D. from the [[École pratique des hautes études|École des Hautes Études]], Paris. He subsequently taught at the Universities of [[University of Toulouse|Toulouse]], [[University of Indiana|Indiana]], and [[University of Michigan|Michigan]].

Since January 1993, Walter D. Mignolo has been the William H. Wannamaker Professor of Literature and Romance Studies at [[Duke University]], USA, and has joint appointments in Cultural Anthropology and Romance Studies.

Mignolo co-edits the web dossier, Worlds and Knowledges Otherwise. He is the academic director of "Duke in the Andes", an interdisciplinary program in Latin American and Andean Studies in [[Quito]], Ecuador, at the Universidad Politécnica Salesiana. Since 2000, he has directed the Center for Global Studies and the Humanities, a research unit within the John Hope Franklin Center for International and Interdisciplinary Studies. He has also been named Permanent Researcher at Large at the Universidad Andina [[Simón Bolívar]] in [[Quito, Ecuador]].

Recently, Mignolo has ventured into what he calls "[[Decoloniality|decolonial aesthetics]]" writing on artists [[Pedro Lasch]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], and [[Tanja Ostojić]]. He contributed to ''Black Mirror/Espejo Negro'', a book on the works of [[Pedro Lasch]], edited by Lasch, published by [[Duke University Press]].
