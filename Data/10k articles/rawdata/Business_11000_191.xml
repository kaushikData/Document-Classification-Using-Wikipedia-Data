The '''2015 Kohler Strike''' is the fourth [[Strike_action|strike]] in the 142-year-old history of the [[Kohler Company]] in [[Kohler, Wisconsin]].

== Background ==
In December 2010, the Kohler Company and United Auto Workers Local 833 reached agreement on a new five-year labor contract, that covered approximately 2,300 union workers at the company's two [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin]] manufacturing locations. The contract passed 1,152 to 717, with 62 percent of union members voting to ratify the deal and 38 percent voting no. Throughout negotiations, Kohler Company officials insisted labor concessions were needed as the company's Sheboygan County manufacturing plants are easily the company's most expensive to operate, and products produced there are no longer competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kohler workers vote to approve new contract|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/112153854.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The deal included a five-year wage freeze, higher health care premiums and the creation of a two-tiered wage and benefit system. It also allowed for the limited use of temporary workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Union workers vote to accept Kohler Co. contract|url=http://archive.sheboyganpress.com/article/20101219/SHE0101/101219021/Update-Union-workers-vote-accept-Kohler-Co-contract|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=The Sheboygan Press|date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Past strikes ==
{{main|Kohler strikes}}
The first Kohler Company strike, which began in 1934, lasted seven years and resulted in the shooting deaths of two strikers during a riot outside the company’s factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police tackle traffic, noise at Kohler strike|url=http://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/news/2015/11/18/police-tackle-traffic-noise-kohler-strike/76006052/|accessdate=19 November 2015|publisher=The Sheboygan Press|date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second strike was in 1954 and lasted 6 years. It was marred by acts of violence and vandalism. The third strike, which occurred in 1983 and lasted several weeks, saw car windows smashed by demonstrators and two union members injured by a motorist who drove his vehicle through a picket line.
 
== Timeline ==
=== Before the strike ===
The Board of Directors of the Kohler Company elected David Kohler the company president and CEO on April 29, 2015, passing leadership of the family business to Herbert Kohler, Sr. grandson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Herbert Kohler Jr. stepping down as CEO of Kohler Co.|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/herbert-kohler-jr-stepping-down-as-ceo-of-kohler-co-b99491384z1-301737391.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 76 year old Herbert Kohler, Jr. would continue as company chairman and would oversee the company's hospitality and real estate group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kohler Co. passes company leadership to fourth generation|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2015/04/29/kohler-co-passes-company-leadership-to-fourth.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Business Journal|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On November 11, 2015, the [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] reported negotiations between the company and the United Auto Workers were continuing, but with a deadline laid down by the union approaching, the two sides were "not even close to an agreement," said Tim Tayloe, president of UAW Local 833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strike at Kohler Co. seems possible as contract deadline approaches|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/strike-at-kohler-co-seems-possible-as-contract-deadline-approaches-b99614626z1-346286602.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On November 13, workers held an informational picket&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kohler Informational Picket on November 13, 2015|url=http://www.publicsafety.photos/KohlerStrike/11-13-2015|website=Wisconsin Public Safety Photo Library|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside the Kohler Company owned-and-operated [[American Club (Kohler, Wisconsin)|The American Club]] ahead of a possible strike.
 
On November 14, the Kohler Company released its "last, best and final offer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kohler Co. Last, Best and Final Contract Offer|url=http://www.corporate.kohler.com/bulletin|website=Kohler Company|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kohler makes 'last, best offer'|url=http://www.htrnews.com/story/news/local/2015/11/14/kohler-makes-last-best-offer/75778762/|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Herald Times Reporter|date=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The strike begins ===
On the morning of November 15, 2015, an estimated 1,800 UAW Union members attended a meeting at [[Sheboygan South High School]]. 94 percent voted down the proposed Kohler Company proposal and approving a strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kohler workers reject offer, OK first union strike at company since 1983|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/kohler-workers-appear-to-reject-offer-setting-up-first-union-strike-since-1983-b99616441z1-349915121.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second day of the strike on November 16 began with workers marching 1.58 miles from Emil Mazey Hall in the Town of Sheboygan to the Kohler Company Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Kohler Company Strike March|url=http://www.publicsafety.photos/KohlerStrike/March|website=Wisconsin Public Safety Photo Library|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strike officially begins as union rejects Kohler Co. offer|url=http://www.wisn.com/news/the-strike-officially-begins-now-union-rejects-kohler-co-offer/36463420|accessdate=17 November 2015|publisher=WISN 12 News|date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed entrances to the company campus caused traffic congestion for morning commute with traffic backed up into nearby cities of Sheboygan and Sheboygan Falls. About 150 union employees were blocking the only company entrance as of 6 a.m. and preventing non-union employees from entering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huge crowds gather as Kohler strike begins|url=http://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/news/local/2015/11/16/kohler-strike-snarles-traffic/75867248/|accessdate=17 November 2015|publisher=The Sheboygan Press|date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days into the strike on November 17, Sheboygan County Judge James Bolgert issued a temporary injunction barring picketers from interfering with traffic near Kohler Company property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Injunction issued against Kohler picketers|url=http://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/news/2015/11/17/injunction-issued-against-kohler-picketers/75940018/|accessdate=18 November 2015|publisher=The Sheboygan Press|date=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporary injunction issued Tuesday bars demonstrators from interfering with traffic on public roads and with vehicles entering or leaving Kohler Co. property.

During the first week of the strike, the Village of Kohler has also asked for help from the [[Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office]] and the neighboring Sheboygan Falls Police Department with traffic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kohler Union Strike Causing Some Village Disruptions|url=http://wbay.com/2015/11/18/kohler-union-strike-causing-some-village-disruptions/|accessdate=21 November 2015|publisher=WBAY-Tv|date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the seventh day of the strike, union members and advocates held mass picket in support of striking Kohler Company workers on November 21 during company's American Club hosts its popular Wisconsin Holiday Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Union plans mass picket to support striking Kohler workers|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/union-plans-mass-picket-to-support-striking-kohler-workers-b99619957z1-351947181.html|accessdate=21 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The street in front of the American Club and the Kohler Company headquarters was closed to traffic during the picket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Kohler Company Strike, Day 7|url=http://www.publicsafety.photos/KohlerStrike/Day7|website=Wisconsin Public Safety Photo Library|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resolution ===
After 32 days, the strike ended as UAW Local 833 and Kohler struck a deal which was ratified by 91% of the union. The deal secured wage increases for Tier A and B employees, narrowing the pay gap between new hires and older workers. Pension benefits were improved and healthcare premium increases were minimized. &lt;ref&gt; http://archive.jsonline.com/business/kohler-employees-vote-on-new-contract-proposal-b99635971z1-362701091.html &lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Society for Public Administration''' (ASPA) is a membership association of almost 10,000 professionals in the United States sponsoring conferences and providing professional services primarily to those who study the implementation of government [[policy]], [[public administration]], and, to a lesser degree, programs of [[civil society]].  Its annual conference is an important meeting for those interested in [[bureaucracy]], [[civic engagement]], [[program evaluation]], [[public management]] and other public administration topics, such as [[budgeting]] and [[budget theory]], government strategic planning, policy analysis, contract administration, personnel management, and related topics.

American Society for Public Administration was founded in 1939, following growing concerns about the management of federal government and the report of the [[Brownlow Committee]]. It was formally incorporated on September 13, 1945.&lt;ref name= corp&gt;"[http://www.ilsos.gov/corporatellc/CorporateLlcController American Society for Public Administration]". ''Corporation File Detail Report''. Illinois Secretary of State. Accessed on April 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

American Society for Public Administration sponsors the journal ''[[Public Administration Review]]'', Journal of Health and Human Services Administration, Public Budgeting and Finance, and other leading international journals related to its over 30 working membership sections (e.g., Section on Public Performance and Management, Section on Women in Public Administration, Section on the Environment and Natural Resources Administration, Section on Intergovernmental Management and Administration).

==History==
American Society for Public Administration was founded in 1939 by [[Louis Brownlow]], William E. Mosher, Donald C. Stone, [[Charles A. Beard]], [[Harold D. Smith]], [[Luther Gulick (social scientist)|Luther Gulick]], and others.&lt;ref name=Brownlow1958&gt;{{cite book |last1= Brownlow |first1= Louis |authorlink1= Louis Brownlow|title= A Passion for Anonymity: the Autobiography of Louis Brownlow, Second Half |year=1958 |oclc= 1620372|pages=463–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugh1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pugh|first1=Darrell L.|title=ASPA Remembered: Reflections on the Society's Golden Anniversary|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=50|issue=2|year=1990|pages=267–273|doi=10.2307/976874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plant2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plant|first1=Jeremy F.|title=Good Work, Honestly Done: ASPA at 70|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=69|issue=6|year=2009|pages=1040–1049|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2009.02061.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its early years, American Society for Public Administration was housed in the Public Administration Clearing House (PACH) in Chicago.&lt;ref name=Brownlow1958/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugh1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt;

Significant events in American Society for Public Administration's history include:
* Sponsorship of ''[[Public Administration Review]]'' since 1939.&lt;ref name=Pugh1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt;
* After a developmental grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1956, independence from PACH.&lt;ref name=Brownlow1958/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pugh1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt;
* A move of the headquarters to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1964.&lt;ref name=Pugh1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt;
* Establishment of the [[National Academy of Public Administration (United States)|National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA)]] as part of ASPA in 1967, and formal separation of NAPA from ASPA in 1970.&lt;ref name=Pugh1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt;
* Reformulation of ASPA's Council on Graduate Education for Public Administration to the [[National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration|National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA)]] within ASPA in 1970, and formal separation of NASPAA from ASPA in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naspaa.org/about_naspaa/about/milestones.asp |title=NASPAA Milestones |author=National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520090753/http://www.naspaa.org/about_naspaa/about/milestones.asp |archivedate=May 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1981, creation with NAPA of National Public Service Awards.&lt;ref name=Pugh1990/&gt;
* A 50th Anniversary Conference in 1990.&lt;ref name=Pugh1990/&gt;
* Approval of the American Society for Public Administration [[Code of Ethics]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt;

American Society for Public Administration's membership declined from about 14,000 members in 1990 to 8,383 members in 2007.&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt;  However, during that period the Society took "steps to address its most serious issues: attracting and retaining members, dealing with structure and funding, developing a coherent mission, strengthening chapters and sections, sponsoring successful conferences, enhancing its publication offerings, and working effectively with other organizations concerned with public administration and public service."&lt;ref name=Plant2009/&gt; American Society for Public Administration membership was affected by the tendency of government to hire local governmental personnel, and the change from government provision of services to contracting to the private and non-profit sectors. However, the field of public administration is the sole academic field given the responsibility for areas ranging from government budgeting at the United States budget levels, community development throughout all localities and states in the United States, and personnel management of all United States workforces, among others.

'''Anna Maria Harkness''' (''[[Birth name|née]]'' '''Richardson''') (October 25, 1837 – March 27, 1926) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[philanthropist]].

She married [[Stephen V. Harkness|Stephen Vanderburgh Harkness]], a businessman of Cleveland, Ohio, in 1851. They were parents of [[Charles W. Harkness|Charles Harkness]], Florence and [[Edward Stephen Harkness]].  Anna's husband [[Stephen V. Harkness|Stephen]] was an early investor with [[John D. Rockefeller]] and became the second-largest shareholder in [[Standard Oil]] before his death in March 1888.

Anna Harkness lost her daughter Florence on July 29, 1895, shortly after Florence's marriage to [[Louis Severance]] in Cleveland, Ohio.  [[Louis Severance]] was a philanthropist and had been the Treasurer of [[Standard Oil]]. Anna M. Harkness and [[Louis Severance]] donated the funds for the construction of the Florence Harkness Memorial Chapel at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

After Anna's and Stephen's son [[Charles W. Harkness]] died in 1917, Anna Harkness gave $3 million to [[Yale University]] for the construction of [[Memorial Quadrangle]] in Charles' memory including [[Harkness Tower]],  the most visible symbol of Yale on the [[New Haven]] skyline. Anna Harkness's portrait is displayed in the dining hall of [[Saybrook College]], part of the Memorial Quadrangle. 

In 1918 Anna Harkness established the [[Commonwealth Fund]] with an initial gift of $10 million and made her son Edward its president. [[Forbes]] listed Edward as the 6th wealthiest individual in the U.S. in 1918 just behind names like  [[John D. Rockefeller]], [[William Rockefeller]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]]. This fund bankrolled the establishment of the [[Harkness Fellowship]]s and the construction of St. Salvator's Hall at the [[University of St Andrews]], the [[Butler Library]] at [[Columbia University]], and many of the undergraduate dormitories at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities (known as "houses" and "residential colleges," respectively).

Anna Harkness donated another $3 million to Yale in 1920 to increase faculty salaries.&lt;ref&gt;Reports Made to the President of Yale University
 By Yale University. President's Office, (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Harkness also made gifts to [[Hampton Institute|Hampton]] and [[Tuskegee Institute]]s, the [[New York Public Library]], the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City|New York]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[New York Zoological Society]] and [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]].  The Harkness Pavilion at [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]] / [[Columbia University Medical Center]] is named for the family.

'''Brand awareness''' refers to the extent to which customers are able to ''recall'' or ''recognise'' a [[brand]].&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary Online, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/brand-awareness.html&lt;/ref&gt; Brand awareness is a key consideration in [[Consumer Behaviour|consumer behavior]], [[advertising management]], [[brand management]] and strategy development. The consumer's ability to recognise or recall a brand is central to purchasing decision-making. Purchasing cannot proceed unless a consumer is first aware of a product category and a brand within that category. Awareness does not necessarily mean that the consumer must be able to recall a specific brand name, but he or she must be able to recall sufficient distinguishing features for purchasing to proceed. For instance, if a consumer asks her friend to buy her some gum in a "blue pack", the friend would be expected to know which gum to buy, even though neither friend can recall the precise brand name at the time.

Different types of brand awareness have been identified, namely ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition''. Key researchers argue that these different types of awareness operate in fundamentally different ways and that this has important implications for the purchase decision process and for marketing communications. Brand awareness is closely related to concepts such as the ''evoked set'' and ''consideration set'' which describe specific aspects of the consumer's purchase decision. Consumers are believed to hold between three and seven brands in their consideration set across a broad range of product categories.&lt;ref&gt;Pham, M. T. and Higgins, E.T., "Promotion and Prevention in Consumer Decision Making: The State of the Art and Theoretical Propositions," in S. Ratneshwar and David Glen Mick, (eds), ''Inside Consumption: Consumer Motives, Goals, and Desires,'' , London: Routledge, 2005, pp 8-43.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers will normally purchase one of the top three brands in their  consideration set.

Brand awareness is a key indicator of a brand's competitive market performance. Given the importance of brand awareness in consumer purchasing decisions, marketers have developed a number of metrics designed to measure brand awareness and other measures of brand health. These metrics are collectively known as '''A'''wareness, '''A'''ttitudes and '''U'''sage (AAU) metrics.

To ensure a product or brand's market success, awareness levels must be managed across the entire product life-cycle - from product launch through to market decline. Many marketers regularly monitor brand awareness levels, and if they fall below a predetermined threshold, the advertising and promotional effort is intensified until awareness returns to the desired level.

== Importance of brand awareness ==

Brand awareness is related to the functions of brand identities in consumers’ memory and can be measured by how well the consumers can identify the brand under various conditions.&lt;ref name="Keller 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin|title=Conceptualizing, measuring, and managing customer-based brand equity|journal=The Journal of Marketing|year=1993|volume=1|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand awareness is also central to understanding the consumer purchase decision process. Strong brand awareness can be a predictor of brand success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ya-Hsin, H., Ya-hei, H., Suh-Yueh, C., &amp; Wenchang, F. (2014). Is Brand Awareness a Marketing Placebo?. International Journal Of Business &amp; Information, 9(1), 29-60.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important measure of ''brand strength'' or ''brand equity'' and is also involved in customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and the customer's brand relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Aaker, D.A. (1991), Managing Brand Equity: Capitalizing on the Value of a Brand Name, N.Y. The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand awareness is a key indicator of a brand's market  performance. Every year advertisers invest substantial sums of money attempting to improve a brand's overall awareness levels. Many marketers regularly monitor brand awareness levels, and if they fall below a predetermined threshold, the advertising and promotional effort is intensified until awareness returns to the desired level. Setting brand awareness goals/ objectives is a key decision in marketing planning and strategy development.

Brand awareness is one of major brand assets that adds value to the product, service or company.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Aaker, D. A. (1991a). Are brand equity investments really worthwhile?.

== Types of brand awareness ==

Marketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.

=== Brand recall===

Brand recall is also known as ''unaided recall'' or ''spontaneous recall'' and refers to the ability of the consumers to correctly elicit a brand name from memory when prompted by a product category.&lt;ref name="Keller 1993"/&gt; Brand recall indicates a relatively strong link between a category and a brand while brand recognition indicates a weaker link. When prompted by a product category, most consumers can only recall a relatively small set of brands, typically around 3–5 brand names. In consumer tests, few consumers can recall more than seven brand names within a given category and for low-interest product categories, most consumers can only recall one or two brand names.&lt;ref&gt;Trout, J. and Ries, A., "The Positioning Era Cometh", ''Advertising Age'' [Special Feature on Positioning], 24 April 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that the number of brands that consumers can recall is affected by both individual and product factors including; brand loyalty, awareness set size, situational, usage factors and education level.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, M. and Parkinson, T.L., "Individual and Product Correlates of Evoked Set Size For Consumer Package Goods", in '' Advances in Consumer Research,''  Vol. 12, Elizabeth C. Hirschman and Moris B. Holbrook (eds), Provo, UT: Association for Consumer Research, pp 492-497, Online: http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6440/volumes/v12/NA-12&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, consumers who are involved with a category, such as heavy users or product enthusiasts, may be able to recall a slightly larger set of brand names than those who are less involved.

===Brand recognition===

Brand recognition is also known as ''aided recall'' and refers to the ability of the consumers to correctly differentiate the brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify the brand name. Instead, it means that consumers can recognise the brand when presented with it at the point-of-sale or after viewing its visual packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263–274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognise it.

==== Top-of-mind awareness====

Consumers will normally purchase one of the top three brands in their consideration set. This is known as  
[[top-of-mind awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,''pp 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, one of the goals for most marketing communications is to increase the probability that consumers will include the brand in their consideration sets.

By definition, top-of-mind awareness is "the first brand that comes to mind when a customer is asked an unprompted question about a category."&lt;ref&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education,&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing top-of-mind awareness among larger groups of consumers (as opposed to a single consumer), it is more often defined as the "most remembered" or "most recalled" brand name(s).&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Koniewski, M., "Brand Awareness and Brand Loyalty", ''PMR Research Paper'', Feb, 2012, www.research-pmr.com&lt;/ref&gt;

A brand that  enjoys top-of-mind awareness will generally be considered as a genuine purchase option, provided that the consumer is favourably disposed to the brand name.&lt;ref&gt;Manternach, L. (2011). Does your brand have top of mind awareness?. ''Corridor Business Journal'', ''7''(52), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Top-of-mind awareness is relevant when consumers make a quick choice between competing brands in low-involvement categories or for impulse type purchases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Driesener, C., Paech, S., Romaniuk, J., &amp; Sharp, B., "Brand and Advertising Awareness: A Replication and extension of a known empirical generalization," ''Australasian Marketing Journal'', vol. 12, no. 3, 2004, pp  70-80&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing implications of brand awareness===

Clearly brand awareness is closely related to the concepts of the ''evoked set'' (defined as the set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when contemplating a purchase) and the ''consideration set'' (defined as the “small set of brands which a consumer pays close attention to when making a purchase decision”).&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. A., &amp; Sheth, J.N. (1969). ''The Theory of Buyer Behaviour''. Wiley, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the advertising's central roles is to create both brand awareness and brand image, in order to increase the likelihood that a brand is included in the consumer's evoked set or consideration set and regarded favourably. &lt;ref&gt;Meenaghan, R., "The role of advertising in brand image development", ''Journal of Product and Brand Management'', Vol. 4, no. 4, 1995, pp.23 - 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers do not learn about products and brands from advertising alone. When making purchase decisions, consumers acquire information from a wide variety of sources in order to inform their decisions. After searching for information about a category, consumers may become aware of a larger number of brands which collectively are known as the ''awareness set''.&lt;ref&gt;Chon, K.Y., Pizam, A. and Mansfeld, Y., ''Consumer Behavior in Travel and Tourism'', 2nd ed, 2000, New York, Haworth, pp 86-87&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the awareness set is likely to change as consumers acquire new information about brands or products.  A review of empirical studies in this area suggests that the consideration set is likely to be at least three times larger than the evoked set.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, J., "A Grounded Model of Consideration Set Size and Composition", in ''Advances in Consumer Research'', Vol. 16, Thomas K. Srull, (ed.) Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research, 1989, pp 749-757, Online: http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/5967/volumes/v16/NA-16&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness alone is not sufficient to trigger a purchase, consumers also need to be favourably disposed to a brand before it will be considered as a realistic purchase option.

The process of moving consumers from brand awareness and a positive brand attitude through to the actual sale is known as ''conversion.'' &lt;ref&gt;Hatten, R.S., ''Small Business Management: Entrepreneurship and Beyond,'' Mason, OH, South-Western Cengage, 2012, p.317&lt;/ref&gt; While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness and brand attitude, it usually requires support from other elements in the marketing program to convert attitudes into actual sales.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,''pp 363-364&lt;/ref&gt; Other promotional activities, such as telemarketing, are vastly superior to advertising in terms of generating sales. Accordingly, the advertising message might attempt to drive consumers to direct sales call centres as part of an integrated communications strategy. &lt;ref&gt;ACCC, ''The Comparator Website Industry in Australia,'' Commonwealth of Australia, 2014, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms or guarantees.

[[File:Shopping list (2098182380).jpg|thumb|''Percy and Rossiter argue that very few shoppers use lists and this has important implications for the purchase decision and advertising strategy'']]

Percy and Rossiter (1992) argue that the two types of awareness, namely ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition'', operate in fundamentally different ways in the purchase decision. For routine purchases such as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), few shoppers carry shopping lists. For them, the presentation of brands at the point-of-sale acts as a visual reminder and triggers category need. In this case, brand recognition is the dominant mode of awareness. For other purchases, where the brand is not present, the consumer first experiences category need then searches memory for brands within that category. Many services, such as home help, gardening services, pizza delivery fall into this category. In this case, the category need precedes brand awareness. Such purchases are recall dominant, and the consumer is more likely to select one of the brands elicited from memory.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L. and Rossiter, J., "A Model of Brand Awareness and Brand Attitude Advertising Strategies", ''Psychology and Marketing'', Vol. 7, no. 4, 1992, pp 263-274&lt;/ref&gt; When brand recall is dominant, it is not necessary for consumers to like the advertisement, but they must like the brand. In contrast, consumers should like the ad when brand recognition is the communications objective. &lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, pp 157-160&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between ''brand recall'' and ''brand recognition'' has important implications for [[advertising]] strategy. When the communications objectives depend on ''brand recognition'', the creative execution must show the brand packaging or a recognisable brand name. However, when the communications objectives rely on ''brand recall'', the creative execution should encourage strong associations between the category and the brand.&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J. R., Percy, L. and Donovan, R.J., “A Better Advertising Planning Grid,” ''Journal of Advertising Research'', vol. 31 (October/November), 1991, pp 11-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers also use jingles, mnemonics and other devices to encourage brand recall.

''Brand dominance'' occurs when, during brand recall tests, most consumers can name only one brand from a given category.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aaker, D. (1996). ''Building Strong Brands.'' New York: Free Press Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Brand dominance is defined as an individual’s selection of only certain brand names in a related category during a brand recall procedure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While brand dominance might appear to be a desirable goal, overall dominance can be a double-edged sword.

[[File:クリネックス (17245624191).jpg|thumb|''When a brand name becomes so well-known that the brand becomes synonymous with the category, the brand is said to have 'gone generic' '']]
A brand name that is well known to the majority of people or households is also called a ''household name'' &lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/household%20name&lt;/ref&gt; and may be an indicator of brand success. Occasionally a brand can become so successful that the brand becomes synonymous with the category. For example, British people often talk about "Hoovering the house" when they actually mean "vacuuming the house." (Hoover is a brand name). When this happens, the brand name is said to have "gone ''generic''." &lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/generic-brand.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of brands becoming generic abound; Kleenex, Cellotape, Nescafe, Aspirin and Panadol. When a brand goes generic, it can present a marketing problem because when the consumer requests a named brand at the retail outlet, they may be supplied with a competing brand. For example, if a person enters a bar and requests "a rum and Coke," the bartender may interpret that to mean a "rum and cola-flavoured beverage,"  paving the way for the outlet to supply a cheaper alternative mixer. In such a scenario, Coca-Cola Ltd, who after investing in brand building for more than a century, is the ultimate loser because it does not get the sale.

== Measuring brand awareness ==

Just as different types of brand awareness can be identified, there are a variety of methods for measuring awareness. Typically, researchers use surveys, carried out on a sample of consumers asking about their knowledge of the focus brand or category.

Two types of recall test are used to measure brand awareness:&lt;ref&gt;Hsia, H.J., ''Mass Communications Research Methods: A Step-by-Step Approach," Routledge"&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Unaided recall tests'': where the respondent is presented with a product category and asked to nominate as many brands as possible. Thus, the unaided recall test provides the respondent with no clues or cues. Unaided recall tests are used to test for brand recall.
*''Aided recall test'': where the respondent is prompted with a brand name and asked whether they have seen it or heard about it. In some aided recall tests, the respondent might also be asked to explain what they know about the brand e.g. to describe package, colour, logo or other distinctive features. Aided recall tests are used to test for brand recognition.
*''Other brand-effects tests'': In addition, to recall tests, brand research often employs a battery of tests, such as brand association tests, brand attitude, brand image, brand dominance, brand value, brand salience and other measures of brand health. Although these tests do not explicitly measure brand awareness, they provide general measures of brand health and often are used in conjunction with brand recall tests.

To measure brand salience, for example, researchers place products on a shelf in a supermarket, giving each brand equal shelf space. Consumers are shown photographs of the shelf display and ask consumers to name the brands noticed. The speed at which consumers nominate a given brand is an indicator of brand's ''visual salience.'' This type of research can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of packaging design and brand logos. &lt;ref&gt; Sutherland, M. and Sylvester, A.K., ''Advertising and the Mind of the Consumer: What Works, What Doesn't and Why,'' Great Britain, Kogan Page, 2000 pp 198-199&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of commercial research firms (e.g. Interbrand,&lt;ref&gt;Interbrand, http://interbrand.com/best-brands/&lt;/ref&gt; Millward-Brown,&lt;ref&gt;Millward-Brown, http://www.millwardbrown.com/brandz/top-global-brands&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen (Asia) &lt;ref&gt;Campaign Asia, http://www.campaignasia.com/Top1000Brands&lt;/ref&gt;) monitor brand effects for key international brands and the topline survey findings are widely published in business press, trade press and online. It is worth noting that these commercially compiled lists are not popularity contests, but use clearly articulated methodologies to compile lists based on consumer responses collected in structured research. However, these listings use a variety of metrics, so the results are not directly comparable and it cannot be assumed that they measure brand awareness. As with the interpretation of all research, it is important for readers to familiarise themselves with the methodologies used in order to clarify what exactly is being measured and how the data was collected.

Obviously, most marketers aim to build high levels of brand awareness within relevant market segments, giving rise to a continuing interest in developing the right metrics to measure brand effects. Metrics used to measure brand effects are collectively termed AAU metrics ('''A'''wareness, '''A'''ttitudes and '''U'''sage).&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0137058292}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brand awareness and the hierarchy of effects ==

{{See also|DAGMAR|AIDA (marketing){{!}}AIDA}}
[[File:Hierarchy of effects.jpg|thumb|Basic Hierarchy of Effects Model (after Lavidge, 1961)]]
Brand awareness is a standard feature of a group of models known as hierarchy of effects models. Hierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages, beginning with brand awareness (or category awareness) and culminating in the purchase decision. &lt;ref&gt;Egan, J., ''Marketing Communications,'' London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; In these models, advertising and marketing communications operate as an external stimulus and the purchase decision is a consumer response.

A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including DAGMAR and AIDA.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., "The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad," in ''Branding and Advertising'', Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of more than 250 papers, Vakratsas and Ambler (1999) found little empirical support for any of the hierarchies of effects.&lt;ref&gt;Demetrios Vakratsas and Tim Ambler, "How Advertising Works: What Do We Really Know?" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 63, No. 1, 1999, pp. 26-43 DOI: 10.2307/1251999 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251999&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of that, some authors have argued that hierarchical models continue to dominate theory, especially in the area of marketing communications and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;O’Shaughnessy, J.,  ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''hierarchy of effects'' developed by Lavidge in the 1960s is one of the original hierarchical models. It proposes that customers progress through a sequence of six stages from brand awareness through to the purchase of a product.&lt;ref name="Lavidge,R.J 1961, pp 59-62"&gt;Lavidge,R.J. and Steiner, G.A., "A Model for Predictive Measures of Advertising Effectiveness," ''Journal of Marketing'', October, 1961, pp 59-62&lt;/ref&gt;
::::: '''Stage 1''':   '''Awareness ''' -  The consumer becomes aware of a category, product or brand (usually through advertising)
:::::::::::::::: ↓
::::: '''Stage 2''':   '''Knowledge'''  -  The consumer learns about the brand (e.g. sizes, colours, prices, availability etc)
:::::::::::::::: ↓
::::: '''Stage 3''':   '''Liking''' -      The consumer develops a favourable/unfavourable disposition towards the brand
:::::::::::::::: ↓
::::: '''Stage 4''':   '''Preference'''  - The consumer begins to rate one brand above other comparable brands
:::::::::::::::: ↓
::::: '''Stage 5''':   '''Conviction''' -  The consumer demonstrates a desire to purchase (via inspection, sampling, trial)
:::::::::::::::: ↓
::::: '''Stage 6''':   '''Purchase'''  -   The consumer acquires the product

Hierarchical models have been widely adapted and many variations can be found, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition (C)- Affect (A) - Behaviour (B) and for this reason, they are sometimes known as C-A-B models.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, T.E., "The Development of the Hierarchy of Effects: An Historical Perspective," '' Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising'' vol. 10, no. 2, 1987, pp. 251–295&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more recent adaptations are designed to accommodate the consumer's digital media habits and opportunities for social influence.

Selected alternative hierarchical models follow:

Hirschman and Moris B.

===Marketing Implications of hierarchical models===

It should be evident that brand awareness constitutes just one of six stages that outline the typical consumer's progress towards a purchase decision. While awareness is a necessary precondition for a purchase, awareness alone cannot guarantee the ultimate purchase. Consumers may be aware of a brand, but for different reasons, may not like it or may fail to develop a preference for that brand. Hence, brand awareness is an indicator of sales performance, but does not account for all sales performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, p. 107-109&lt;/ref&gt;  For these reasons, marketers use a variety of metrics, including cognitive, affective and behavioral variables, to monitor a brand's market performance.

As consumers move through the ''hierarchy of effects'' (awareness→ knowledge→ liking→ preference→ conviction→ purchase), they rely on different sources of information to learn about brands.  While main media advertising is useful for creating awareness, its capacity to convey long or complex messages is limited. In order to acquire more detailed knowledge about a brand, consumers rely on different sources such as product reviews, expert opinion, word-of-mouth referrals and brand/ corporate websites. As consumers move closer to the actual purchase, they begin to rely on more personal sources of information such as recommendations from friends and relatives or the advice of sales representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivasan,N., "Pre-purchase External Search Information," in Valarie A. Zeithaml (ed), ''Review of Marketing 1990'', Marketing Classics Press (AMA), 2011, pp 153-189&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the opinion of an influential blogger might be enough to shore up preference/conviction while a salesperson might be necessary to close the actual purchase.

[[File:The Purchase Funnel.jpg|thumb|The Purchase Funnel indicates that awareness is a necessary precondition for purchase]]

All hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude or brand liking, which serves to underscore the importance of creating high levels of awareness as early as possible in a [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)|product or brand life-cycle]]. Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market. When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the advertising effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a [[Purchase funnel|funnel]].&lt;ref&gt;Court, D.  Elzinga, D., Mulder, S. and Vetvik, O.J., "The Consumer Decision Journey", ''McKinsey Quarterly'', June 2009, Online: http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-consumer-decision-journey&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly targeted promotions such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand.

== Creating and maintaining brand awareness ==

{{See also|Product life-cycle management (marketing)|Brand management|Advertising management}}

Brand advertising can increase the probability that a consumer will include a given brand in his or her consideration set. Brand-related advertising expenditure has a positive affect on brand awareness levels. Virtually anything that exposes consumers to a brand increases brand awareness. “Repeat brand exposure in stores improves consumers' ability to recognize and recall the brand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Huang, R., &amp; Sarigöllü, E. (2012). How brand awareness relates to market outcome, brand equity, and the marketing mix. Journal Of Business Research, 6592-99.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased exposure to brand advertising can increase consumer awareness and facilitate consumer processing of the included information, and by doing this it can heighten consumers brand recall and attitude towards the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schmidt, S., &amp; Eisend, M. (2015). Advertising Repetition: A Meta-Analysis on Effective Frequency in Advertising. Journal Of Advertising, 44(4), 415-428.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Product life-cycle curve.jpg|centre|thumb|613x613px|Brand marketers must consider how to manage awareness throughout a product's entire life-cycle]]

To increase the probability of a product's acceptance by the market, it is important to create high levels of brand awareness as early as practical in a product or brand's life-cycle. To achieve top-of-mind awareness, marketers have traditionally, relied on intensive '''advertising''' campaigns, especially at the time of a product launch.&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G, Belch, M.A, Kerr, G. and Powell, I., ''Advertising and Promotion Management: An Integrated Marketing Communication Perspective'', McGraw-Hill, Sydney, Australia, 2009, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; To be successful, an intensive campaign utilises both broad ''reach'' (expose more people to the message) and high ''frequency'' (expose people multiple times to the message). Advertising, especially main media advertising, was seen as the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create high awareness levels. Nevertheless, intensive advertising campaigns can become very expensive and can rarely be sustained for long periods.

As new products enter the market growth stage, the number of competitors tends to increase with implications for market share. Marketers may need to maintain awareness at some predetermined level to ensure steady sales and stable market share. Marketers often rely on rough and ready 'rules-of-thumb' to estimate the amount of advertising expenditure required to achieve a given level of awareness. For instance, it was often held that to increase brand awareness by just one per cent, it was necessary to double the dollars spent on advertising.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, Jones, J.P, ''The Ultimate Secrets of Advertising'', Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

When a brand becomes established and attains the desired awareness levels (typically outlined in the marketing plan), the brand advertiser will shift from an intensive advertising campaign to a ''reminder campaign.''  The objective of a reminder campaign is simply to keep target audiences aware of the brand's existence and to introduce new life into the brand offer.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary (online), http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/reminder-advertising.html&lt;/ref&gt; A reminder campaign typically maintains broad reach, but with reduced frequency and as a consequence is a less expensive advertising option. Reminder advertising is used by established brands, often when they are entering the maturity stage of the ''[[product lifecycle]].'' In the decline stage, marketers often shift to a ''caretaker'' or maintenance program where advertising expenditure is cut back.

[[File:A serviceman accesses social media channels using an iPad, outside MOD Main Building in London MOD 45156052.jpg|thumb|''The rise of digital media and social networks is changing the way that consumers search for product information'']]

While advertising remains important for creating awareness, a number of changes in the media landscape and to consumer media habits have reduced the reliance on main media advertising. Instead, marketers are seeking to place their brand messages across a much wider variety of platforms. An increasing amount of consumer time and attention is devoted to digital communications devices - from computers and tablets through to cellphones. It is now possible to engage with consumers in a more cost efficient manner using platforms such as social media networks that command massive audiences. For example, Facebook has become an extremely important communications channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dokyun, L., Hosanagar, K., &amp; Nair, H. S. (2015). Advertising Content and Consumer Engagement on Social Media: Evidence from Facebook. Working Papers (Faculty) -- Stanford Graduate School Of Business, 1-41.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, social media channels allow for two-way, interactive communications that are not paralleled by traditional main media. Interactive communications provide more opportunities for brands to connect with audience members and to move beyond simple awareness, facilitating brand preference, brand conviction and ultimately brand loyalty.

The rise of social media networks has increased the opportunities for ''opinion leaders'' to play a role in brand awareness.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Malaska, M., Saraniemi, S., &amp; Tahtinen, J. (2010, September). ''Co-creation of Branding by Network Actors''. Paper presented at 10th Annual EBRF Conference: Co-Creation as a Way Forward, (pp. 15-17), Nokia, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, anyone can be an opinion leader e.g. celebrities, journalists or public figures, but the rise of the digital environment has changed our understanding of who is a potentially useful influencer. Indeed, the digital environment has created more opportunities for bloggers to become important influencers because they are seen as accessible, authentic and tend to have loyal followings.&lt;ref&gt;Paul McIntyre, “Independent bloggers overtake celebrities as key social media influencers”, '' Australian Financial Review'' , 22 June 2015 Online:http://www.afr.com/business/independent-bloggers-overtake-celebrities-as-key-social-media-influencers-20150528-ghbovu&lt;/ref&gt; Bloggers have become key influencers in important consumer goods and services including fashion, consumer electronics, food and beverage, cooking, restaurant dining and bars. For example, a recent survey by Collective Bias, showed that when it comes to product endorsements digital influencers are more popular than celebrities. Findings showed that only 3% of participants said they would consider buying a celebrity-endorsed item, in comparison to 60% who said they had been influenced by a blog review or social media post when shopping.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, N., "Celebrity Vs Shopper" ''Harper's Bazaar'' (Australia), 2 April 2016 Online: http://www.harpersbazaar.com.au/news/fashion-buzz/2016/4/bloggers-are-more-popular-than-celebrities/&lt;/ref&gt; For marketers, the digital landscape has made it somewhat easier to identify social influencers.

== Popular examples of brand advertising and promotion ==

The following examples illustrate how brand awareness and brand advertising are used in practice.

===Coca-Cola '[[Share a Coke]]' Campaign===

{{main article|Share a Coke}}
[[File:"Share a Coke" (14823114294).jpg|thumb|The '[[Share a Coke]]' campaign received multiple creative effectiveness Lion Awards at Cannes]]

Coca-Cola is a well-established brand with a long history and one that has achieved market dominance. For any brand, such as Coke, that controls some 70 percent of market share, there are relatively few opportunities to enlist new customers. Yet Coca-Cola is always on the lookout for novel communications that not only maintain its brand awareness, but that bring the brand to the attention of new audiences. The company launched a campaign which became known as ‘Share a Coke’, with the campaign objectives; "to strengthen the brand’s bond with Australia’s young adults – and inspire shared moments of happiness in the real and virtual worlds." &lt;ref&gt;Coca-Cola company. "Share a Coke: How the Groundbreaking Campaign Got Its Start ‘Down Under’", Retrieved from http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/share-a-coke-how-the-groundbreaking-campaign-got-its-start-down-under/&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign, originally launched in Australia became so successful that it was subsequently rolled out to other countries.

The concept was to introduce personalized Coke bottles or cans. Popular names were written in a 'look-alike Spencerian script' which is part of the Coke brand's distinctive brand identity. The campaign organisers seeded social media by targeting opinion leaders and influencers to get them to them lead the conversation and encourage others to seek out “Share a Coke” for themselves. &lt;ref&gt;Coca Cola, Share a Coke, [Brand campaign website],https://www.shareacoke.com&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Ogilvy, Share a Coke Campaign Brief and Creative Concept, [Advertising agency], http://ogilvy.com.au/our-work/share-coke&lt;/ref&gt; Within days celebrities and others with no connection to Coke were spreading the concept across social networks. The campaign extended the audience reach as more people were exposed to the messages. According to Coke's creative team, "That [Australian] summer, Coke sold more than 250 million named bottles and cans in a nation of just under 23 million people". This campaign helped Coke extend its awareness across a broader age profile as they interacted with each customer on a personal level. &lt;ref&gt;Coca-Cola company. "Share a Coke: How the Groundbreaking Campaign Got Its Start ‘Down Under’", Retrieved from http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/share-a-coke-how-the-groundbreaking-campaign-got-its-start-down-under/&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Ronald McDonald]] and anthropomorphic brand characters===

[[File:Ronald McDonald, Quetzaltenango.jpg|thumb|[[Ronald McDonald]] is an anthropomorphic brand character that has become part of McDonald's brand identity.]]

Consumers experience few difficuties assigning a personality to a brand and marketing communications often encourage consumers to think about brands as possessing human characteristics. &lt;ref&gt;Puzakova, M.,  Kwak,H. and Rocereto, J., "Pushing the Envelope of Brand and Personality: Antecedents and Moderators of Anthropomorphized Brands", in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 36, Ann L. McGill and Sharon Shavitt, Duluth (eds), MN: Association for Consumer Research, 2007, pp 413-420.[url]: http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/14399/volumes/v36/NA-36&lt;/ref&gt; When brands are infused with human-like characteristics, it can assist in communicating a brand's values and creating distinctive brand identities that serve to differentiate an offering from competing brands. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. C., Graetz, B. R. and Westerbeek, H. M., "Brand personality in a membership‐based organisation", ''International Journal of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Marketing,'' Vol. 11 No. 3, 2006, pp. 251-266.&lt;/ref&gt;  “In an increasingly competitive marketplace, [some] companies rely on brand characters to create awareness, convey key product/service attributes or benefits, and attract consumers" (Keller, 2003). 

The use of anthropomorphic characters has a long history. For example, the [[Michelin man]], employed as a memorable character to sell Michelin car tyres, was introduced as early as 1894. These characters benefit the brand by creating memorable images in the consumer’s mind while conveying meanings that are consistent with the brand's values.

McDonald's created a similar “anthropomorphic brand character” known as Ronald Mcdonald as part of its brand identity. For younger consumers, Ronald McDonald injects a sense of fun and mystery into the McDonald's brand. For parents, the character clearly signals that McDonald's is a family friendly venue. Characters help to carry the brand's identity and can be seen as non-human 'spokes-character', contributing to a strong brand differentiation. The likeability of the brands character can “positively influence attitudes towards the brand and increase [consumers'] purchase intention” &lt;ref&gt;Hosany, S., Prayag, G., Martin, D., &amp; Lee, W., "Theory and Strategies of Anthropomorphic Brand Characters from Peter Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, and Ronald McDonald, to Hello Kitty. ''Journal of Marketing Management'', vol. 29, no 1/2, 2013, pp 48-68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mini===
The well-known automotive manufacturer, Mini, investigated its brand perception in the UK by carrying out 55 in-depth interview designed to elicit key feedback about the brand's values. Consumers felt that the symbolic elements which represented the brand were that it was “fun, stylish and sporty image”.&lt;ref name="Simms, C. D. 2006"&gt;Simms, C. D., &amp; Trott, P. (2006). "The perceptions of the BMW Mini brand: the importance of historical associations and the development of a model," ''Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management'', 228-238.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Customer engagement]] with the MINI brand on a Facebook fan-page, promoted “positive effects on consumers’ brand awareness, through WOM activities and the purchase intention was achieved”.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Hutter, K., Hautz, J., Dennhardt, S., &amp; Fuller, J. (2013), "The impact of user interactions in social media on brand awareness and purchase intention: the case of MINI on Facebook," ''Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management'', 342-351.&lt;/ref&gt; The brand, therefore, connected with users at an emotional level.&lt;ref name="Simms, C. D. 2006"/&gt;

'''Central location tests''' are a type of Quantitative research technique. They are [[Product (business)|product]] [[marketing]] [[Marketing research|tests]] performed in [[controlled environment]]s, contrary to [[home-user test]]s, which take place where the products would actually be used. 

A Central Location Test (CLT) is one in which the research is conducted in a location such as a room in a shopping mall. In this instance, consumers would be recruited to participate in a research product at the mall and the research would be conducted and completed at that time.

'''Claus Josef Riedel''' (19 February 1925 – 17 March 2004) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] glassmaker, businessman, professor of chemistry, and [[chemical engineer]]. He was the 9th-generation owner of [[Riedel (glass manufacturer)|Riedel Crystal]], an Austrian glassware manufacturer that was established in 1756. Riedel is best known for creating and producing grape variety-specific glassware designed to enhance types of wines based on specific properties of individual grape varieties. He was among the first glassware experts in history to recognize that the taste of wine is affected by the shape of the glass from which it is consumed, and is credited with first discovering the concept of variety-specificity in glassware, developing variety-specific glassware shapes and bringing these glasses to the consumer market. Riedel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal from 1957 until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Claus-Riedel-Wineglass-Innovator-Dies-at-79_21942], Claus Riedel, Wineglass Innovator, Dies at 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Claus Riedel was born in Polaun, now part of [[Kořenov]], [[Bohemia]] (present-day [[Czech Republic]]), to Walter Riedel, a glassmaker, and Claudia Prollius Riedel. Claus Riedel was drafted by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in [[World War II]], where he fought Italian partisans in [[Tuscany]] and [[Liguria]]. In March 1945 he was captured by American forces and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp near [[Pisa, Italy]] for ten months. In January 1946, while being returned to Germany for repatriation, Riedel escaped by jumping from a train entering [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/24/world/claus-josef-riedel-crystal-maker-who-suited-glass-to-wine-is-dead-at-79.html], Claus Josef Riedel, Crystal Maker Who Suited Glass to Wine, Is Dead at 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riedel remained in Austria, finding a job with glassmaker [[Daniel Swarovski]], who had once been an apprentice to Riedel’s great-grandfather Josef Riedel. He also enrolled in the [[University of Innsbruck]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], where he studied chemistry. After graduating, he spent five years working various jobs throughout Europe. In 1955 he was contacted by The [[Austrian People’s Party]] Prime Minister, Reinhard Kamitz, who invited him to take over the bankrupt Tiroler Glashütte glassware factory.

==Restarting the Riedel company==
Walter Riedel had been employed during World War II by the Germans to blow vacuum tubes for electronic equipment. In that capacity he had been captured by the conquering Russian army in 1945, and taken to the USSR as a prisoner of war. After ten years he was released, and  found his way to Austria, where he joined Claus. With assistance from Swarovski, the two Riedels were able to reopen the glassware factory by 1957, turning it into today’s Riedel Glass Factory in [[Kufstein]], Austria. Prior to World War II, the factory had produced heavy industrial glass, but upon reopening, Claus Riedel changed its focus to fine hand-made glass. Claus Riedel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal from 1957 until 1994, when he turned the reins over to his son [[Georg Josef Riedel]], who later was succeeded by his son [[Maximilian Riedel]], who is the current President and CEO of Riedel Crystal.

==Design Innovations==
As a glassmaker, Riedel was interested primarily in function over appearance, and broke away from the traditional richly cut, heavy and thick glass designs of the time. He spent 16 years studying the physics of wine delivery to the mouth and taste buds and experimenting with different glass configurations, matching them with wines of different regions, grape origin and age to create stemware that would match and complement specific wines and spirits. He was among the first glassware experts in history to recognize that the taste of wine is affected by the shape of the glass from which it is consumed.

From these experiments, Riedel created the Burgundy Grand Cru glass in 1958, made to enhance the flavors and aromas of the Pinot Noir and Nebbiolo grape variety, specifically for Burgundy, Barolo, and Barbaresco wines. This creation was first exhibited at the World Exhibition in Brussels, Expo 58 (The Brussels Worlds Fair), where it received a Gold Medal for its creative and striking design. It was acquired by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York for the museum’s permanent collection.

In 1961, Riedel Crystal introduced the first full line of wine glasses created for different wines. Riedel perfected these variety-specific wine glasses in 1973 with the introduction of his most notable glass collection, the Sommeliers Series, the world’s first gourmet glasses.

==Awards and nominations==
Claus Riedel was honored with 28 design prizes and awards for his creations. Notable honors include:
*1958:  World Exhibition, [[Expo 58]], [[Brussels]] – Gold Medal
*1958: [[Museum of Modern Art]], Burgundy Grand Cru glass selected for permanent collection 
*1959: Sommeliers Series Burgundy Grand Cru glass awarded Most Beautiful Glass in the World, [[Corning Museum of Glass]]
*1960: La Triennale di Milano, Silver Medal 
*1966: American Institute of Interior Designers Award

==Personal life==
During his lifetime, Claus Riedel was married five times to four different women (he married Ute two separate times).

On 17 March 2004, Riedel died in [[Genoa, Italy]] from heart failure while visiting family. He was survived by his fourth wife Ute, by two children from previous marriages (Georg Riedel and Barbara Riedel Orehounig), and a son (Wenzel Riedel) by Ute Riedel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">'''Commercial Alert''' is a project of [[Public Citizen]], a [[consumer advocacy]] non-profit organization. Commercial Alert opposes advertising to children and the commercialization of culture, education, and government. It works on issues such as [[commercialism]], [[consumerism]], [[product placement]], [[native advertising]], [[advertising in schools]], [[ad-creep]], and [[privacy]]. It works to reduce the negative impacts of advertising on public health, such as [[obesity]]. It was co-founded in 1999 by prominent consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]].

The mission of Commercial Alert is "to keep the commercial culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting children and subverting the higher values of family, community, environmental integrity and democracy".

In 2001, it complained to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] that [[Internet search engine]]s were failing to unambiguously label paid results as advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-06-29/business/17548366_1_search-engines-terra-lycos-search-results|title=Sites told to 'fess up / Search results often advertisers |last=Kopytoff|first=Verne |date=June 29, 2002 |work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-07-16-search-engines.htm|title=Search engines accused of deceptive advertising|last=Associated Press|date=July 16, 2001|work=USA Today|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/aug2001/nf2001086_115.htm|title= The Search Engines' Little Secret|last=Salkever  |first=Alex |date=August 6, 2001|work=Business Week|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Federal Trade Commission rejected a request by Commercial Alert to identify [[product placement]] in television programs as advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15671-2005Feb10.html|title=FTC Rejects Ad Labeling on TV |last=Mayer |first=Caroline E. |date=February 11, 2005|work=Washington Post|pages=E04 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Commercial Alert criticized [[Jack Daniel's|Jack Daniels]] sponsorship of the television series ''[[Mad Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKN2131866620070622|title=Watchdog irked by booze-sex link on TV drama |last=Schiller|first=Gail |date=June 21, 2007 |work=Reuters/Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Don Francesco Antonio Maria Matarazzo, Count Matarazzo''' (March 9, 1854 in [[Castellabate]] – December 10, 1937 in São Paulo, [[Brazil]]), was an Italian-Brazilian businessman and [[Nobility|noble]] who created a large business in [[South America]], particularly in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://entrepreneurreview.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/count-francesco-matarazzo-royalty-in-life-and-in-business/|title=Count Francesco Matarazzo: Royalty in Life and in Business|last=entrepreneurreview|date=2015-12-18|website=The Entrepreneur Review|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Castellabate]], [[Salerno]], Italy, the eldest of Doctor Costabile Matarazzo's nine sons, and Mariangela Jovane. At the age of 26, when [[Italian Brazilian#Italian immigration to Brazil|Italian emigration to Brazil]] was widespread, he moved to  the city of [[Sorocaba]], [[São Paulo]] with his brothers, wife and children.&lt;ref name=Treccani&gt;{{cite web|title=MATARAZZO, Francesco|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-matarazzo_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|work=TRECCANI, La cultura italiana|access-date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially he sold oranges and lottery tickets and shined shoes, reinvesting the proceeds in new businesses, eventually including plantations of tea, coffee, corn, rice, rubber and cotton.&lt;ref name="Barnes &amp; Barnes, 2001"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nazi Refugee Turned Gestapo Spy: The Life of Hans Wesemann, 1895–1971 | publisher=Praeger Publishers |author1=Barnes, James J  |author2=Barnes, Patience P | year=2001 | pages=11 | isbn=0-275-97124-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, he moved to São Paulo and with his brothers, Giuseppe and Luigi, founded Matarazzo and Irmãos. He diversified its business and imported wheat flour from the [[United States of America]]. Giuseppe took part in the company with a lard factory in [[Porto Alegre]] and Luigi with a deposit-warehouse in São Paulo.

The following year the company was dissolved and replaced by Companhia Matarazzo SA with 43 minority shareholders. This corporation also controlled the factories in Sorocaba and Porto Alegre.

War between [[Spain]] and [[Central America]]n countries made it difficult buy wheat flour and he obtained credit from the [[London and Brazilian Bank]] to build a mill in São Paulo. From there, his business expanded rapidly to a total of 365 factories{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} throughout Brazil. The conglomerate became the fourth largest in the country and 6% of the population depended on its factories in São Paulo. The business was renamed '''Indústrias Reunidas Francisco Matarazzo''' (IRFM) in 1911.

The Gestapo spy [[Hans Wesemann]] reported that:

{{bq|text=An entire fleet sails under his flag. Tens of thousands of workers toil in his factories. He makes cement, cuts down trees and turns the pulp into paper, on which he prints his newspapers. The public drinks his beer and watches films in his cinemas. He contrives to be both wealthy and popular and when the president of Brazil visits Sao Paolo, he calls upon Matarazzo first.&lt;ref name="Barnes &amp; Barnes, 2001"/&gt;}}

In recognition of his financial and material assistance to Italy during the [[First World War]] King Victor Emmanuel III conferred the title of [[Count]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Matarazzo died in 1937 after an attack of [[uremia]]. At that time he was Brazil's's richest man, with an estimated fortune of 10 billion U.S. dollars.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The '''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe''' was an international aeronautical speed competition instituted on 25 August 1909 by the French oil magnate [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]]. The race was reinstated three times through the years at the initiative of the [[Aéro-Club de France]], and later by  Deutsch de la Meurthe's widow Suzanne.

==First Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
Announced in 1906, the first Deutsch de la Meurthe competition was a speed trial intended for all powered aircraft over a distance of 200 kilometres, to be flown as an outward leg of 100 km followed by a return to the starting point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6551284g/f7.image.r=Deutsch%20de%20la%20Meurthe Bulletin Officiel de l'Aėro-Club de France] [[l'Aėrophile]], March 1906, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The flight had to be made between  1 March and  31 October, and the performance was recognized only if the previous best performance was surpassed by at least 10%. A bonus of 20,000 [[French franc|francs]] was awarded each year for the best performance that had remained unsurpassed for eight months. The Coupe (cup), an objet d'art valued at 10,000 francs, was to be given to the first aircraft builder who won three consecutive competitions.&lt;ref name=flight1919&gt;{{cite |journal=Flight |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201366.html |title=Coupe Henry Deutsch de l a Meurthe |volume=XI |number=564|date=16 October 1919 |page= 1368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===1912 competition===
Despite the substantial prize being offered, it took six years to attract participants. On 12 April 1912, [[Maurice Tabuteau]] piloting a 50&amp;nbsp;hp [[Gnome et Rhône|Gnome]]-powered [[Morane-Saulnier]] monoplane flew the circuit in 1 h 47 min 48 s, despite persistent navigation problems caused by fog. On 1 May 1912 Parisian Emmanuel Hélen completed the course at {{convert|119.532|kph|mph|abbr=on}} flying a 70&amp;nbsp;hp Gnome-powered [[Nieuport]] monoplane. Since no other pilot bettered this performance by more than 10% before 31 October 1912, Hélen became the first holder of the Coupe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200317.html Flight, 5 May 1921, p. 317]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1913 competition===
On 27 October 1913 [[Eugène Gilbert]] gained first place in the second competition for the Coupe, covering the course at an average speed of {{convert|154.38|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in a 160 h.p. Gnome-powered [[Deperdussin Monocoque]].

===1919/1920 competition===
[[File:Nieuport-Delage 29V racer.jpg|thumb|Nieuport-Delage NiD.29V racer]]
The competition was interrupted by the [[World War I|First World War]], but on 13 October 1919 it resumed using the same course, but the competition was now open for the entire year, and the trophy would be definitely kept by the first participant whose time remained unbeaten for eight consecutive months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201390.html Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe] ''Flight'' 23 October 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Four aeroplanes participated in this trial: a 180&amp;nbsp;hp [[Hispano-Suiza]]-powered [[Gourdou-Leseurre]] monoplane piloted by Rost, a 300&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza-powered [[Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés|SPAD]]-Herbemont piloted by [[Joseph Sadi-Lecointe]], a 300&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza-powered Nieuport biplane piloted by [[Bernard Barny de Romanet]], and a 180&amp;nbsp;hp Le Rhöne-powered Nieuport monoplane designed by engineer Mary, and flown by the Danish pilot [[Leth Jensen]]. Taking off on 13 October 1919, Jensen flew the circuit at an average speed of 200.001&amp;nbsp;km/h (57 minutes). The next day, Rost reached an average speed of 210&amp;nbsp;km/h while de Romanet had an aircraft failure. On 15 October, Sadi-Lecointe flew a first circuit at 223&amp;nbsp;km/h, and then a second lap at 246.9&amp;nbsp;km/h and thus became the title holder. On 21 October 1919, de Romanet reached an average speed of 268.631&amp;nbsp;km/h which was insufficient to be homologated, because this performance was less than 110% of Sadi-Lecointe's performance. He followed it the next day with an average speed of 285.600 km/h which did count. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201420.html "The Coupe Deutsch"] ''Flight'' 30 October 1919 p1422&lt;/ref&gt; Bad weather then stopped the competition, which was resumed just three months later. On 3 January 1920, Sadi-Lecointe, who had in the meanwhile had left [[Blériot-SPAD]] for Nieuport, reached {{convert|266.314|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;"The Deutsch Cup Contest" ''Flight'' 8 January 1920 p56&lt;/ref&gt;  with a Hispano-engined [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29]]V. On 3 August 1920, he became the holder of the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe, his performance having remained unbeaten.

==Second Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
In 1920, following the ending of the [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Gordon Bennett Trophy]] competition due to a third consecutive French victory, the Aéro-Club de France decided to organize a new competition to replace it. This was named ''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe'' to honour [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]], who had died on 24 November 1919; the competition was funded by his family.

It remained a speed competition, but was now to be held on a given date. The competition was to be held as 3 laps of a 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi) circuit, with its start at [[Étampes]] and a turn made at la Marmogne farm at [[Gidy]]. The competition was open for three years and was international, with each country allowed three entrants. A sum of 60,000 francs was to be awarded each year for the best performance, and a cup valued at 20,000 francs given to the winner. In the case of the cup being won outright before the end of the competition, the winner would also received the remaining prize money&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200327.html |title=Coupe Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe |journal=Flight |date=12 May 1921 |page=327 |format=pdf |number=645 |volume=XIII)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1921 competition===
[[File:Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan.jpg|thumb|Nieuport NiD.41 Sesquiplan]]
There were seven participants in this race, which was held on 1 October. No eliminating heats were needed to select from the five French pilot entrants, since Count [[Bernard Barny de Romanet|Bernard de Romanet]] died when the wing fabric of his Lumière-De Monge monoplane&lt;ref group=note&gt;The aircraft could be configured as either a biplane or a monoplane.&lt;/ref&gt; detached at high speed during the elimination trials on 23 September, and at the last moment [[Hanriot (aircraft company)|Hanriot]] withdrew their entrant, the Hanriot HD.22. This was a metal monoplane with retractable landing gear expressly built for the race, and which had been intended to be piloted by Rost. Nieuport entered two [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29|Nieuport NiD.29V]]s  piloted by Sadi-Lecointe and Ferdinand Lasne, and a [[Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan|NiD.41 Sesquiplan]] was entrusted to Georges Kirsch. A 700&amp;nbsp;hp Fiat-powered [[Fiat Aviazione|Fiat]] biplane piloted by [[Francesco Brack Papa]] represented Italy, and British pilot Herbert James flew a 450&amp;nbsp;hp [[Napier Lion]]-powered [[Nieuport Nighthawk|Gloster Mars I]] (G-EAXZ).&lt;ref name=flight1921&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200650.html The Coupe de Deutsch de la Meurthe] ''Flight'', 29 September 1921, pp. 650-651]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;
A broken propeller forced Sadi-Lecointe to make a forced landing in a beet field at Cernonville, injuring an eye and both legs in the process. The wing fabric of James' aeroplane was torn away, and he had to make a forced landing. Brach Papa established a new Italian speed record, but the engine exploded before the finish. Thus, only two Nieuport pilots were left to finish the race, Georges Kirsch winning with a speed of 282.75&amp;nbsp;km/h (a new world speed record for a distance of 300&amp;nbsp;km); Fernand Lasne's speed was 259.03&amp;nbsp;km/h.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

===1922 competition===
The 1921 circuit remained unchanged for the 1922 competition, which was held on 30 September. Nieuport-Astra&lt;ref group=note&gt;Nieuport having taken over the [[Société Astra]] by this point&lt;/ref&gt; entered a Nieuport NiD.29V piloted by Lasne and the sesquiplane piloted by Sadi-Lecointe, [[Jean Casale]] was piloting a Blériot-SPAD S.58, a design based on the [[Blériot-SPAD S.41|S.41 fighter]]. Fiat and Gloster were presenting the same machines and pilots as the preceding year. Assigned to their factory pilot Berthelin, who was new to this competition, the NiD.41 was retired at the last moment. The [[tailless aircraft|tailless]] Simplex aircraft which was supposed to be piloted by [[Georges Madon]] had an accident during its tests, and [[Charles Nungesser]] was absent.&lt;ref name=flight1922&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1922/1922%20-%200573.html |title=The race for the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe |journal= Flight |date=5 October 1922 |pages=573-576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Nieuport sesquiplane named ''Eugène Gilbert'' (race number 5), Sadi-Lecointe covered the first 100&amp;nbsp;km at an average speed of 325&amp;nbsp;km/h (a new closed circuit speed record), but a spark plug popped out of its cylinder and passed through the engine cowling as he was turning around the airport pylon. The pilot was therefore forced to land, and the airplane hit a gutter which turned the aircraft on its back without injuring the pilot. James lost his maps during his flight and unable to find the turning point returned to the start. Jean Casale's SPAD S.58 ''Louis Blériot'' (race no.3) was victim of a radiator leak, and made a forced landing at Étampes and was unable to finish the race, as was also the case for Brack-Papa's [[Fiat B.R.|Fiat R.700]] which had a fuel pump failure.{{cn|date=September 2015}} The first lap made by the Italian pilot at 288&amp;nbsp;km/h (179&amp;nbsp;mph) was not homologated since the aircraft had flown behind the time-keepers at the starting point, but he was offered a second attempt. Brack-Papa started a second time but retired when he realized he would not be able to beat Lasne, ) who won the competition with an average speed of 289.90&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name=flight1922/&gt;

==Third Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
In 1931 Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe initiated a new competition for the Coupe, which was contested for the first time on 29 May 1933. The trial was to be run in two 1,000&amp;nbsp;km stages separated by a 90 minutes refuelling stop, and was limited to aircraft with an engine capacity of less than eight litres. The starting point of the race was still at Étampes. Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe was offering one million Francs, and the Ministère de l'Air (Air Ministry) offered another three million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1932/1932%20-%200422.html Flight, 6 May 1932, p. 390]&lt;/ref&gt;
===1933 competition===
[[File:Potez 53 Musee du Bourget P1010709.JPG|thumb|A Potez 53]]
On 24 May 1933 Captain [[Ludovic Arrachart]] was killed when his [[Caudron C.362|Caudron C.360]] (race no.11) crashed due to engine failure at Maisons near [[Chartres]] while he was training for the competition.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65535525/f6.image.r=caudron|date=June 1933|page=166|title=La Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was won by Georges Détré flying a [[Potez 53]] powered by a Potez 9B radial engine developing barely 310&amp;nbsp;hp at full power at a speed of {{convert|322.81|kph|mph}},  beating Raymond Delmotte's Caudron C.362 (race no.6) with a speed of {{convert|291.12|kph|mph}}, and also beating the only foreign competitor, [[Nick Comper]] flying [[Comper Swift]] ''G-ABWW'' {{convert|239.58|kph|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; A third French competitor, test pilot Lemoine also flying a Potez 53, was forced to abandon the race.&lt;ref name=flight1934-510&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200510.html Flight, 24 May 1934, pp. 510-511]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1934 competition===
[[File:Caudron 460 Le Bourget 2009.jpg|thumb|A Caudron C.460 replica]]
[[File:GMars.jpg|thumb|Gloster Mars I (G-EAXZ)]]
On 27 May 1934, the race was a duel between the Caudron pilots, the [[Caudron]] firm presenting two racing aircraft designed by [[Marcel Riffard]]. [[Maurice Arnoux]] won with a C.450 at a speed of 388.97&amp;nbsp;km/h overtaking Louis Massotte's [[Régnier Motor Company|Regnier]]-engined (and sponsored) C.366 (360.72&amp;nbsp;km/h) and Albert Monville's Renault-engined [[Caudron C.460]] (341.04&amp;nbsp;km/h). Nick Comper flew the [[Comper Streak]] (G-ACNC), but retired on the 6th lap of the afternoon session as problem with the undercarriage limited his speed. Georges Detre flying a [[Potez 53]]-2 retired after problems with his engine oil supply. The [[Potez 53]]-3 had problems with its variable pitch propeller and was unable to start for the second section,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flight1934-510/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1933/1933%20-%200976.html Flight, 9 Nov 1933, p. 976]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200480.html Flight, 17 May 1934, pp. 476, 480-481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200531.html Flight, 31 May 1934, pp. 531-532]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935 competition===
The 1935 race was arguably the most exciting{{cn|date=September 2015}} competition of them all, and was the consecration of the Caudron-Renault racers. Eight pilots were registered for this event, but the [[Nennig C-3]] (race no.4) of [[Guy Bart]] was not ready, and the Régnier Martinet, a modified Caudron C.366, (race no.2) was damaged during its tests. Two Caudron C.560s were supposed to participate (race no.1 and 3), but were not ready. They were thus replaced by a [[Caudron C.430]] and a C.450 with the same race numbers.&lt;ref name=flight1935&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1935/1935%20-%201324.html "A Family Affair"] ''Flight'', 30 May 1935, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt;

The course was over 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;miles), from [[Etampes]] aerodrome to [[Chartres]] [[Boncé|Bonce]] and back. The race itself was in two stages, each of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km (625&amp;nbsp;miles).

Charles Franco was the first to take off in Caudron C.430 (race no.1), but abandoned the race on the fourth lap as he was clearly out-classed by the other aircraft. It was followed by the Caudron C.460s of [[Yves Lacombe]] (race no.5), [[Raymond Delmotte]] (Caudron's chief pilot) (race no.8 ), and [[Maurice Arnoux]] (race no.6) respectively, this last entrant having to quit the race after seven laps, having run out of oil after a high-speed lap at {{convert|469|km/h|abbr=on}}. [[Albert Monville]]'s Caudron C.450 (race no.3) was the last to take off. Only three aircraft qualified for the second part of the race, which was held during rain showers. Raymond Delmotte won, ahead of Yves Lacombe and Maurice Arnoux, flying the aircraft previously flown by Albert Monville .&lt;ref name=flight1935/&gt;

==Fourth Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
On 13 September 1936, a last competition was organized, in which two [[Caudron C.461]]s, one Caudron C.450 and two [[Caudron C.560]]s took part. Yves Lacombe won this race with a speed of only {{convert|389.462|km/h|abbr=on}}, overtaking Maurice Arnoux timed at {{convert|369.59|km/h|abbr=on}}, a performance barely superior to what had been established in 1934, probably because of bad engine tuning in a competition presenting no real challenge for the engine and aircraft manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202782.html ''Flight'', 15 October 1936, p. 387]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source does not mention anything save Lacombe won|date=September 2015}}

'''''Detroit''''' is a turn-based [[business simulation game]] that puts one in charge of a fledgling automobile company starting in 1908 (the year the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Model T|Model T]] was introduced). The player is responsible for the financing, research and development, design, testing, production, and marketing of automobile product lines. The aim of the game is to be the most profitable automobile business in the world after 100 years.

The game is named after the American city of [[Detroit]] which is nicknamed "Motor City" due to the concentration of American automobile manufacturers in the city during the 20th century.

==Gameplay==
The player starts off with a factory and a number of distributors. The player is always set against three competitors, which can be either human or computer. The game tends to follow common steps in a project lifecycle which involves the planning of a product, development of a product, testing of a product and its release to the public. The player is expected to follow this process whenever they wish to develop a new automobile.

Each turn is one month, and the game lasts approximately 100 years. At the start of each month, the player is presented with a money ledger showing the prior month's business. At this time newspapers also announce if cars are doing well or if there are special world events. World events that vastly effect gameplay are: [[World War I]], [[The Great Depression]], [[World War II]], and the [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis of the 1970s]]. Most of these events negatively affect demand for all cars, with the exception of the energy crisis which targets low-mileage vehicles.

If at any time the player is bankrupt for long enough, the game ends with a scene of the player's avatar jumping out of a window.

The different aspects of the business are covered by different buildings at the factory (which is actually a pictorial representation of the main menu). Clicking on one of these buildings will bring up the following departments:

===Manager's office===
The manager's office acts as the player's interface to the numbers end of the business. Available from here is financial data concerning car models, factory production numbers, competition information, car reviews, and more. The player can manage the number of employees at factories, hire and fire new employees for factories, manage salaries (especially important to keep workers from striking), and commission reports to find out more about their automobiles.

A unique feature available in the manager's office is the ability to print most reports to the computer's printer.

===Research and development===
The research and development screen allows the player to invest their researchers into fields of development. These fields range from aesthetic changes such as body shape) to more technical ones such as new engines, suspension, brakes, safety and luxury features. The game references many real-world auto features as the fields progress, such as "drum brakes", "windshield wipers", and more.

===Design and testing===
One of the core parts of the gameplay is the ability to design new vehicles. Designing the body involves choosing what type of automobile (car, truck, etc.) and then three main sections of the car: the front, middle, and rear. Color can also be specified but has no discernible impact on the sales or reviews of the car.

As the player's research and development team develops more advanced features for the car, they become available on the design screen. However, all the parts have an associated cost and drive up the cost of the vehicle. They also affect the test results of the car. As time progresses, the public will demand different styles of car. For example, in the energy crisis, consumers will demand more fuel efficient cars. Ultimately it can be a game of trial-and-error finding a vehicle that the public likes.

During the testing phase the car is tested and then given a rating for handling in a corner, braking, acceleration, capacity (cargo and passenger), fuel economy, and safety. Generally, the better performance of the car, the more likely its success, especially if it conforms to the demands of the time or excels against the competition.

===Manufacturing and sales===
The manufacturing and sales screen allows the player to manage the production and distribution of vehicles. A world map of territories is displayed, whereby the player can click individual territories to display the factory and showroom in a territory. Here one can open or close down new factories and showrooms or upgrade the level of factories to make them more productive. Supply routes between factories and showrooms are also set and prioritized on this screen. The price of vehicles in each territory can also be set here.

===Marketing===
Here the player can invest funds into marketing of vehicles through various forms of media. Some will be more effective than others depending in which year the player is at in the game. Examples of media one can advertise with include billboards, newspapers, women's magazines, radio and television.

==Bugs and limitations==
* The game shipped with a bug where sometimes workers would disappear from production and research lines. The patch that fixes the bug introduces a problem whereby sometimes lines would inexplicably gain thousands of workers, drowning the player in overhead.
* All production (and research) lines are limited to 255 workers each. Factories are limited to six lines apiece.
* Many times demand can inexplicably decline or altogether cease for a vehicle, even if it is competitively priced and held in high reviews.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' rated ''Detroit'' two stars out of five. Describing it as "a puzzle game rather than a true strategy game", the magazine criticized the fixed demand values, repetitive gameplay, and unrealistic depiction of historical events.&lt;ref name="cgw199408"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Emrich |first=Alan |last2=Schlunk |first2=Petra |date=August 1994 |title='What's Good for GM is Good for America' |department= |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&amp;pub=2&amp;id=121 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
A '''''directeur sportif''''' ([[French language|French]] for [[sporting director]], although the original French term is often used in English-language media; plural ''directeurs sportifs'') is a person directing a [[cycling team]] during a [[road bicycle racing]] event.  It is seen as the equivalent to a field manager in baseball, or a head coach in football. At professional level, a directeur sportif follows the team in a car and communicates with riders, personnel and race officials by [[radio]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LSW DS ramirez.jpg|thumb|300px|Directeur sportif of the Liberty Seguros-Wurth team riding in the team car.  The car carries spare [[Racing bicycle|bikes]] and [[Bicycle wheel|wheels]] ]] --&gt;The directeur sportif warns of obstacles or challenging terrain, updates the team on the situation in the race, and provides mechanical help.  The car carrying the directeur sportif also usually carries a [[bicycle mechanic]] with spare [[bicycle|bikes]], [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] and parts.  It also carries spare water bottles, food and medical equipment.

In recent years the role has increased, in keeping with better team cohesion, tactics and [[telecommunication|communication]] and [[telemetry]] equipment.  The directeur sportif can have split times, find where riders from other teams are in the race, and dictate orders to riders.  This has made teamwork and tactics more important.

A directeur sportif can also be involved in the riders' training and racing programme. Many are former professionals, such as [[Johan Bruyneel]] and [[Sean Yates]].

[[Gord Fraser (cyclist)|Gord Fraser]] described his role as directeur sportif as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycling.com/racing/wheel-and-still-race |title=At the Wheel, and Still in the Race |last1=Sumner |first1=Jason |date=21 February 2012 |website=[[Bicycling (magazine)]] |access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=Probably the first thing is that I’m the person who has to come up with a tactical plan at the races that will maximize the potential of the team. I’m also a motivator. I have to have a good eye for talent. I have to have recruitment skills. I have to be good with media and sponsors. And it’s best if I’m not a reckless driver since I spend so much time driving in close proximity to people riding bikes. But really, it all goes back to having the right plan in place, and coming up with a good set of options, then making sure those scenarios are communicated to the riders so they can execute that strategy during the race.}}

Several directeurs sportifs are also associated with famous riders whom they have nurtured. [[Patrick Lefevère]] with [[Johan Museeuw]] and [[Tom Boonen]], [[Cyrille Guimard]]'s relationship with [[Bernard Hinault]], and later [[Laurent Fignon]]; [[Jean de Gribaldy]] with [[Sean Kelly (cyclist)|Sean Kelly]] and [[Joaquim Agostinho]]; and Bruyneel with [[Lance Armstrong]] are examples.

{{Maplink|frame=yes|zoom=13|frame-lat=37.545|frame-long=-77.438|type=shape|title=Richmond|text=There are several areas in Downtown Richmond, including [[Shockoe Bottom]], [[Shockoe_Slip#Shockoe_Slip|Shockoe Slip]], the [[River District]], [[Belle Isle (Virginia)|Belle Isle]], [[Monroe Ward]], [[Manchester, Virginia|Manchester]], [[Jackson Ward]], Main Street, [[Court End]], [[Tobacco Row]], and the Canal Walk.}}

'''Downtown Richmond''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. It is generally defined as being bound by Belvidere Street to the west, [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] to the north and east, and the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] to the south. The [[Fan district]] borders it to the west, Highland Park to the north, [[Church Hill]] to the east, and Manchester to the south.

==Buildings and towers==
Richmond is now widely considered Virginia's "tallest" city because of many tall buildings in what is Richmond's [[central business district]], surrounding the [[Virginia State Capitol]] and many government office buildings (many dating to the [[New Deal]]). The [[James Monroe Building]] and SunTrust Plaza tower over 449&amp;nbsp;ft, and 400&amp;nbsp;ft, respectively, making them Richmond's tallest buildings, and the state's second and third tallest in the behind the Westin Virginia Beach Town Center at 508&amp;nbsp;ft. Other towering [[skyscrapers]] include the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]], Bank of America Plaza, the James Center, [[Richmond City Hall Observation Deck|Richmond City Hall]], the Riverfront Plaza twin towers, the James Madison Building, [[Dominion Resources]] headquarters building, Main Street Center, the [[Central National Bank (Richmond, Virginia)|Central National Bank]], and [[VCU Medical Center]] (which includes several hospitals, most over 200 feet, and the new School of Medicine under construction will be 12 storeys). Other important buildings Downtown include the [[Richmond Coliseum]] and the Greater Richmond Convention Center (which includes a tourist information office). [[Shockoe Bottom]] and [[Shockoe Slip]] also have nightclubs, bars, condo towers and lofts in various architectural styles.

==From slave traders to skyscrapers==
From the 1800s, downtown Richmond was a booming city, one of the largest in the nation, and a major player in the slave trade market. The district now known as [[Shockoe Bottom]] was the largest and most famous slave trade market in the entire nation, with people traveling from the South to trade, purchase, or sell slaves. When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] came, though, Richmond became much of a military town, serving as the capital of the newly formed [[Confederate States of America]]. As the war came to an end, the South, in a last resort, deliberately set fire to Richmond, so that when the Union troops arrived, the entire city was ablaze. The troops tried to extinguish the fire, but 80 percent of the buildings of Downtown Richmond was completely burnt to the ground. In the era of [[Reconstrucion]], Richmond devised to rebuild and prosper back to the top as it once was, and quickly rebuilt itself. Now that all of the slaves were free, Richmond saw new economic opportunities in other businesses, such as finance, retail, and banking. In the 1920s, America shifted into an [[Art Deco]] period, which included the construction of many fancy buildings in Downtown Richmond, notably the Central Bank Building. Also, department retailers saw investment in the downtown sector, and opened up [[flagships]]. This included [[Sears &amp; Roebuck]], [[Thalhimers]], and [[Miller &amp; Rhoads]]. But the slow yet massive move out into suburban areas began making its mark on Downtown, as these department stores expanded out to the new suburban shopping centers, and eventually Sears closed the downtown store, and Thalhimers and Miller &amp; Rhoads went defunct in the 90s. Although retail was becoming less and less of a viable economy for downtown, banking and big business began booming, and in the 1960s, Richmond began a massive build-out, which included the construction of over 600 buildings. This would go on into the 80s, until the last few skyscrapers were topped out. In 1978, the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond]], designed by renowned architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]], debuted. Now, the economy of Richmond is booming, with several [[Fortune 500]] companies headquartered there. [[Dominion Resources]], [[MeadWestvaco]], and [[Universal Corporation|Universal]] are among those headquartered in the downtown district. [[MeadWestvaco]] built its new headquarters in 2010. However large areas of the town were allowed to fall into disrepair until the creation of large swathes of HUD priority areas in the worst areas. Developers were quick to take advantage of the generous re-development loans especially since there was a ready-made market in the form of students requiring cheap housing.

==Residents, apartments, and lofts==
The [[Shockoe Bottom]] and [[Shockoe Slip]] districts have successfully begun the process of converting tobacco warehouses and factories into lofts and apartments. Canal Walk is under consideration for development both on the residential and service sector sides, however it is not clear whether there is real consumer appetite for additional restaurants, bars and coffee shops in Richmond. HUD developments in the Manchester district are hoping to start converting former factories into apartment and loft complexes. Residential conversion of the historic John Marshall hotel is also aimed to provide inner-city living space for an optimistic planning target for residency. This is echoed by the planned new construction of Shockoe Valley Heights, a large residential development in Shockoe Bottom. The partial redevelopment of [[Tobacco Row]], a huge row of old tobacco warehouses near fashionable Cary Street is now complete and has attracted favorable attention. The economical loft conversions have proved popular among student tenants. Further housing and redevelopment is a theme favored by Mayor Dwight C. Jones, citing plans for large apartment and condominium towers on the Canal Walk and hoping that it will attract tourists to Richmond. Unfortunately this has not occurred, however the planning is now taking a more modest line aimed at enhancing the challenge of a rather dull and empty space. Plans for the demolition of the old Reynolds Metals plant are still awaiting funding of around $50 million to be followed by reconstruction of the old canal system and development of the infrastructure with HUD grant aid before private interests can be offered a suitable development area.

==Revitalization success and future plans==
Richmond's downtown is rich in history especially from the Civil War and reconstruction period, the "Gilded Age". A great deal of attention has been devoted to the potential tourism holds for the city, however the mainstay remains the VCU facilities and students together with the banking interests that form the backbone of the city. Industry friendly investment in infrastructure has enhanced Richmond's reputation and attracted business through the establishment of areas such as the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park, (located north of the [[Richmond Coliseum]]), which markets itself as a premier office park for research. However although much has been done in Richmond towards establishing a true urban core there are still concerns among both civic and private institutions that the city will risk crime and dilapidation in the Downtown areas unless investment is forthcoming. The City of Richmond Downtown Master Plan concretises the official line which is to build upward and create a Condo tower-based residential area Downtown. This will provide "the perfect place to live, work, and play". This will not solve the fact that there are no major national chain stores located in downtown or its direct vicinity. A rapid transport system to provide faster links between Washington and Richmond is also mooted as important to the create of New Richmond according to Mayor [[Dwight C. Jones]]: [[high-speed rail]].

==Festivals==
Downtown Richmond also is home to some of the nation's biggest festivals, including the [[National Folk Festival (United States)|National Folk Festival]] from 2005 to 2007, which spawned the [[Richmond Folk Festival]], which is now one of the biggest festivals in the state, drawing as much as 200,000 people in its weekend long schedule. It takes place each year on [[Brown's Island]] and the surrounding area. There is also the National Beer Festival, which was scheduled to come to Richmond for 2011, but will return next year on account that it was cancelled under mysterious circumstances. There are much more festivals that bring nearly a million people to Richmond every year. There is also the 2nd Street Festival in Jackson Ward, considered part of Downtown, and an Italian Festival, the Que Pasa? Hispanic Festival, and in the holidays, the James Center Grand Illumination.

'''Farm Progress''' is the publisher of 22 agricultural and ranching magazines.  The company dates back nearly 200 years. Farm Progress Companies is owned by [[Penton Media]].

Farm Progress has the oldest known continuously published magazine with ''Prairie Farmer'', which was launched in 1841. The company publishes 18 regional magazines with local coverage of each agricultural community. Annually, Farm Progress produces four farm shows including the '''Farm Progress Show''', which launched in 1953. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.farmprogress.com/ME2/dirsect.asp?sid=50A4695952D64EFB886435FE1F323AFA&amp;nm=Farm+Shows Show Locations&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company currently known as "Farm Progress" started in 1819 with the ''American Farmer'' magazine. ''[[Prairie Farmer]]'' started in 1841, followed by ''[[Wallaces Farmer]]'' in 1855, which helped chronicle the vast changes in Iowa agriculture as well as providing information to help farmers trim costs and boost profits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wallaces+farmer+celebrates+150+years+serving+Iowa+readers-a0134908654&lt;/ref&gt; Three generations of the Wallace family; [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]], [[Henry A. Wallace]], and Henry Browne Wallace, owned and operated ''Wallaces' Farmer'', which was then a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iptv.org/iowapathways/mypath.cfm?ounid=ob_000035&lt;/ref&gt;

The Farm Progress affiliate '''Prairie Farmer''' purchased radio station [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] from [[Sears]] in 1928 and operated it primarily as a service to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wlshistory.com/WLS30/ | title = The Prairie Farmer Days | work = The History of WLS Radio | publisher = Scott Childers | date = 2010-05-06 | accessdate = 2010-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station moved to the Prairie Farmer Building on West Washington Street in [[Chicago, Illinois]] where it remained for 32 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/wls/studios/index.html A look at the floor plan for the WLS studios in the Prairie Farmer Building-Studio A and its control room are still intact today]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1959, [[American Broadcasting Company|American Broadcasting-Paramount Theaters]] bought the Farm Progress Group, largely to acquire WLS and consolidate it with ABC station WENR. In 1986, ABC merged with [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] and in 1996, the [[Disney]] Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC. In 1997, the Disney Company sold the Farm Progress Companies to [[Rural Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Australian Firm Buys Parent Of Prairie Farmer Magazine From Disney | work = Chicago Tribune | accessdate = 2014-08-23 | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-07-01/business/9707010089_1_state-farm-prairie-farmer-farm-futures }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural Press merged with [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]] in 2007. In 2012, Fairfax sold Farm Progress to [[Penton Media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foliomag.com/2012/penton-acquires-farm-progress-companies-79-9-million Penton Acquires Farm Progress Companies for $79.9 Million]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farm Progress Show==
In 1953, ''Prairie Farmer'' teamed with WLS Radio in Chicago to host a field day where farmers could see first-hand the progress being made in farming equipment, along with seed varieties and ag chemicals.

In subsequent years, the show evolved to include seed test plots and field demonstrations. The show typically was held annually at different sites in Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana. As the event grew, it became apparent that temporary sites were inadequate to handle the large crowds and exhibits.

In 2005, a permanent biennial exhibit site was constructed near [[Decatur, Illinois]] which hosted its inaugural show in 2005. For the 2007 show, the site was expanded and upgraded with asphalt paved streets.  The Decatur site is one of two permanent biennial sites constructed to host the show. 

[[Boone, Iowa]], was selected for the show's second permanent biennial site. In 2008 the show site hosted its first show at its newly constructed permanent biennial facility.  The show now alternates between these two permanent sites on an annual basis. The Boone site is developed on about {{convert|600|acre|km2|1}} at the intersection of U.S. Highway 30 and Iowa Highway 17, while the Decatur show site includes {{convert|640|acre|km2|1}} of exhibits and field demonstrations.

The Farm Progress Show is the oldest outdoor agricultural equipment exhibition in the United States with more than 500 exhibitors. Farm Progress Companies does not release attendance figures, but the Decatur Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau estimates attendance of at least 150,000 for the three days of the 2007 show.

'''Gustav Nicolay Aarestrup''' (1 January 1916 – 15 November 2005) was a Norwegian jurist and businessperson. He was both chief executive officer and chair of [[Storebrand]].

==Early life and World War II==
He was born in [[Steinkjer]] as a son of vicar Joachim Homboe Aarestrup (1866–1940) and his wife Anna Sophie Wiig (1872–1944).&lt;ref name=hvem&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1973|title=Aarestrup, Gustav Nicolay|encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1973/0617.html|page=617|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Sagene]] two years later.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Gustav Nicolay Aarestrup (obituary)|date=24 November 2005|first=Idar|last=Kreutzer|authorlink=Idar Kreutzer|work=Aftenposten|page=|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He finished his secondary education in 1933, took [[Oslo Commerce School]] in 1934 and took the [[cand.jur.]] degree in 1938. He worked as a junior solicitor in [[Mysen]] until 1940, then briefly as a police officer in Oslo before being deputy judge in [[Farsund]] from 1940 to 1941.&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt; In July 1941, one year after the German [[Operation Weserübung|invasion]] and [[German occupation of Norway|occupation]] of Norway, Aarestrup was arrested for an attempt to flee the country. He was first imprisoned in [[Kristiansand]]'s [[Arkivet (Kristiansand)|Arkivet]], and later sat in [[Møllergata 19]] from 8 to 22 August and in [[Grini concentration camp]] until mid-October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Norsk fangeleksikon. Grinifangene|editor=Giertsen, Børre R.|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|year=1946|page=18|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 he left Farsund, being hired in the insurance company [[Storebrand]]. After a year as a secretary for the American finance attaché in Sweden in 1944 and for the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]-in exile in [[London]] from 1944 to 1945, he returned to Norway where he became foreign superintendent in Storebrand. Also, in 1943 he had married Ingrid Christie Krohn, daughter of professor Ivar Trygve Krohn and Ellen Christie.&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Later career==
He rose in the hierarchy, via board secretary from 1948, assisting director from 1954 and vice president from 1957 to 1961. He was the chief executive officer from 1965 to 1976. He then chaired the board until his retirement in 1982.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite news|title=Aarestrup avløser Hansson som leder av Storebrand|date=8 May 1965|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|page=27|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both 1965 and 1976 he succeeded [[Per M. Hansson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Per M. Hansson (obituary)|date=12 October 1994|first=Gustav|last=Aarestrup|work=Aftenposten|page=11|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as chief executive of Storebrand, he was also the chief executive of Custos, Europeiske, Hypotekforsikringsselskapet, Kreditt-Atlas and Oslo Assuranceselskap.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; In 1970 he also took over for Hansson as chief executive of Norrøna.&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt; From 1971 to 1974 Aarestrup chaired the [[Association of Norwegian Insurance Companies]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In the mid-1980s Aarestrup was a proponent for a road tunnel to lead the [[European route E18]] away from the city core of [[Oslo]], specifically the square [[Rådhusplassen]]. Since the tunnel would be built under the [[Oslofjord]], the project was called Vannlinjen. In 1984 Aarestrup became a founding board chairman of the [[Vannlinjen|company of the same name]]. Board members were Ole S. Gilbo, Ragnar Hurum, [[Johan B. Holte]], [[Olav Selvaag]], [[Erling Storrusten]] and Jan Bille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Næringstopper stiftet A/S Vannlinjen: Politikerne satser på Grunnlinjen|date=9 April 1984|first=Egil Wettre|last=Johnsen|work=Aftenposten Aften|page=3|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out, the [[Festning Tunnel]] project, proposed by the company [[Fjellinjen]], prevailed. In 1986, when the tides were turning for Fjellinjen, Aarestrup referred to the project as a "misère from beginning to end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vannlinjen over til Oslolinjen|date=9 October 1986|first=|last=|work=Aftenposten Aften|page=18|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a board member of Norske Fortuna,&lt;ref name=new/&gt; [[Livsforsikringsselskapet Idun]], Equipment Leasing Company, Skips A/S Myken, A/S Fidelio, Victor Jenssens Rederi, Waages Tankrederi, Waages Tankrederi II, [[Forsikringsselskapet Viking]],&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt; and until 1985 in [[Elektrisk Bureau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slutt på maktkampen i EB|date=29 March 1985|first=Kjell|last=Aaserud|work=Aftenposten|page=36|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chaired the supervisory council of A/S Rosshavet, A/S Vestfold, Rederi A/S Ruth, Norges Skibshypotekforening and [[Andresens Bank]], and was a supervisory council member of Autotransport.&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt; From 1976 to 1979 he chaired the Norwegian branch of [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Gustav Nicolay Aarestrup|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Gustav_Nicolay_Aarestrup|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In politics he was a member of the so-called "economic committee" of the [[Conservative Party of Norway]], which was responsible for collecting party funds. Fellow members were [[Bjørn Bettum]] (chair), [[Johan H. Andresen (born 1930)|Johan H. Andresen]], Per Chr.

'''Horace Davis''' (March 16, 1831 &amp;ndash; July 12, 1916) was a [[United States Representative]] from [[California]]. He was the son of [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[John Davis (Massachusetts Governor)|John Davis]] and the younger brother of diplomat [[Bancroft Davis|John Chandler Bancroft Davis]].

==Biography==
Davis was born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. He attended the Worcester public schools and [[Williams College]], [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1849, and then studied law in the [[Dane Law School]] of Harvard University, but did not engage in professional pursuits by reason of failing eyesight.

Davis sailed for [[San Francisco, California]], around [[Cape Horn]] in 1852, and upon arriving, engaged for a brief time as a gold miner, a lumber supercargo surveyor for a coastal [[Steamboat|steamer]], and a purser for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In addition he helped found the Mercantile Library Association of California (its oldest public library). Under his administrative   tutelage interest in the library was restored with his creation of a library catalog (an act which later lead to his poor eyesight). He resigned in 1855 and  relocated to San Francisco in 1860 at which time he established the highly successful Golden Gate Flouring Mills and the Sperry Flour Company. He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistd American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[American Civil War]] broke out, he served in the secretive San Francisco-based [[Home Guard (Union)|Home Guard]] acting to secure both the loyalty of California to then [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the election of [[Leland Stanford]] as governor of California (by patrolling the polls on election day). He presided over the Produce Exchange of San Francisco from 1867 to 1877 until he was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] of the [[45th United States Congress|Forty-fifth]] and [[46th United States Congress|Forty-sixth]] Congresses (March 4, 1877 - March 3, 1881), where on June 8, 1878 he spoke in support of a bill  to restrict Chinese [[immigration]]. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1880 to the [[47th United States Congress|Forty-seventh]] Congress.

After his retirement from the Produce Exchange of San Francisco he presided over both the San Francisco [[Chamber of Commerce]] 1883-1884 and the [[Savings and loan association|Savings and Loan Society]] 1885 and served as a member of the [[Republican National Committee]] 1880-1888. In February, 1888 he was elected president of the [[University of California]], but resigned in April, 1890. He was named president of the [[board of trustees]] of [[Stanford University]] by its original founder and served in this capacity from 1885-1916 where he effected its consolidation with the Wilmerding and Lux schools. He served as president of the [[University of California]] 1887-1890.

Married twice and a devout [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], he contributed greatly to [[Starr King School for the Ministry]], (formerly the Pacific Unitarian School for the Ministry). He was an active student of history and literature, his most noted work being an essay entitled ''American Constitutions''. He died after an appendicitis operation in San Francisco in 1916 and was buried in Cypress Lawn Cemetery.

'''''How to Start a Business in Taiwan''''' is a 2013 book by Elias Ek, a Swedish [[entrepreneur]] and writer. The book covers the main areas of information that a foreigner living in Taiwan who wants to set up a business or invest in a Taiwanese business needs to know. Launched during the 2013 Taipei International Book Exhibition (Jan 30-Feb 4, 2013) the book was very well received by both customers and society. The very first copy was handed over to Taiwan President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] (馬英九) who said he hoped the book would help bring more foreign investors to Taiwan.&lt;ref name="A great place to start a business"&gt;Fotland, Geir Yeh. [http://www.norwaynews.com/en/~view.php?72X2b540Lc4844A285Uik844SQ3888Ro76JFp353OcI8 Taiwan - A great place to start a business]. ''Norway News''. April 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Elias Ek says the book is not about how to start a successful business but how to successfully start a business in Taiwan. This book covers Taiwan-specific issues like:

* - An introduction to doing business in Taiwan
* - A guide to doing business in Taiwan
* - Staffing your business in Taiwan
* - Picking the correct business entity
* - Registering your business
* - Financing your business in Taiwan
* - Overview of the legal systems, trademarks and patents
* - Interviews with successful foreign entrepreneurs in Taiwan

Ek says his ambition in writing the book is "that when you hire an accountant to do the paperwork, you know the questions to ask. You would be able to point to a Chinese term and say: ’Is that what you are talking about?’ So you can get on the same page easier. My second ambition is that you could also do the whole process on your own."&lt;ref name="TAIWAN BUSINESS MADE EASY"&gt;Bruyas, Dimitri. [http://startabusinessintaiwan.tw/blog/347-taiwan-business-made-easy-china-post-article TAIWAN BUSINESS MADE EASY!]. ''China Post''. April 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well read blog InTaiwan.de recommended the book but suggested the section about pensions was utterly confusing and some chapters were out of order.&lt;ref name="Company InTaiwan"&gt;Bardenhagen, Klaus. [http://www.intaiwan.de/2013/07/26/how-to-start-a-business-in-taiwan-book-review/ Ever considered setting up your own company in Taiwan…]. 'InTaiwan''. July 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government-sponsored 100 Innovators show on radio station Uni FM interviewed Ek and the journalist Lilian Kim called Ek one of Taiwan's most successful foreign entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="unifm"&gt;[http://www.uni967.com/newweb/index.php?menu=2&amp;page=2_1&amp;ID=4944 Innovative 100: Elias Ek ]. ''Uni FM 96.7''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Author Elias Ek is from Sweden but has lived in Taiwan since 2000. In 2002 he co-founded B2B Marketing company Enspyre.&lt;ref name="Virtual Office coming to Taiwan"&gt;Lee, Wai Loun. [http://www.appledaily.com.tw/appledaily/article/finance/20031004/399447/ Virtual Office coming to Taiwan] ''Apple Daily''. April 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; While building his business he has also spent a lot of time supporting foreign entrepreneurs. In 2006 Enspyre sponsored what was probably the first seminar for foreign entrepreneurs and in 2008 Ek became the co-chair of the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei SME Centre, spending 3 years arranging seminars and workshops. He is currently active in a similar capacity at the French Chamber of Commerce.

In January 2011 Ek was at the Bangkok airport and discovered a book for foreigners about how to set up a business in Thailand.{{cn|date=January 2016}} He was inspired to write such a book for Taiwan as well. Despite assembling a great team of interns to help, it took two years to make the book a reality.&lt;ref name="Advice from Elias"&gt;Stephenson, Ian.

Ek has also invested in many other Taiwanese startups and was one of the initiative takers to bring Startup Weekend to Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Startup Weekend Taipei"&gt;YUAN, JEREMY BRAND.

The '''Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank''' (Hungarian: '''Magyar Ipar-és Kereskedelmi Bank''') was an important Hungarian bank in the late 19th and early 20th century.

It was a mediocre bank until the appointment of [[István Tisza]] - a prominent businessman and politician - as its president. Under his direction, it became the largest bank of Hungary within a decade.

The '''Ingram Barge Company''' is a [[barge]] company based in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], [[United States]].

According to the company website, Ingram operates nearly 4,000 barges with a fleet of over 80 [[linehaul]] vessels and over 30 tug boats. The company operates on the [[Mississippi River]], [[Ohio River]], [[Cumberland River]],  [[Tennessee River]], [[Gulf Intracoastal Waterway]], [[Kanawha River]], [[Illinois River]], and the [[Monongahela River]]. In 1994 ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine listed Ingram as the 14th largest privately held company in the [[United States]]. Ingram Barge is part of the [[Ingram Marine Group]], in turn part of [[Ingram Industries]].

==History==
'''Ingram Barge Company''' (IBCO) was founded in 1946 by [[Orrin Henry Ingram, Sr.]], also known as Hank. The company started out as Ingram Products Company, transporting primarily petroleum and running terminals in St. Paul and Louisville. Over time, Hank expanded the barging side of the business and reorganized his fleet under a new subsidiary – Ingram Barge Company. He brought on his sons, [[Frederic B. Ingram]] and [[E. Bronson Ingram II]], to be integral members of the company.

In the 1960s, IBCO acquired a sand and gravel yard, which would later become known as Ingram Materials Company, and officially put IBCO into the dry cargo transportation business. During this time of expansion, the family was hit with the unexpected: Hank Ingram died in April 1963.

After Hank’s death, Bronson and Fritz continued their father’s vision of growing their barging business. They expanded into off-shore marine construction and started moving other types of cargo, among them coal and crushed stone. In 1978, the brothers split up Ingram Corporation. Bronson began his leadership of Ingram Industries Inc., which encompassed IBCO.

In 1984, Ingram purchased Ohio Barge Line, formerly owned by U.S. Steel. '''Neil N. Diehl''' came on board as Chairman Emeritus of IBCO to oversee the acquisition. During the 1980s, Ingram bought many boats and barges from several different transportation companies, allowing IBCO to become the third largest for-hire river carrier in the U.S.

On June 15, 1995, E. Bronson Ingram died. Ingram Industries was then organized, naming two of Bronson’s sons, [[Orrin H. Ingram II]] and [[John R. Ingram (businessman)|John R. Ingram]], as Co-Presidents. In 1998, Orrin was appointed Chairman of IBCO and in 1999, became President and CEO of Ingram Industries. John became Vice Chairman of Ingram Industries and Craig E. Philip was named President and CEO of Ingram Barge Co. Following Craig's retirement in 2014, Orrin was named CEO of Ingram Barge Co.

In 2002, IBCO acquired Midland Enterprises LLC, which included The Ohio River Company LLC and Orgulf Transport LLC. In 2005, Ingram acquired Riverway Company. These strategic acquisitions allowed Ingram to become what it is today – the largest carrier on the inland waterway system.

== Ingram Barge and Hurricane Katrina ==
Perhaps the most famous Ingram barge was [[ING 4727]], which broke free of its moorings during Hurricane Katrina and landed in what had been a residential neighborhood of the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, Louisiana. It was suggested that the ING 4727 was responsible for the major breach in the [[Industrial Canal]], although several major studies concluded otherwise. The ING 4727 was in the custody of Lafarge North America at the time of the hurricane. In 2008, a federal district court in New Orleans found that Ingram Barge was not responsible or liable for the breakaway of the ING 4727. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed an appeal of the district court’s ruling, thereby officially ending Ingram Barge’s involvement in the ING 4727 litigation.

==Competition==
Competition includes Kirby, American Commercial Lines, Higman Barge, SCF Marine and [[American River Transportation Company|ARTCO]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2964">{{Multiple issues|{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}{{orphan|date=September 2012}}}}c [[business]] environment; that is, trading and making [[money]] through the exchange of [[foreign currency]]. The international financial activities help the organizations to connect with international dealings with overseas business partners- customers, [[suppliers]], lenders etc. It is also used by [[government]] organization and non-profit institutions.

== History and background ==

During the post-war years, the [[GATT]] was established in order to improve trade. It removed the trade barriers notably over the years, as a result of which international trade grew manifold. The financial participation of the trader's exporters and importers and the international transactions flowed significantly. 
It started when different countries started “liberalizing” i.e. when countries agreed to open doors for each other and traded. The advancement of technology and liberalization resulted in the idea of financial management both domestically and globally.

== Domestic vs international financial management (IFM)==

Financial Systems may be classified as domestic or overseas, closed or open. A ‘domestic’ is one inside a country. Thus financial system in the {{US}}, is an international financial system from the {{IND}} view.
The mean and objective of both domestic and international financial management remains the same but the dimensions and dynamics broaden drastically.
Foreign currency, market imperfections, enhanced opportunity sets and political risks are four broader heads under which IFM can be differentiated from financial management (FM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between International and Domestic Financial Management:|url=http://www.efinancemanagement.com/international-financial-management/74-international-financial-management|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The goal of IFM is not only limited to maximization of [[shareholders]] but also [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.

== Importance ==

Compared to national financial markets international markets have a different shape and analytics. Proper management of international finances can help the organization in achieving same efficiency and effectiveness in all markets, hence without IFM sustaining in the market can be difficult.

Companies are motivated to invest capital in abroad for the following reasons
* Efficiently produce products in [[foreign corporation|foreign]] [[Market (economics)|markets]] than that domestically.
* Obtain the essential raw materials needed for production.
* Broaden [[Market (economics)|markets]] and diversify
* Earn higher returns
*foreign investment

== Current Councillors ==

== History ==
The Internet Society of New Zealand was originally formed in 1995 in order to take responsibility for the [[.nz]] [[ccTLD]].

At the annual meeting on 4 August 2008, InternetNZ's [[Peter Dengate Thrush]] was made an InternetNZ Fellow because of his record of contribution to Internet policy issues in New Zealand and internationally.&lt;ref name="Dengate Thrush Fellow"&gt;{{cite web | title=Peter Dengate Thrush named InternetNZ Fellow | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0808/S00012.htm | accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Internet Society===
Despite sharing many aims with the [[Internet Society]], InternetNZ has never been a chapter of that organisation.  In April 2008, the organisation formally changed its official name to "Internet New Zealand Inc." to recognise common usage and to specifically reflect these differences.&lt;ref&gt;

Deel 1] (Dutch) Jan Justus Enschedé (3)&lt;/ref&gt; was a newspaper editor and printer in Haarlem, the Netherlands.

==Biography==
He was the great great grandson of the founder of the [[Joh. Enschedé]] company, and the son of [[Jacobus Enschedé II]]. Like his second cousin and mentor [[Johannes Enschedé III]], he was a member of the [[Dutch Society of Science]] and the [[Teylers Second Society]]. He worked for Enschedé III as editor of the [[Opregte Haarlemsche Courant]] from 1829, later joined by [[Johannes Enschedé IV]]. In 1850 they had a quarrel with the city council of Haarlem over the use of the [[Coat of arms of Haarlem|city coat of arms]] in the newspaper. As city publisher they had the right, but Haarlem withdrew this privilege, claiming ownership. Jan Justus wrote a book explaining the case of Enschedé, which they won.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ifFQAAAAcAAJ Bedenkingen tegen de adviezen van mr. B. Donker Curtius en mr.

==Early life and education==
Kraft was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], to a [[American Jewish|Jewish]] family, one of four children of [[New England Patriots]] owner [[Robert Kraft]] and his late wife [[Myra Kraft]].&lt;ref name=JSpaceFaceOff /&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishJournalOwner /&gt; Robert Kraft is worth an estimated $4.8 billion, according to Forbes and ranks as 108th richest person in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robert Kraft|url = https://www.forbes.com/profile/robert-kraft/|website = Forbes|access-date = 2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kraft attended the [[Belmont Hill School]] for high school. In 1986, Kraft graduated from [[Williams College]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor's degree]] in [[history]]. He currently serves on Williams' [[board of trustees]]. After working as a consultant at [[Bain &amp; Company]] for two years, Kraft earned his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highpoint-capital.com/team.html|title=HighPoint Capital Team Members|work=HighPoint Capital|accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
===New England Patriots===
Since his family's purchase of the team in 1994, Kraft has held the titles of Vice President (1994–1999), Vice Chairman (2000–2005) and President (2005–present), and thus has overseen the management of each department in the organization.

====Role with the NFL====
Within the [[National Football League]], Kraft serves on two owners' committees. In March [[2006 NFL season|2006]], when the [[National Football League Players Association]] and the NFL were deadlocked in contract negotiations, Kraft designed the revenue sharing plan that was used for that version of the [[collective bargaining agreement]].

===New England Revolution===
Since their inception in 1995 as one of the inaugural teams of [[Major League Soccer]], Kraft has been the co-owner/investor of the Revolution, along with his father. Foxboro hosted its third [[MLS Cup]] in 2002, the first in Gillette Stadium and the first involving the Revolution as one of the teams vying for the MLS title. In front of an MLS-record crowd of 61,136, the Revolution would go on to lose the match, as well as their other four MLS Cup appearances in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2014.

====Other soccer involvements====
The Krafts' interest in soccer has extended beyond the Revolution. [[Foxboro Stadium]] played host to six matches of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], five of the [[FIFA Women's World Cup 1999|1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]], as well as the [[Women's United Soccer Association|2000 Founder's Cup]]. In November 2005, the Krafts expressed interest in purchasing the [[Liverpool F.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4420306.stm|title=Kraft admits Liverpool interest|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2005-11-14|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the team was eventually acquired by a pair including [[Tom Hicks]], the owner of the [[Dallas Stars]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/6323037.stm|title=US pair agree Liverpool takeover|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-02-06|accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraft also served as the owner/investor of the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] from 1999–2000, the two years which the Kraft Group owned the team. 

==Personal life==
He has 3 children, two sons and a daughter. In 1995, Kraft married Patricia Lipoma in a Jewish ceremony at the [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]] home of his parents. She is a convert to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8332878.html Boston Globe: "A Patriotic wedding" by Susan Bickelhaupt and Ellen O'Brien] June 20, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lavin Entrepreneurship Center''' is housed within the [[San Diego State University College of Business Administration|College of Business Administration]] at [[San Diego State University]] (SDSU) and offers a blend of university curriculum and experiential learning opportunities to students across the SDSU campus. The Center provides academic curriculum through both a major and minor in entrepreneurship and hands-on learning opportunities through various co-curricular programs. The Lavin Center is a resource for SDSU students that provides an entrepreneurial foundation and encourages innovation.&lt;ref name="aboutthelavinentrepreneurshipcenter"&gt;[http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/about/ "About the Lavin Entrepreneurship Center"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission of the Lavin Entrepreneurship Center is "to inspire entrepreneurship campus-wide and enable students to develop the entrepreneurial competencies necessary to compete in the global economy."&lt;ref&gt;http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
San Diego State University management professor emeritus, Dr. Daryl Mitton, formed the University’s original Entrepreneurial Management Center (EMC) in 1980. In 1986, the EMC received its first funding and the program has been dedicated to entrepreneurial research and development since.&lt;ref name="emccelebrates25years"&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~cba/news-online/11-July/f.html "EMC Celebrates 25 Years"] College of Business Administration News. Retrieved November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Entrepreneurial Management Center was renamed to honor [[Leonard H. Lavin|Dr. Leonard H. Lavin]], founder of the [[Alberto-Culver]] company and a longtime supporter of the Center. Dr. Lavin has been actively involved with the Center as a guest lecturer and mentor since 2005.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurialmanagementcenternamed"&gt;[http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news.aspx?s=73955 "Entrepreneurial Management Center Named"] Business Administration Story. Retrieved November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurship Curriculum ==
The SDSU College of Business Administration works closely with the Lavin Entrepreneurship Center to offer a curriculum designed to meet the needs of students with an interest in entrepreneurship. The blend of academic and experiential learning is geared to provide students with a theoretical foundation as well as build and reinforce lifelong skills necessary to succeed as an entrepreneur.&lt;ref name="lavincurriculum"&gt;[http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/curriculum/ "Lavin Curriculum"] Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Undergraduate Program ===

The Undergraduate Entrepreneurship curriculum is designed so that students who wish to have deep immersion in entrepreneurship can do so through the specialization, while students – from both a business and non-business background – seeking some exposure to the entrepreneurial mindset can do so through the minor.

* '''Specialization in Entrepreneurship:''' The Specialization in Entrepreneurship is crafted specifically for Management majors in the College of Business Administration. This specialization complements the managing theories and strategies in the core classes with an innovational and an entrepreneurial mindset. In this specialization, students have the opportunity to explore the ins-and-outs of family business, franchising, international and social ventures, as well as creativity and innovation.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurshipspecialization"&gt;[http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/curriculum/management_specialization.php "Entrepreneurship Specialization"] Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Minor in Entrepreneurship:''' The Entrepreneurship Minor is open to all students enrolled at SDSU, regardless of academic major. Through the entrepreneurship minor, both business and non-business students have the opportunity to learn how to take an idea, evaluate it, and potentially turn it into a real business.

=== Graduate Program ===

The Lavin Entrepreneurship Center supports the SDSU graduate program in entrepreneurship and acts as a physical hub on campus as well as a virtual web community that allows entrepreneurs, investors, and service providers to partner with one another and provide resources for start-up companies.

The case study lead curriculum is taught in an environment where students work in teams. Students are encouraged to think strategically, learn how to assess ideas and solutions, build appropriate financial and business models, and develop the right management and marketing strategies. The faculty in the program are a blend of tenured professors and industry experienced lecturers to provide a balance of theory and application.&lt;ref name="lavingraduateprogram"&gt;[http://lavincenter.sdsu.edu/curriculum/grad.php "Lavin Graduate Program"] Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1956,&lt;ref name="computers"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=naUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1308%2C2644596 McGill Management Institute teaches the unusual...it’s where executives go to learn about computers], The Montreal Gazette, Aug 18, 1984, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute has a full-time staff of learning design and program managers working with professors at McGill’s Faculties of Management, Law, Arts, Education and Medicine, external guest experts in specific fields, as well as visiting professors from universities worldwide. The Institute’s clientele includes businesses, not-for-profit organizations and government/public sector services.

==History==

After establishing the first management diploma in 1906, McGill University began offering evening classes in business education in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2010-2011/sites/mcgill.ca.study.2010-2011/files/desautels_faculty_of_management_201011_0.pdf  Desautels Faculty of Management: Programs, Courses and University Regulations 2010-2011], Desautels Website, PDF retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Following Canada's post World War II expansion, McGill University responded to the needs of senior executives by offering seminars in personnel management, marketing, and finance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EIMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dpkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20personnel-management&amp;pg=3548%2C915652 McGill University Evening Extension Course listing], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 8, 1950, Retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent to business seminars offered by McGill, the Executive Development Institute, a private business education organization, began to offer the Executive Development Course (EDC) in 1949, in affiliation with the [[Montreal Board of Trade]]. It was developed with support from the Graduate School of Business at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vJgtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kZ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3255%2C552133 Executive Development Institute, 12th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 5, 1961, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aMItAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=montreal%20board-of-trade%20seminar%20institute%20executive&amp;pg=4026%2C1105140 Executive Development Institute, 13th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 7, 1962, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W8MtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_Z4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=1953%2C316811 Executive Development Institute, 15th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 3, 1964, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A precursor to the existence of many MBA and later EMBA programs, the EDC was designed to provide a comprehensive look at management practices in strategy, human resources, marketing, negotiations and financial acumen.&lt;ref name="computers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kZMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3272%2C1782776 To Help the Executive Grow], The Montreal Gazette - Jul 11, 1963, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the McGill Management Institute was founded to facilitate the more effective delivery of business seminars offered at McGill University.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt; In 1973, the Executive Development Institute merged with the McGill Management Institute and, under the McGill banner, continued the facilitation of the EDC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UhQyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3qEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1486%2C4031929 Ross Plans Book on University Growth], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 31, 1973, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zYcxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uKEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=5535%2C2565363 Psychological Survival for Executives], The Montreal Gazette - April 10, 1974, Retrieved on August 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The merger coincided with a move to its current home in the Bronfman building at McGill University on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal, where it underwent a significant expansion of its offerings. By 1984, the McGill Management Institute was offering 70 day-time seminars and 20 evening courses each year, in addition to the EDC.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt;

In 1993, the McGill Management Institute was renamed the McGill International Executive Institute. It took its current name, the McGill Executive Institute, in 2002. It is a division of the [[Desautels Faculty of Management]].

==Philosophy==

The McGill Executive Institute has been noted for its approach to action-based learning,&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 213, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for its international dimension. In his 2009 work, ''Executive Education in Canadian Firms'', Bruce Gordon R. Fowler states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The executive programs at this Institute recognize better than most schools, even among the other eight illustrious institutions discussed here, the need for international diversity and content. Indeed, McGill has been recognized as having an international dimension unsurpassed in North America for diversity among students and faculty, and for program style and content. The scope of McGill's global outlook is certainly equal to that of Harvard and INSEAD, also featured here as giants of international connectivity, which simply must be part of any program involving  executives of international or multinational firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 138, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Products and Services==
Each year, the McGill Executive Institute provides approximately 20 to 40 open enrolment seminars addressing a number of business topics. The Institute’s longest running program is the Executive Development Course which was launched in 1949. The EDC has been expanded over the years, and is currently offered in three successive modules: the Executive Development Course, the Advanced Management Course, and Integrated Management Thinking. Together, these are referred to by the Institute as the [[Mini-MBA]] Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://executive.mcgill.ca/seminars List of Seminars available from McGill Executive Institute website], Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The McGill Executive Institute also designs and delivers customized learning solutions specifically for an organization’s team of managers or executives.  Services range from short workshops delivered in English, French or bilingual formats to global initiatives with delivery of modules to participants across management levels over several years.

The McGill Executive Institute also offers an International Masters in Practicing Management (IMPM), as well as the Advanced Leadership Program (ALP). These longer, global programs occur over several modules and across multiple international locations, in conjunction with other universities: The Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India; Lancaster University in the UK; Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management in Seoul, Korea; and INSEAD in France. Both the ALP and the IMPM were co-founded and are co-directed by Professor [[Henry Mintzberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R.

Monopolistc competition models are used under the rubric of [[imperfect competition]] in International Economics.  This model is a derivative of the [[monopolistic competition]] model that is part of basic economics.  Here it is tailored to international trade.

==Setting up the model==
Monopolies are not often found in practice, the more usual market format is [[oligopoly]]: several firms, each of whom is big enough that a change in their price will affect the price of the other firms, but none with an unchallenged monopoly.  When looking at oligopolies the problem of ''interdependence'' arises.  Interdependence means that the firms will, when setting their prices, consider the effect this price will have on the actions of both consumers and competitors.  For their part, the competitors will consider their expectations of the firm's response to any action they may take in return.  Thus, there is a complex game with each side "trying to second guess each others' strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul, and Maurice Obstfeld.  ''International Economics: Theory and Policy,'' 7th ed. (Boston: Pearson Addison-Wesley, 2005) pg 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Monopolistic Competition model is used because its simplicity allows the examination of one type of oligopoly while avoiding the issue of interdependence.

==Benefits of the model==
The appeal of this model is not its closeness to the real world but its simplicity.  What this model accomplishes most is that it shows us the benefits to trade presented by [[economies of scale]].

==Assumptions of the model==
*1. Each firm is presumed to be able ''differentiate its product'' from that of its rivals.  Cars are a good example here; they are very different, yet in direct competition with each other.  This means there will be some customer loyalty, which allows for some flexibility for the firm to move to a higher price.  In other words, not all of a firm's customers would leave for other products if the firm raised its prices.
*2. This model dismisses the issue of interdependence when a firm sets its price.  The firm will act ''as if it were a monopoly'' regarding the price it sets, not considering the potential responses from its competitors.  The justification is that there are numerous firms in the market, so each receives only scant attention from the others.
===Background of the model===
:*An industry consisting of a number of firms, each of which produces differentiated products.  The firms are monopolists for their products, but depend somewhat of the number of reasonable alternatives available and the price of those alternatives.  Each firm within the industry thus faces a demand that is effected by the price and prevalence of reasonable alternatives.
:*Generally we expect a firm's sales to increase the stronger the total demand for the industry's product as a whole.  Conversely, we expect the firm to sell less if there are a significant number of firms in the industry and/or the higher the firm's price in relation to those competitors.  The demand equation for such a firm would be:

:::::::::::'''Q = ''S'' x [1/n - ''b'' x (P - ''P'')]'''

:::* "Q" = the firm's sales.  "''S''" is the total sales of the industry.  "n" is the number of firms in the industry, "''b''" is a constant term representing the responsiveness of a firm's sales to its price.  "P" is the price charged by the firm itself. "''P''" is the average price charged by its competitors.
:::* The intuition of this model is: 
::::* If all firms charge the same price their respective market share will be 1/n.  Firms charging more get less, firms charging less get more.
:::::*(Note) Assume that lower prices will not bring new consumers into the market.  In this model consumers can only be gained at the expense of other firms.  This simplifies things, allowing a focus on the competition among firms and also allows the assumption that if ''S'' represents the market size, and the firms are charging the same price, the market share of each firm will be ''S''/n.

=== Morrison Incident ===
In 1837, Olyphant &amp; Co's ship ''Morrison'' made an attempt to repatriate seven shipwrecked [[Japan]]ese sailors and at the same time open trade with Japan. The crew's efforts were thwarted after the Japanese opened fire and the ship was forced to retreat.{{sfn|Shavit|1990|p=354}}

After David Olyphant's son [[Robert Morrison Olyphant]] reorganized the firm in 1858,{{sfn|Shavit|1990|p=374}} in the 1870s, partner [[Augustus Allen Hayes]] helped revive proposals for the [[Woosung Road]] Railway between Woosung (now known as [[Wusong]]) and Shanghai's [[Zhabei District]] in conjunction with [[History of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.|Jardine Matheson]] and Augustine Heard and Company.&lt;ref name="Lange2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ole Lange|title=Stormogulen: C.F.

*''Tinqua'' (1851)
*''Wild Duck'' (1852)

== Collapse ==
In the mid 1870s, the firm  reduced their interest in Chinese products and instead turned to the [[sodium nitrate]] business in conjunction with the government of [[Peru]]. As an extension to these dealings with Peru's rulers, Olyphant &amp; Co. agreed to import [[coolie]] laborers by steamer from China. However, the firm proved unable to procure the requisite human cargoes, allegedly as a result of jealously on the part of their competition with support from the British government.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt; To the surprise of the mercantile community, the subsequent losses incurred caused Olyphant &amp; Co. to cease trading in late 1878 while owing money to creditors including [[Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.]] and the government of Peru.&lt;ref name=NYTimes /&gt;

'''Parmanand Singh''' (born 1905) was one of the three [[Indo-Fijians]] elected to the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] of [[Fiji]] in October 1929 when Indo-Fijians were given the first opportunity to elect their own representatives. The other two were [[Vishnu Deo]] and [[James Ramchandar Rao]]. Singh was a landlord from Ba and undertook several business ventures which included publishing newspapers.

==Biography==
Parmanand Singh was born in [[Yalalevu]] in the [[Ba District, Fiji|Ba District]] of Fiji in 1905. His parents had come to Fiji as [[Indian indenture system|indentured labourer]]s and prospered in the opportunities available after indenture. He was educated at [[Auckland]] College, graduating in 1923. While in [[New Zealand]], he played rugby, a game rarely played by Fiji Indians.

On his return to Fiji, he took advantage of a business opportunity by leasing land from [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] (CSR) and sub-leasing it to small farmers.

Like most rich farmers from Ba, he joined the [[Arya Samaj in Fiji|Arya Samaj]] and was chosen by [[Vishnu Deo]] to contest the Northern &amp; Western Division in the [[1929 Fijian general election|1929 general elections]], the first in which Indo-Fijians were allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fijielections.blogspot.com/2017/02/fiji-legislative-council-election-1929.html 1929 Fiji Legislative Council elections] Fiji Elections&lt;/ref&gt; He won easily with the support of Deo and the Arya Samaj, an organisation to which most educated Fiji Indians belonged. However, two weeks after being sworn in he and the two other Indo-Fijians representatives resigned when a motion asking for equal political rights for Indo-Fijians was defeated.

He was opposed to the immigration of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s and [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]s, a cause later taken up by his brother, [[Chattur Singh]] who was later also a member of the Legislative Council.

In 1948, he left for [[India]] for the education of his children and returned 3 years later.

He saw opportunities in the printing industry and established a printing press in [[Ba (town)|Ba]], which he used to publish a newspaper, ''Awaaz'' (The Voice) in the [[Hindi]] language. He was unable to keep the newspaper in circulation due to a natural disaster and poor staff. He then moved to [[Lautoka]] and in 1956, started publishing another newspaper, ''Jai Fiji'', which remained in circulation until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Sharma | first = Guru Dayal | title = Memories of Fiji: 1887 - 1987 | publisher =Guru Dayal Sharma, Suva, Fiji | year = 1987 | pages = 151–152 | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family involvement in Fijian politics has continued with his son, [[Anand Singh]], also serving in the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]] and as the [[Attorney General of Fiji]] in the [[Fiji Labour Party]] government of [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] from 1999 to 2000.

'''Paulilles''' is a [[protected area]] on the Mediterranean Sea, located between the towns of [[Port-Vendres]], and [[Banyuls-sur-Mer]] in [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], [[North Catalonia]], France.

== History ==

=== The Dynamite Factory ===
Paulilles Recreational Park occupies a rehabilitated [[dynamite]] factory site protected as an [[ecological network]] by the [[Natura 2000]] European organisation. Originally serving as the French [[Alfred Nobel|Nobel]] Dynamite Factory, it was created by Nobel's associate in France, Paul François Barbe, and built in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;http://histoireduroussillon.free.fr/Villages/Histoire/Paulilles.php&lt;/ref&gt;
Several accidents over the years caused multiple deaths: the most important ones killed 20 workers in 1882&lt;ref&gt;Article in ''Le Républicain des Pyrénées Orientales'', 26 January 1882&lt;/ref&gt; and 5 in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Fabricio Cardenas, [http://vieuxpapierspo.blogspot.fr/2015/07/explosion-paulilles-en-1885.html Vieux papiers des Pyrénées-Orientales, ''Explosion à Paulilles en 1885 ''], 6 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protecting the environment ===
In July 1991, the installations were closed by the Société nationale des poudres et des explosifs (SNPE), and later sold to the [[Conservatoire du littoral]] in 1998 to protect the area from real estate developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatoire-du-littoral.fr/front/process/Content.asp?rub=8&amp;rubec=108&amp;site=1990 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614082531/http://www.conservatoire-du-littoral.fr/front/process/Content.asp?rub=8&amp;rubec=108&amp;site=1990 |archivedate=2009-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, the [[General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales]] launched the renovation to ready 9 buildings, destroy nearly 70, and landscape 17 hectares to turn Paulilles into a free and ecological recreational park, a museum on the [[industrial heritage]] of the  factory and a traditional Catalan boat repair facility [https://web.archive.org/web/20090225032932/http://www.cg66.fr/environnement/espaces_naturels/paulilles/index.html].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cete-aix.fr/imgarea/Cotita_9_Paulilles_oct2008_COCHE_INCA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Paulilles opens to the public in June 2008.

== Geography ==
[[File:Posidonia 2 Alberto Romeo.jpg|thumb|[[Posidonia]]]]
Paulilles is located about 2 miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Port-Vendres]] behind the '''Las Portas pass''' along the scenic [[Route Départementale 914]]. It is a small scale Mediterranean bay, forming a prairie down to the sea between the '''Béar cape''', and the '''Oullestrell cape''' and forms three beaches: '''Bernardi''', '''del Mitg''', '''Fourat''' separated by small cliffs in the bay. 
The original forest has been well preserved and is typical of the [[Mediterranean region]]. 
It is composed of [[Aleppo pine]] (Pinus halepensis), [[Maritime Pine]] (Pinus pinaster), [[Stone Pine]] (Pinus pinea), for the  [[Pinaceae]])family. Also [[Holm oak]] (Quercus ilex), [[Cork Oak]] (Quercus suber) and [[Olive]] trees (Olea europaea).
Local flora is well represented with the [[Armeria]] of Roussillon (Armeria ruscinonensis Girard), the polycarpon of Catalonia (Polycarpon polycarpoides), the [[Thymelaea]] hirsuta, the Limonium  tremolsii, and also [[Tamarix]] ([[Tamaricaceae]]), and Gattiliers (Vitex agnus-castus).

All the waters around Paulilles are also protected by [[Natura 2000]], for its [[Posidonia oceanica]], a species of [[seagrass]] that is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea and [[Coralline algae]]s that offers shelter and nursing home for the rich aquatic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://natura2000.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/FR9101482.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206192701/http://natura2000.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/FR9101482.html |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This marine plants forms large underwater meadows of high importance to the [[environmental conservation]] of the region.

'''''Saudi Real Estate Companion''''' is a book edited by H.E. Mueller and A.D. Williams. It focuses on bringing international standards to the market through a focus on all aspects of a standard real estate cycle&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Overview==

It is one of the first non-Arabic language books covering [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] real estate.The book attempts to address a large range of topics covering the best ways to approach real estate investment, marketing, development and valuations. These are approached in a way as to introduce many advanced techniques to the reader using standard (non-technical) language.

The work is divided into seven key sections:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Saudi-Real-Estate-Companion-Essential-ebook/dp/B01DTNO0SC|title=Saudi Real Estate Companion: Essential Real Estate Skills for the Saudi Arabian Market|last=Mueller|first=H. E.|last2=Williams|first2=A. D.|date=2016-04-04|publisher=Booktango|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Valuation (finance)|Valuations]]; covering the basis of valuing different asset types for investment and self-ownership purposes in the Kingdom
* Market Skills; covering buying and selling properties and examples of real estate fraud and scams to be avoided
* Development and [[Feasibility study|feasibility]]; which covers feasibility and best use studies as well as project financing as well as advanced Saudi Real estate market issues
* Property and Facility management; covering details of day to day property management and risk reduction
* Trading and investment; covering a wide range of Saudi specific investment issues and different trading strategies that can be adopted in the Kingdom
* Economic Issues and Real Estate; this section covers the [[Macroeconomics|macro-economic]] issues impacting the Saudi real estate market as well as real estate cycles in the kingdom
* Market and Geographic commentary; considered specific areas in the Kingdom focusing on districts and sectors that are likely to have good potential in each of the major cities such as [[Riyadh]], [[Jeddah]], [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] etc.

==Real Estate Cycle==

The authors dedicated a significant portion to rel estate cycles in Saudi Arabia with a focus on historic, economic and psychological factors. At the same time they highlighted the key factor impacting the market as follows:

Oil price fluctuations can make the Saudi property cycle more exaggerated as oil price despite general overall stability over the past few years, can suddenly breakout of its typical range as was seen recently. The current weakness in oil prices which appear to have lasted beyond what was expected, is having an impact on government spending and will in turn impact the real estate market.

However it should be noted that the author denied that this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ADwilliamsinKSA|title=AD Williams (@ADwilliamsinKSA) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tammy Barton (née May)''' is an Australian entrepreneur and the founder of [[MyBudget]].

== Personal life ==
'''Tammy Barton (née May)'''

Tammy Barton (née May) is an Australian entrepreneur, businessperson and personal finance expert. She is the founding director of MyBudget,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mybudget.com.au|title=MyBudget|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a personal budgeting service based in Australia that aims to help people take control of their finances through budgeting and money management.

She has won many awards, including twice being awarded the Telstra Business Woman of the Year (Entrepreneur-South Australia), 2007 and 2017. Barton is recognised as one of Australia's most influential businesswomen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/news/meet-australias-100-women-of-influence-20121011-jiosz|title=Meet Australia's 100 Women of Influence|last=Hooper, Narelle and Fox|first=Catherine|date=12 October 2012|website=Australian Financial Review|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she regularly appears in the media as an expert on personal money management and household budgeting.

== Career ==
Barton started MyBudget as a home-based business in Adelaide in 1999 at the age of 22 after working at a debt collection agency where she witnessed the damaging effects of financial stress on people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/business/financial-freedom-just-a-budget-away-20120509-jyzl4|title=Financial freedom just a budget away|website=Australian Financial Review|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/sa-business-journal/south-australian-tammy-mays-mybudget-business-aimed-at-helping-people-budget-is-making-an-impact-in-different-ways/news-story/2dc8b758510104f36de7ca6d9c1fc676|title=South Australian Tammy May's MyBudget business aimed at helping people budget is making an impact in different ways|last=Moss|first=Cory|date=2 March 2004|website=The Advertiser|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business has since grown into a national company that employs more than 250 staff in 15 offices across Australia. During that time, the company has delivered its money management services to more than 65,000 clients.

On 26 October 2012, Barton became an appointee to the BankSA Advisory Board. Chairman Rob Chapman said Barton brought "strong credentials and a passionate commitment to helping South Australia prosper and grow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/new-faces-for-banksa/news-story/fe8c4f9652819cf0257f13806ec45604|title=MyBudget founder Tammy May and former Ernst &amp; Young SA managing partner Mark Butcher join BankSA advisory board|last=Booth|first=Meredith|date=22 October 2012|website=The Advertiser|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Barton remains director of and spokesperson for MyBudget.

For her business achievements, Barton has been recognised with a number of awards and honours, see below. During her acceptance speech at the Telstra South Australian Business Woman of the Year Awards in October 2017, Barton announced that MyBudget would be opening its first international branch, in the United Kingdom, in 2018 to further what she described as her "commitment to helping lead the global financial fitness movement.”

'''Walter Jodok Kohler Jr.''' (April 4, 1904 – March 21, 1976) was a member of the [[Kohler family of Wisconsin]] and was the [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|33rd]] [[Governor of Wisconsin|Governor]] of [[Wisconsin]], serving three terms from 1951 to 1957. He was a leading figure in state and national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] activities. His role in the clash between Senator [[Joseph R. McCarthy]] and presidential candidate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952 has interested historians for decades. Kohler was for many years a sales executive at the [[Kohler Company]] and served as president at [[Vollrath|The Vollrath Company]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishistory.com/apr4.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a distinguished Naval officer in [[World War II]]. He had two children - a son, [[Terry Jodok Kohler]], and daughter, Charlotte Nicolette Kohler.

Kohler's father, [[Walter J. Kohler Sr.]], was Governor of Wisconsin from 1929 to 1931. His son [[Terry Jodok Kohler|Terry Kohler]] ran for governor in 1982 against [[Anthony Earl]], but lost.

==Personal life==
Walter Jodok Kohler Jr. was born on April 4, 1904 on his family's lavish estate in [[Kohler, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishistory.com/apr4.html&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, [[John Michael Kohler]] had founded the [[Kohler Company]] in the late 19th century, and his father, [[Walter J. Kohler Sr.]] (1875–1940), was active in his family's plumbing supply business and served one term as the State's Republican governor (1929–31). Walter Jr.'s mother was the former Henrietta "Lottie" Schroeder (1869–1947), and he had three brothers: John Michael Kohler III (1902–68), Carl James (1905–60), and Robert Eugene (1908–90).

Walter enjoyed many luxuries while growing up, but they were tempered by a strong-willed father who impressed his boys with the necessity of integrity, hard work, learning, good manners, frugality, and service to the community. Walter followed what was becoming a family tradition by graduating from [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts, and [[Yale University]].

In 1925, after college, Walter joined the Kohler Company. He knew much about the factory, having been employed there in a number of often grueling jobs during school breaks—another family tradition for males. In 1932, he married Chicago socialite Marie Celeste Holden (1900–74), a divorcée with a child. The couple had two children: Terry Jodok (1934-2016) and Charlotte Nicolette (b. 1936). In 1938, Walter and Celeste built a handsome estate, Windway, not far from the main plant; Walter lived there for the rest of his life. After World War II, he and Celeste divorced. In 1948 Walter married Charlotte McAleer (1912–95), a wealthy divorcée from Philadelphia.

In his last years, he and Charlotte traveled widely throughout the world and enjoyed long holidays in Antigua and Florida. He died in Sheboygan on March 21, 1976 following a heart attack. Obituaries emphasized Walter's character and integrity, noting his wartime service, his business success, and his three successive terms as governor.

==Military service==
In August 1942, Kohler joined the [[United States Navy]] as a [[Lieutenant]] and was assigned duty as a combat intelligence officer in the [[Solomon Islands]]. In January 1944 he became part of the crew of the USS Hancock, a huge new aircraft carrier of the Essex class assigned to the South Pacific as part of the Third Fleet. Kohler was the ship's air combat intelligence officer. The Hancock was in the thick of fierce fighting throughout the year. On December 3, Kohler was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant Commander]], receiving the highest recommendations.

On April 7, 1945 the Hancock was hit by a [[Kamikaze]] plane that caused major damage. Walter quietly vowed that if he survived the war, he would go into public service to put an end to such violence and destruction. Soon afterward, exhausted by intense battle, he sought an honorable discharge. On September 24, he left the Navy. Now 41, Kohler had served 37 months of active duty. The [[Bronze Star Medal]] and the Asiatic theater ribbon with five battle stars were among his awards.

==Business career==
Walter discovered after the war that the entire Kohler Company was in the control of his uncle, Herbert V. Kohler. The industrialist told the veteran that he had no future in the company. Using inheritance funds and borrowed money, Walter made an effort to run the [[Vollrath]] Company in [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]], a maker of kitchen utensils and dairy supply products. The Kohlers and Vollraths were related and had long enjoyed economic ties. With the aid of a key insider, Walter became president of Vollrath in April, 1947. Under his energetic leadership, the company began almost immediately to increase its profits. Between 1945 and 1950, the net worth of the company virtually doubled, and an assortment of new products appeared. By early 1958 sales had doubled in a decade. Walter led the Vollrath Company until his death. A short time later, [[Terry Jodok Kohler|Terry Kohler]], Walter's son, assumed the reins of the highly expanded and profitable corporation. He had worked full-time for the company since 1963.

==Political life==
Walter J. Kohler Jr. decided to move in politics in 1948 and he joined Team Stassen for the presidential elections. While this was unsuccessful, his networking and hard work in politics paid off when he became the [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|33rd]] [[Governor of Wisconsin]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves p. 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt; Walter had experienced politics first hand, being active in his father's reelection campaign in 1932. After returning from the war, he thought of running for the [[United States Senate]]. But that was also the driving ambition of [[Joseph R. McCarthy]], an ex-Marine who had run for the Senate two years earlier. Walter had little choice but to step aside. In the late 1940s, Walter rose within the state G.O.P. by making friends, working for others, and winning the support of industrialist Tom Coleman, a dominant force within the Party. In 1948, Kohler was a delegate to the national convention and made it clear that he was a moderate Republican in the mold of the GOP's presidential candidate [[Thomas Dewey]].

Dewey's unpredictable loss to [[Harry Truman]] prompted many Republicans, in the next few years, to employ "[[Red Scare]]" tactics in order to win office; this was the practice of irresponsibly labeling Democratic opponents as Communists or pro-Communists. Kohler would never be sympathetic to the right-wing, McCarthyite wing of the party. Still, he made infrequent gestures in this direction in order to appeal to the many Wisconsinites who were certain that their junior Senator's charges were on target. Moreover, Walter thought that at times, such as the case against [[Alger Hiss]], McCarthy and his allies were on the right track.
In 1950, Walter was elected Governor, winning 59 of 71 counties in what was a Republican sweep of state offices. Legislators, journalists, and the public soon praised his friendliness, hard-work, and integrity. During the next two years Wisconsin prospered economically, had a budget surplus, and enjoyed tax cuts. Of 55 specific gubernatorial proposals for legislation, 47 were passed. The package included two civil rights measures, a hike in old age pensions, and improved unemployment and workmen's compensation benefits.

During his reelection bid in 1952, Kohler worked successfully for the nomination of moderate [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. When the candidate was about to campaign in Wisconsin, Walter privately asked Eisenhower to alter a proposed Milwaukee speech that was critical of Senator McCarthy. At the heart of the request was the desire to unify Republican Party (GOP) and carry Wisconsin at the polls. Eisenhower reluctantly agreed, and the strategy, in large part, paid off. Republicans won the White House and control of Congress, McCarthy and Kohler (they officially supported each other) were reelected, and Republicans retained control of the state legislature. Walter admitted to being offered various positions in [[Washington, D.C.]], including at least one on the [[White House]] staff during his second term as governor. He turned them all down in large part because of the resistance of his wife to further political activity.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, P. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GOP sweep intensified the commitment of local Democrats to gain power. [[Bill Proxmire]], the man Kohler defeated handily, began to campaign the day after the election to win the governorship in 1954. Anti-McCarthy forces from the political center and left stepped up their nationwide efforts to bring down the Wisconsin Senator and end the Second Red Scare.
Kohler defeated Proxmire again in 1954. At the conclusion of his third two-year term in 1956, he had built an impressive record that included advances in higher education, redistricting, highway construction, public welfare, conservation, and the criminal and children's law codes. During his terms in office, 89 of the governor's 92 vetoes were sustained by the Republican-dominated legislatures. State government under Walter's watch was efficient, clean, and fiscally responsible.

Kohler and Proxmire campaigned diligently for the vacant Senate seat. The McCarthyite wing of the GOP in large part turned against Walter (as it had against Eisenhower), and this lack of support, accompanied by Proxmire's populist rhetoric and financial support from labor unions, prompted a dramatic upset win for the tireless Democrat. Proxmire would represent Wisconsin in the United States Senate until 1989.
Kohler played a role in the GOP National Convention of 1960, but thereafter he saw himself primarily as a businessman and fund-raiser for the American Cancer Society.

==Death==
Walter's health declined in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He had [[shingles]] and was diagnosed with [[skin cancer]] and had an operation to remove some cancerous tissue in 1972 at the [[Mayo Clinic]]. Then in 1975, Walter underwent heart surgery, which did nothing to improve his condition. He continued to deteriorate until he died of a massive [[heart attack]] at [[Aurora Health Care|Sheboygan Memorial Hospital]] on March 21, 1976 at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, p. 420-421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=W. J. Kohler Dies|newspaper=Sheboygan Press|date=22 Mar 1976|pages=1, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is buried in Kohler's Woodland Cemetery.

'''Willem Grasso''' (20 April 1833 – 20 March 1903) was the founder of [[Grasso's industrial refrigeration equipment|Grasso’s Royal Machine Factories Ltd.]]

==Biography==

Grasso was born at [[Tilburg]], the son of a smith. He moved with his family in 1845 to [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. In 1858, he started his own little forge in ’s-Hertogenbosch. In 1868, he built a new factory / living house. Thanks to his good contacts with Jurgens, who had received the rights for producing [[margarine]] in 1871, Willem Grasso was the first to have the chance to produce machines for this fast growing industry. The name Grasso soon would be well known.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1894, his son [[Henri Grasso]] would take over the company. In 1896, he started a refrigeration department in [[Vught]]. In 1913, he returned to ’s-Hertogenbosch, when the opportunity came up to build a brand new factory there. In the same year, he was the first in the Netherlands to start producing refrigeration machines, using the name Grasso. He{{who|date=November 2010}} died in [[Boekel]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

a few generations later(on the 13th or August in 2003) Willem Patrick Gijsbercht Grasso was born. A young very muscular and intelligent man capable of many things. he started off his life in a Dutch school but later moved on to the English system. Due to many mathematical contests, he made over 6.3 million euros before his sixteenth birthday. Half of his money was sent to charity and the other half he had invested in his own company. Which is now valued over 2.5 billion euros.
