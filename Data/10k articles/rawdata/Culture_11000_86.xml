A '''canon''' in the sphere of [[visual arts]] and [[aesthetics]], or an '''aesthetic canon''', is a rule for [[Body proportions|proportions]], so as to produce a harmoniously formed figure.

==Evolution==
{{Main|Female body shape}}
By extension, the norms of a certain epoch as to what is or is not considered beautiful may be called a '''canon of beauty'''. These norms have varied over time and what is considered beautiful in one era may not necessarily be so in another. Canons of beauty follow the evolution of [[fashion]] and are dependent on the evolution of physical decoration techniques such as [[hairdressing]] or [[make up]].

Under France's [[Ancien Régime]], canons of beauty required a woman to have as white a skin as possible. This was achieved (sometimes to the danger of health) by [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] and [[face powder]]s as well as 'mouches', fake moles made of black muslin glued onto the face or chest. Today, by contrast, such canons prefer a 'healthier' skin colour, sportiness, gait and so on.

According to the anthropologist Alfred-Louis Kroeber, the female silhouette regularly revolves through one of three basic shapes&amp;mdash;[[bustle]], [[scabbard]], [[bell (instrument)|bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Nathalie Bailleux and Bruno Remaury, ''Modes et vêtements'', collection “[[Découvertes Gallimard]]” (nº 239), series Culture et société, Éditions Gallimard ({{ISBN|2-07-053270-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proportions in art==
{{See also|Body proportions}}
For his painting ''The Birth of Venus'' [[Sandro Botticelli]] stated that the distance between the nipple and navel, between the two legs and between the navel and the groin must all be equal for a figure to (in his opinion) be ideally proportioned. Other such systems of 'ideal proportions' in painting and sculpture include the [[Polyclitean canon]] and [[Vitruvian module]]s, best known in the [[Vitruvian Man]].

[[File:The mmuo of a girl.jpg|thumb|An Agbogho Mmuo and two attendees]]
'''Agbogho Mmuo''', or '''Maiden [[Igbo mythology|Spirits]]''' are annual performances held during the [[dry season]] in the [[Nri-Igbo|Nri]]-[[Awka]] area in the northern part of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]s' traditional territory. Performed only by men wearing [[African traditional masks|masks]], the masquerades imitate the character of [[adolescence|adolescent]] girls, exaggerating the girls' beauty and movements. The performance is always accompanied by [[Igbo music|musicians]] who sing and play tributes to both real and spirit maidens.

The performances showcase an ideal image of an Igbo maiden. This ideal is made up by the smallness of a young girl’s features and the whiteness of her complexion, which is an indication that the mask is a spirit. This whiteness is created using a chalk substance used for ritually marking the body in both West Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. The chalky substance is also used in [[Uli (design)|uli design]], created and exhibited on the skin of Igbo women. Most maiden spirit mask are decorated with representations of hair combs, and other objects, modeled after late 19th-century ceremonial hairstyles. These hairstyles include elaborate coiffures and crests which intend to add beauty to the mask.

This art style is featured in the book [[Purple Hibiscus]] written by [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]].

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}

'''Bathyllus''' was a dancer/performer of [[pantomimus]] in [[Rome]] during the period of [[Augustus]]. Born in [[Alexandria]], he was the favourite comedic performer of [[Maecenas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', 1.54&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He is often described with the performer [[Pylades]], who was seen as the epitome of tragic performance, while Bathyllus was seen as the epitome of comedic performance. They were both former slaves and they are both credited with having modernised pantomime in Rome adding different forms of dance which are often described as erotic. Each founded a school and had some political influence in Rome occasionally leading to their supporters clashing in the streets.

According to [[Juvenal]], a pantomime named Bathyllus, dancing, provoked Roman matrons to a state of sexual frenzy. Bathyllus appears in the illustrated edition of Juvenal's satire 'Against Women' by [[Aubrey Beardsley]].&lt;ref name="HallWyles2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edith Hall|author2=Rosie Wyles|title=New Directions in Ancient Pantomime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9N0GmN1wiLsC&amp;pg=PA126|date=20 November 2008|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-155257-1|pages=126–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

References to a different, earlier, Bathyllus are found in the writing of [[Horace]] (epode 14) who describes him as beloved of [[Polycrates]] the Tyrant and the poet, [[Anacreon]], who described him in his 29th ode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5509">'''Categories for the Description of Works of Art''' ('''CDWA''') describes the content of art databases by articulating a conceptual framework for describing and accessing information about works of art, architecture, other material culture, groups and collections of works, and related images. The CDWA includes 532 categories and subcategories. A small subset of categories are considered core in that they represent the minimum information necessary to identify and describe a work. The CDWA includes discussions, basic guidelines for cataloging, and examples. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/introduction.html CDWA Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Categories provide a framework to which existing art information systems can be mapped and upon which new systems can be developed. In addition, the discussions in the CDWA identify vocabulary resources and descriptive practices that will make information residing in diverse systems both more compatible and more accessible. 

The use of the CDWA framework will contribute to the integrity and longevity of data and will facilitate its inevitable migration to new systems as informational technology continues to evolve. Above all, it will help to give end-users consistent, reliable access to information, regardless of the system in which it resides. 

These guidelines hopefully provide a common ground for reaching agreement on what information should be included in art information systems, and what information will be shared or exchanged with other institutions or systems. Target users are curators, registrars, researchers, information managers, and systems vendors.

==History==
The CDWA is a product of the Art Information Task Force (AITF), which encouraged dialog between art historians, art information professionals, and information providers so that together they could develop guidelines for describing works of art, architecture, groups of objects, and visual and textual surrogates. 

Formed in the early 1990s, the task force was made up of representatives from the communities that provide and use art information: art historians, museum curators and registrars, visual resource professionals, art librarians, information managers, and technical specialists. The work of the AITF was funded by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], with a two-year matching grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) to the [[College Art Association]] (CAA).

==CDWA Lite== &lt;!-- [[Lightweight Information Describing Objects]] redirects here --&gt;
[[ARTstor]], the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], and RLG Programs/[[OCLC]] have worked together to develop an XML schema to describe cultural materials and their surrogates to provide an easier and more sustainable model for contributing to union resources. This initiative was driven by the absence of a data content standard specifically designed for unique cultural works, and a technical format for expressing this data in a machine-readable format.

CDWA Lite is an XML schema to describe core records for works of art and material culture based on CDWA and the Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) content standard. CDWA Lite records are intended for contribution to union catalogs and other repositories using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) harvesting protocol. The CDWA Lite schema has been enlarged and integrated into the [[LIDO|Lightweight Information Describing Objects (LIDO)]] schema, which is available on the CIDOC site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA)|url=https://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Changes''''' is a British [[television advertisement]] launched in 1987 to promote the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk2|second-generation]] of the [[Volkswagen Golf]]. The 50-second ad was directed by [[David Bailey]] and stars the model [[Paula Hamilton]] as a woman throwing away some of her possessions. After discarding her wedding ring, pearl necklace, brooch and mink coat, she decides to keep her Volkswagen Golf and drives off in it with a smile on her face. ''Changes'' was named after the song that was used as its soundtrack, written by [[Alan Price]]. It was awarded the Silver prize at the 1988 British Arrows Awards, and is remembered as an indicator of car advertising's recognition of women's growing independence.

==Sequence==
A woman (Paula Hamilton) is leaving her husband. She tearfully exits her [[mews]] house, removes her wedding ring and posts it back through the letter box. Walking away, she angrily tears off her pearl necklace, throws away her brooch, and removes her mink coat. She approaches a drain, but, as she goes to drop the keys to her Volkswagen Golf down it, she changes her mind and decides instead to keep the car.&lt;ref name="Dickason 2000 p. 74"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dickason | first=R. | title=British Television Advertising: Cultural Identity and Communication | publisher=University of Luton Press | year=2000 | isbn=978-1-86020-571-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fyy5aMpa468C&amp;pg=PA74 | pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advert ends with her driving off in the Golf with a smile on her face; its [[strapline]] reads: "If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen."&lt;ref name=Hardy/&gt;

==Production==
''Changes'' was created by the advertising agency [[Boase Massimi Pollitt]] on behalf of [[Volkswagen]]. It was directed by the British photographer David Bailey, who had first discovered Hamilton.&lt;ref name=Eden/&gt; For the piece, Hamilton was styled to resemble [[Princess Diana]].&lt;ref name=Nolan/&gt; The music used was the song "Changes" by [[Alan Price]], which also gave its title to the advert itself. Set to the tune of "[[What a Friend We Have in Jesus]]", the song was written by Price for his friend [[Zoot Money]] while he was going through a divorce.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

==Reception==
Critical reaction to the advert was positive—it was awarded the Silver prize at the 1988 [[British Arrows Awards]].&lt;ref name=HAT/&gt; As a result of the success of ''Changes'', Hamilton was catapulted to fame, but grew to resent only being known for it. Speaking to [[Matthew Wright (television presenter)|Matthew Wright]] in 1997, she remarked: "All I always seem to be known as is Paula Hamilton the alcoholic and Volkswagen girl."&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

==Legacy==
''Changes'' is remembered as an indicator of car advertising beginning to recognise women's increased independence – previous car adverts had largely only either featured women as models or depicted them as passengers. Reflecting on the advert in May 1998, Stephen Armstrong of ''[[The Guardian]]'' named it as one of the five best advertising campaigns, and remarked that it had "spawned a new era in car advertising".&lt;ref name=Armstrong/&gt; In April 2000 ''Changes'' was ranked at number 42 on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The 100 Greatest TV Ads]]'', where it was described as being "a sign that [[feminism]] had at last reached the ad men".&lt;ref name="100 Greatest"/&gt;

The '''''Communion of the Apostles''''', or '''''Institution of the Eucharist''''' is a painting of the [[Last Supper]] by [[Federico Barocci]] located at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome. It was commissioned for the family chapel of [[Pope Clement VIII]] Aldobrandini and completed between 1603 and 1608.&lt;ref name=Apostasy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstegen|first1=Ian|title=The apostasy of Michelangelo in a painting by Federico Barocci|journal=Notes in the History of Art|date=Spring 2003|volume=22|issue=3|pages=27–34|jstor=23206723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was most likely the sight of Barocci's ''Presentation of the Virgin'' in the Chiesa Nuova at its unveiling in 1603 that led to the commission of the ''Communion'' four months later. On 13 August 1603 the pope communicated with the minister to [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere]], duke of Urbino, Giacomo Sorbolongo, about acquiring an altarpiece from Barocci.{{efn|Stasera uerso il tardi il Papa mi ha fatto chiamare, et quando sono stato dent'ro, mi ha detto ridendo, che se bene era cosa leggieri, per la quale mi hauea fatto dimandare, era per'o un suo gusto et seguit'o, come fa fabricare una Capella qui nella Minerua in memoria de' suoi, Padre, Madre et fratelli, et desiderando, che nell'altare di essa ci fosse il quadro fatto da uallente huomo, se bene qui ce ne sono et in particulare ha Iseppino, non dimeno si sodisfarebbe assai hauerlo di mano del Baroccio.}} At this time the [[Cavaliere d'Arpino]] was the pope's most important artist; the letter goes on to ask that d'Arpino not be told of the commission.{{efn|desidera non si sappia da altri tal pratica, massime per rispetto d'Iseppino}}&lt;ref name=Verstegen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstegen|first1=Ian|title=Federico Barocci, Federico Borromeo, and the Oratorian Orbit|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Spring 2003|volume=56|issue=1|pages=56–87|doi=10.2307/1262258|jstor=1262258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission was completed entirely in [[Urbino]] and efforts were made to supply Barocci with extensive information about the contextual chapel, which was frescoed by [[Cherubino Alberti]] with a ''Triumph of the Holy Cross''.&lt;ref name=Emiliani&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emiliani|first1=Andrea|title=Federico Barocci (Urbino 1535-1612)|date=1985|publisher=Nuova Alfa Editoriale|location=Bologna|pages=376–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gian Pietro Bellori wrote that the pope was supplied with preparatory sketches.&lt;ref name=Wohl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellori|first1=Giovanni Pietro|last2=Wohl|first2=Alice Sedgwick|last3=Wohl|first3=Hellmut|last4=Montanari|first4=Tomaso|title=Giovan Pietro Bellori: The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521781879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope sought the removal of Satan from the original design,&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt; and thereafter asked that it depict a night scene.&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=Thomas|title=Color and the Exchange of Ideas between Patron and Artist in Renaissance Italy|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 2000|volume=82|issue=2|pages=298–308|doi=10.2307/3051378|jstor=3051378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barocci quotes from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'' by inserting the portrait of [[Heraclitus]], which many believe is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]]. Significantly, he depicts [[Judas Iscariot]] using Michelangelo's portrait.&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt; To an audience familiar with this association, this would have been taken as particularly strong commentary on the status of the Michelangelo.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=Morten Steen|title=In Michelangelo's Mirror|date=2013|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271056401|pages=148–149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUI9xD9ghpgC|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by directly quoting from Raphael, who was Michelangelo's antithesis and favoured by the Clementine church, Barocci, and by implication Pope Clement VIII, inserted a comment on the relative status of the two artists within the church of the time.&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt;

Barocci asked 1,500 scudi for the altarpiece. The fee undoubtedly was influenced by the number of figures. At the same point in his career (1604), he had accepted 300 scudi for a much simpler ''Crucifixion'' (Museo del Prado, Madrid).&lt;ref name=Spear&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spear|first1=Richard|title=Scrambling for Scudi: Notes on Painters' Earnings in Early Baroque Rome|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=310–320|doi=10.2307/3177346|jstor=3177346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of East Timor}}

The '''Cuisine of East Timor''' consists of regional popular foods such as [[pork]], [[fish]], [[basil]], [[tamarind]], [[legume]]s, [[corn]], [[rice]], [[root vegetable]]s, and [[tropical fruit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food of East Timor|url=http://visiteasttimor.com/food-east-timor|publisher=Visit East Timor}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Timorese cuisine has influences from Southeast Asian foods and from Portuguese dishes from its [[Portuguese Timor|colonisation by Portugal]]. Flavours and ingredients from other former Portuguese colonies can be found due to the presence of Portuguese soldiers from other colonies in East Timor.

== East Timorese Dishes ==
The food in East Timor is divided into two categories: vegetarian and non vegetarian.
As agriculture is the main occupation in East Timor, the primary food is rice, which is cultivated widely in this country. Apart from rice, other staple food items that are cultivated in East Timor include sweet potatoes, maize, cassava, and taro. These primary staples are supplemented with beans, cabbage, spinach, onions and cowpeas.

The second category of food consists of poultry, pigs, and goats. Most homes in East Timor raise their own food animals for meat. Fish is also a source of animal protein in this country as fishing is also an important occupation after agriculture.

* Batar daan- A popular dish of corn, [[mung bean]]s, and [[pumpkin]].
* Budu- A sauce of [[tomato]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], and [[Spanish onion]].

[[File:Timor-cafe-Batar daan.jpg|thumb|An East Timorese dish of ikan sabuko with batar daan, rice and budu.]]

* Ikan sabuko- A Spanish [[mackerel]] in tamarind marinade with basil and [[capsicum]].
* [[Tapai]]- A fermented rice dish. It is sweet, sour, and slightly alcoholic.
* Caril - A mild chicken [[curry]] with a roasted capsicum and [[coconut]] paste.
* [[Feijoada]] – A common dish of former Portuguese colonies, it is made with pork, [[cannellini]] beans and [[chorizo]].

== Hungry season ==
East Timor's crops rely on the rains that come following the annual dry season. This leads to a period of poor [[food security]] coined the “Hungry Season” from November to February due to the unpredictable [[climate]]. Many households depend on their own production of food because of the erratic climate conditions, such as [[drought]]s.

Many families subsist on [[akar (food)|akar]], which is a widely available food source for the poor. It is dried [[palm tree]] bark, beaten into a powder, mixed with water to form a [[Fruit preserves|jelly]] and then cooked over fire. This leads to cases where nearly 58% of children under the age of five suffer from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMOR-LESTE: Chronic malnutrition among world's highest|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/92039/timor-leste-chronic-malnutrition-among-world-s-highest|publisher=Irin News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Desserts ==
[[File:Timor-cafe-2-bibinka.jpg|thumb|Bibinka - a grilled and layered coconut cake.]]
* [[Bibinka]]- A grilled and layered coconut cake
* [[Portuguese tart]] (pastel de nata)- an egg tart pastry

== Coffee ==
The [[coffee]] of East Timor is organic and a major [[cash crop]] for the island nation. Coffee accounts for 90 percent of the country’s non-oil exports, while 46 percent of East Timorese households rely solely on coffee for their income

The crop has grown in the country for centuries. It accounted for half of the country's trade when it was a Portuguese colony in the late 1800s, but during 24 years of Indonesian occupation the bumper business was neglected when the military took over - prices fluctuated and many coffee plantations were battlefields so the quality of beans worsened.

By the war’s end, agricultural experts estimated two generation’s worth of farming knowledge was lost and some plantations were abandoned. But because the trees got little attention the pesticide and fertiliser-free groves are popular for organic coffee lovers. Today, the coffee is known as the golden prince of East Timor agriculture - worth $10 million a year, 46,000 coffee farms employ one-fifth of East Timor’s population but it is a major battle to encourage farmers to improve the quality of East Timor’s agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=101East|title=Where the wild coffee grows|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2013/06/2013617121433808710.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Angola}}
The '''culture of [[Angola]]''' is influenced by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. Portugal [[Portuguese Angola|occupied]] the coastal enclave [[Luanda]], and later also [[Benguela]], since the 16th/17th centuries, and expanded into the territory of what is now Angola in the 19th/20th centuries, ruling it until 1975. Both countries share cultural aspects: language ([[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]) and main religion ([[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity]]). However, the Angolan culture is mostly native [[Bantu people|Bantu]], which was mixed with [[culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]]. The diverse ethnic communities with their own cultural traits, traditions and native languages or dialects include the [[Ovimbundu]], [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]], [[Bakongo]], [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]], [[Avambo]] and other peoples.

==Ethnic groups and languages==
There are over 100 distinct ethnic groups and languages/dialects in Angola. Although [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language, for many black Angolans it is a second or even third language. The three dominant [[ethnic group]]s are the [[Ovimbundu]], [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] (better called Ambundu, speaking Kimbundu) and the [[Bakongo]]. There are also small numbers of Mestiço (mixed African and European descent) and ethnic white Europeans as well.

===Ovimbundu===
The largest ethnolinguistic category, the Ovimbundu, were located in west-central Angola, south of Mbundu-inhabited regions. In 1988 the [[United States Department of State]] estimated that they constituted 37 percent of the population. The language of the Ovimbundu is [[Umbundu]].

The core area of the Ovimbundu kingdoms was that part of the Benguela Plateau north of the town of Huambo. Expansion continuing into the twentieth century enlarged their territory considerably, although most Ovimbundu remained in that part of the plateau above 1,200 meters in elevation.

Like most African groups of any size, the Ovimbundu were formed by the mixture of groups of diverse origin (and varying size). Little is known of developments before the seventeenth century, but there is some evidence of additions to the people who occupied the Benguela Plateau at that time. Over time, a number of political entities, usually referred to as kingdoms, were formed. By the eighteenth century, there were twenty-two kingdoms. Thirteen were fully independent; the other nine were largely autonomous but owed tribute to one of the more powerful entities, usually the kingdom of Bailundu, but in some cases Wambu or Ciyaka. By the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century, effective occupation by the Portuguese had caused a fairly rapid decline in the power of the heads of these kingdoms, but Ovimbundu continued to think of themselves as members of one or another of the groups based on these political units after [[World War II]].

In addition, to the groups that clearly spoke dialects of Umbundu, there were two on the periphery of Ovimbundu distribution: the [[Mbui]], who seemed to straddle the linguistic boundary between the Ovimbundu and the Mbundu; and the [[Dombe]] living to the west near the coast, whose language was closely related to Umbundu, although not a dialect of it. The Dombe and several other groups, including the Nganda and the Hanya (who, according to one account, spoke Umbundu dialects) relied on cattle raising, as did their southern neighbors, the Herero and the Ovambo. Still others, typically the old tributary kingdoms, came to speak Umbundu relatively recently.

Until the Portuguese established firm control over their territory, the Ovimbundu – particularly those of the major kingdoms of Bailundu (to the northwest), Bihe (to the northeast), and Wambu (in the center) – played important roles as intermediaries in the [[slave]], [[ivory]], and [[beeswax]] trades, acting as carriers, entrepreneurs, and raiders. With the decline of the slave trade in the last decades of the nineteenth century, the entrepreneurs among the Ovimbundu turned to the rubber trade, abandoning the warfare and raiding that had hitherto been integrally related to their economic activities. The [[rubber]] slump at the beginning of the twentieth century, the end of the de facto autonomy of their kingdoms not long after, and the displacement of Ovimbundu traders by the Portuguese forced these people to turn to cash-crop agriculture. (The men had hitherto had little involvement with cultivation; in fact, the women continued to be responsible for the cultivation of [[subsistence crop]]s.)

The introduction of [[cash crop]]s, particularly [[coffee]], led to a series of changes in settlement patterns and social arrangements. But after a time, soil exhaustion, lack of support of African agriculture by the colonial authorities, incursions of Portuguese settlers who took over valuable property in the highlands, and a number of other factors contributed to a decline in the success of Ovimbundu cash-crop agriculture. By the early 1960s, up to 100,000 Ovimbundu, estimated at one-quarter of the group's able-bodied adult males, were migrating on one-year and two-year labor contracts to the coffee [[plantation]]s of Uíge and Cuanza Norte provinces; another 15,000 to 20,000 sought work in Luanda and Lobito; and roughly the same number worked in the industrial plants of [[Huambo]] or for European farmers in the [[Benguela Plateau]]. In most cases, remuneration was low, but these migrant workers had little alternative. This pattern continued through the remainder of the colonial period, except for those males who were involved in nationalist activity (usually with [[UNITA]]).

In the 1940s, the Ovimbundu organized what was probably the most closely knit Angolan community of the colonial era. With the financial and ideological aid of North American [[Christian]] missionaries, they established a network of Christian villages, each with its own leadership, schools, churches, and clinics. They were thus able to maintain the Ovimbundu culture while providing educational and social amenities for their children. The generation that emerged from this structure became the disciples of [[Jonas Savimbi]] and the basis for UNITA, which in the 1980s used the same concepts to maintain Ovimbundu cohesiveness within UNITA-controlled areas.

Given the degree of change in Ovimbundu society and the involvement of the Ovimbundu with UNITA, it was difficult to determine their long-range role in Angolan politics. Just how long Ovimbundu solidarity would persist under changing circumstances could not be predicted.

===Mbundu===
Just north of Ovimbundu territory lived the Mbundu, the second largest ethnolinguistic category, whose language was Kimbundu. In 1988 they made up an estimated 25 percent of the Angolan population. In the sixteenth century, most of the groups that came to be known as Mbundu (a name apparently first applied by the neighboring Bakongo) lived well to the east of the coast in the plateau region (at a somewhat lower altitude than the Ovimbundu); a few groups in the far northeast lived at altitudes below 700 meters. In general, the outlines of the area occupied by the Mbundu had remained the same. The major exception was their expansion of this area to parts of the coast formerly occupied by Bakongo and others.

Although most of the boundaries of Mbundu territory remained fairly firm, the social and linguistic boundaries of the category had shifted, some of the peripheral groups having been variably influenced by neighboring groups and the groups close to the coast having been more strongly influenced by the Portuguese than were the more remote ones. Moreover, the subdivisions discernible for the sixteenth century (and perhaps earlier) also changed in response to a variety of social and linguistic influences in the colonial period. The Mbundu in general and the western Mbundu in particular, located as they were not far from [[Luanda]], were susceptible to those influences for a longer time and in a more intense way than were other Angolan groups.

There were a number of Kimbundu dialects and groups. Two, each incorporating Portuguese terms, gradually became dominant, serving as [[lingua franca]]s for many Mbundu. The western dialect was centered in Luanda, to which many Mbundu had migrated over the years. The people speaking it, largely urban, had come to call themselves Ambundu or Akwaluanda, thus distinguishing themselves from rural Mbundu. The eastern dialect, known as Ambakista, had its origins in the eighteenth century in a mixed Portuguese-Mbundu trading center at Ambaca near the western edge of the plateau region, but it spread in the nineteenth century through much of eastern Mbundu territory. Another Kimbundu-speaking group, the Dembos, were generally included in the Mbundu category. Living north of Luanda, they had also been strongly influenced by Kikongo speakers.

By the late 1960s, the Mbundu living in the cities, such as Luanda and Malanje, had adopted attributes of Portuguese lifestyle . Many had intermarried with Portuguese, which led to the creation of an entirely new class of mestiços. Those who received formal education and fully adopted Portuguese customs became assimilados.

The Mbundu were the [[MPLA]]'s strongest supporters when the movement first formed in 1956. The MPLA's president, [[Agostinho Neto]], was the son of a Mbundu [[Methodist]] pastor and a graduate of a Portuguese medical school. In the 1980s, the Mbundu were predominant in Luanda, [[Bengo (province)|Bengo]], Cuanza Norte, Malanje, and northern Cuanza Sul provinces.

===Bakongo===
[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|[[Yombe people|Yombe]]-sculpture, 19th century]]
The Kikongo-speaking Bakongo made up an estimated 15 percent of the Angolan population. In 1988 the Bakongo were the third largest ethnolinguistic group in Angola. Concentrated in Uíge, Zaire, and Cabinda provinces, where they constituted a majority of the population, the Bakongo spilled over into the nation of [[Zaire]] (where they were the largest single ethnic group) and Congo. Although the Angolan city of São Salvador (renamed Mbanza Congo) was the capital of their ancient kingdom, most of the Bakongo were situated in Zaire.

Their former political unity long broken, the various segments of the ethnolinguistic category in Angola experienced quite different influences in the colonial period. The Bashikongo, living near the coast, had the most sustained interaction with the Portuguese but were less affected by participation in the coffee economy than the Sosso and Pombo, who were situated farther east and south. All three groups, however, were involved in the uprising of 1961. The Pombo, still farther east but close to the Zairian border, were much influenced by developments in the Belgian Congo (present-day Zaire), and a large contingent of Pombo living in Léopoldville (present-day [[Kinshasa]]) formed a political party in the early 1950s. The Solongo, dwelling on the relatively dry coastal plain, had little contact with the Portuguese. They and the Ashiluanda of the island of Luanda, to the south, were Angola's only African sea fishermen.

The Mayombe (also spelled Maiombe) of the mountain forests of Cabinda spoke a dialect of [[Kikongo]] but were not part of the ancient kingdom. That part of the Mayombe living in Zaire did join with the Zairian Bakongo in the Alliance of Bakongo (Alliance des Bakongo –  Abako) during the period of party formation in the Belgian Congo, but the Cabindan Mayombe (and other Kikongo-speaking groups in the enclave), relatively remote geographically and culturally from the Bakongo of Angola proper, showed no solidarity with the latter. Instead, in 1961 the Mayombe formed a Cabindan separatist movement, the Alliance of Mayombe (Alliance de Mayombe – Alliama), which merged with two other Cabindan separatist movements in 1963 to form the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda – [[FLEC]]).

One of the first major revolts of the nationalist struggle was instigated by Bakongo in March 1961 in the northwest. The Portuguese crushed the peasant attack, organized by the Bakongo group, the Union of Angolan Peoples (União das Populações de Angola  –  UPA), on their settlements, farms, and administrative outposts. Subsequently, 400,000 Bakongo fled into Zaire. In 1962 the UPA formed the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola  –  FNLA), which became one of the three major nationalist groups (the other two being the MPLA and UNITA) involved in the long and bloody war of independence. Most of the FNLA's traditional Bakongo constituency fled into exile in Zaire during the war. Following independence, however, many Bakongo exiles returned to their traditional homesteads in Angola. They had since retained their ethnolinguistic integrity.

The Bakongo are a matriarchal tribe, which means that the women have the authority and power in the tribe.

===Lunda-Chokwe===
The hyphenated category Lunda-Chokwe constituted an estimated 8 percent of the Angolan population in 1988. As the hyphenation implies, the category comprises at least two subsets, the origins of which are known to be different and the events leading to their inclusion in a single set are recent. The [[Lunda people|Lunda]] alone were a congeries of peoples brought together in the far-flung Lunda Empire (seventeenth century to nineteenth century) under the hegemony of a people calling themselves Ruund, its capital in the eastern section of Zaire's [[Katanga Province]](present-day Shaba Province). Lunda is the form of the name used for the Ruund and for themselves by adjacent peoples to the south who came under Ruund domination. In some sources, the Ruund are called Northern Lunda, and their neighbors are called Southern Lunda. The most significant element of the latter, called Ndembu (or Ndembo), lived in Zaire and [[Zambia]]. In Angola the people with whom the northward-expanding [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] came into contact were chiefly Ruund speakers. The economic and political decline of the empire by the second half of the nineteenth century and the demarcation of colonial boundaries ended Ruund political domination over those elements beyond the Zairian borders.

The Chokwe, until the latter half of the nineteenth century a small group of hunters and traders living near the headwaters of the Cuango and Cassai rivers, were at the southern periphery of the Lunda Empire and paid tribute to its head. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Chokwe became increasingly involved in trading and raiding, and they expanded in all directions, but chiefly to the north, in part absorbing the Ruund and other peoples. In the late nineteenth century, the Chokwe went so far as to invade the capital of the much-weakened empire in Katanga. As a consequence of this Chokwe activity, a mixed population emerged in parts of Zaire as well as in Angola, although there were virtually homogenous communities in both countries consisting of Chokwe, Ruund, or Southern Lunda.

The intermingling of Lunda (Ruund and Southern Lunda) and Chokwe, in which other smaller groups were presumably also caught up, continued until about 1920. It was only after that time that the mixture acquired the hyphenated label and its members began to think of themselves (in some contexts) as one people.

The languages spoken by the various elements of the so-called Lunda-Chokwe were more closely related to each other than to other [[Bantu languages]] in the Zairian-Angolan savanna but were by no means mutually intelligible. The three major tongues (Ruund, Lunda, and Chokwe) had long been distinct from each other, although some borrowing of words, particularly of Ruund political titles by the others, had occurred.

Portuguese [[anthropologist]]s and some others accepting their work have placed some of the peoples (Minungu and Shinji) in this area with the Mbundu, and the Minungu language is sometimes considered a transitional one between Kimbundu and Chokwe. There may in fact have been important Mbundu influence on these two peoples, but the work of a number of linguists places their languages firmly with the set that includes Ruund, Lunda, and Chokwe.

Economic and political developments in the 1970s affected various sections of the Lunda-Chokwe differently. Substantial numbers of them live in or near Lunda Norte Province, which contains the principal diamond mines of Angola. Diamond mining had been significant since 1920, and preindependence data show that the industry employed about 18,000 persons. Moreover, the [[mining]] company provided medical and educational facilities for its employees and their dependents, thereby affecting even greater numbers. How many of those employed were Lunda-Chokwe is not clear, although neighboring villages would have been affected by the presence of the mining complex in any case. In the intra-Angolan political conflict preceding and immediately following independence, there apparently was some division between the northern Lunda-Chokwe, especially those with some urban experience, who tended to support the MPLA, and the rural Chokwe, particularly those farther south, who tended to support UNITA. In the 1980s, as the UNITA insurgency intensified in the border areas of eastern and northern Angola, Lunda-Chokwe families were forced to flee into Zaire's Shaba Province, where many remained in 1988, living in three sites along the [[Benguela Railway]]. The impact of this move on the ethnolinguistic integrity of these people was not known.

A somewhat different kind of political impact began in the late 1960s, when refugees from Katanga in Zaire, speakers of Lunda or a related language, crossed the border into what are now Lunda Sul and northern Moxico provinces. In 1977 and 1978, these refugees and others whom they had recruited formed the National Front for the Liberation of the Congo (Front National pour la Libération du Congo – FNLC) and used the area as a base from which they launched their invasions of Shaba Province. In the 1980s, these rebels and perhaps still other refugees remained in Angola, many in Lunda Sul Province, although the Angolan government as part of its rapprochement with Zaire was encouraging them to return to their traditional homes. The Zairian government offered amnesty to political exiles on several occasions in the late 1980s and conferred with the Angolan government on the issue of refugees. In 1988, however, a significant number of Zairian refugees continued to inhabit LundaChokwe territory. The significance for local Lunda-Chokwe of the presence and activities of these Zairians was not known.

===Nganguela===
[[Ngangela language|Ngangela]] is generic term for a number of closely related Bantu languages in south-eastern Angola spoken by the Ngonzelo, Luchazi, Nyemba, Luvale, Luimbi, Mbunda, Mbuela, Yauma and Nkangala ethnic groups. [[Yauma language]] and [[Nkangala language]] are in turn Mbunda dialects. Nkangala, Mbalango, Sango, Ciyengele ("Shamuka") and Ndundu are closely related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bantu languages.com/fr/zonek.html Bantu-Languages.com]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, citing Maniacky 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ovambo, Nyaneka-Nkhumbi, Herero, and others===
In far southwestern Angola, three categories of Bantu-speaking peoples have been distinguished. Two of them, the Ovambo and the Herero, were more heavily represented elsewhere: the Ovambo in [[Namibia]] and the Herero in Namibia and [[Botswana]]. The Herero dispersion, especially that section of it in Botswana, was the consequence of the migration of the Herero from German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) after their rebellion against German rule in 1906. The third group was the Nyaneka-Humbe. Unlike the other groups, the Nyaneka-Humbe did not disperse outside Angola. In 1988 the Nyaneka-Humbe (the first group is also spelled Haneca; the latter group is also spelled Nkumbi) constituted 3 percent of the population. The Ovambo, of which the largest subgroup were the Kwanhama (also spelled Kwanyama), made up an estimated 2 percent of the Angolan population. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Kwanhama Kingdom of southern Angola was a powerful state involved in a lucrative trade relationship with the Portuguese, who, together with the Germans, occupied Kwanhama territory in the early twentieth century. In the 1980s, the Ovambo were semi[[nomad]]ic cattle herders and farmers. The Herero constituted no more than 0.5 percent of the population in 1988. Traditionally, the Herero were nomadic or seminomadic herders living in the arid coastal lowlands and in the mountainous escarpment to the east in Namibe, Benguela, and Huíla provinces. Many Herero migrated south to Namibia when the Portuguese launched a military expedition against them in 1940 following their refusal to pay taxes.

In the southeastern corner of the country the Portuguese distinguished a set of Bantu-speaking people, described on a map prepared by José Redinha in 1973 as the Xindonga. The sole linguistic group listed in this category was the Cussu. The Language Map of Africa, prepared under the direction of David Dalby for the International African Institute, noted two sets of related languages in southeastern Angola. The first set included Liyuwa, Mashi, and North Mbukushu. These languages and other members of the set were also found in Zambia and Namibia. The members of the second set, Kwangali-Gcikuru and South Mbukushu, were also found in Namibia and Botswana. The hyphen between Kwangali and Gcikuru implies mutual intelligibility. Little is known of these groups; in any case, their members were very few.

All of these southern Angolan groups relied in part or in whole on cattle raising for subsistence. Formerly, the Herero were exclusively herders, but they gradually came to engage in some cultivation. Although the Ovambo had depended in part on cultivation for a much longer time, dairy products had been an important source of subsistence, and cattle were the chief measure of wealth and prestige.

The southwestern groups, despite their remoteness from the major centers of white influence during most of the colonial period, were to varying degrees affected by the colonial presence and, after World War II, by the arrival of numbers of Portuguese in such places as Moçâmedes (present-day Namibe) and Sá da Bandeira (present-day Lubango). The greatest resistance to the Portuguese was offered by the Ovambo, who were not made fully subject to colonial rule until 1915 and who earned a considerable reputation among the Portuguese and other Africans for their efforts to maintain their independence. In the nationalist struggle of the 1960s and early 1970s and in the postindependence civil war, the Ovambo tended to align themselves with the Ovimbundu-dominated UNITA. Many also sympathized with the cause of [[SWAPO]], a mostly Ovambo organization fighting to liberate Namibia from [[South Africa]]n rule.

===Hunters, gatherers, herders, and others===
Throughout the lower third of Angola, chiefly in the drier areas, were small bands of people. Until the twentieth century, most of them were nomadic hunters and gatherers, although some engaged in [[herd]]ing, either in addition to their other subsistence activities or as their chief means of livelihood. Those who survived turned, at least in part, to cultivation.

The bands living a nomadic or seminomadic life in Cuando Cubango Province (and occasionally reaching as far east as the upper Cunene River) differed physically and linguistically from their sedentary Bantu-speaking neighbors. Short, saffron-colored, and in other respects physically unlike the Nganguela, Ovambo, and Nyaneka-Humbe, they spoke a language of the !Xu-Angola or Maligo set of tongues referred to as Khoisan or [[Click language]]s (the exclamation point denotes a specific kind of click), whose precise relations to each other are not yet fully understood by observers.

Several other hunting and gathering or herding groups, the members of which were taller and otherwise physically more like the local Bantu speakers, lived farther west, adjacent to the Ovambo and Herero. These people spoke Bantu languages and were less nomadic than the Khoisan speakers, but they were clearly different from the Ovambo and Herero and probably preceded them in the area. As with most African art, the wooden masks and sculptures of Angola are not merely aesthetic creations. They play an important role in cultural rituals, representing life and death, the passage from childhood to adulthood, the celebration of a new harvest and the marking of the hunting season.
Angolan artisans work in wood, bronze, ivory, malachite or ceramic mediums. Each ethno-linguistic group in Angola has its own unique artistic traits. Perhaps the single most famous piece of Angolan art is the Cokwe thinker, a masterpiece of harmony and symmetry of line. The Lunda-Cokwe in the north eastern part of Angola is also known for its superior plastic arts.

Other signature pieces of Angolan art include the female mask Mwnaa-Pwo worn by male dancers in their puberty rituals, the polychromatic Kalelwa masks used during circumcision ceremonies, Cikungu and Cihongo masks which conjure up the images of the Lunda-Cokwe mythology (two key figures in this pantheon are princess Lweji and the civilizing prince Tschibinda-Ilunga), and the black ceramic art of Moxico of central/eastern Angola.

===Mestiço===
In 1960 a little more than 1 percent of the total population of Angola consisted of ''mestiços''. It has been estimated that by 1970 these people constituted perhaps 2 percent of the population. Some ''mestiços'' left at independence, but the departure of much greater numbers of Portuguese probably resulted in an increase in the proportion of ''mestiços'' in the Angolan total. In 1988 ''mestiços'' probably continued to number about 2 percent of the Angolan population.

The process of mixing started very early and continued until independence. But it was not until about 1900, when the number of Portuguese in Angola was very small and consisted almost entirely of males, that the percentage of ''mestiços'' in the population exceeded the percentage of whites.

After a number of generations, the antecedents of many ''mestiços'' became mixed to the extent that the Portuguese felt a need to establish a set of distinctions among them. Many ''mestiços'' accepted this system as a means of social ranking. One source suggests that the term ''mestiço'' used alone in a social context applied specifically to the offspring of a mulatto and a white; the term ''mestiço cabrito'' referred to the descendant of a union between two mulattos; and the term ''mestico cafuso'' was applied to the child of a union between a mulatto and a black African. It is possible that an even more complex set of distinctions was sometimes used.

Most ''mestiços'' were urban dwellers and had learned to speak Portuguese either as a household language or in school. Although some of the relatively few rural ''mestiços'' lived like the Africans among whom they dwelt, most apparently achieved the status of ''assimilados,'' the term applied before 1961 to those nonwhites who fulfilled certain specific requirements and were therefore registered as Portuguese citizens.

With some exceptions, ''mestiços'' tended to identify with Portuguese culture, and their strongly voiced opposition over the years to the conditions imposed by the colonial regime stressed their rights to a status equivalent to that of whites. Before World War II, only occasionally did ''mestiço'' intellectuals raise their voices on behalf of the African population. Thus, despite the involvement of ''mestiços'' in the nationalist struggle beginning in 1961 and their very important role in the upper echelons of the government and party, significant segments of the African population tended to resent them. This legacy continued in the late 1980s because ''mestiços'' dominated the MPLA-PT hierarchy.

Starting in the late 1970s, an average of 50,000 Cuban troops and civilian technical personnel (the overwhelming majority of whom were male) were stationed in Angola. As a result, a portion of the nation's younger population was undoubtedly of mixed African and Cuban descent. This new category of racial mixture, however, had not been described by researchers as of late 1988, and no figures existed on how many Angolans might fall into this category.

'''Dai De''' ({{zh|c=戴德|p=Dài Dé}}), also known as '''Da Dai''', ({{zh|c=大戴|l=Big Dai|s=|t=}}; more formally, "Dai the Greater"), birth and death unknown, was a Confucian scholar of the [[Former Han Dynasty]]. He was active during the reign of [[Emperor Yuan of Han]] (48–33 BC).

He was the son of [[Dai Ren]] (戴仁) and the uncle of [[Dai Sheng]]. He was a native of Liang (now [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and a founder of the New Text Confucian (Simplified:今文经学; Traditional: 今文經學 [[Jinwen Jingxue|''Jinwen jingxue'']]) exegesis of “classical texts concerned with codes of conduct” (Simplified: 今文礼学; Traditional: 今文禮學: ''Jinwen lixue'')  during the [[Former Han Dynasty]]. 

He was traditionally credited with producing a substantially edited version of the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' (''Li Ji'') that bore his name: ''Dai the Greater's Book of Rites'' (大戴禮記 ''Da Dai Li Ji''). It is likely, however, that Dai's prestigious name was attached to a reduced version of the ''Book of Rites'' in order to legitimate a much-revised text.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey K. Riegel, ”Ta Tai Li chii 大戴禮記” in Michael Lowe, ed., ''Early Chinese Texts: A Bibliographical Guide'' (Berkeley CA: The Society for the Study of Early China and the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, 1993), pp. 456-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the preceding version was said to have consisted of an initial 131 essays (篇 ''pian''), to which an additional 83 were subsequently added. Dai is said to have reduced the resulting 214 essays to 85, which his nephew, Dai Sheng, was then supposed to have further reduced too 46. 3 additional essays were added later to reach a final total of 49. There is no reliable evidence, however, to attribute these revisions to either Dai De or Dai Sheng, both of whom were, nevertheless, trained as Confucian scholars specializing in various texts concerning "codes of conduct" (禮 ''li''). Dai's reputed influence on these related texts, which include the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]''  and the ''[[Etiquette and Ceremonial|Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial]]'', is equally uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey K. Riegel, “Li chi 禮記,” in Michael Lowe, ed., ''Early Chinese Texts: A Bibliographical Guide'' (Berkeley CA: The Society for the Study of Early China and the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley, 1993), pp. 293-97; Michael Lowe, “Dai De,” in Xinzhong Yao, edl,  ''RoutledgeCurzon Encyclopedia of Confucianism'' (New York: Routledge, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

A short biography of Dai can be found in the ''RoutledgeCurzon Encyclopedia of Confucianism'' (Routledge, 2003).

{{Nihongo|'''''&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE "Death note" to "Desu nōto". Even though the "Japanese" name is "Desu nōto", the real and official name is "Death note". --&gt;Death Note'''''|デスノート|Desu Nōto|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written by [[Tsugumi Ohba]] and illustrated by [[Takeshi Obata]]. The story follows [[Light Yagami]], a high school student who stumbles across a mysterious otherworldly notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the [[Shinigami]] [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]], and grants its user the power to kill anyone whose name and face he knows. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to change the world into a utopian society without crime as a god-like vigilante named "Kira" and the subsequent efforts of [[List of Death Note characters#Kira Investigation Team|an elite task-force of law enforcement officials]], consisting of members of the Japanese police agency led by [[L (Death Note)|L]], an enigmatic international detective, to apprehend him and end his reign of terror.

''Death Note'' was first serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s manga magazine ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' from December 2003 to May 2006. The 108 chapters were collected and published into 12 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes between April 2004 and July 2006. An [[anime]] television adaptation aired in Japan from October 3, 2006, to June 26, 2007. Composed of 37 episodes, the anime was developed by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and directed by [[Tetsurō Araki]]. A [[light novel]] based on the series, written by [[Nisio Isin]], was also released in 2006. Additionally, various video games have been published by [[Konami]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. The series was adapted into three [[live action]] films released in Japan on [[Death Note (2006 film)|June 17, 2006]], [[Death Note 2: The Last Name|November 3, 2006]], and [[L: Change the World|February 2, 2008]], and [[Death Note (2015 TV series)|a television drama]] in 2015. A miniseries entitled ''[[Death Note: New Generation]]'' and [[Death Note: Light Up the New World|a fourth film]] were released in 2016. An [[Death Note (2017 film)|American film adaptation]] was released on [[Netflix]] on August 25, 2017.

''Death Note'' media is licensed and released in North America by [[Viz Media]], with the exception of the video games and soundtracks. The episodes from the anime first appeared in North America as downloadable from [[IGN]], before [[Viz Media]] licensed it and it aired on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]'s [[Bionix]] anime block in Canada and on [[Adult Swim]] in the United States with a DVD release following. The live-action films briefly played in certain North American theaters in 2008, before receiving home video releases. In 2015, the collected volumes of the ''Death Note'' manga had over 30 million copies in circulation.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Death Note characters}}

In Tokyo, an intelligent yet disaffected high-school student named [[Light Yagami]] finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. After verifying that the notebook works, Light sets out to create a utopian world without evil, killing numerous high-profile Japanese criminals, before eventually targeting international law-offenders around the world. Eventually, Light is visited by [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]], a Japanese god of death and the Death Note's previous owner, who dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom. Ryuk, who is invisible to anyone who has not touched the Death Note, is amused by Light's actions and serves as Light's companion.

As numerous criminals and convicts around the world begin to die of spontaneous heart attacks, the global media dub the mysterious figure responsible for the murders as "Kira", a Japanese trans-literation of the word "killer", who is both feared and beloved by the public and the law enforcement agencies. Hoping to apprehend Kira, [[Interpol]] requests the assistance of an enigmatic and highly-esteemed international consulting detective, known as [[L (Death Note)|L]], who has cracked numerous crime cases around the world, to assist them in the investigation. After deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L stages a TV broadcast in which he tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan, by manipulating him to kill a decoy.  Humiliated, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L quickly deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police's investigation, led by Light's father, [[List of Death Note characters#Soichiro Yagami|Soichiro Yagami]]. The FBI send a team of agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation, but Light outmaneuvers and kills them all. Nonetheless, L picks up enough hints to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the [[List of Death Note characters#Kira Investigation Team|Kira Task Force]], both trying to get the other to reveal crucial info.

At this point, a famous model/actress named [[Misa Amane]] gains a second Death Note from a Shinigami named [[List of Death Note characters#Rem|Rem]]. Misa makes a deal with Rem for Shinigami eyes, which allows her to kill knowing only the face at the cost of half her lifespan. Misa commits numerous murders, sends taped recordings to the police, and eventually uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira. Infatuated with Light, she demands Light be her boyfriend. Although he does not love Misa, Light agrees, intending to use Misa's Shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. However, before she can do so, L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem, who has feelings for Misa, threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally-driven individual, [[List of Death Note characters#Kyosuke Higuchi|Kyosuke Higuchi]] of the [[List of Death Note characters#Yotsuba Group|Yotsuba Group]]. Now with no knowledge of the Death Note, Light wholeheartedly joins the investigation. Together, Light and L deduce Higuchi's identity, arrest him, and discover the existence of the Death Notes and the Shinigami. When they touch the Death Note, Light and Misa regain their memories, and Light kills Higuchi with a piece of the Death Note, regaining possession of the book. However, L casts suspicion on Misa, forcing Rem to murder L to save her. Rem dies in the process, as it is forbidden for Shinigami to protect human individuals. The task force agrees to cover up L's death and appoint Light as the new L. The investigation stalls as a result.

Four years later, crime rates worldwide have massively dropped, but cults have arisen which adore Kira. Two intelligent young men, who were raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: [[Near (Death Note)|Near]] and [[Mello (Death Note)|Mello]]. Both are aware that L is dead, and thus consider Light, the current L, a prime suspect. Mello, along with the Mafia's assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death during the rescue mission. As suspicion starts to fall again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, [[List of Death Note characters#Teru Mikami|Teru Mikami]]. He also appoints a well-known newscaster, [[List of Death Note characters#Kiyomi Takada|Kiyomi Takada]] as Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello with a hidden page of the Death Note, but is killed by Light, in order to dispel suspicions. Shortly after, Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light seizes the chance to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members. However, Mikami's Death Note fails to work. It is revealed that Near had replaced Mikami's Death Note with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light as Kira. A scuffle breaks out during which Light is grievously wounded. Ryuk, realizing that Light will spend the rest of his life in prison, writes down Light's name in his Death Note as he had promised to do at the beginning of the story.

==Concepts==

===The notebooks===
The core [[plot device]] of the story is the "Death Note" itself, a black notebook with instructions (known as "Rules of the Death Note") written on the inside. When used correctly, it allows anyone to commit a murder, knowing only the victim's name and face. According to the director of the live-action films, [[Shusuke Kaneko]], "[t]he idea of spirits living in words is an ancient Japanese concept... In a way, it's a very Japanese story".&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death Note Manga Spawns Movie, Crime Wave |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2008/05/death_note |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=August 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809001934/http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2008/05/death_note |archivedate=August 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Takeshi Obata]] originally thought of the books as "Something you would automatically think was a Death Note". Deciding that this design would be cumbersome, he instead opted for a more accessible college notebook. Death Notes were originally conceived as changing based on time and location, resembling scrolls in ancient Japan, or the [[Old Testament]] in medieval Europe. However, this idea was never used.&lt;ref name="HowtoRead140"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ohba|first1=Tsugumi|last2=Obata|first2=Takeshi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=149|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
Writer [[Tsugumi Ohba]] had no particular themes in mind for ''Death Note''. When pushed, he suggested: "Humans will all eventually die and never come back to life, so let's give it our all while we're alive".&lt;ref name="HowtoRead69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=69|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "no human has the right to pass judgment on another's actions. No one should play God". He said that [[Near (Death Note)|Near]]'s climactic speech about good and evil was rooted in his own beliefs.

In a 2012 paper,&lt;ref name=JJRS_Thomas_2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Jolyon Baraka|title=Horrific "Cults" and Comic Religion|journal=[[Japanese Journal of Religious Studies]]|volume=39|issue=1|pages=127–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolyon Baraka Thomas characterised ''Death Note'' as heavily influenced by the conflicts between liberty and security; as illustrating that high moral ideals are easily corrupted, and that people will always justify horrific acts of violence in the name of safety. Thomas writes that "the price of peace is death".

Thomas' paper lists ''Death Note'' as one of the later and more sophisticated psychological thrillers released in the wake of the 1995 [[Tokyo subway sarin attack]], saying that it examines the human tendency to express itself through "horrific" cults and describes the negative effects of those cults on the members, on their families, and on society. Through the [[Moral relativism|moral relativity]] that characterizes the story throughout, readers are reminded that their own ideas of good and evil might not differ so much from those of extremist cult members.

==Production==
The ''Death Note'' concept derived from a rather general concept involving [[Shinigami]] and "specific rules".&lt;ref name="HowtoRead59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=59|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohba wanted to create a suspense series because he did not feel that he could have created a fight-style series and that the genre had few suspense series' available to the public. After publication of the pilot chapter, the series was not expected to be approved as a serialized comic by the author, who did not consider it to "fit with ''Jump''". Ohba said that, when he learned that ''Death Note'' had received approval and that Takeshi Obata would create the artwork, he "couldn't even believe it".&lt;ref name="HowtoRead174"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=173|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to positive reactions, ''Death Note'' became a serialized manga series.&lt;ref name="HowtoRead58"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=58|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Thumbnails" were created incorporating dialog, panel layout, and basic drawings, and were sent to the illustrator. The editor reviewed the thumbnails and sent them to the illustrator (Obata) with the script set in stone and the panel layout "mostly done". Obata then determined the expressions and "camera angles" and created the final artwork. Ohba concentrated on the tempo and the amount of dialogue, making sure that the text was as concise as possible. Ohba commented that he believed "reading too much exposition" would be tiring and would negatively affect the atmosphere and "air of suspense". Significant artistic license was given to the illustrator who worked on basic descriptions, such as "abandoned building",&lt;ref name="HowtoRead180"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=180|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this extended to the design of the Death Notes with Obata given a free rein.

When Ohba decided on the plot he internally visualized the panels while on his bed, drinking tea, or walking around his house, needing to feel relaxed while visualizing the panels. On many occasions, the original draft was too long and needed to be refined various times before the desired "tempo" and "flow" for the chapter was finalized. The writer remarked on his preference for reading the previous "two or four" chapters carefully to ensure consistency in the story.&lt;ref name="HowtoRead59"/&gt;

The typical weekly production schedule consisted of five days of creating and thinking and one-day using a pencil to insert dialogue into rough drafts; after this point, the writer faxed any initial drafts to the editor. The illustrator's weekly production schedule involved one day with the thumbnails, layout, and pencils and one day with additional penciling and inking. Obata's assistants usually worked for four days and Obata spent one day to finish it. Obata said that sometimes he took a few extra days to color pages and that this "messed with the schedule". In contrast, the writer took three or four days to create a chapter on some occasions, while on others he took a month. Obata said that his schedule remained consistent except when he had to create color pages.&lt;ref name="HowtoRead192"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=192|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohba and Obata rarely met in person during the creation of the serialized manga; instead, the two met with the editor. The first time they met in person was at an editorial party in January 2004. Obata said that, despite the intrigue, he did not ask his editor about Ohba's plot developments as he anticipated the new thumbnails every week.&lt;ref name=" HowtoRead174"/&gt; The two did not discuss the final chapters with one another and they continued to talk with the editor. Ohba said that when he asked the editor if Obata had "said anything" about the story and plot the editor responded: "No, nothing".&lt;ref name=" HowtoRead180"/&gt;

Ohba claims that the series ended more or less in the manner that he intended for it to end; he considered the idea of [[L (Death Note)|L]] defeating Light Yagami with Light dying, but instead chose to use the "Yellow Box Warehouse" ending. According to Ohba, the details had been set "from the beginning".&lt;ref name="HowtoRead58"/&gt; The writer wanted an ongoing plot line instead of an episodic series because ''Death Note'' was serialized and its focus was intended to be on a cast with a series of events triggered by the Death Note.&lt;ref name="HowtoRead60"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|pages=60–61|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''13: How to Read'' states that the humorous aspects of ''Death Note'' originated from Ohba's "enjoyment of humorous stories".&lt;ref name="HowtoRead194"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=194|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ohba was asked, during an interview, whether the series was meant to be about enjoying the plot twists and psychological warfare, Ohba responded by saying that this concept was the reason why he was "very happy" to place the story in ''Weekly Shōnen Jump''.&lt;ref name="HowtoRead192"/&gt;

===Pilot chapter===
The ''Death Note'' process began when Ohba brought thumbnails for two concept ideas to [[Shueisha]]; Ohba said that the ''Death Note'' pilot, one of the concepts, was "received well" by editors and attained positive reactions by readers.&lt;ref name=" HowtoRead58"/&gt; Ohba described keeping the story of the pilot to one chapter as "very difficult" and he said that he remembered it took over a month to begin writing the chapter. He added that the story had to revive the killed characters with the Death Eraser and that he "didn't really care" for that plot device.&lt;ref name="HowtoRead215"/&gt;

Obata said that he wanted to draw the story after he heard of a "horror story featuring Shinigami".&lt;ref name=" HowtoRead174"/&gt; According to Obata, when he first received the rough draft created by Ohba, he "didn't really get it" at first and he wanted to work on the project due to the presence of Shinigami and because the work "was dark".&lt;ref name="HowtoRead215"/&gt; He also said he wondered about the progression of the plot as he read the thumbnails, and if ''Jump'' readers would enjoy reading the comic. Obata said that while there is little action and the main character "doesn't really drive the plot", he enjoyed the atmosphere of the story. He stated that he drew the pilot chapter so that it would appeal to himself.&lt;ref name="HowtoRead215"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note 13: How to Read|year=2008|page=215|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=1-4215-1888-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohba brought the rough draft of the pilot chapter to the editorial department. Obata came into the picture at a later point to create the artwork. They did not meet in person while creating the pilot chapter. Ohba said that the editor told him he did not need to meet with Obata to discuss the pilot; Ohba said "I think it worked out all right".&lt;ref name="HowtoRead174"/&gt;

===Anime adaptation===
[[Tetsurō Araki]], the director, said that he wished to convey aspects that "made the series interesting" instead of simply "focusing on morals or the concept of justice". Toshiki Inoue, the series organizer, agreed with Araki and added that, in anime adaptations, there is a lot of importance in highlighting the aspects that are "interesting in the original". He concluded that Light's presence was "the most compelling" aspect; therefore the adaptation chronicles Light's "thoughts and actions as much as possible". Inoue noted that to best incorporate the manga's plot into the anime, he "tweak[ed] the chronology a bit" and incorporated flashbacks that appear after the openings of the episodes; he said this revealed the desired tensions. Araki said that, because in an anime the viewer cannot "turn back pages" in the manner that a manga reader can, the anime staff ensured that the show clarified details. Inoue added that the staff did not want to get involved with every single detail, so the staff selected elements to emphasize. Due to the complexity of the original manga, he described the process as "definitely delicate and a great challenge". Inoue admitted that he placed more instructions and notes in the script than usual. Araki added that because of the importance of otherwise trivial details, this commentary became crucial to the development of the series.&lt;ref name="Passionsdreams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimlinger|first=Carl|date=November 2007|title=Passion and dreams|journal=[[Newtype USA]]|volume=6|issue=11|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Araki said that when he discovered the ''Death Note'' anime project, he "literally begged" to join the production team; when he joined he insisted that Inoue should write the scripts. Inoue added that, because he enjoyed reading the manga, he wished to use his effort.&lt;ref name="Passionsdreams"/&gt;

==Media==

===Manga===
{{Main|List of Death Note chapters}}

Douglas Wolk of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' said that a rumor circulated stating that the creators intended to create ''Death Note'' to last half as long as its actual run and Ohba and Obata had been persuaded to lengthen the storyline when ''Death Note'''s popularity increased, noting that the rumor "makes sense, since about halfway through the series, there's a point that seems like a natural ending". In addition, he said that fans wrote "thousands" of ''Death Note'' [[fan fiction]] stories and posted them on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death strip|url=http://www.salon.com/2007/07/26/death_note/|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|date=July 26, 2007|website=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|accessdate=August 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924184827/http://www.salon.com/2007/07/26/death_note/#|archive-date=2015-09-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Japanese fans pointed out the similarities between ''Death Note'' and the 1973 one-shot {{nihongo|"The Miraculous Notebook"|不思議な手帖}} by [[Shigeru Mizuki]]. Comipress reported that the only difference between the story and ''Death Note'' is that there are no Shinigamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Origin of Death Note?|url=http://comipress.com/article/2007/01/08/1287|publisher=Comipress.com|date=January 8, 2007|accessdate=August 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605001232/http://comipress.com/article/2007/01/08/1287#|archive-date=2011-06-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anime News Network]] (ANN) writer Zac Bertschy called ''Death Note'' a "surprisingly gripping and original suspense tale that raises a handful of interesting questions about morality". He noted that the difference between the series and other manga from the same demographic was very big due to the murders the main character commits as well as how he hides his identity of Kira. Although Bertschy mentioned some [[shōnen manga|''shōnen'' manga]] readers will be surprised with the dark themes of ''Death Note'', he praised the series for its "great art, great story, [and] compelling characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note-gn-1|title=Death Note GN 1|last=Bertschy|first=Zac|date=September 29, 2005|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=June 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607111516/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note-gn-1#|archive-date=2009-06-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Rosato from Mania Entertainment found the story to be very entertaining, having liked Light's development in the story and L's introduction as well as how the latter starts suspecting the former's identity. Additionally, she praised the story as it is "building a climax" with each detail introduced in the first chapter, making the reader look forward to upcoming chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/death-note-vol-02_article_82348.html |title=Death Note Vol. #02 |last=Rosato |first=Julie |date=November 3, 2005 |publisher=Mania Entertainment |accessdate=June 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130074517/http://www.mania.com/death-note-vol-02_article_82348.html |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Briana Lawrence from ANN stated that what makes ''Death Note'' so interesting is that there is no villain, "instead it had two opposing sides that both believe in the same thing: justice". She felt that while the series' second half was not as good, with Light seeming less intelligent and once vital characters fading into the background, the ending brings back what the fans loved about the first volume and the supporting cast are "given a chance to shine". However, she did not like how the epilogue made no mention of what happens with [[Misa Amane]] and how Near and Mello was still treated like parts of L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12|title=Death Note GN 12|last=Lawrence|first=Briana|date=August 5, 2007|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=June 8, 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QpQyOi5j?url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12#|archive-date=2014-07-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised Teru Mikami's role as bloody and flashy as ever better than that of Near, Mello, and Misa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note-relight/dvd-2|title=Death Note Relight 2|last=Chapman|first=Jacob Hope|date=January 30, 2010|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=November 29, 2014|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QpQge9Dd?url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note-relight/dvd-2#|archive-date=2014-07-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jolyon Baraka Thomas, in a ''[[Japanese Journal of Religious Studies]]'' article, describes the manga as having a "somber narrative" with a "dark cast".

==Legacy==
The series' release outside Japan was met with a wave of [[copycat crime]]s. According to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, ''Death Note'' "[turned] Japan's most-popular print medium into an internationally controversial topic that has parents wondering whether they should prohibit their kids from reading manga entirely".

Early in 2005, school officials in [[Shenyang]], the capital of [[Liaoning]] (People's Republic of China), banned ''Death Note''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/school/2005-01/11/content_2446984.htm|title=Chinese city bans Death Note|date=January 11, 2005|publisher=Xihuanet|accessdate=September 4, 2008|language=Chinese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225062441/http://news.xinhuanet.com/school/2005-01/11/content_2446984.htm#|archive-date=2008-12-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate cause was that students had been altering notebooks to resemble Death Notes and then writing the names of acquaintances, enemies, and teachers in the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-02-06/death-note-stirs-controversy-in-china|title=Death Note Stirs Controversy in China|date=February 6, 2005|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=August 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915215555/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-02-06/death-note-stirs-controversy-in-china#|archive-date=2008-09-15|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comipress.com/article/2007/03/26/1711|title=Death Note in China – Success or Disaster?|date=March 26, 2007|publisher=ComiPress|accessdate=August 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121073011/http://comipress.com/article/2007/03/26/1711#|archive-date=2010-11-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was designed to protect the "physical and mental health"&lt;ref name="BeijingBan1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSPEK30969020070515|title=Beijing bans scary stories to protect young|date=May 15, 2007|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=May 15, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517044716/http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSPEK30969020070515#|archive-date=2007-05-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of students from horror material that "misleads innocent children and distorts their mind and spirit".&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-05/26/content_880773.htm|title='Death Note' days numbered|last=Weifeng|first=Liu|date=May 26, 2007|publisher=[[China Daily]]|accessdate=May 27, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528072653/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-05/26/content_880773.htm#|archive-date=2007-05-28|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Clements]] has suggested that the Chinese authorities acted partly against "superstition", but also against illegal, pirate publishers of ''Death Note''.&lt;ref name="ClementsNeo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|date=August 2007|title=Manga Pulse|publisher=[[Neo (magazine)|NEO Magazine]]|issue=35|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban has been extended to other Chinese cities including Beijing,&lt;ref name="BeijingBan2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-05/15/content_6103672.htm|title=Beijing publisher to ignore Beijing's ban of its horror story|last=Jie|first=Xiao|date=May 15, 2007|publisher=Xinhuanet|accessdate=August 27, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707025308/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-05/15/content_6103672.htm#|archive-date=2008-07-07|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2007/05/15/death-note-banned-in-beijing-2 |title=Death Note banned in Beijing |last=MacDonald |first=Heidi |date=May 15, 2007 |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=August 28, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shanghai and [[Lanzhou]] in [[Gansu]] Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comipress.com/news/2007/06/05/2067|title=Chinese Students Fight Back at Death Note Ban|date=June 5, 2007|publisher=ComiPress|accessdate=June 15, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214171837/http://comipress.com/news/2007/06/05/2067#|archive-date=2010-12-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally published Chinese-language versions of ''Death Note'' are published in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="ClementsNeo"/&gt; On June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed ''Death Note'' among 38 anime and manga titles banned in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2015/06/12/china-bans-38-japanese-anime-manga-titles-including-attack-titan |title=China bans 38 anime &amp; manga titles incuding ''Attack on Titan'' |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=2015-06-12 |accessdate=2018-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831174910/https://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2015/06/12/china-bans-38-japanese-anime-manga-titles-including-attack-titan# |archive-date=2018-08-31 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17541">'''Drug education''' is the planned provision of information, resources, and skills relevant to living in a world where [[drugs|psychoactive substances]] are widely available and commonly used for a variety of both medical and non-medical purposes, some of which may lead to harms such as [[drug overdose|overdose]], [[injury]], infectious [[disease]] (such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]]), or [[substance dependence|addiction]].

==Benefits==
Planning includes developing strategies for helping children and young people engage with relevant drug-related issues during opportunistic and brief contacts with them as well as during more structured sessions.  Drug education enables children, youth and adults to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes to appreciate the benefits of living healthily (which may or may not include the use of psychoactive substances), promote responsibility towards the use of drugs and relate these to their own actions and those of others, both now and in their future lives. It also provides opportunities for people to reflect on their own and others' attitudes to various psychoactive substances, their use and the people who use them.

==Drug education campaigns &amp; programs==
Drug education can be given in numerous forms, some more effective than others. Examples include [[advertising]] and awareness raising campaigns such as the UK Government’s [[FRANK (drugs)|FRANK]] campaign or the US "media campaign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediacampaign.org/ Media campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there are school based drug education programs like [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]] or that currently being evaluated by the UK Blueprint Programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/young-people/blueprint Blueprint], ''Home office.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; In efforts to prevent problematic substance use, drug education may perpetuate myths and stereotypes about psychoactive substances and people who use them.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Drugs, discourses and education: A critical discourse analysis of a high school drug education text|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|pages=223–238|doi=10.1080/01596300801966864}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug education can also take less explicit forms; an example of this is the Positive Futures Programme, funded by the UK government as part of its drug strategy. This programme uses [[sport]] and the [[arts]] as catalysts to engage young people on their own turf, putting them in contact with positive role models (coaches/trained youth workers). After building a trusting relationship with a young person, these role models can gradually change attitudes towards drug use and steer the young person back into education, [[training]] and [[employment]]. This approach reaches young people who have dropped out of mainstream education. It also has additional benefits for the community in reduced [[crime]] and [[anti-social behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/publication-search/young-people/0607_YPSMPG11 Positive Futures Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==School-based drug education ==
School-based drug education began with the anti-alcohol "[[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] education" programmes of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in the United States and Canada in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Jerome|title=100 years of 'just say no' versus 'just say know': Reevaluating drug education goals for the coming century|journal=Evaluation Review|year=1998|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15–45|doi=10.1177/0193841x9802200102}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In many respects, the WCTU's [[progressive education]] agenda set the template for much of what has been done since in the name of drug education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health|year=2013|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Past research into drug education has indicated that to be effective it must involve engaging, interactive learning strategies that stimulate higher-order thinking, promote learning and be transferable to real life circumstances. Current challenges from this approach exist in adopting evidence-based school drug education programmes.&lt;ref name=Cahil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cahil|first=H. W.|title=Challenges in adopting evidence-based school drug education programmes|journal=Drug &amp; Alcohol Review|year=2007|volume=26|issue=6|pages=673–679|doi=10.1080/09595230701613593}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in the majority of countries where preventive drug education programs and courses exist, they are established and funded by the Government. These education programs aim to educate adolescents about [[Recreational drug use|illicit drug use]] in an effort to prevent illegal drug use while highlighting the dangers of [[substance abuse|problematic substance use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Midford|first=R|title=Is Australia ‘fair dinkum’ about drug education in schools?|journal=Drug &amp; Alcohol Review|year=2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=421–427|doi=10.1080/09595230701373842}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Government]] has implemented a range of drug education programs through the [[National Drug Education Strategy (NDES)]] by providing schools with effective drug education programmes. The program aims  to manage drug related issues and incidents within schools .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Schools Drug Education Strategy 2009|url=http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|work=Northern Territory Government|publisher=Department of Education and Children Services|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421035758/http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2015 the [http://www.health.gov.au/ Australian Government Department of Health] launched the [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] portal as part of its response to the findings from the National Ice Taskforce report.&lt;ref&gt;Grass roots a key to tackling ice https://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2015-nash053.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister of Australia, JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, SYDNEY https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-12-06/joint-doorstop-interview-sydney&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] is an online portal that facilitates access to interactive evidence-based drug education resources and prevention programs for school communities. [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] builds on existing drug education resources developed by researchers at the [https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/ National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC)] such as the [https://www.climateschools.com.au/ Climate Schools programs] that have been proven to reduce alcohol and drug related harms and increase student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Champion|title=A cross-validation trial of an Internet-based prevention program for alcohol and cannabis: Preliminary results from a cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Aust NZ J Psychiatry|date=2015|volume=50|pages=64–73|doi=10.1177/0004867415577435|url=http://anp.sagepub.com/content/50/1/64|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Internet-based prevention for alcohol and cannabis use: final results of the Climate Schools course|journal=Addiction|date=2010|volume=105|issue=4|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x/full|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x|pages=749–759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Delivering prevention for alcohol and cannabis using the internet: A cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Preventive Medicine|date=2009|volume=48|issue=6|pages=579–584|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|accessdate=2 February 2016|ref=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Department of Health and Aging]] identified that analgesics (90%), alcohol (80-90%) and tobacco (30-60%) were the most widely utilised substances among adolescents. In addition to this, cannabis was another commonly used illicit substance that accounted for 33% usage among adolescents aged 14–17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=B|title=School drug education in New South Wales: Moral panic and the individualisation youth drug use|journal=Social Alternatives|year=2005|volume=24|issue=4|pages=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to government funded programs, a number of not-for-profit organisations (such as [[Life Education Australia]] also provide drug education programs to adolescents. These preventative programs aim to deliver a progressive approach that will motivate and encourage young people to make positive decisions in life. Emphasis within these programs is also placed in focusing on deterring [[peer pressure]] as a means of empowering adolescents and promoting autonomy. This approach reaches 750,000 primary and secondary students in Australia each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joyce|first=R|author2=O’Connor, L.|title=Life Education: Research and Evaluation.|journal=Life Education|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== D.A.R.E, Drug Abuse Resistance Education ==
D.A.R.E stands for Drug Abuse Resistance Education. In the United States, D.A.R.E is implemented in elementary school classrooms, 5th grade to educate students on drugs effects and temptations they may encounter. The program implemented in public and private school systems to prepare 5th graders for middle school, as well as all further education.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although D.A.R.E is implemented to prevent students from doing drugs in the future, there is little evidence to suggest it actually prevents students from doing drugs. In the article, “Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education” by Dukes and Stein, a [[chi-squared test]] was performed to see if there was a significant difference between high school students that received D.A.R.E training and those who did not receive D.A.R.E and its relation to drug use. The study found that there is no significant difference between the drug use of students that received D.A.R.E and students that did not. One of the main reasons the authors mentioned D.A.R.E had little correlation with Drug use is that there are other external causes that only affect some students, which can lead them into the direction of drug use. Additionally, the time that students received D.A.R.E (5th grade), and the time that the students encounter drugs may be many years after, so students may have little remembrance of the program. However, the United States schools continue to implement the program in classrooms because the police officers that come into classrooms can serve as community role models to students, and all students are different so it may steer them away from drugs in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Steroid use in high schools ==
Steroid use is a common form of drug use in high schools across the United States. Many students, specifically males, use steroids to increase their performance in athletic events. Many professional athletes, for example professional cyclist, Lance Armstrong, and former professional MLB player, Alex Rodriguez both were nationally recognized as steroid users. Additionally in an article in the ''Journal of Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology,'' it states that in a survey of  212 Canadian national track athletes, over 10% of them would take an illegal drug if it was undetectable, if it could help them win an Olympic gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anawalt|first=Bradley D.|date=March 2018|title=Detection of Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use by Elite Athletes and by Members of the General Public|url=|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology|volume=464|pages=21-27|via=EBSCOhost, doi:10.1016/j.mce.2017.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many adolescents idolize athletes, so when they find out there is a way to enhance their performance, and that elite athletes are using them, steroids may be used by students. 

An article in the ''Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse'' ran a study on two southern California high schools in middle class suburbs, and the high school students use of Anabolic Androgenic Steroids. It surveyed students on if they use steroids, knew the side effects of steroids, and additionally their use of other prevalent drugs. The article specifically found that male students that were athletes were more likely to use steroids than students that are female or non- athlete students in general. Most students that participated in steroids played the sports, football or soccer, and were most likely to do steroids if they participated in both sports. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorang|first=Melissa|date=September 2011|title=Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use in Teens: Prevalence, Demographics, and Perception of Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse|volume=20|pages=358–369|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Professional sports, influence young athletes, and when pro- athletes participate in drugs, it can lead young adults to use drugs without realizing the side effects and consequences that come along with drug use.

Also, a study in the ''journal of Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy'' discusses alcohol and drug prevention programs in Australia for students in grades 8 and 9. It goes into detail about the student's between 13 and 15 years old, to see if alcohol and drug prevention programs have an actual effect on preventing substance abuse. The study comes to conclusion that when the students went through a drug and alcohol prevention program, they were less likely to develop a drug or alcohol problem. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Midford|first=Richard|last2=et al.|date=April 2012|title=Alcohol Prevention: What Can Be Expected of a Harm Reduction? Focused School Drug Education Program?|url=|journal=Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy|volume=19, no. 2|pages=102-110|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and Drug Education ==
The University of North Carolina Greensboro has researched the drug prevention program, All Stars, Sr.,. The program is developing education through technology (videos), so that health education programs could reach schools in rural communities. The technology programs would provide drug/ health education in general with qualified instructors, in areas that do not have programs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyrick|first=David L|last2=et. al|date=July 2010|title=Going the Distance: Delivery of High School Drug Prevention via Distance Education|url=|journal=American Journal of Distance Education|volume=24.3|pages=151-162|via=EBSCOhost,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation ==
Recent studies have identified that a gap between the theory of education programmes and the implementation exists.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; This is regards to the collaborative learning approach and difficulties with teachers adopting these interactive drug education programmes. The practical implications of these findings are that professional training and support are required to increase the effectiveness of teaching staff, and the uniform implementation of drug curriculum.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; Additional drug education research in the future should acknowledge the complexities of implementing these programmes in a school environment. Furthermore, additional support for teachers, counselors, school administrators and other education professionals should be integrated as a means of being realistic about what constitutes effective drug education and maintaining a high quality standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Teaching teachers to just say 'know': Reflections on drug education|journal=Teaching and Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=24|issue=2|pages=356–367|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2007.08.007}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eight Immortals from [[Sichuan]]''' ({{zh|c=蜀中八仙|p=Shǔ zhōng bāxiān}}) are eight Sichuanese who supposedly became ''[[Xian (Daoist)| xian]]'' ("immortals; transcendents; fairies"). The term is first used by [[Qiao Xiu]] (譙秀 qiáo xiù) in ''Record of [[Shu (kingdom)|Shu]]'' (《蜀紀》 shǔ zì) written in [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]].

They are:

'''''Electronic Book Review''''' (''ebr'') is a peer-reviewed scholarly journal with emphasis on the digital. Founded in 1995 by [[Joseph Tabbi]] and Mark Amerika, the journal was one of the first to devote a lasting web presence to the discussion of literature, theory, criticism, and the arts. 

==Overview==
Since its inception, ''ebr'' has highlighted works characterized by innovation, resistance to genre, and creative use of emerging (electronic and web-specific) media. In 1996, ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' referred to the journal as "a new mecca for cutting-edge fiction and criticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spillman|first1=Rob|title=Bibliofiles: Web crawling for bookworms|journal=Details|date=December 1996|issue=December 1996|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially managed in DIY fashion by contributing writers and programmers, by 1997 Anne Burdick joined the staff as design director, later bringing on Ewan Branda for the redesign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Hunter|first1 = Allison|url = http://www.allisonhunter.com/art/howarticle.html|website = How Magazine|publisher = How Magazine|accessdate = 10 September 2015|title = Weaving the Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''Deep Sites: Intelligent Innovation in Contemporary Web Design'', Max Bruinsma characterizes ''ebr'' as "an interesting web of critical debates on electronic textuality, cyberculture, and the value of digital design literacy for scholarship and critical writing on the web."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruinsma|first1=Max|title=Deep Sites: Intelligent Innovation in Contemporary Web Design|date=2003|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=New York|isbn=9780500283844|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its emphasis on the materiality of text extended to early experiments with form on the site itself, including "glosses," in which comments by a guest curator appear embedded in existing articles, and the "weave" function, which allowed for fluid rearrangement of content "like a virtual loom that weaves different patterns each time you choose a different perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruinsma|first1=Max|title=Deep Sites: Intelligent Innovation in Contemporary Web Design|date=2003|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=New York|isbn=9780500283844|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and Collaboration==
In conjunction with a trilogy of essay collections from MIT Press, ''ebr'' published a thread reproducing a portion of the essays while also expanding, critiquing, and responding to the print content. The "First Person" thread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Person|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson|website=Electronic Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; exists as an accompaniment to the collections ''First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game'', ''Second Person: Role-Playing and Story in Games and Playable Media'', and ''Third Person: Authoring and Exploring Vast Narratives'' by Pat Harrigan and Noah Wardrip-Fruin.

      <comment>I have changed "Lacón gallego" to simply "lacón". Someone might have wanted to promote Gallician products or was simply confused, maybe by the proximity of both regions. The "fabada" is made with "lacón", from Asturias or from whatever other place in Spain. Simply "lacón".</comment>

'''Fabada asturiana''', often simply known as '''fabada''', is a rich [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] [[bean]] [[stew]], originally from and most commonly found in the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Principality of Asturias]], but widely available throughout the whole of Spain and in Spanish restaurants worldwide. [[Canning|Canned]] fabada is sold in most supermarkets across the country.

Fabada is a hot and heavy dish and for that reason is most commonly eaten during winter and at the largest meal of the day, lunch. It is usually served as a starter, but may also be the main course of the meal. It is typically served with Asturian [[cider]] or a [[red wine]].

==Ingredients==
Fabada is made with dried large [[Common bean#White beans|white beans]] (''[[fabes de la Granja]]'', soaked overnight before use), [[pork|shoulder of pork]] (''lacón'') or [[bacon]] (''[[tocino]]''), [[black pudding]] (''morcilla''), [[chorizo]], and often [[saffron]] (''azafrán'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spain.info/TourSpain/Gastronomia/Productos%20y%20Recetas/Recetas/C/0/Fabada.htm?Language=en{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acocinar.com/fabada.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081110123153/http://www.acocinar.com/fabada.htm |archivedate=2008-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recipes also call for [[longaniza]].

==Variations==
The Spanish [[olla podrida]] and southern [[French cuisine|French]] [[cassoulet]] are both similar to fabada asturiana.

'''Fictional resistance movements and groups''' commonly appear in [[dystopian fiction]], opposing the [[tyranny]] which dominates the setting.

==In literature==
In Chuck Palahniuk's ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'', the tyranny is the soul-destroying life of modern western society.  The protagonist rebels against this by organising atavistic [[Bare-knuckle boxing|bare-knuckle]] fights and then by leading ''Project Mayhem'' to destroy civilization.  This story developed themes of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and anti-consumerism seen in earlier works such as ''[[Rebel without a Cause]]'' and ''[[The Prisoner]]'' with the epic, [[millenarianism|millennial]] quality of other contemporary works such as ''[[The Matrix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=God's Unwanted: ''Fight Club'' and the Myth of "Total Revolution" |publisher=Baylor University Press |year=2007 |title=Escape Into the Future: Cultural Pessimism and Its Religious Dimension in Contemporary American Popular Culture |author=John M.

A cart is visible down the street, and one man appears to be carrying a large leg of meat.|19th-century ''Grub Street'' (latterly Milton Street), as pictured in ''[[Chambers Book of Days]]'']]

Until the early 19th century, '''Grub Street''' was a street close to [[London]]'s impoverished [[Moorfields]] district that ran from [[Fore Street, London|Fore Street]] east of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]] north to [[Chiswell Street]]. Famous for its concentration of impoverished "[[hack writer]]s", aspiring poets, and low-end publishers and booksellers, Grub Street existed on the margins of London's journalistic and literary scene. It was pierced along its length with narrow entrances to alleys and courts, many of which retained the names of early signboards. Its [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] society was set amidst the impoverished neighbourhood's low-rent [[Flophouse|dosshouse]]s, brothels and coffeehouses.

According to [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'', the term was "originally the name of a street... much inhabited by writers of small histories, dictionaries, and temporary poems, whence any mean production is called grubstreet". Johnson himself had lived and worked on Grub Street early in his career.  The contemporary image of Grub Street was popularised by [[Alexander Pope]] in his ''[[Dunciad]]''.

The street was later renamed '''Milton Street''', which was partly swallowed up by the [[Barbican Estate]] development, but still survives in part. The street name no longer exists, but Grub Street has since become a pejorative term for impoverished hack writers and writings of low literary value.

==Toponymy==
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the [[verb]] grub translates as "To dig superficially; to break up the surface of (the ground); to clear (ground) of roots and stumps."  The earliest use of the word is in 1300, "Theif hus brecand, or gruband grund", and in 1572 "Ze suld your ground grube with simplicitie".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{Citation | title = grub (v) | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50099520?query_type=word&amp;queryword=grub+street&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;single=1&amp;sort_type=alpha | publisher = dictionary.oed.com | format = Registration required | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grub Street appears to have taken its name from a refuse ditch that ran alongside (grub), and variations on the name include Grobstrat (1217&amp;ndash;1243), Grobbestrate (1277&amp;ndash;1278), Grubbestrate (1281), Grubbestrete (1298), Grubbelane (1336), Grubstrete, and Crobbestrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harbenp241"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogersp24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1980|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grub is also a derogatory [[noun]] applied to 'a person of mean abilities, a literary hack; in recent use, a person of slovenly attire and unpleasant manners.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = grub (n) | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50099518?query_type=word&amp;queryword=grubby&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;single=1&amp;sort_type=alpha | publisher = dictionary.oed.com | format = Registration required | accessdate = 2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Grub street hermit.gif|right|thumb|upright|alt=A man sits on a large ornate chair, resting his left elbow on a desk, his clenched fist supporting his head. In his right hand, at his waist, he holds a walking cane. He wears a cloak and a long beard, and his slippered feet rest on a chequered or tiled floor.  On the desk lies an open book.  Above his head the wall contains a shelf, filled with books.  A picture hangs from the wall showing a country scene with a large mansion or castle|Henry Welby, engraving after [[William Marshall (illustrator)|William Marshall]].]]
Grub Street was in [[Cripplegate]] ward, in the parish of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]] (Cripplegate ward was bisected by the city walls, and therefore was both 'within' and 'without').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Denton|1883|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harben|1918|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the area was originally extensive marshlands from the [[River Fleet|Fleet Ditch]], to Bishopsgate, contiguous with Moorfields to the east.&lt;ref name="Rogerspp2324"/&gt;  The [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]] Churchwardens' Accounts of 1267 mention a stream running from the nearby marsh, through Grub Street, and under the city walls into the [[Walbrook|Walbrook river]], which may have provided the local population with drinking water,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Denton|1883|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the marshes were drained in 1527.&lt;ref name="Brewery"/&gt;

One of Grub Street's early residents was the notable recluse [[Henry Welby]], the owner of the estate of [[Goxhill]] in [[Lincolnshire]].  In 1592 his half-brother attempted to shoot him with a pistol.  Shocked, he took a house on Grub Street and remained there, in near-total seclusion, for the rest of his life.  He died in 1636 and was buried at [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate|St Giles]] in Cripplegate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Souden | first = David | last2 = Harrison | first2 = B. | title = Welby, Henry (d. 1636) | publisher = oxforddnb.com | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28978 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/28978 | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[virginalist]] [[Giles Farnaby]] also lived in Grub Street from 1634 until his death in 1640.

At the time, its path was partly within [[Cripplegate]] [[Wards of the United Kingdom|Ward]], but outside the city walls of the [[City of London]]. The surviving Milton Street is now entirely within the City of London.]]
[[File:Sweedons passage grub street.jpg|left|thumb|A late 18th-century illustration of a property on Sweedon's Passage, Grub Street]]
An early use of the land surrounding Grub Street was [[archery]].  In ''Records of St. Giles' Cripplegate'' (1883), the author describes an order made by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] to convert Finsbury Fields from gardens, to fields for archery practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Denton|1883|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; however in [[Elizabethan]] times archery became unfashionable, and Grub Street is described as largely deserted, "except for low gambling houses and bowling-alleys&amp;mdash;or, as we should call them, skittle-grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Denton|1883|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Stow]] also referred to Grubstreete in ''A Survey of London Volume II'' (1603) as "It was convenient for bowyers, since it lay near the Archery-butts in Finsbury Fields", and in 1651 the poet [[Thomas Randolph (poet)|Thomas Randoph]] wrote "Her eyes are Cupid's Grub-Street: the blind archer, Makes his love-arrows there."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stow|1908|pp=356&amp;ndash;374}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The little London directory of 1677'' lists six merchants living in 'Grubſreet', and [[Costermonger]]s also plied their trade—a Mr Horton, who died in September 1773, earned a fortune of £2,000 by hiring wheelbarrows out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anon|1863|pp=33, 85, 109, 120, 126, 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dentonp174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Denton|1883|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Land was cheap and occupied mostly by the poor, and the area was renowned for the presence of [[Fever|Ague]] and the [[Black Death]]; in the 1660s the [[Great Plague of London]] killed nearly eight thousand of the parish's inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Rogerspp2324"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1980|pp=23&amp;ndash;24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of St Giles in 1801 has been estimated at about 25,000&amp;nbsp;people, but by the end of the 19th century this was dropping steadily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1980|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 18th century [[Cripplegate]] was well known as an area haunted by insalubrious folk,&lt;ref name="Rogerspp2324"/&gt; and by the mid-19th century crime was rife.  Methods of dealing with criminals were severe&amp;mdash;thieves and murderers were "left dangling in their chains on Moorfields."&lt;ref name="Rogersp26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1980|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of [[gibbet]]s was common, and four 'cages' were maintained by the parish, for use as a [[Lying-in]] hospital, housing the poor, and 'idle imposters'.  One such cage stood amidst the poor quality housing stock of Grub Street;&lt;ref name="Rogersp26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Denton|1883|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; destitution was viewed as a crime against society, and was punishable by whipping, and also by having a hole cut in the gristle of the right ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Denton|1883|pp=87&amp;ndash;88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well before the influx of writers in the 18th century, Grub street was therefore in an economically deprived area.&lt;ref name="Rogersp24"/&gt; John Garfield's ''Wandring Whore issue V'' (1660) lists several 'Crafty Bawds' operating from the Three Sugar-Loaves, and also mentions a Mrs Wroth as a 'common whore'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garfield|1660|p=13, p.&amp;nbsp;15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early literature===
The earliest literary reference to Grub Street appears in 1630, by the [[English people|English]] [[poet]], [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]].  "When strait I might descry, The Quintescence of Grubstreet, well distild Through Cripplegate in a contagious Map".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Grub-street | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50099538?query_type=misspelling&amp;queryword=grube&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;single=1&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;control_no=null | publisher = dictionary.oed.com | format = Registration required | accessdate = 2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The local population &lt;!-- of St. Giles --&gt;was known for its nonconformist views; its [[Presbyterian]] preacher [[Samuel Annesley]] had been replaced in 1662 by an [[Anglican]].  Famous 16th-century [[Puritan]]s included [[John Foxe]], who may have authored his [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]] in the area,&lt;ref name="Dentonp174"/&gt; the historian [[John Speed]], the [[Protestant]] printer and poet [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]].  The [[Protestant]] [[John Milton]] also lived near Grub Street.&lt;ref name="Achinsteinp116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Achinstein|2003|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press freedom===
In 1403 the City of London Corporation approved the formation of a Guild of [[stationer]]s.  Stationers were either [[bookseller]]s, [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]], or [[bookbinding|bookbinders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Patterson | first = Lyman Ray | authorlink = Lyman Ray Patterson | year = 1968 | title = [[Copyright in Historical Perspective]] | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Printing]] gradually displaced manuscript production, and by the time that the Guild received a royal charter of incorporation on 4 May 1557, becoming the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], it was in effect a Printers' Guild.  In 1559, it became the 47th [[Livery Company|livery company]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Stationers' Company had considerable powers of search and seizure, backed by the state (which supplied the force and authority to guarantee copyright).  This monopoly continued until 1641 when, inflamed by the treatment of religious dissenters such as [[John Lilburne]] and [[William Prynne]], the [[Long Parliament]] abolished the [[Star Chamber]] (a court which controlled the press) with the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]].  This led to the de facto cessation of state censorship of the press.  Although in 1641 token punishments were given to those responsible for unlicensed and hostile pamphlets published around London&amp;mdash;including Grub Street&amp;mdash;[[Puritan]] and radical pamphlets continued to be distributed by an informal network of street hawkers, and dissenters from within the Stationers' Company.&lt;ref name="Achinsteinp116"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Knight|1998|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendle|1995|pp=31&amp;ndash;34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tabloid journalism&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' places the earliest use of the word 'Journalist' in 1693 &amp;mdash; Humours Town 78 Epistle-Writer, or Jurnalists, Mercurists.&lt;/ref&gt; became rife; the unstable political climate resulted in the publication from Grub Street of anti-[[Charles I of England|Caroline]] literature, along with blatant lies and anti-Catholic stories regarding the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]; stories that were advantageous to the parliamentary leadership.  Following the King's failed attempt to arrest several members of the Commons, Grub Street printer [[Bernard Alsop]] became personally involved in the publication of false pamphlets, including a fake letter from the Queen that resulted in [[John Bond (jurist)|John Bond]] being [[Pillory|pilloried]].  Alsop and colleague [[Thomas Fawcett]] were sent to [[Fleet Prison]] for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendle|1995|pp=38&amp;ndash;39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[English Civil War]] therefore, publishers and writers remained answerable to the law.  State control of the press was tightened in the [[Licensing Order of 1643]], but although the new regime was arguably as restrictive as the monopoly that the Stationers' Company once enjoyed, parliament was unable to control the number of renegade presses that flourished during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mendle|1995|pp=40&amp;ndash;42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The freedoms ensured by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] led indirectly to the refusal in 1695 of the [[Parliament of England]] to renew the [[Licensing of the Press Act 1662]], a law which required all printing presses to be licensed by Parliament.  This lapse led to a freer press, and a rise in the volume of printed matter.  [[Jonathan Swift]] wrote to a friend in [[New York (state)|New York]], "I could send you a great deal of news from the ''Republica Grubstreetaria'', which was never in greater altitude."&lt;ref name="Bonomipp104105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bonomi|2000|pp=104&amp;ndash;105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hacks===
[[File:Distressed poet gutenberg.jpg|thumb|right|alt=In a small scruffy garret, with a fireplace at the back of the room, a man sits at a desk underneath a roof window, quill in his hand, writing on a sheet of paper.  A woman sits in the centre of the room, repairing clothes.  Some of these clothes are on the floor, and a cat is sleeping on the pile they form.  Underneath the pile, partially concealed, is a copy of a journal.  The woman is looking at another woman who has entered the room to the left, who holds a list of items.  At her feet, a dog is stealing a piece of food from a plate on a chair.|A copy of ''[[Grub Street Journal|The Grub Street Journal]]'' lies at the writer's feet, in [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[The Distrest Poet]]''.

The fruits of the Grub Street publishers were read and debated in houses like this.&lt;ref name="Clarkepp79"/&gt;]]
Publishing houses proliferated in Grub Street, and this, combined with the number of local [[Attic|garrets]], meant that the area was an ideal home for hack writers.  In ''The Preface'', when describing the harsh conditions a writer suffered, [[Tom Brown (satirist)|Tom Brown]]'s &lt;!-- (1663&amp;ndash;1704) --&gt; self-parody referred to being "Block'd up in a Garret".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dawson|2005|pp=15&amp;ndash;16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such contemporary views of the writer, in his inexpensive [[Ivory Tower]] high above the noise of the city, were immortalised by [[William Hogarth]] in his 1736 illustration [[The Distrest Poet]].  The street name became a synonym for a hack writer; in a literary context, 'hack' is derived from Hackney&amp;mdash;a person whose services may be for hire, especially a literary drudge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = hack | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50101116?query_type=word&amp;queryword=hack&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=pcII-ki3vq4-2347&amp;result_place=2 | publisher = dictionary.oed.com | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this framework, hack was popularised by authors such as [[Andrew Marvell]],&lt;ref name="Timbsp385"/&gt; [[Oliver Goldsmith]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''The poems and plays of Oliver Goldsmith''&amp;nbsp;(1818)&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;71&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wolcot]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''The works of Peter Pindar''&amp;nbsp;(1812)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anthony Trollope]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Belton estate''&amp;nbsp;(1866)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ned Ward]]'s late 17th-century description reinforces a common view of Grub Street authors, as little more than prostitutes:

One such author was [[Samuel Boyse]].  Contemporary accounts picture him as a dishonest and disreputable rogue, paid for each individual line of prose as a [[Jack of all trades, master of none]].  He apparently lived in squalor, often drunk, and on one occasion after pawning his shirt, he fashioned a replacement out of paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be a called a 'Grub Street author' was therefore often viewed as an insult,&lt;ref name="Timbsp385"&gt;{{Harvnb|Timbs|1868|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Grub Street hack [[James Ralph]] defended the trade of the journalist, contrasting it with the supposed hypocrisy of more esteemed professions:

===Periodicals===
In response to the newly increased demand for reading matter in the [[Augustan literature|Augustan period]], Grub Street became a popular source of [[Periodical publication|periodical]] literature.  One publication to take advantage of the reduction of state control&lt;!-- abolition of the Star Chamber --&gt; was ''A Perfect Diurnall'' (despite its title, a weekly publication).  However it quickly found its name copied by unscrupulous Grub Street publishers, so obviously that the newspaper was forced to issue a warning to its readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toward the end of the 17th century authors such as [[John Dunton]] worked on a range of periodicals, including ''Pegasus'' (1696), and ''The Night Walker: or, Evening Rambles in search after lewd Women'' (1696&amp;ndash;1697).  Dunton pioneered the [[advice column]] in ''Athenian Mercury'' (1690&amp;ndash;1697).  The satirical writer and publican [[Ned Ward]] published ''The London Spy'' (1698&amp;ndash;1700) in monthly instalments, for over a year and a half.  It was conceived as a guide to the sights of the city, but as a periodical also contained details on taverns, coffee-houses, tobacco shops, and [[bagnio]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Troyer|1968|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other publications included the [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] ''[[John Tutchin#The Observator|Observator]]'' (1702&amp;ndash;1712), and the [[Tory]] ''Rehearsal'' (1704&amp;ndash;1709), both superseded by [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''Weekly Review'' (1704&amp;ndash;1713), and Jonathan Swift's ''Examiner'' (1710&amp;ndash;1714).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|pp=45&amp;ndash;46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  English newspapers were often politically sponsored, and Grub Street was host to several such publications; between 1731 and 1741 [[Robert Walpole]]'s ministry was reported to have spent about £50,077 (about £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|50077|1741}}|0}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} nationally of [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] funds on bribes to such newspapers.  Allegiances changed often, with some authors changing their political stance on receipt of bribes from secret service funds.&lt;ref name="Clarkepp5860"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|pp=58&amp;ndash;60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such changes helped maintain the level of disdain with which the establishment viewed journalists and their trade, an attitude often reinforced by the abuse publications would print about their rivals.  Titles such as ''Common Sense'', ''Daily Post'', and the ''Jacobite's Journal'' (1747&amp;ndash;1748) were often guilty of this practice, and in May 1756 an anonymous author described journalists as "dastardly mongrel insects, scribbling incendiaries, starveling savages, human shaped tygers, senseless yelping curs..."&lt;ref name="Clarkepp79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|pp=7&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In describing his profession, [[Samuel Johnson]], a Grub Street man himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forster|1863|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; said "A news-writer is a man without virtue who writes lies at home for his own profit.  To these compositions is required neither genius nor knowledge, neither industry nor sprightliness, but contempt of shame and indifference to truth are absolutely necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Idler | publisher = ''Payne's Universal Chronicle | date = 1758-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The Province, or rather the States, of Grub-street, like those of Switzerland, never enter into any alliance offensive and defensive with any one contending power, against another; but wisely keep themselves in an exact neutrality.  At the same time, their private members are ready to engage on either side for good pay, without ever inquiring into the merits of the cause.|''Grub Street Journal'' (1731)|&lt;ref name="Clarkepp5860"/&gt;}}

===Taxation===
In 1711 [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] gave royal assent to the [[Stamp Act 1712|1712 Stamp Act]], which imposed new taxes on newspapers.  The Queen addressed the House of Commons: "Her majesty finds it necessary to observe, how great license is taken in publishing false and scandalous libels, such as are a reproach to any Government.  This evil seems to be grown too strong for the laws now in force.  It is therefore recommended to you to find a remedy equal to the mischief."&lt;ref name="Ingelhartp76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ingelhart|1987|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The passage of the Act was partly an attempt to silence Whig pamphleteers and dissenters, who had been critical of [[Tories (political faction)#1688–1714|the then Tory]] government.  Every copy of a news-carrying publication printed on a half-sheet of paper became liable to a duty of a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], and if printed on a full sheet, a [[Penny (British decimal coin)|penny]].  A duty of a [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] was placed on advertisements.  Pamphlets were charged a flate rate of two shillings per sheet for each edition, and were obliged to include the name and address of the printer.&lt;ref name="Clarkepp4849"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|pp=48&amp;ndash;49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of the Act caused protests from publishers and authors alike, including Daniel Defoe, and Jonathan Swift, who in support of the Whig press wrote:

{{Quote|Do you know that Grub Street is dead and gone last week?  No more ghosts or murders now for love or money.  I plied it pretty close the last fortnight and published at least seven penny papers of my own, besides some of other people's; but now every single half sheet pays a half penny to the queen.  The ''Observator'' is fallen; the ''Medlays'' we jumbled together with the ''Flying Post'', the ''Examiner'' is deadly sick; the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'' keeps up and doubles its price; I know not how long it will hold.  Have you seen the red stamp the papers are marked with?  Methinks the stamping it is worth a half penny.|Jonathan Swift (1712)|&lt;ref name="Ingelhartp76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Timbs|1868|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stone columns are visible behind her.|[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]]]
Although the Act had the unfortunate side-effect of closing down several newspapers, publishers used a weakness in the legislation which meant that newspapers of six pages (a half-sheet ''and'' a whole sheet) were only charged at the flat pamphlet rate of two shillings per sheet (regardless of the number of copies printed).  Many publications thus expanded to six pages, filled the extra space with extraneous matter, and raised their prices to absorb the tax.  Newspapers also used the extra space to introduce serials, hoping to hook readers into buying the next instalment.  The periodical nature of the Newspaper allowed writers to develop their arguments over successive weeks, and the newspaper began to overtake the pamphlet as the primary medium for political news and comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|pp=49&amp;ndash;50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1720s 'Grub Street' had grown from a simple street name to a term for all manner of low-level publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keeble|Wheeler|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The popularity of [[Nathaniel Mist]]'s ''Weekly Journal'' gave rise to a plethora of new publications, including the ''Universal Spectator'' (1728), the [[Anglican]] ''Weekly Miscellany'' (1732), the ''Old Whig'' (1735), ''Common Sense'' (1737), and the ''Westminster Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such publications could be strident in their criticism of government ministers&amp;mdash;''Common Sense'' in 1737 compared Walpole to the infamous outlaw [[Dick Turpin]]:

{{Quote|Must not a Foreigner laugh to hear the whole Nation exclaiming every Day in the publick News Papers [sic] against the Depredations of one pitiful Fellow, one of very mean Rank and Qualifications, every Way contemptible? &amp;mdash; What must they think of a Nation who quietly permits such a Wretch as this to carry on a successful Series of impudent Robberies, which every one knows, every one exclaims against, and yet every one submits to.|''Common Sense'' (1737)|&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response, a 1737 edition of the ''Craftsman'' proposed a tax on urine, and ten years later the ''Westminster Journal'', in a critique of proposed new taxes on food, servants, and malt, proposed a tax on human excrement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all publications were based entirely on politics however. The ''[[Grub Street Journal]]'' was better known in literary circles for its combative nature, and has been compared to the modern-day ''[[Private Eye]]''. Despite its name, it was printed on nearby Warwick Lane. It began in 1730 as a literary journal and became known for its bellicose writings on individual authors.  It is considered by some to have been a vehicle for Alexander Pope's attacks on his enemies in Grub Street, but although he contributed to early issues the full extent of his involvement is unknown.  Once his interest in the publication waned ''The Journal'' began to generalise, satirising medicine, theology, theatre, justice, and other social issues.  It often contained contradictory accounts of events reported by the previous week's newspapers, its writers inserting sarcastic remarks on the inaccuracies printed by their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|pp=62&amp;ndash;63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It ran until 1737 when it became the ''Literary Courier of Grub-street'', which lingered for a further six months before vanishing altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hillhouse|1972|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Entick.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Grub Street printer John Entick's successful [[Entick v Carrington|legal battle]] against the executive power of the state was an influential factor in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].]]
Newspapers and their authors were not yet completely free from state control.  In 1763 [[John Wilkes]] was charged with [[seditious libel]] for his attacks on a speech by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], in issue 45 &lt;!-- (synonymous with the [[Jacobite uprising of 1745]])? --&gt;of ''[[The North Briton]]''.  The King felt personally insulted and [[Writ of assistance|general warrants]] were issued for the arrest of Wilkes and the newspaper's publishers.  He was arrested, convicted of libel, fined, and imprisoned.  During their search for Wilkes, the king's messengers had visited the home of a Grub Street printer named [[John Entick]].  Entick had printed several copies of ''The North Briton'', but not number 45.  The messengers spent four hours searching his home, and eventually carried away more than two hundred unrelated charts and pamphlets.  Wilkes had filed for damages against the [[Under Secretary of State]] Robert Woods and won his case, and two years later Entick [[Entick v Carrington|pursued]] the chief messenger Nicholas Carrington in similar fashion&amp;mdash;and was awarded £2,000 in compensation.  Carrington appealed, but was ultimately unsuccessful; Chief Justice [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Camden]] upheld the verdict with a landmark judgement that established the limits of executive power in English law, that an officer of the state could only act lawfully in a manner prescribed by statute or [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Knight|1998|pp=120&amp;ndash;123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lynch | first = Jack | title = Wilkes, Liberty, and Number 45 | url = http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/summer03/wilkes.cfm | publisher = history.org | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judgement also formed part of the background to the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Constitution of the United States: Browse, 2002 Edition &amp; Supplements | work = Fourth Amendment--Search and Seizure | url = http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/browse2002.html#2002 | publisher = gpoaccess.gov | pages = 3&amp;ndash;4 | format = PDF | year = 2002 | accessdate = 2009-07-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090806204245/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/browse2002.html#2002 | archivedate = 6 August 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infighting===
[[File:The Gentleman's Magazine, May 1759.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A front cover of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', which started in 1731.  The first of its kind, it was started by [[Edward Cave]] from his office at St John's Gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Denton|1883|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1716 the [[bookseller]] and [[publisher]] [[Edmund Curll]] acquired a manuscript that belonged to [[Alexander Pope]].  Curll advertised the work as part of a forthcoming volume of poetry, and was soon contacted by Pope who warned him not to publish the poems.  Curll ignored him and published Pope's work under the title ''Court Poems''.  A meeting between the two was arranged, at which Pope poisoned Curll with an [[emetic]].  Several days later he also published two pamphlets describing the meeting, and proclaimed Curll's death.  Pope hoped that the combination of the poisoning and the wit of his writing would change the public view of Curll from a victim, to a deserving villain.  Meanwhile, Curll responded by publishing material critical of Pope and his religion.  The incident, meant to secure Pope's status as an elevated figure amongst his peers, created a lifelong and bitter rivalry between the two men, but may have been beneficial to both; Pope as the man of letters under constant attack from the hacks of Grub Street, and Curll using the incident to increase the profits from his business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = MacKenzie | first = Raymond N. | last2 = Harrison | first2 = B. | title = Curll, Edmumd (d. 1747) | format= Registration required | publisher = oxforddnb.com | date = January 2008 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6948 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/6948 | accessdate = 2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope later immortalised Grub Street in his 1728 poem ''[[The Dunciad]]'', a satire of "the Grub-street Race" of commercial writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fulford | first = Robert | title = When hacks attract: Serious artists are drawn to tales of mercenary scribes | publisher = ''The National Post'' | date = 2003-08-19 | url = http://www.robertfulford.com/2003-08-19-hacks.html | accessdate = 2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such infighting was not unusual, but a particularly notable episode occurred from 1752&amp;ndash;1753, when [[Henry Fielding]] started a [[Paper War of 1752–1753|"paper war"]] against hack writers on Grub Street.  Fielding had worked in Grub Street during the late 1730s.  His career as a dramatist was curtailed by the [[Licensing Act 1737|Theatrical Licensing Act]] (provoked by Fielding's anti-Walpole satire such as ''[[Tom Thumb]]'' and ''[[Covent Garden Tragedy]]'') and he turned to law, supporting his income with normal Grub Street work.  He also launched ''The Champion'', and over the following years edited several newspapers, including from 1752&amp;ndash;1754 ''[[The Covent-Garden Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Uglow|1998|pp=3&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "war" spanned many of London's publications, and resulted in countless essays, poems, and even a series of mock epic poems starting with [[Christopher Smart]]'s ''[[The Hilliad]]'' (a pun on Pope's ''Dunciad'').  Although it is not clear what started the dispute, it resulted in a divide of authors who either supported Fielding or Hill, and few in between.&lt;!-- referenced in the paper war article --&gt;

The avariciousness of the Grub Street press was often demonstrated in the manner in which they treated notable, or notorious public figures.  [[John Church (clergyman)|John Church]], an independent minister born in 1780, raised the ire of the local hacks when he admitted he had acted 'imprudently' following allegations he had sodomised young men in his congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clement | first = Mark | last2 = Harrison | first2 = B. | title = Church, John (b. 1780) | publisher = oxforddnb.com | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58284 | year = 2004 | format = Registration required | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/58284}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Satire was a popular pastime&amp;mdash;the [[Mary Toft]] affair of 1726, concerning a woman who fooled some of the medical establishment into believing she had given birth to rabbits&amp;mdash;produced a notable dirge of diaries, letters, satiric poems, ballads, false confessions, cartoons, and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Todd|1995|pp=1&amp;ndash;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later history===
Grub Street was renamed as Milton Street in 1830, apparently in memory of a tradesman who owned the building lease of the street.&lt;ref name="Harbenp241"&gt;{{Harvnb|Harben|1918|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the middle of the 19th century it had lost some of its negative connotations; authors were by that time viewed in the same light as traditionally more esteemed professions,&lt;ref name="Timbsp385"/&gt; although 'Grub Street' remained a metaphor for the commercial production of printed matter, regardless of whether such matter actually originated from Grub Street itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Writer [[George Augustus Henry Sala]] said that during his years as a Grub Street 'hack', "most of us were about the idlest young dogs that squandered away their time on the pavements of Paris or London. We would not work. I declare in all candour that... the average number of hours per week which I devoted to literary production did not exceed four."&lt;ref&gt; (Cross, 94)[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255-s01/boheme/london.html Bohemian London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Literary Encyclopedia''.http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1664&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Silk_Street_junction_with_Milton_Street_view_southeast_01.jpg|thumb|The junction of Silk Street and Milton Street (left)]]
Although the street no longer exists in name (and modern construction has changed much of the area), the name continues to exist in modern use.&lt;ref&gt;cf. for instance, Brooks, David. ''The Road to Character'', NY, 2015, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the area was destroyed by enemy bombing in [[World War II]], and has since been replaced by the [[Barbican Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Barbican Centre &amp;mdash; Concept and Design | url = http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Housing/Private_housing/Barbican_history/ | publisher = cityoflondon.gov.uk | accessdate = 2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Milton Street still exists. The area was heavily damaged during [[World War II]], and most of Milton Street was itself swallowed up by the [[Barbican Estate]] development after the war. A short section survives between Silk Street and Chiswell Street, and borders the City of London's Brewery Conservation Area.&lt;ref name="Brewery"&gt;{{Citation | title = Brewery Conservation Area Character Study | url = http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/FFC808DD-1CEE-4814-BCEB-06E5977F1C8F/0/DP_PL_BreweryCA.pdf | format = PDF | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
As Grub Street became a metaphor for the commercial production of printed matter, it gradually found use in early 18th-century [[United States|America]].  Early publications such as handwritten ditties and squibs were circulated among the [[gentry]] and taverns and coffee-houses.  As in England, many were directed at politicians of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bonomi|2000|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Grub Street Productions," a partnership of American TV producers [[David Angell]], [[Peter Casey (screenwriter)|Peter Casey]] and [[David Lee (screenwriter)|David Lee]], produced the [[Sitcom|situation comedies]] ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]'' and ''[[Frasier]]''.

'''''Hammerfall''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American science fiction and fantasy author {{nowrap|[[C. J. Cherryh]]}}. It was first published in June 2001 in the United States by [[HarperCollins]] under its [[HarperCollins#Imprints|Eos Books]] imprint.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; It was also serialized in two parts as ''Ribelle Genetico'' and ''Il Pianeta del Deserto'' in the Italian science fiction magazine, ''[[Urania (magazine)|Urania]]'', published in issue 1425 in October 2001, and issue 1430 in January 2002, respectively.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

''Hammerfall'' is the first of two novels set in Cherryh's [[The Gene Wars universe|Gene Wars universe]], and concerns [[Genetic engineering|gene manipulation]] using [[nanotechnology]], and contact with an alien race, the ''ondat''. The second novel, ''[[Forge of Heaven]]'' was published in June 2004.

''Hammerfall'' was nominated for the [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel]] in 2002, and was a third-place runner-up.&lt;ref name=WWE-2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

==Plot summary==
''Hammerfall'' takes place on an unspecified planet,{{refn|In the sequel, ''[[Forge of Heaven]]'', Cherryh calls the planet "Marak's World", and provides a detailed [[backstory]] of the events leading to the human landings on the planet, their encounters with the ''ondat'', and the Gene Wars.{{sfn|Cherryh|2004|p=4}}|group="nb"}} where the Ila, believed to be a god and immortal, rules the Lakht, a huge desert, and all its villages from the holy city of Oburan. Some of the villagers, including Marak, an abjorian fighter of the Kais Tain tribe, are afflicted with a "madness" that manifests itself in the form of voices and visions, and are outcast from their communities. The Ila, however, is interested in the "mad" and orders that they be rounded up and brought across the desert to Oburan.

The Ila singles out Marak, because he and his father had launched an unsuccessful rebellion against her. She queries Marak on the nature of these visions and voices, and, intimidated by her holiness, he tells her they appear to come from the east where there is a silver tower he is drawn to. She instructs Marak to lead the other mad east across the desert to find the source of the madness, and promises that if he returns with the answer, she will make him ruler of Kais Tain. After several weeks in the harsh desert, the visions and voices draw Marak and the others to the silver tower where they meet Luz, who appears to be a deity like the Ila.

Luz explains to Marak that the "mad" have tiny "creatures" in their blood that makes them see and hear things. These are "makers", or nanoceles that they have infected them with, and it is Luz who has been calling them east. She tells Marak that when the Ila first arrived on the planet over 500 years ago, she used her own makers to modify man and beast to survive in the desert, but this angered the ''ondat'', an alien species, because she had released makers on their world and damaged its ecology. The ''ondat'' feared her actions would rekindle the age-old Gene Wars, and want to rid the planet of all Ila's life. Luz's people negotiated with the ''ondat'' to give them time to undo the Ila's makers with their own more advanced nanoceles, and prevent the ''ondat'' from destroying the planet. Thirty years ago, Luz and her team landed and began releasing their own makers into villagers to draw them to her. The ''ondat'' agreed to hold off their destruction for thirty years, and to spare the area surrounding Luz's tower once it begins. Luz instructs Marak to return across the desert to Oburan and persuade the Ila and other survivors to come to Luz's Refuge where they will be safe. The thirty years is already up and Marak has to hurry because the ''ondat'' have already begun their bombardment of the Lakht with asteroids from space.

To stress the urgency of Marak's new mission, Luz feeds the "mad" with a new vision, that of the final ''ondat'' assault on the world, the hammerfall. Guided by Luz's voice, Marak manages to avoid the bombardment from space and reaches Oburan, only to finds it in ruins, and the Ila and other survivors camped nearby. Keeping to his promise, Marak tells her what he found, and about Luz and her makers. The Ila reveals that she knew about Luz, and while at odds with her, she agrees to return with Marak to her Refuge because she knows that the hammerfall is coming.

The return caravan with the Ila and other survivors barely makes it across the desert to the Refuge before the final hammer falls, destroying the Lakht. An uneasy truce is established between the Ila and Luz, the world's two "gods", and while the Ila insists that her makers will overcome Luz's, it is ''her'' makers that are overwhelmed by Luz's. The weather has changed—it is cold and often snows, but after several generations, Marak, whose makers have made him immortal, begins routine inspections of the transformed Lakht, and Luz prepares to release new creatures she has engineered.

==Reception==
A review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' praised ''Hammerfall'', calling it a "satisfying novel" that is a "blend of gorgeous, slightly knotty prose, deeply conflicted heroes, desperate action and nicely observed cultural details".&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly/&gt; Writing in the SF Reader, Elizabeth Kelley Buzbee described the book as a "world-class space opera" that explores "the low tech/high tech clash of cultures".&lt;ref name=Buzbee/&gt; But she was critical of Cherryh's portrayal of the two major characters, Marak and the Ila, who she felt come across as being the perfect hero and villain. Buzbee said that neither of them appear to experience any internal conflict: one never doubts Makak's sanity, and the Ila is simply too opaque to understand.&lt;ref name=Buzbee/&gt;

A reviewer in [[Kirkus Reviews]] called ''Hammerfall'' "[v]ery disappointing", complaining that it has "no recognizable plot" and is a "threadbare scenario that's little more than elaborate stage-setting for the series to come".&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt; In the [[Science Fiction Weekly]], science fiction writer and literary critic [[John Clute]] said the novel is "a most extraordinary text [that] is told with all the intensity of an epic", but found it "exhausti[ng]".&lt;ref name=Clute/&gt; He described the storyline, the endless treks back and forth across the desert, as "Idiot-Plot circumbendibus", adding that it "walks in its own bitter water".&lt;ref name=Clute/&gt; 

A [[New England Science Fiction Association]] reviewer, Elisabeth Carey said that ''Hammerfall'' reads like a fantasy because it is written from Marak's perspective, a non-technological nomad, who probably interprets the technology he witnesses as magic.&lt;ref name=Carey/&gt; She found the book "interesting and mostly enjoyable", but added that it might be enjoyed more by fans of Cherryh's fantasy than her science fiction. Carey was, however, critical of Luz's characterization, complaining that she is "difficult and obscure", and that some of Marak's wrong decisions are because she is so obscure.&lt;ref name=Carey/&gt; Carey wrote: "This is dangerously close to being an idiot plot, a plot in which critical events would not happen, if otherwise intelligent characters did not behave like idiots".&lt;ref name=Carey/&gt;

[[File:Kerinci MSS detail.jpg|thumb|[[Rencong alphabet]], native writing systems found in Malay Peninsula, central and [[South Sumatra]]. The text reads (Voorhoeve's spelling): "haku manangis ma / njaru ka'u ka'u di / saru tijada da / tang [hitu hadik sa]", which is translated by Voorhoeve as: "I am weeping, calling you; though called, you do not come" (hitu adik sa- is the rest of 4th line.]]
'''[[Malay language|Malay]]''' is a major language of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family. Over a period of two [[Millennium|millennia]], from a form that probably consisted of only 157 original words,{{Clarify|reason=this seems to be saying that Malay at some point had only 157 words (however words are counted); maybe attested or reconstructed words are meant?|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noriah|1999|pp=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malay has undergone various stages of development that derived from different layers of foreign influences through international trade, religious expansion, [[colonisation]] and developments of new socio-political trends. The oldest form of Malay is descended from the [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language]] spoken by the earliest [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] settlers in Southeast Asia. This form would later evolved into Old Malay when Indian cultures and religions began penetrating the region. Old Malay contained some terms that exist today, but are unintelligible to modern speakers, while the modern language is already largely recognisable in written Classical Malay of 1303 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeuw|1959|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malay evolved extensively into Classical Malay through the gradual influx of numerous Arabic and Persian vocabulary, when Islam made its way to the region. Initially, Classical Malay was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the Malay kingdoms of Southeast Asia. One of these dialects that was developed in the literary tradition of [[Melaka Sultanate|Melaka]] in the 15th century, eventually became predominant. The strong influence of Melaka in international trade in the region resulted in Malay as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in commerce and diplomacy, a status that it maintained throughout the age of the succeeding Malay sultanates, the European colonial era and the modern times. From 19th to 20th century, Malay evolved progressively through a significant grammatical improvements and lexical enrichment into a modern language with more than 800,000 phrases in various disciplines.

==Ancient Malay==
Ancient Malay, or Proto-Malay, is the language believed to have existed in prehistoric times, spoken by the early Austronesian settlers in the region. Its ancestor, the [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language]] that derived from [[Proto-Austronesian]], began to break up by at least 2000 BCE as a result possibly by the southward expansion of [[Austronesian people]]s into the [[Philippines]], [[Borneo]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Sulawesi]] from the island of [[Taiwan]]. Proto-Malay language was spoken in Borneo at least by 1000 BCE and was, it has been argued, the ancestral language of all subsequent [[Malay languages|Malay dialects]]. Linguists generally agree that the homeland of the [[Malayic languages|Malayic]]-[[Dayak language|Dayak]] languages is in Borneo, based on its geographic spread in the interior, its variations that are not due to contact-induced change, and its sometimes conservative character.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|2001|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the first millennium, Malayic speakers had established settlements in the coastal regions of modern-day South Central [[Vietnam]], [[Tambelan]], [[Riau Islands]], [[Sumatra]], [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Luzon]], [[Maluku Islands]], [[Bangka-Belitung Islands]] and [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andaya|2001|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the common era saw the growing influence of Indian civilisation in the archipelago. With the penetration and proliferation of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] vocabulary and the influence of major [[Indian religions]], Ancient Malay evolved into the Old Malay language.&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt; The [[Dong Yen Chau inscription]], believed to be from the 4th century CE, was discovered in the northwest of Tra Kieu, near the old [[Champa]] capital of [[Indrapura (Champa)|Indrapura]], modern day [[Vietnam]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid|Amat Juhari|2006|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkib Negara Malaysia|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morrison|1975|pp=52–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is considered to be in the related [[Cham language|Old Cham language]] rather than Old Malay by experts such as Graham Thurgood. The oldest uncontroversial specimen of Old Malay is the 7th century CE [[Sojomerto inscription]] from [[Central Java]], [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]] from [[South Sumatra]] and several other inscriptions dating from the 7th to 10th centuries discovered in [[Sumatra]], [[Malay peninsula]], western [[Java]], other islands of the [[Sunda Islands|Sunda archipelago]], and [[Luzon]]. All these Old Malay inscriptions used either scripts of Indian origin such as [[Pallava script|Pallava]], [[Nagari]] or the Indian-influenced Old Sumatran characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/31/30 The Syair of Minye Tujuh]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Malay system is greatly influenced by [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] scriptures in terms of [[phonemes]], [[morpheme]]s, [[vocabulary]] and the characteristics of scholarship, particularly when the words are closely related to Indian culture such as ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'', ''[[kshatriya|kesatria]]'',  ''[[maharaja]]'' and ''[[raja]]'', as well as on the Hindu-Buddhist religion such as ''[[dveṣa|dosa]]'', ''[[phala|pahala]]'', ''[[naraka|neraka]]'', ''[[svarga|syurga]]''  or ''[[svarga|surga]]'' (used in Indonesia-which was based on Malay), ''puasa'', ''[[swami|sami]]'' and ''[[vihara|biara]]'', which lasts until today.

It is popularly claimed that the Old Malay of the [[Srivijaya]]n inscriptions from South Sumatra is the ancestor of the Classical Malay. However, as noted by some linguists, the  precise relationship between these two, whether ancestral or not, is problematical and remained uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the existence of a number of morphological and syntactic peculiarities, and affixes which are familiar from the related [[Batak languages|Batak]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] languages but are not found even in the oldest manuscripts of Classical Malay. It may be the case that the language of the Srivijayan inscriptions is a close cousin rather than an ancestor of Classical Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeuw|1959|pp=141–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, although the earliest evidence of Classical Malay had been found in the Malay peninsular from 1303, Old Malay remained in use as a written language in Sumatra right up to the end of the 14th century, evidenced from Bukit Gombak inscription dated 1357&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeuw|1959|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tanjung Tanah manuscript of [[Adityavarman]] era (1347–1375).

[[File:KlMuseumBatuBersurat.jpg|thumb|The [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]], written in year 1303.]]
The period of Classical Malay started when [[Islam]] gained its foothold in the region and the elevation of its status to a [[state religion]]. As a result of [[Islamisation]] and growth in trade with the [[Muslim world]], this era witnessed the penetration of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] vocabulary as well as the integration of major [[Islamic culture]]s with local Malay culture. Earliest instances of Arabic lexicons incorporated in the pre-classical Malay written in Kawi was found in the Minyetujoh inscription dated 1380 from [[Aceh]]. Pre-Classical Malay took on a more radical form as attested in the 1303 CE  [[Terengganu Inscription Stone]] and the 1468 CE Pengkalan Kempas Inscription from Malay peninsula. Both inscriptions not only serve as the evidence of Islam as a state religion, but also as the oldest surviving specimen of the dominant classical [[Orthography|orthographic]] form, the [[Jawi script]]. Similar inscriptions  containing various adopted Arabic terms with some of them still written the indianised scripts were also discovered in Sumatra and Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1998|pp=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abdul Rashid 2006 29"&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid|Amat Juhari|2006|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pre-Classical Malay evolved and reached its refined form during the golden age of the Malay empire of [[Melaka Sultanate|Melaka]] and its successor [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]] starting from the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|pp=74–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a bustling port city with a diverse population of 200,000 from different nations, the largest in Southeast Asia at that time, Melaka became a melting pot of different cultures and languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1998|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; More loan words from Arab, Persian, Tamil and Chinese were absorbed and the period witnessed the flowering of [[Malay literature]] as well as professional development in royal leadership and public administration. In contrast with Old Malay, the literary themes of Melaka had expanded beyond the decorative ''[[belles-lettres]]'' and [[theological]] works, evidenced with the inclusion of [[accountancy]], [[maritime law]]s, [[credit note]]s and [[trade]] [[license]]s in its literary tradition. Some prominent manuscripts of this category are ''[[Undang-Undang Melaka]]'' ('Laws of Melaka'), ''[[Undang-Undang Laut Melaka]]'' (Melakan Maritime Laws) and ''[[Hukum Kanun Pahang]]'' ('Laws of [[Pahang Sultanate|Pahang]]'). The literary tradition was further enriched with the translations of various foreign literary works such as ''[[Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah]]'' and ''[[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]'', and the emergence of new intellectual writings in [[philosophy]], [[tasawuf]], [[tafsir]], [[history]] and many others in Malay, represented by manuscripts like ''[[Sulalatus al-Salatin]]'' and ''Furu' Al-Masa'il''.&lt;ref name="Abdul Rashid 2006 29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1998|pp=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melaka's success as a centre of commerce, religion, and literary output has made it an important  point of [[Malayisation|cultural reference]] to the many influential Malay sultanates in the later centuries. This has resulted the growing importance of Classical Malay as the sole [[lingua franca]] of the region. Through inter-ethnic contact and trade, the Classical Malay spread beyond the traditional Malay speaking world&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in a trade language that was called ''Bahasa Melayu pasar'' ("Bazaar Malay") or ''Bahasa Melayu rendah'' ("Low Malay")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to ''Bahasa Melayu tinggi'' (High Malay) of Melaka-Johor. It is generally believed that [[Malay trade and creole languages|Bazaar Malay]] was a pidgin, perhaps influenced by contact between Malay, Chinese and non-Malay natives traders. The most important development, however, has been that pidgin Malay creolised, creating several new languages such as the [[Ambonese Malay#Ambonese Malay|Ambonese Malay]], [[Manado Malay]], [[Makassar Malay]] and [[Betawi language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from being the primary instrument in spreading Islam and commercial activities, Malay also became a court and literary language for kingdoms beyond its traditional [[Malay world|realm]] like [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]], [[Sultanate of Banjar|Banjar]] and  [[Ternate Sultanate|Ternate]] and also used in diplomatic communications with the European colonial powers. This is evidenced from diplomatic letters from Sultan Abu Hayat II of Ternate to King [[John III of Portugal]] dated from 1521 to 1522, a letter from Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah of Aceh to Captain [[Sir Henry Middleton]] of the [[East India Company]] dated 1602, and a golden letter from Sultan [[Iskandar Muda]] of Aceh to King [[James I]] of [[England]] dated 1615.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1998|pp=23–27, 44–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frontispiece of a Jawi edition of the Malay Annals.jpg|left|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of a copy of ''[[Sulalatus al-Salatin]]'']]

The early phase of European colonisation in Southeast Asia began with the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century and the Dutch in the 17th century. This period also marked the dawn of  [[Christianization]] in the region with its stronghold in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], [[Banda Islands|Banda]] and [[Kota, Jakarta|Batavia]]. In facilitating early missionary works, religious books and manuscripts began to be translated into Malay of which the earliest was initiated by a pious Dutch trader, Albert Ruyll in 1611. The book titled ''Sovrat A B C'' and written in Latin alphabet not only means in introducing Latin alphabet but also the basic tenets of [[Calvinism]] that includes the [[Ten Commandments]], the faith and some prayers. This work later followed by several [[Bible]]s translated into Malay; ''Injil Mateus dan Markus'' (1638), ''Lukas dan Johanes'' (1646), ''Injil dan Perbuatan'' (1651), ''Kitab Kejadian'' (1662), ''Perjanjian Baru'' (1668) and ''Mazmur'' (1689).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1998|p=55&amp;61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The era of Classical Malay also witnessed the growing interest among foreigners in learning the Malay language for the purpose of commerce, diplomatic missions and missionary activities. Therefore, many books in the form of word-list or dictionary were written. The oldest of these was a Chinese-Malay word list compiled by the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] officials of the [[Hanlin Academy#Bureau of Translators|Bureau of Translators]] during the heyday of Melaka Sultanate. The dictionary was known as ''Ma La Jia Guo Yi Yu'' (Words-list of Melaka Kingdom) and contains 482 entries categorised into 17 fields namely astronomy, geography, seasons and times, plants, birds and animals, houses and palaces, human behaviours and bodies, gold and jewelleries, social and history, colours, measurements and general words.&lt;ref name="Braginsky2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vladimir Braginsky|title=Classical Civilizations of South-East Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxwiAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA366&amp;lpg=PA366&amp;dq=Gempita+mist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DoA1Mpi5cM&amp;sig=2NAfnprwoKpdOT_rqA9oIYOWDPc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SH9rVMaUBYSjgwSWsYPYBQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Gempita%20mist&amp;f=false|date=18 March 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-84879-7|pages=366–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, E.

==Pre-Modern Malay (19th century)==
[[File:AbdullahbinAbdulKadir-HikayatAbdullah-1849.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A page of ''[[Hikayat Abdullah]]'' written in [[Jawi script]], from the collection of the [[National Library, Singapore|National Library of Singapore]]. A rare first edition, it was written between 1840 and 1843, printed by [[lithography]], and published in 1849.]]
19th century was the period of strong [[Western world|Western]] political and commercial domination in Southeast Asia. The [[Dutch East India Company]] had effectively colonised the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]], the [[British Empire]] held several colonies and protectorates in Malay peninsula, Sarawak and North Borneo, the French possessed part of [[Indo-China]], the Portuguese established  their outposts in [[Portuguese Timor|Timor]], while the Spaniards and later the Americans gained control over the [[Philippines]], where the Malay language did not thrive. The Dutch and British colonists, realising the importance in understanding the local languages and cultures particularly Malay, began establishing various centres of linguistic, literature and cultural studies in universities like [[Leiden University|Leiden]] and [[University of London|London]]. Thousands of Malay manuscripts as well as other historical artefacts of Malay culture were collected and studied.&lt;ref name="Abdul Rashid 2006 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid|Amat Juhari|2006|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[Latin script]] began to expand in the fields of administration and education whereby the influence of [[English literature|English]] and [[Dutch literature]]s and languages started to penetrate and spread gradually into the Malay language.

At the same time, the technological development in printing method that enabled mass production at low prices increased the activities of authorship for general reading in the Malay language, a development that would later shifted away Malay literature from its traditional position in Malay courts.&lt;ref name="Abdul Rashid 2006 32"/&gt; In addition, the report writing style of journalism began to bloom in the arena of Malay writing. A notable writer of this time was [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]] with his famous works ''[[Hikayat Abdullah]]'', ''[[Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan]]'' and ''[[Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Mekah]]''. Abdullah's authorship marks an early stage in the transition from the classical to modern literature, taking Malay literature out of its preoccupation with folk-stories and legends into accurate historical descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sneddon|2003|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other well known books were published such as two notable classical literary work, ''Sulalatus Salatin'' and ''Taj Al-Salatin''. There were other famous religious books of the era which were not only published locally but also in countries like Egypt and Turkey. Among the earliest examples of Malay newspapers are ''Soerat Kabar Bahasa Malaijoe'' of Surabaya published in 1856, ''Bintang Timor'' of Padang published in 1965 and ''Jawi Peranakan'' of Singapore published in 1876. There was even a Malay newspaper published in Sri Lanka in 1869, known as ''[[Alamat Langkapuri]]''. Earlier in 1821, the first Malay magazine was published in Melaka known as ''Bustan Arifin'' and in 1856, a Malay magazine titled ''Bintang Oetara'' was published in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="Abdul Rashid 2006 33"&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid|Amat Juhari|2006|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, the Malay language of Melaka-Johor was regarded as the standard language and became the medium of instruction in schools during colonial era. Starting from 1821, Malay-medium Schools were established by the British colonial government in Penang, Melaka and Singapore. These were followed by many others in Malay states of the peninsular. This development generated the writings of text books for schools, in addition to the publication of reference materials such as Malay dictionaries and grammar books. Apart from that, an important position was given towards the use of Malay in British administration, which requires every public servant in service to pass the special examination in Malay language as a condition for a confirmed post, as gazetted in ''Straits Government Gazette 1859''. In Indonesia, the Dutch colonial government recognised the Melaka-Johor Malay used in Riau as High Malay and promoted it as a medium of communication between the Dutch and local population. The language was also taught in schools not only in Riau, but also East Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan and East Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Abdul Rashid 2006 33"/&gt;

==Modern Malay (20th century)==
The flourishing of pre-modern Malay literature in 19th century led to the rise of intellectual movement among the locals and the emergence of new community of Malay linguists. The appreciation of language grew and various efforts were undertaken by the community to further enhance the usage of Malay as well as to improve its abilities in facing the challenging modern era. Among the efforts done was the planning of a [[text corpus|corpus]] for Malay language, first initiated by ''Pakatan Belajar-Mengajar Pengetahuan Bahasa'' (Society for the Learning and Teaching of Linguistic Knowledge), established in 1888. The society that was renamed in 1935  as ''Pakatan Bahasa Melayu dan Persuratan Buku Diraja Johor'' (The Johor Royal Society of Malay language and Literary works), involved actively in arranging and compiling the guidelines for spelling, dictionaries, grammars, punctuations, letters, essays, terminologies and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid|Amat Juhari|2006|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of [[Sultan Idris Training College]] (SITC) in [[Tanjung Malim]], [[Perak]] in 1922 intensified these efforts. In 1936, [[Zainal Abidin Ahmad (writer)|Za'ba]], an outstanding Malay scholar and lecturer of SITC, produced a Malay grammar book series entitled ''Pelita Bahasa'' that modernised the structure of the Classical Malay language and became the basis for the Malay language that is in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2008|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important change was in [[syntax]], from the classical passive form to the modern active form. In the  20th century, other improvements were also carried out by other associations, organisations, governmental institutions and congresses in various part of the region.

Writing has its unique place in the history of self-awareness and the nationalist struggle in Indonesia and Malaysia. Apart from being the main tools to spread knowledge and information, newspapers and journals like ''Al-Imam'' (1906), ''Panji Poestaka'' (1912), ''Lembaga Melayu'' (1914),  ''Warta Malaya'' (1931),  ''[[Poedjangga Baroe]]'' (1933) and ''[[Utusan Malaysia|Utusan Melayu]]'' (1939)  became the main thrust in championing and shaping the fight for [[nationalism]]. Writing, whether in the form of novels, short stories, or poems, all played distinct roles in galvanising the spirit of [[Indonesian National Awakening]] and [[Malay nationalism]].

During the first ''Kongres Pemuda'' of Indonesia held in 1926, in the ''[[Youth Pledge|Sumpah Pemuda]]'', Malay language was proclaimed as the unifying language for the nation of Indonesia. In 1945, the language which later renamed "[[Bahasa Indonesia]]" in 1928 became the [[national language]] as enshried in the constitution of an independent Indonesia. Later in 1957, Malay language was elevated to the status of national language for the independent [[Federation of Malaya]] (later reconstituted as [[Malaysia]] in 1963). Then in 1959, Malay language also received the status of national language in [[Brunei]], although it only ceased to become a British protectorate in 1984. When [[Singapore]] separated from Malaysia in 1965, Malay became the national language of the new republic and one of the four official languages. The emergence of these newly independent states paved the way for a broader and widespread use of Malay (or Indonesian) in government administration and education. Colleges and universities with Malay as their primary medium of instructions were introduced and bloomed as the prominent centres for researches and production of new intellectual writings in Malay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul Rashid|Amat Juhari|2006|p=34&amp;35}}&lt;/ref&gt; After East Timor independence, [[Indonesian language]] become one of the working languages.

The Indonesian language as the unifying language for Indonesia is relatively open to accommodate influences from other Indonesian ethnics' languages, most notably [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as the majority ethnic group in Indonesia, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as the previous coloniser, and [[English language|English]] as the international language. As a result, Indonesian has wider sources of loanwords, as compared to Malay used in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. It was suggested that the Indonesian language is an artificial language made official in 1928.&lt;ref name="Interesting Thing of The Day 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Interesting Thing of The Day|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; By artificial it means that Indonesian was designed by academics rather than evolving naturally as most common languages have, to accommodate the political purpose of establishing an official unifying language of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Interesting Thing of The Day 2004"/&gt; By borrowing heavily from numerous other languages it expresses a natural linguistic evolution; in fact, it is as natural as the next language, as demonstrated in its exceptional capacity for absorbing foreign vocabulary. This disparate evolution of Indonesian language led to a need for an institution that can facilitate co-ordination and co-operation in linguistic development among countries with Malay language as their national language. The first instance of linguistic co-operation was in 1959 between Malaya and Indonesia, and this was further strengthened in 1972 when MBIM (a short form for ''Majlis Bahasa Indonesia-Malaysia'' - Language Council of Indonesia-Malaysia) was formed. MBIM later grew into MABBIM (''[[Majlis Bahasa Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia]]'' - Language Council of Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia)  in 1985 with the inclusion of Brunei as a member and Singapore as a permanent observer. Other important institution is [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] established in 1956. It is a government body responsible for co-ordinating the use of the Malay language in Malaysia and Brunei.

The dominant orthographic form of Modern Malay language that based on Roman or [[Latin script]], the [[Malay alphabet]], was first developed in the early 20th century. As the Malay-speaking countries were divided between two colonial administrations (the Dutch and the British), two major different spelling orthographies were developed in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[British Malaya]] respectively, influenced by the orthographies of their respective colonial tongues. In 1901, [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System]] (1901–1947) became the standard orthography for Malay Language in Dutch East Indies. In the following year, the government of the [[Federated Malay States]] established an orthographic commission headed by Sir [[Richard James Wilkinson]] which later developed the "Wilkinson Spelling System" (1904–1933). These spelling systems would later succeeded by the [[Republican Spelling System]] (1947–1972) and the Za'ba Spelling System (1933–1942) respectively. During the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak|Japanese Occupation of Malaya]] and [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Indonesia]], there emerged a system which was supposed to uniformise the systems in the two countries. The system known as ''Fajar Asia'' (or 'the Dawn of Asia') appeared to use the Republican system of writing the vowels and the Malayan system of writing the consonants. This system only existed during the Occupation. In 1972, a declaration was made for a joint [[Orthography|spelling system]] in both nations, known as ''Ejaan Rumi Baharu'' ([[New Rumi Spelling]]) in Malaysia and ''Sistem Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan'' ([[Perfected Spelling System]]) in Indonesia. With the introduction of this new common spelling system, all administrative documents, teaching and learning materials and all forms of written communication is based on a relatively uniform spelling system and this helps in effective and efficient communication, particularly in national administration and education.

Despite the widespread and institutionalised use of [[Malay alphabet]], [[Jawi script]] remains as one of the two official scripts in [[Brunei]], and is used as an alternate script in [[Malaysia]]. Day-to-day usage of Jawi is maintained in more conservative Malay-populated areas such as [[Pattani]] in Thailand and [[Kelantan]] in Malaysia. The script is used for religious and Malay cultural administration in [[Terengganu]], [[Kelantan]], [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]] and [[Johor]]. The influence of the script is still present in [[Sulu]] and [[Marawi]] in the Philippines while in Indonesia, Jawi script is still widely used in Riau and Riau Island province, where road signs and government buildings signs are written in this script.

The '''International VELUX Award''' challenges students of architecture to explore the theme of sunlight and daylight. The award is biennial and was first presented in 2004.

The award celebrates excellence in completed works on any scale from a small scale component to large urban contexts or abstract concepts and experimentation. The award is presented by [[VELUX]] in close cooperation with the [[International Union of Architects]] (UIA) and the European Association for Architectural Education (EAAE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaae.be/eaae2/index.php European Association for Architectural Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417013813/http://www.eaae.be/eaae2/index.php |date=2008-04-17 }} Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
“Light of Tomorrow” is the theme of the International VELUX Award. The award wants to challenge the future of daylight in the built environment. The award contains no specific categories and is in no way restricted to the use of VELUX products. The jury of the International VELUX Award comprises internationally recognized architects and other building professionals. Any registered student of architecture – individual or team – from all over the world may participate in the award. The award wants to acknowledge not only the students but their teachers as well. Therefore, all students must be backed and granted submission by a teacher from a school of architecture.

== History ==
The first International VELUX Award took place in 2004. 760 students from 194 schools in 34 countries in Europe registered, and 258 students from 106 schools in 27 countries submitted their projects. The international jury led by [[Glenn Murcutt]] selected three winners and eight honourable mentions, who were announced at the Award event held in Paris.

== 2004 winners ==
In 2004 the first prize went to Norwegian student Claes Heske Ekornås for his project “Light as matter”. In 2004, ten winners were announced at the Award event in Paris.

== 2006 winners ==
In 2006, the award went global – inviting students from all over the world to participate. The number of submissions more than doubled reaching 557 projects from 225 schools in 53 countries.

'''Jamming''' in [[dance]] culture is a kind of informal show-off during a [[social dance]] party. Dancers clear a circle ('''jam circle''' or '''dance circle''') and dancers or dance couples take turns showing their best tricks while the remaining dancers cheer the jammers on.  While some jam circles are staged, most form organically and spontaneously when the energy and mood is right.  

==Jam circles==
The term originated during the [[swing era]] of dancing, probably borrowed or appeared in parallel with the expression "[[jam session]]" in music. Scenes with jamming may be seen in movies and [[musical theatre|musical]]s, such as ''[[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]''. At the same time, this kind of dance behavior is not unusual in [[folk dance]]s in various cultures all over the world and is often included in scenic performances when a group dance is interweaved with several solos. In [[Lindy hop]], it is common for jam circles to take place on or around special occasions such as birthdays or weddings. In these cases, the person(s) being celebrated will usually stay in the circle for the duration of the jam and, rather than dance one song with one partner, will dance one song but swap partners many times throughout.

For Flamenco dancing, the circle is called a juerga.

==Cypher circles==
Specific to the [[b-boy|bboying]] culture, cypher circles hold the similar concepts as jam circles.  When one or two bboys/bgirls get together to dance, it is known as jamming.  But when enough bboys/bgirls get together to make a circle where one can break in, it is known as "cyphering".  Cyphering takes place at nearly every bboying jam that takes place.  It is a way to show one's experience, the flavor they put into their style, and in some cases, specifically to "burn" or "smoke" another breaker. 

==Dance circles==
A variant of the 'show case' style jam circles is a circle where dancers within the circle swap partners from the outside.  Less "showy" than a jam circle, these jams are to commemorate an occasion for the person(s) in the circle.  Another way to consider the difference is that while the jam circles showcase ability, the dance circles here showcase dancers.  For example, this kind of jam circle may be organized when a dancer from the local dance community celebrates a birthday, or is moving away.  Other occasions for these jams include a welcome dance for new members and/or visitors. Many of these circles are a planned portion of the evening.

The dancers of honor stay in the circle the whole time while other dancers from outside the circle cut in 'on the fly'.  Dancers "break in", or "steal", their way into the middle by breaking the connection of the dancers and inserting themselves such that the person of honor continues dancing without missing a beat.  Some scenes do this in an organized fashion (such as a line), however, many do so without rules.  Such birthday jams are common in [[swing dance]] and [[hustle (dance)|hustle]] communities in the [[United States]] but not unusual in [[salsa (dance)|salsa]] or [[tango dance|tango]].   While nerve-wracking for beginning dancers the jams do help to meet the local crowd.

==Dance off==
This form of jamming often occurs during prom, high school or college dance parties. What happens is that during the dances, the dancers would form a circle, and often, one by one, the dancers, individually or by a group, would come into the circle and display their dancing abilities. The style of dancing is popular amongst [[hip hop dance]]rs.

==Charleston jams==
This variant of jam circle typically does not involve much of an audience.  While a few competitions have staged [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] jams and competitions, almost always they happen on their own when a few dancers start doing solo Charleston next to each other.  Eventually the dancers form a circle and dance solo charleston while watching each other. These jams occur frequently at most [[Lindy hop today|Lindy Hop]] events.

{{nihongo|'''''Kamaboko'''''|蒲鉾:かまぼこ}} is a type of [[Curing_(food_preservation)|cured]] [[surimi]], a processed seafood product common in [[Japanese cuisine]]. 

It is made by forming various [[Purée|pureed]] [[whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]] and additives such as [[Monosodium glutamate|MSG]] into distinctive loaves, which are then steamed until fully cooked and firm. These are sliced and either served unheated (or chilled) with various dipping sauces, or added to various hot soups, rice, or noodle dishes. Kamaboko is typically sold in semicylindrical loaves. Some include artistic patterns, such as the pink spiral on each slice of [[narutomaki]], named after [[Naruto whirlpools|the well-known tidal whirlpool]] near the Japanese city of [[Naruto, Tokushima|Naruto]].

There is no precise English translation for kamaboko. Rough equivalents are ''[[fish paste]]'', ''[[fish loaf]]'', ''[[fish cake]]'', and ''[[fish sausage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(Tsuji, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;. Tsuji recommends using the Japanese name in English (cf., ''[[sushi]]'').  The Ashkenazi Jewish dish [[gefilte fish]] is somewhat similar,{{cn|date=September 2017}} but as a [[forcemeat]] adds fat. 

Red-skinned and white kamaboko are typically served at celebratory and holiday meals, as red and white are considered to bring good luck. 

Kamaboko has been made in Japan since the 14th century AD and is now available nearly worldwide. The simulated crab meat product ''[[crab stick|kanikama]]'' (short for ''kani-kamaboko'') is the best-known form of ''surimi'' in the West. In Japan, the prepackaged snack ''chīkama'' (cheese plus kamaboko) is commonly sold in convenience stores. In the city of [[Uwajima]], a type of fried kamaboko called [[jakoten]] is popular.

== Composition ==
=== Choice of fish ===
Early kamaboko was made with [[Ground meat|minced]] [[Amur catfish|catfish]] ([[Silurus asotus]]). 

The [[whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]] used to make [[surimi]] ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: [[wiktionary:擂|擂]][[wiktionary:り|り]][[wiktionary:身|身]], literally "[[ground meat]]") include:

* Chicken grunt (''[[Parapristipoma|Parapristipoma trilineatum]]'')
* Golden threadfin bream (''[[Nemipterus virgatus]]'')
* Lizardfish (''[[Synodontidae]]'')
* Japanese gissu (''[[Pterothrissus gissu]]'')
* Various [[shark]] species (''[[Selachimorpha]]'')
* Alaska pollock (''[[Theragra chalcogramma]]'')
* White croaker (''[[Sciaenidae|Pennahia argentata]]'')
* Nibe croaker (''[[Sciaenidae|Nibea mitsukurii]]'')
* Daggertooth pike conger (''[[Muraenesox cinereus]]'')
* Gnomefish (''[[Scombrops boops]]'')
* [[Black bass]]
** Smallmouth bass (''[[Micropterus dolomieu]]'')
** Largemouth bass (''[[Micropterus salmoides]]'')
** Florida black bass (''[[Florida black bass|Micropterus floridanus]]'')

== Kamaboko Day ==
The Kamaboko organization of Japan specified November 15 for ''Kamaboko Day'' established in 1983.

==Outside Japan==
=== Hawaii ===
In [[Hawaii]], pink or red-skinned ''kamaboko'' is readily available in grocery stores. It is a staple of [[saimin]], a popular noodle soup created in Hawaii from the blending of Chinese and Japanese ingredients.  Kamaboko is sometimes referred to as ''fish cake'' in English.

After [[World War II]], surplus [[Quonset hut|Quonset huts]] became popular as housing in Hawaii. They became known as ''kamaboko houses'' due to the Quonset hut's half- cylindrical shape, similar to Kamaboko.&lt;ref name=hierarchy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historichawaii.org/2013/12/28/the-kamaboko-house/|title=The Kamaboko House|publisher=Historic Hawaii Foundation|accessdate=2017-07-21|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kappa Mikey''''' is an American animated comedy television series created by [[Larry Schwarz]]. The show is [[Nicktoons (United States)|Nicktoons Network]]'s first original half-hour series, bought during the same period as other [[Animation Collective]] series such as ''[[Three Delivery]]'' and ''[[Speed Racer: The Next Generation]]'', as well as Flash shows from other studios, such as ''[[Edgar &amp; Ellen]]'' and ''[[The Secret Show]]'', though the latter was made from [[BBC]]. The series premiered on February 25, 2006 and ended on September 20, 2008. The series is [[MTV]]'s first global acquisition, and was available on [[iTunes]] until 2009.

''Kappa Mikey'' was marketed as "the first [[anime]] to be produced entirely in the United States", according to press releases from MTV, Nicktoons Network and various other sources, as the term ''anime'' in English is generally reserved for animation originally produced for the Japanese market. It uses Japanese animation and culture as inspiration for its concept, rather than being "true" anime. As a matter of fact, the series is a homage/parody of Japanese anime.

==Plot==
The series focuses on a rather self-centered, cocky adolescent American boy named "Mikey" who wins a starring role in a popular Japanese television series ''LilyMu'' by centering on a team of crime-fighters with personalities based around typical anime characters. He becomes acquainted with his co-stars, including Gonard, a tall, husky, sweet, rather dimwitted young man who portrays the primary antagonist of the ''LilyMu'' series, Lily, the spoiled, heartless portrayer of the otherwise ingenuous and sweet damsel-in-distress of ''LilyMu'' who contempts Mikey for having overtaken her limelight, Mitsuki, a sweet-natured actress infatuated with Mikey who plays a much tougher character in the series than in reality, and Guano, a small, fuzzy, purple creature with many insecurities, responsibilities, strange habits and tendencies. The program in which the actors are featured is run by a tyrannical, strict and loud boss named "Ozu" who is not only noted for his sour demeanor and constant infuriation with Mikey, but also his mentoring guidance, and aided by Yes-Man, his dedicated and trustworthy assistant who loyally upholds him and agrees with any decision that he makes. The series centers on the actors' daily lives aside from filming the television program and the predicaments in which they may entangle themselves at the hands of their own cockiness, incompetence, or celebrity status, and episodes usually feature sub-plots following the lives of whichever characters are not being primarily featured in that particular episode. The series relies heavily on gags and other things for comedy.

==Production==
The show's title is a play on the word [[kappamaki]], a type of [[sushi]]. It is suggested that the show was the inspiration for naming the title character "Mikey" and used the prefix "[[kappa (folklore)|kappa]]". Like Mikey, who is a "fish out of water" in Japan, the kappa itself is a water demon creature who can live on land. The kappas first appeared on this show in the episode "Mikey, Kappa" on August 5, 2007, where the origin of the title was explained.  Coincidentally, Mikey also shares his name with the actor who supplies his voice.

''Kappa Mikey'' is different from other cartoons produced at the turn of the 21st century, in that the property was owned by the studio instead of an agency, the animation was not outsourced and the episodes were written by a full-time staff.  After producing Internet-based projects and television spots, the series became [[Animation Collective]]'s first television series. The series was produced in [[New York City]] starting from the summer of 2005.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;[http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=3405 Animation World Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075558/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=3405 |date=2008-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production for the two seasons wrapped in September 2007.

Schwarz conceived the series in 2000, when he was running Rumpus toys, a toy design company in New York City, but they folded before any storyboarding could commence.  They resurfaced years later as Animation Collective, and produced an early test pilot for a pitch to [[MTV Networks]], where the character designs and backgrounds resembled more like those found in [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]'', and the humor was also more adult-oriented. Much of the current cast was voicing their characters even this early in production. MTV declined the deal, and Nickelodeon eventually picked up the project. The series was tweaked heavily in order to be aimed at a younger audience. Voice talents were usually local, and its audio was recorded at Manhattan-based [[NYAV Post]], which [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] owns. [[Larry Schwarz]], along with the other executive producers, oversaw all phases of production, but only had writing credits on the pilot episode, "Mikey Impossible" and "A Christmas Mikey".  All the episodes were directed by Sergei Aniskov.  The instrumental score was composed by John Angier, who also wrote the lyrics to "The Recycling Song", "Ori and Yori's Hits", "Living With Mikey", "How Did We Get Here?" and the songs from "The Karaoke Episode".

The series was animated in [[Adobe Flash]], with some moments of [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] rendered in [[Maya (software)|Maya]]. To further emphasize the contrast in animation styles, one group of animators was assigned to the anime characters, and another group was in charge of Mikey and the other American characters.  The vehicles on ''[[LilyMu]]'' and around Tokyo, as well as the weapons, the Gonard balloon, Pirate King's ship, the Karaoke Genie Machine, etc., were created in Maya and exported into Flash using the Toon Filter.  The backgrounds were modeled in Maya, and texture, details, and clouds were added in [[Photoshop]].  Some of the backgrounds were inspired by actual locations in [[Tokyo]]. The show's anime-style characters perform with large comedic overuses of [[face fault]]s, such as a face and/or body turning into an exaggerated general appearance, or becoming much smaller. This allowed animators to have more control over how a character looks and acts than on many other Flash shows, and they did not always have to be on-model.  The show uses clichés common to anime, including the sweat drop, lines over the eyes or no eyes at all, big heads, flaming eyes and bodies [[super deformed|becoming smaller]]. Sometimes Mikey will try to do these things, which was one of the show's running gags, but cannot due to being drawn in an American style.

A Kappa Mikey DVD was released on September 18, 2007 under the [[Starz Home Entertainment]] brand, and includes the episodes "Lost in Transportation", "Easy Come, Easy Gonard", and "The Man Who Would Be Mikey", all from the first season, as well as bonus material, including a fictional music video of "I'm Alright" taken from "Battle of the Bands", wallpaper, an interactive game parodying ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', and a How-to-Draw-Mikey tutorial.

In 2008, the Animation Collective site advertised a second DVD that was scheduled be released sometime later that year.  However, the announcement was removed from the website, leaving the exact release date to be unknown. The DVD was intended to include the first season in its entirety, with DVD extras, and would have been considered more of an "official" volume than the last one. No further announcement has been made as the status of this DVD. As of 2009, this release is shelved.

Season 1 (Episodes 1 – 13) was released on DVD on September 12, 2007 [http://www.anchorbayent.com.au/Detail.aspx?ID=STZ1019], and Season 2 (Episodes 14–26) was released on DVD on March 12, 2008 [http://www.anchorbayent.com.au/Detail.aspx?ID=STZ1111] by Anchor Bay Entertainment in Australia.

The soundtrack for "Kappa Karaoke" is available as a downloadable album on iTunes. Both seasons of the show itself were also available for download from iTunes before they were later taken down from the online retailer.

'''Kustom Kulture''' is a [[neologism]] used to describe the [[art]]works, [[vehicle]]s, [[hairstyle]]s, and [[fashion]]s of those who drove and built [[custom car]]s and [[Custom (motorcycle)|motorcycles]] in the [[United States of America]] from the 1950s through today. 
It was born out of the hot rod culture of Southern California of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="DutchTurner1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Von Dutch|author2=Ron Turner|author3=Ed Roth|author4=Robert Williams|title=Custom Culture: Von Dutch, Ed "Big Daddy" Roth,Robert (Bob) Bond, Robert Williams and Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10di738DvjoC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=1 November 1993|publisher=Last Gasp|isbn=978-0-86719-405-0|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of [[hot rod]]ding, many fashions and styles developed. Over time, each of these distinct styles of customizing have blended and reshaped our everyday life. Artists such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch (Kenny Howard)]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and  custom car builder [[Ed Roth|Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]]; along with Lyle Fisk, [[Dean Jeffries]]; hot rod and [[lowrider]] customizers such as the [[Barris Brothers]] (Sam and [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2265319/Batmobile-Man-paid-1-original-sells-auction-4-6M.html|title=George Barris with Batmobile: Photos|publisher=Daily Mail | location=London|date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with numerous [[tattoo]] artists, automobile painters, and movies and television shows such as ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[The Munsters]]'' ([[The Munster Koach]], [[DRAG-U-LA]]) have all helped to form what is known as Custom Culture.

Custom Culture is usually identified with the [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]]s of the 1950s, the [[drag racing|drag racers]] of the 1960s, and the [[lowrider]]s of the 1970s. Other subcultures that have had an influence on Custom Culture are the [[Skinhead]]s, [[mods and rockers]] of the 1960s, the [[punk rock|punk]] rockers of the 1970s, the metal and [[rockabilly]] music, along with the [[scooterboy]]s of the 1980s, and [[psychobilly]] of the 1990s. Each separate culture has added their own customizations to the cars, their own fashions, influenced the music, and added their own ideas of what is cool, what is acceptable, and what is not. Everything from wild pinstriped paintjobs, to choptop [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]s, to custom [[Harley-Davidson]] and [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycles, to [[metallic paint|metal-flake]] and black [[Primer (paint)|primer]] paint jobs, along with music, cartoons, and monster movies have influenced what defines anyone and anything who is part of this automobile subculture.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Kustom Kulture had taken on a rebirth of American subcultures from the 1950s and 1960s with  [[DIY]] activities. Each style is distinct, and has its roots in American automobile history. Many styles that would not have tolerated each other in the past now come together in large car shows.

==Kustom Graphics==
The rebirth of Kustom Kulture has seen the  use of the term “Kustom Graphics” to describe the style of artwork associated with the subculture when applied to posters, flyers, T-shirts and logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kustom Graphics|date=2008|publisher=Korero Books|isbn=9780955339868|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweden and Finland ==
[[File:60's car with lots of raggare on the roof at Power Big Meet.jpg|thumb|right|Swedish hot rodders with a 1960s American car at Power Big Meet]]
Locals in these countries, influenced by American culture, have created a local hot rod culture which is vibrant in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]  where enthusiasts gather at meetings such as [[Power Big Meet]] and clubs like Wheels and Wings in [[Varberg]], Sweden have established themselves in Hot Rod culture. Since there is very little "vintage tin" the hot rods in Sweden are generally made with a home made chassis (usually a Model T or A replica), with a Jaguar (or [[Volvo 240]]) rear axle, a [[Small-block#Small block|small block]] [[V8 engine|V8]], and [[fiberglass]] tub, but some have been built using for instance a [[Volvo Duett]] chassis. Because the Swedish regulations required a crash test even for custom-built passenger cars between 1969 and 1982, the Duett option was preferred, since it was considered a rebodied Duett rather than a new vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070228060401/http://hem.passagen.se/stur/pages/artiklar/duettrod/Duettrodden.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070129040558/http://hem.passagen.se/stur/pages/galleri/duetter/Duettrods.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930003248/http://amazon.forum.bilia.se/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=25500&amp;sid=e89d2d537977372aa45c4d0c5b7b9598]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garaget.org/?car=19319][http://www.garaget.org/?car=16701][http://www.garaget.org/?car=19319]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 1950s and 1960s cars are also hot rodded, like [[Morris Minor]], [[Ford Anglia]], [[Volvo Amazon]], [[Ford Cortina]], [['57 Chevy]], to name but a few. These are known as [[custom cars]] (sometimes spelled Kustom).

'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender''' people in Barbados do not enjoy the same rights as non-LGBT people. Homosexual acts are illegal (regardless of whether they were consensual and done in private) in [[Barbados]], with a life sentence; however, the law is rarely enforced. The law is currently in effect, but under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyxtra.com/|title=Xtra – The news is queer|website=Xtra|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/north-central-america/barbados |title=Travel &amp; living abroad (Barbados) - Local laws and customs |first= |last= |author=Staff |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (UK)]] |location= |page= |pages= |at= |trans-title=|format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=7 April 2010 |quote=Barbados, in common with much of the English speaking Caribbean, has a very conservative attitude to homosexuality and homophobic views are unfortunately common. Contrary to popular belief, homosexuality itself is not illegal although [[sodomy]] remains a criminal offence. However, the penalties set out in the 1992 Sexual Offences Act concerning sexual relations between members of the same sex are rarely enforced when this takes place in private. There is no overtly public gay scene in Barbados and no gay and lesbian publications. However, many gay Bajans couples are known and live together without problems by maintaining a low profile. |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, Attorney General [[Adriel Brathwaite]] said that gays should be "left alone" and protected in the eyes of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/06/07/barbados-official-says-gays-should-be-left-alone-despite-sodomy-law/|title=Barbados official says gays should be ‘left alone’ despite sodomy law|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the Belize Supreme Court struck down [[Belize]]'s sodomy ban as unconstitutional. Because Belize and Barbados (and all member states of [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]]) share an identical jurisprudence, Barbados' sodomy ban is also unconstitutional. However, unlike Belize, [[Constitution of Barbados|Barbados' Constitution]] contains a "savings clause", which protects laws inherited by the former [[British Empire]] from constitutional review, even if these laws run counter to fundamental human and constitutional rights.

Because of Barbados' small population, many LGBT Barbadians choose to remain in the closet in fear that coming out would expose them to the entire country.&lt;ref name="gaystar"/&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
[[File:Rihanna concert in Washington DC (2).jpg|thumb|upright|Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]], famous on the island, has often expressed support for LGBT rights.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt;]]
Same-sex and different-sex [[anal sex|anal]] and [[oral sex]] (buggery or sodomy) are criminalised in Barbados. Chapter 154, Section 9 of the ''Sexual Offences Act'' criminalises buggery, regardless of whether the act was done in private and consensual. Punishment is life imprisonment. The law is rarely enforced, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/lgbti2.pdf CHAPTER 154 SEXUAL OFFENCES]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) published a report entitled: "I Have to Leave to be me: Discriminatory Laws Against LGBT People in the Eastern Caribbean". The organisation called on Barbados to repeal Section 9 and urged the Government to create a safe environment for all Barbadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbadostoday.bb/2018/04/13/bteditorial-the-implications-of-trinidads-landmark-gay-rights-ruling-for-barbados/|title=#BTEditorial - The implications of Trinidad’s landmark gay rights ruling for Barbados - Barbados Today|date=13 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government minister subsequently warned that external forces were trying to impose same-sex marriage on the country. HRW called the minister's response a "cheap political trick", as their report does not mention same-sex marriage at all, and instead focuses on the discrimination and harassment LGBT people face in Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/28/cheap-political-trick-barbados|title=Cheap Political Trick in Barbados|date=28 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016 and April 2018, the [[LGBT rights in Belize|Belize Supreme Court]] and the [[LGBT rights in Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago High Court]], respectively, ruled that laws criminalising homosexuality are unconstitutional. These rulings have been welcomed by Barbadian LGBT activists, who hope to have their own laws repealed too. However, Barbados' Constitution contains a "savings clause", which protects laws inherited by the former [[British Empire]] from constitutional review, even if these laws run counter to fundamental human and constitutional rights, thus making any legal challenge to the buggery law difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbadostoday.bb/2018/04/12/our-win-too/|title=Our win too! - Barbados Today|date=12 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Barbadian LGBT activists have filed suit in international courts instead. In June 2018, with the help of Canadian human rights groups, they filed a case with the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] challenging Chapter 154, Section 9 of the ''Sexual Offences Act''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailyxtra.com/lgbt-activists-file-challenge-of-barbados-anti-gay-laws-87494 LGBT activists file challenge of Barbados’ anti-gay laws]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglican Bishop of Barbados, as well as the Catholic Church, have come out in opposition to the buggery law, stating that, while they morally oppose homosexuality, governments must respect the rights of all persons, including LGBT people.&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/23/shes-famous-barbados-and-lgbt-ally|title=She’s Famous, From Barbados, and an LGBT Ally|date=23 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], extremist and [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] groups have attacked LGBT activists and LGBT people more broadly. These include the New Testament Church, which has made factually incorrect and unscientific comments regarding [[sexual orientation]], claiming that [[heterosexuality]], [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]] are chosen, and has argued that discrimination against LGBT people should be encouraged, while at the same time [[victim playing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://barbadostoday.bb/2018/07/19/no-same-sex/ No same-sex!]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
There is no recognition of same-sex unions in Barbados. In June 2016, Attorney General [[Adriel Brathwaite]] said the Barbados Government will not change the law to allow for same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.barbadostoday.bb/2016/06/07/gay-blow/|title= Gay blow: AG rules out same-sex marriages|publisher=Barbados Today|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption and parenting==
Same-sex couples are unable to legally adopt in Barbados.

While not explicitly prohibited or regulated by law, the Barbados Fertility Centre offers [[In vitro fertilization|IVF]] and [[artificial insemination]] treatments to lesbian couples. [[Surrogacy]] is illegal in Barbados.&lt;ref name="fertility"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.barbadosivf.com/single-and-same-sex/|title=SINGLE AND SAME SEX COUPLES FERTILITY OPTIONS|website=Barbados Fertility Centre|date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT rights movement in Barbados==
In 2013, [[Donnya Piggott]] and Ro-Ann Mohammad founded the association Barbados Gays, Lesbians and All-Sexuals Against Discrimination as an organization to create an education mechanism and open public dialogue in a supportive manner for the LGBT community of Barbados.&lt;ref name="Dottin (2013)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dottin|first1=Bea|title=BGLAD: Don't hate|url=http://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/29080/bglad-8217-hate|accessdate=18 March 2015|publisher=Nation News|date=24 June 2013|location=St. Michael, Barbados}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbados held its first pride parade in November 2017.&lt;ref name="gaystar"&gt;[https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/this-is-why-we-needed-the-first-ever-barbados-pride/ This is why we needed the first ever Barbados Pride]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homosexual refugee claims ===
{{as of|2011|alt=In 2011}}, the Government of Barbados said it was investigating claims that some gay [[Barbadian people|Barbadians]] were seeking [[refugee status]] in [[Canada]]. In 2016, a Guyanese newspaper reported that over 300 members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in Barbados were seeking asylum in Canada, [[England]] and the [[United States]] because they fear persecution at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stabroeknews.com/2016/news/regional/09/26/gays-leaving-barbados-canada/|title=Gays leaving Barbados for Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bajan Minister for Foreign Affairs, Maxine McClean, stated a concern of the Government at these applications attempting to secure refugee status in Canada since two of the nine applications to the Canadian Government had already been denied and questions have been raised as to whether it is an attempt at abusing the refugee system to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay scam? |author= |first=Ricky |last=Jordan |authorlink= |authorlink2= |url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/gay-scam/ |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=20 February 2011 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=25 February 2011 |language= |trans-title=|quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bajan organisation United Gays and Lesbians Against AIDS, Barbados (UGLAAB) stated it was also looking to conduct its own investigation on the same allegations. 

The resident [[United States|U.S.]] [[Ambassador]] later commented to the local press that some of the other nations in region were among the highest number of such refugee applications to the United States, but he went on to say that the U.S. Embassy to [[Bridgetown]] had not yet reported any specific problems within Barbados to the U.S. [[State Department]]. The ambassador highlighted that [[sodomy law]]s were a part of statute law for Barbados and that the Barbadian Government should perhaps consider formally retiring those laws to maintain Barbados' good image internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay backlash worry |author= |first=Tony |last=Best |authorlink= |authorlink2= |url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/gay-backlash-worry/ |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=26 February 2011 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=26 February 2011 |language= |trans-title=|quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International relations ===
In 2011, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] stated during a Commonwealth of Nations Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in [[Australia]] that his Government would find it difficult to provide aid for countries which still had laws banning sodomy on their statute books. Thereafter, the Attorney General for Barbados stated publicly that Barbados would not be dictated to by the U.K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/not-by-uk/|title=Not by UK|first=Nation News|last=author|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the statement, several members of Barbados' openly gay community stated that Barbados should begin to offer packaged tourism deals for gay tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/dear-cash-in-gay-tourism/|title=Dear: Cash in gay tourism|first=Nation News|last=author|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an informal comment line by the Barbados Nation newspaper found that plan to be disliked by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/talk-back-readers-see-no-reason-to-focus-on-gay-tourism/|title=TALK BACK: Readers see no reason to focus on gay tourism|first=Nation News|last=author|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the UK's comment, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] established a unit to tackle gay rights. It noted the problems some of the laws in the region presented and stated that it would "promote the harmonious development of all its work areas based on the interdependence and indivisibility of all human rights and the need to protect the rights of all individuals and groups historically subjected to discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/Comunicados/English/2011/115-11eng.htm|title=IACHR Creates Unit on the Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Persons|website=www.cidh.oas.org|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
Recent polls conducted by Caribbean Development Research Services Inc. (CADRES) have found Barbadians to be more tolerant than previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Homosexuality debate rages in Barbados |author=Staff writer |first= |last= |authorlink= |url=http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/homosexuality-debate-rages-in-barbados/ |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The Daily Nation (Barbados)|Nation Newspaper]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=11 December 2010 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=11 December 2010 |trans-title=|quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 poll conducted by the Caribbean Development Research Services (CADRES), 67% of Barbadians described themselves as tolerant of the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antillean.org/jones-accept-homosexual-relationships-246/|title=Barbados MP: Accept the existence of gay relationships|date=3 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 82% also opposed discrimination against the LGBT community.

In recent years, due in part to the rapid legalisation of same-sex marriage in many countries including the [[United States]], many American evangelical ministers have come to Barbados. Human rights activists have accused them of spreading and preaching violence and hatred. Owing to these evangelical ministers, homophobic rhetoric in Barbados has become more widespread. For example, a university lecturer called homosexuality "illogical", numerous doctors erroneously claimed that AIDS cannot be spread through heterosexual sex and many religious leaders correlated homosexuality to paedophilia.&lt;ref name="gaystar"/&gt;

'''Leavisism''' is a form of [[literary studies]] named after [[F. R. Leavis]]. Leavis was greatly influenced by [[Matthew Arnold]] and they share the notion that culture is the high point in civilization and concern of an educated minority.&lt;ref&gt;The Cultural Studies Reader by Simon During, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Leavis argues that prior to industrial revolution England had an authentic culture of the educated elite. For Leavis it was a golden age of an organic community with a lived culture of Folk-song and Folk-dance.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Studies: Theory and Practice by Chris Barker, 12 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Light Yagami'''|夜神{{ruby|月|ライト}}|Yagami Raito|lead=yes}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[manga]] series ''[[Death Note]]'', created by [[Tsugumi Ohba]] and [[Takeshi Obata]]. He is a bored teen genius who finds a [[supernatural]] notebook known as the Death Note, which was dropped by the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]]. Using the notebook, which allows its owner to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face, Light becomes a god-like vigilante known as {{Nihongo4|'''Kira'''|キラ}} in an attempt to create a [[utopia]] cleansed of criminals, with him at the helm as its "God", with the series chronicling his eventual descent from a normal and unassuming teenager to a cunning, ruthless and sociopathic serial-killer, as he carries out a horrific world-wide massacre of criminals and terrorists in his goal to change the world into a utopian society without crime, murdering those whom he sees as morally unworthy of life and anyone who gets in the way of his plans, which includes individuals such as law enforcement officials and police officers. 

In the [[anime]] adaptation, he is voiced by [[Mamoru Miyano]] in Japanese and by [[Brad Swaile]] in the English version. In the live-action film series, he is portrayed by [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] with Swaile reprising his role as his English dub voice; he is portrayed by both [[Kenji Urai]] and Hayato Kakizawa in the musical; in the TV drama, he is portrayed by [[Masataka Kubota]]; and his counterpart in the American film is portrayed by [[Nat Wolff]].

== Creation and conception ==
[[Tsugumi Ohba]], the story writer of ''Death Note'', said that his editor suggested the [[family name]] "Yagami" for Light. Ohba said that he did not feel "too concerned" about the meaning of the name (the [[Kanji]] for "Yagami" are "night" and "god"); he said that after he created the final scene in the manga he "liked" that the final scene created "deeper significance" in the name, of Kira worshippers worshipping him at night under the light of the moon – his given name Light is written with the character for "moon".&lt;ref name="EnglishHTR61"&gt;"How to Think." ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Takeshi Obata]], the artist of ''Death Note'', said that he had "no trouble" designing Light as the character description presented to him, "A brilliant honors student who's a little out there," was "clear and detailed". As the weekly serialization continued, Obata simplified the design by subconsciously removing "unnecessary" lines and felt that he became "better" at drawing Light. When Chapter 35 appeared and the editor informed Obata that Light loses his memories, Obata had to draw Light in a similar manner as he appeared in Chapter 1; Obata said "It was like I had to forget everything I had learned." Obata said that he used "a lot of effort" to design Light's wardrobe. According to Obata, he encountered difficulty imagining the clothing of "a brilliant person," so he looked through fashion magazines. Obata envisioned Light as a "smart and formal guy" who wears formal shirts. Most of Light's clothing in ''Death Note'' is "fitted" and Obata avoided [[jeans]].&lt;ref name="Light drawing design"&gt;"Takeshi Obata Production Note: Characters." ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

When designing color book covers Obata assigned colors to characters to "get the atmosphere right". Obata assigned clear or "lack of a color" to Light.&lt;ref&gt;''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
[[Shusuke Kaneko]], director of the film, intended for Light to appear sympathetic at the beginning of the film; when Light first gains the Death Note, Kaneko "was careful" to have Light react in a manner "as you and I would". Kaneko changed the story involving Light gaining his first notebook as he felt that the audience "would have a hard time sympathizing" with Light if the scene remained the same as it was in the manga. Kaneko added that as he portrayed Light as "being enthralled" as he "becomes more cruel" to make the audience members feel that they could "do the terrible things he does" even if the members do not sympathize with Light.&lt;ref name="SJinterview6"&gt;''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]''. Volume 6, Issue 6. June 2008. [[VIZ Media]]. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] said that he felt difficulty portraying Light in the film series because of the lack of "action" and because Light has no signature mannerisms and therefore has his feelings displayed by his face; Fujiwara added that he struggled conveying Light's "incredible 
intelligence" and that the performance would appear "very empty or simplistic" if Light received an improper portrayal. Fujiwara explained that he wanted Light to cry in a particular scene even though Kaneko told Fujiwara "Light doesn’t cry" since Fujiwara believed that the scene would feel "more honest"; Kaneko used the take.&lt;ref name="Thestars"&gt;"[http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/29/movies/15836983&amp;sec=movies The stars]." ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]''. Sunday October 29, 2006. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaneko designed Light's room to reflect the character's personality by making it clean and neat and filling it with legal, criminal history, foreign, and academic books. The original version of Light's room included a stereo; Kaneko replaced it with a [[vacuum]] cleaner to reflect Light's "clean-freak self".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/29/movies/15836968&amp;sec=movies The making] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215636/http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F10%2F29%2Fmovies%2F15836968&amp;sec=movies |date=2008-12-18 }}." ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]''. Sunday October 29, 2006. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenichi Matsuyama]], the actor who portrayed L, said that he and Fujiwara became "so immersed" in their character portrayals that they did not talk to one another while on the set; when filming ceased they conversed and "went out for a drink or two".&lt;ref name="Thestars"/&gt; Matsuyama also said that Light and L are "extremely" alike in that they have "a very strong sense of justice".&lt;ref name="ThedummyStarMalaysia"&gt;"[http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/10/29/movies/15853999&amp;sec=movies The dummy]".

Light Yagami was born on February 28, 1986.&lt;ref name="LightHTRProfile8"&gt;''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He is an acknowledged genius, placing first in national exam tables and university entrance exams and is shown to be a model student, admired by both by his fellow students and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;''Death Note'' Volume 2. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also athletic and attractive, displaying a gentleman-like demeanor and an immensely likable and sensible personality, which has contributed to his popularity among his peers and teachers.&lt;ref name=JJRS_Thomas_2012&gt;{{cite journal | last=Thomas | first=Jolyon Baraka | title=Horrific "Cults" and Comic Religion | journal=[[Japanese Journal of Religious Studies]] | volume=39 | issue=1 | pages=127–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the story, Light is a student in his last year of [[high school]]; he later attends {{Nihongo4|To-Oh University|東応大学|Tōō Daigaku}}. His father, [[Soichiro Yagami|Soichiro Yagami]], is the chief of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] and the head of the task force hunting for "Kira", the name the public has given to the perpetrator of a string of inexplicable murders around the world. His mother, [[Sachiko Yagami|Sachiko]], is a housewife. His younger sister, [[Sayu Yagami|Sayu]], acts as a cheerful, less academic [[foil (literature)|foil]].

When Light discovers the Death Note, which was dropped into the Human World by the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]], who becomes Light's companion, he is initially horrified of the Death Note's god-like abilities, but after realizing the potential of the notebook's abilities and it's utitility for a better cause, he begins a world-wide massacre, managing to murder numerous high-profile  criminals and law-offenders around the world, in order to accomplish his goal of a utopian society without crime, under the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira": the Japanese trans-literation of the word: killer, given to him by the Japanese media and public. While his task originates with good intentions,&lt;ref&gt;Brusuelas, James. "[http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&amp;article_no=3585 Anime Reviews: Death Note a Must-Have, Naruto and Bleach a Bit Faded] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016122504/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone |date=2007-10-16 }}." ''[[Animation World Magazine]]''. Thursday March 28, 2008. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; he is corrupted by power within a week, plotting to rule his utopia as "the god of the new world", willing to kill anyone who impedes his plans. His ethics are [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]], justifying the most extreme acts in service of his cause. He is also driven by a need for victory, which motivates most of his cruelest acts. Combined with the power of the Death Note, his [[hubris]] and genius-level intellect convince him that only he can save the world. However, it is shown that he was not born a sociopath, as evidenced when he lost his memories of using the Death Note during the middle half of the series, during which he reverted back to his old personality: a polite, courteous and kind-hearted person, who is unwilling to manipulate others and believes that the act of murder is a crime, which wholly contradicts his personality while operating as "Kira" and also goes on to assist his father in finding "Kira". 

Eventually a small task force of Japanese police officers, including Light's father, under the direction of the eccentric genius detective [[L (Death Note)|L]] begin to close in on Light. Although he suspects Light is Kira, L allows him to collaborate with the police on the case. This begins an intricate and complex game of [[cat and mouse]] between the two, with Light trying to learn L's real name so he can kill him, and L trying to get Light to expose himself so that he can arrest him. Eventually, via an elaborate plan that sees Light relinquish ownership of his Death Note, thus temporarily losing all memory of it, and the forced help of his fiancée [[Misa Amane]]'s Shinigami [[Rem (Death Note)|Rem]], L dies. Light then assumes the "L" persona and continues his charade of searching for Kira with the task force while carrying out the killings himself with help from Misa.

Over four years later, Light is able to garner most of the world's support, reaching the point where his followers have begun to worship Kira as a literal deity. But two young intellectuals, [[Mello (Death Note)|Mello]] and [[Near (Death Note)|Near]], both raised as potential successors to L begin to separately investigate the case that took the life of their predecessor. Near heads the [[SPK (Special Provision for Kira)]], an American investigation team composed of [[CIA]] and [[FBI]] agents, while Mello teams up with the [[Mafia]]. Although Mello dies working separate from Near, his actions lead [[Teru Mikami]], a man selected by Light to kill criminals using another Death Note, to make a mistake that results in Light's capture by Near, the SPK and Japanese police. Seeing that Light has finally lost, he is killed when Ryuk writes his name in his own Death Note, just as the Shinigami had warned when they first met.&lt;ref name="Volume 12: Finis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ohba | first = Tsugumi | title = Death Note, Volume 12 | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Viz Media]] | isbn = 978-1-4215-1327-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In film ===
====Japanese film series====
[[Image:TatsuyaFujiwaraasLightYagami.png|thumb|[[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] as Light in the [[Death Note (2006 film)|''Death Note'' film series]].]]
In the Japanese film series, Light Yagami is portrayed by [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]], known for his role as [[Shuya Nanahara]] in ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]''. In the films, he is portrayed as a distinguished, popular and intellectually-gifted college student, who has a disregard and frustration of the incapability of the law enforcement system to quell the rampant crime-wave around the world, which drives his motives to use the Death Note, to change the world into a utopian society without crime, under the alias of a god-like vigilante known as "Kira", much like his manga counterpart. However, some slight changes and modifications were made to the character. At the film's beginning, Light is a first-year law student at a university, instead of still being in high school as in the beginning of the manga and anime. Light's motives also slightly differ; in this version, he uses the Death Note mainly out of his frustration from the perceived failures of the [[Law of Japan|Japanese justice system]]. Light, prior to his discovery of the Death Note, [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]]s into the government database and finds that the government secretly acknowledges that it is unable to prosecute many criminals. Also, Light discovers the Death Note in an alley during a rainy night after encountering an accquited felon named Takuo Shibuimaru in a night-club. Another difference is that Light meets Ryuk right after killing Shibuimaru with the Death Note. At the end of the first movie Light kills his girlfriend, Shiori Akino, and frames her death as a murder and reason to foster hatred for "Kira", in order to join the Kira investigation team as a result of their sympathy.

Light relinquishes ownership of the Death Note to [[Kiyomi Takada]]. After Takada is caught, Light kills her to recover the Death Note, but it is taken by the investigation team. L states that he will test the 13-Day Rule, a fake Death Note rule designed to prove Light and Misa's innocence. Rem, knowing that L's actions will reveal Misa's identity as the 2nd Kira, writes both L and his handler: Watari's names in the Death Note. Light then proceeds to write his father's name in the book, manipulating his father to return the confiscated Death Note. Light confronts his father, but Soichiro does not die. The investigation team members, including L, reveal themselves. Having already written his own name in the Death Note, thus negating Rem's actions, L tells Light that he had just written in a fake note. Light tries to write on a hidden piece of Death Note, but is shot by Matsuda, an investigation team member. Light tells Ryuk to write the team's names, promising to show him many interesting things, and begins to laugh. He stops, however, when Ryuk shows him that he had written just one name: Light's. Light tries to stop Ryuk, but merely passes right through him. As Light begins to succumb to the effects of the Death Note, Ryuk takes this opportunity to reveal to him that humans that have used the Death Note are barred from entering either [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]], instead spending eternity in [[nothing]]ness. Light dies in his father's arms, begging him to believe that he acted as Kira to put the justice, which Soichiro had taught him since his childhood, into practice. 

Several years after Light's death, however, it is revealed in the sequel film ''[[Death Note: Light Up the New World]]'' that Light has secretly raised a son, Hikari Yagami (夜神光 ''Yagami Hikari''), to inherit a Death Note and carry on Kira's legacy. As Hikari becomes of age, the boy is killed by Teru Mikami, his appointed guardian, over control of the notebook. Mikami is then killed by police officer Tsukuru Mishima who decides to use the notebook to continue Light's work in ridding the world of crime. During the course of the film, Mishima is eventually caught by police and he willingly turns himself in and the notebook to the authorities, thus ending Kira's legacy.

[[Nat Wolff]] portrays the character's counterpart, "Light Turner": a Seattle high school student, in [[Death Note (2017 film)|the American film adaptation]], as an intelligent yet quiet and socially-introverted teenager, who stumbles across the mystical Death Note and eventually decides to use the notebook's god-like abilities to commit a world-wide massacre, in order to change the world into a utopian society without crime, under the alias of a literal human deity: "Kira", while being hunted down by an elite task-force of law enforcement officials within Seattle City, led by an enigmatic international detective known as L and his own father, veteran Seattle detective: James Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/nat-wolff-adam-wingard-death-note-1201605146/|title='Paper Towns'' Nat Wolff to Star in Adam Wingard's 'Death Note'|publisher=Variety|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Warners' Live-Action Death Note Film Casts Nat Wolff |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-29/warners-live-action-death-note-film-casts-nat-wolff/.93552 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2015-09-29 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Qualley]] portrays Mia Sutton (based on the sociopathic qualities of Light Yagami&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-netflixs-death-note-is-really-an-origin-story-and-w-1798435941|title=Why Netflix's Death Note Is Really an Origin Story and Where a Sequel Could Go|last=Trendacosta|first=Katharine|work=io9|date=August 28, 2017|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Light's girlfriend who assists him in his activities as "Kira". In this adaptation, Light has vast character differences from his manga counterpart and does not have a sister and has lost his mother in a hit and run incident, which partially serves as his inspiration to operate as Kira. He has a close yet somewhat strained relationship with his father and while considered academically-gifted by peers and authorities, is not a popular student and is considered as a social outsider and lacks friends. Unlike his manga counterpart, he is also far less charismatic and confident, but more morally-driven and demonstrates a reluctance to murder innocents and law enforcement individuals attempting to capture him, while eventually demonstrating a more darker, colder, more confident and meticulous personality, towards the film's ending. Furthermore, instead of obtaining the notebook by chance, Ryuk deliberately hands Light the notebook, in order to entertain himself.

After being enticed to kill a bully by Ryuk, Light murders the criminal who killed his mother. Along with Mia Sutton, his classmate and love interest, Light begins a crusade similar to his manga counterpart to rid the world of crime. However the pair eventually come to a disagreement on how they should deal with law enforcement targeting them, including L and Light's father James. After Mia kills Watari, L's handler, she schemes to steal the notebook from Light, but Light outmanuevers her and kills her and manages to concoct an elaborate plan through the Death Note, by manipulating a number of criminals to continue his activities as "Kira" through the notebook and inducing himself into a medical coma, which seemingly proves Light's innocence to the authorities. At the end of the film, James presents Light with evidence that he killed his mother's murderer and Light confesses to being Kira and reveals how he cleared himself of suspicion. Meanwhile, L, disgraced by his superiors due to failing to implicate Light and seeking to avenge Watari, considers killing Light with a hidden piece of the notebook he finds in Mia's room. The film ends without Light's fate being divulged.

=== In other media ===
In the [[Death Note (2015 TV series)|2015 drama]], [[Masataka Kubota]] plays the role of Light Yagami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Masataka Kubota, Kento Yamazaki Star in Live-Action Death Note TV Series |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-21/masataka-kubota-kento-yamazaki-star-in-live-action-death-note-tv-series/.88403 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2015-05-21 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Netflix adaptation, Light is portrayed as less charismatic, insecure and is initially hesitant to kill law enforcement. His relationship with his father Soichiro is also strained due to the death of his mother prior to the start of the series. However, in the later half of the series he grows to demonstrate the same level of ruthlessness, intellect and hubris as his manga counterpart.

Like the Netflix adaption, Light does not obtain the notebook by chance and it is given to him by Ryuk in response to a confrontation with a bully. After again using the notebook to save his father from being held hostage, Light proceeds to use the notebook to kill criminals as Kira. In response to the killings, the detective L leads a police task force alongside Light's father Soichiro to capture Kira. Toward the end of the series, L and Soichiro see through Light's deception and each attempt to convince him to turn himself in. When Light refuses to relent, he is baited into confessing after L and Soichiro both sacrifice their lives. The information obtained from their deaths is relayed to the police task force, who ambush Light in a warehouse in a [[sting operation]] lead by L's successor Near. In a desperate attempt to help him evade capture, Light's accomplice Teru Mikami sets fire to the warehouse but Light is instead trapped by the fire and burns to death. 

In [[Death Note: The Musical|the musical adaptation]], Light is portrayed by [[Kenji Urai]] and Hayato in the Japanese productions and [[Hong Kwang-ho]] and [[Han Ji-sang]] in the Korean productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kenji Urai, Hayato Kakizawa Star in Death Note Musical |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-07-29/kenji-urai-hayato-kakizawa-star-in-death-note-musical/.77092 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2014-07-29 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

===Analysis===
Ohba described Light as a victim of the Death Note, with Light's life being "ruined" once he obtained it. According to Ohba, Light was "a young man who could understand the pain of others" when he first encountered the Death Note. Ohba said that if Ryuk never developed an interest in the human world, Light would have become "one of the greatest police leaders in the world" who, with L, worked against criminals.&lt;ref&gt;''Death Note 13: How to Read''. [[VIZ Media]]. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that he believed that debating whether Light's actions were good or evil is not "very important". Ohba said that he personally sees Light as a "diabolical" character.&lt;ref name="HowtoThink69"&gt;"How to Think." ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Obata said that Light was his second favorite human character and that he was not sure whether that was because he "liked" Light or because he drew "such a diabolical character" in a magazine for children.&lt;ref name="HTR190"&gt;''Death Note 13: How to Read''. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ohba, Light sees [[Misa Amane]], whom he uses as an accomplice, as a "bad person" who killed people, so he acts emotionally cold towards her and manipulates her, although he pretends to love her, and even says he will marry her. He is only stopped from killing her by the shinigami [[Shinigami (Death Note)#Rem|Rem]], who threatens to kill him if she dies early or if he tries to kill her, despite her knowledge that doing so will cause her own death.&lt;ref name="HTR65"/&gt;

[[Image:Raitoindeepthought.PNG|right|thumb|Light as he appears in the anime.]]

Although Light originally had good intentions, he was "very conceited", with a "warped ... desire to be godlike", bearing love for his family, and intending to transform the world into "a better place".&lt;ref name="HTR65"&gt;"How to Think." ''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohba also states that Light, "uncompromising" when achieving his ideals, "sullied" himself by using the Death Note and that his actions "may have been the result of the purity within him" prior to obtaining the Death Note.&lt;ref name="LightHTRProfile9"&gt;''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This purity is demonstrated in Light's personality shift after he temporarily relinquishes the Death Note to ward off suspicion. Losing his memories as Kira along with ownership of the notebook, Light demonstrates compassion, a reluctance to manipulate others and an intense unwillingness to kill. Once his memories return, however, he reverts back to his ruthless Kira persona and remains that way until his death. Nevertheless, Ohba states that Light never lost his love for his family since he viewed them as righteous people.&lt;ref name="Tsugumi Ohba 2007 Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaiaonline.com/guilds/viewtopic.php?t=21396363|work=Translated Interview from The Star featured in Gaia Online|title=Tsugumi Ohba Interview|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Wolk of ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' describes Light as "coldly manipulative", "egomaniacal", and "an unrepentant [[serial killer]], a butcher on an enormous scale" who is not "a [[Freddy Krueger]], a monster who represents pure evil, or a [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[demon]]ic symbol of his age". Wolk describes Light as "the good guy, more or less" who genuinely believes that he holds "the moral high ground".&lt;ref name="WolkSalon"&gt;Wolk, Douglas. "[http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/07/26/death_note/print.html Death strip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510123142/http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/07/26/death_note/print.html |date=2008-05-10 }}." ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]''. July 26, 2007. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about which character was most similar to himself, Ohba indicated Near and "maybe Light." Regarding Light, Ohba cited "because I did well in school."&lt;ref name="HTR194"&gt;''Death Note 13: How to Read''. ''[[VIZ Media]]''. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Travis Fickett of ''[[IGN]]'' describes Light as a "[[Psychopathy|sociopath]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fickett, Travis. "[http://tv.ign.com/articles/788/788502p1.html Death Note: "Rebirth" Review]." ''[[IGN]]''. May 15, 2007. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Tom S. Pepirium of IGN describes Light as "brilliant, but disturbed".&lt;ref&gt;Pepirium, Tom S.

Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolk describes Light's ideal world, a "totalitarian" place "ruled by a propagandistic TV channel and an arbitrary secret executioner". Wolk said that Ohba sometimes suggests that this world is "in some ways a better, happier world than ours".&lt;ref name="WolkSalon"/&gt; Jolyon Baraka Thomas describes Light's vision of justice as "impure": "[His] supercilious attempt to save society from itself is both self-aggrandizing and cruel".&lt;ref name="JJRS_Thomas_2012"/&gt; Toshiki Inoue, the series organizer for the ''Death Note'' anime, describes Light as a "child whose wish happens to come true".&lt;ref name="Passionsdreams"&gt;"Passion and dreams."

===Critical reception===

Tom S. Pepirium of [[IGN]] said that he felt surprised when he learned that some viewers, while watching the series, wanted Light to emerge as the victor of the storyline; Pepirium added that his wife said that she was "kinda rooting for Light". Pepirium compared wanting Light to win to "cheering for [[Kevin Spacey]] at the end of ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Pepirium, Tom S. "[http://tv.ign.com/articles/839/839431p1.html Death Note: "Overcast" Review]". ''[[IGN]]''. December 4, 2007. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Pepirium added that [[Brad Swaile]], Light's English-language voice actor, "nails" the "difficult" task of making Light "both likable and hated".&lt;ref&gt;Pepirium, Tom S.

Tetsuro Araki, the director of the anime, said that he felt an urge to support and cheer for Light. Araki added that Light would have used and killed him if he was one of Light's friends, but the director still believed that Light is "''that'' interesting" and therefore he would have felt an attraction towards Light.&lt;ref name="Passionsdreams"/&gt;

Pauline Wong of ''OtakuZone'' had her opinions of the film portrayal of Light Yagami published in ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', a [[Malaysia]]n newspaper. In it, Wong says that the "very ''[[bishie]]''-status-worthy" Fujiwara portrayed Light with "aplomb and near-perfection, right down to the evil little smile". Kitty Sensei, quoted in the same Malaysian article, says that the portrayal of Light in the film is "very faithful to the manga's".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/12/movies/15948203&amp;sec=movies Death rocks]".

Men start disappearing from the factory on their way to [[Sysert]], and a young brave girl Dunyakha goes looking for them. Unfortunately that area is packed with wolves. One of the Sysert miners tells Dunyakha that there might be a safe passage near the Galyan swamp, because "The Earth Cat roams from Galyan to [[Dumnaya]]". The Earth Cat, a creature with fiery ears that lives in the sands where copper mixes with gold, doesn't harm people, but wolves are afraid of it. Dunyakha does as she is told. Once the wolves start surrounding her, she sees two blow flames that look like cat's ears. She realizes that they are The Earth Cat's ears, and the Cat itself moves beneath the ground. Dunyakha follows the flames and that decision saves her life.

The main character of the ''skaz'' is the son of Katyenka and Danilo the Craftsman from "[[The Stone Flower]]" and "The Mountain Craftsman". Katyenka marries Danilo and gives birth to eight boys. When the landlord doubles the family's [[quit-rent]], the third son Mitya becomes a stone craftsman. He proves to be a talented worker, quickly surpassing his teacher. One day he decides to make a tree branch from inexpensive stone (mostly [[Serpentine group|serpentine]]), drawing inspiration from a [[gooseberry]] bush. The resulting gooseberry twig looks incredibly well-made and lifelike, and the landlord wants it for his daughter. He takes it by force, but quickly finds out that Mitya used the cheapest of stones for it. The landlord feels offended that the serpentine would touch his daughter and steps on the twig, crushing it to dust. Mitya disappears from the village.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">Traditional '''Māori poetry''' was always sung or chanted,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/maori-myths-and-traditions/2 "Literary Forms"], B.G. Biggs, ''[[Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]'', (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meter (music)|musical rhythm]]s rather than linguistic devices served to distinguish it from [[prose]]. There is a large store of traditional chants and songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-CowYest-t1-body-d1-d8.html "Chapter VIII. — The Poetry of the Maori"], ''The Maori: Yesterday and To-day'', James Cowan, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhyme]] or [[assonance]] were not devices used by the  [[Māori people|Māori]]; only when a given text is sung or chanted will the [[metre (poetry)|metre]] become apparent. The lines are indicated by features of the [[Māori music|music]]. The language of [[poetry]] tends to differ stylistically from prose. Typical features of [[poetic diction]] are the use of synonyms or contrastive opposites, and the repetition of key words. As with poetry in other languages: "Archaic words are common, including many which have lost any specific meaning and acquired a religious mystique. Abbreviated, sometimes cryptic utterances and the use of certain grammatical constructions not found in prose are also common" (Biggs 1966:447&amp;ndash;448).

The '''National Theatre,''' located in [[Budapest]] originally opened in 1837. Since then, it has occupied several locations, including the original building at Kerepesi Street, the ''People's Theatre'' at [[Blaha Lujza tér (Budapest Metro)|Blaha Lujza Square]], as well as Hevesi Sándor Square, its longest temporary location. It currently occupies the National Theatre building, which opened March 15, 2002.

==History==
[[File:Nemzeti szinhaz old.jpg|left|thumb|The original building at Kerepesi Street]]
[[File:Budapest anno - Nemzeti Színház.jpg|left|thumb|The ''People's Theatre'', before its demolition]]
The concept of a national theatre in Budapest was born at the turn of the 18th-19th century, promoted by influential thinkers including [[Ferenc Kazinczy]] and Baron [[István Széchenyi]]. Széchenyi was a major figure in Hungary's reform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/354.html|title=The Emergence of a Hungarian Reform Movement in the 'Two Sister Countries' and Its Organization in Transylvania|website=mek.oszk.hu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He dreamed of a great building on the bank of the [[Danube]] that would operate in the form of a joint-stock company. He proposed his plans in his 1832 pamphlet, ''A Magyar Játékszínről''.

The [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Hungarian Parliament]] made the decision to move forward with a national theatre in its 41st article of 1836. Led by [[Antal Grassalkovich]], construction began in 1835 on Kerepesi Street. With a company assembled in the previous four years by András Fáy and Gábor Döbrentei (playing in the [[Court Theatre of Buda]]), the theatre opened on August 22, 1837, under the name ''Pesti Magyar Színház'' (Hungarian Theatre of Pest). Its goals were to give birth to the national drama and to showcase classics of world literature. Nationalized in 1840, the name was changed to the National Theatre, which it still holds today.

[[File:Nemzszinh-spiralcivertan.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography of the Park]]The National Theatre building was demolished in the 1900s. The company moved to the ''People's Theatre'' at Blaha Lujza Square in 1908. In the following decades, the company was only a tenant of ''People's Theatre'', and the building's state continually deteriorated. In 1963, authorities decided to demolish it, citing metro line construction as the reasoning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.mandadb.hu/cikk/682907/Demolished_memories_lost_buildings__Budapest|title=Demolished memories, lost buildings – Budapest|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Operation ceased one year later, and the building was demolished on April 23, 1965. The company transferred to the renovated ''Petőfi Theatre'' (today is known as Thália), in Nagymező Street. Two years later, it relocated again to the former ''Magyar Theatre'' in Hevesi Sándor Square.

After the demolition of the ''People's Theatre,'' a proposal was made to build the new theater in the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]], at Felvonulási Square. An international design contest for the new theatre was held in 1965. No first place prize was awarded, and instead the second place prize was shared between the plans of Miklós Hofer and Jan Bogusławski - Bohdan Golebiewski. The planning, led by Hofer, stretched on for the better part of two decades. The building permit was finally granted in 1985, but the construction work went no further than chopping down a few trees. In 1988, a tender was held for a new location and Engels Square (today Erzsébet Square) was chosen. Another decade passed without any progress. In 1996, Parliament agreed to move on to the next phase. However, the project was delayed again due to political quarrels over the next several years. The project resumed again with architect [[Ferenc Bán]] being declared the winner, but the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1998|newly elected government]] stopped the work, finding it too costly.

In 1999, ministry commissioner György Schwajda commissioned [[Mária Siklós]] to make plans for a building at a new location Essenza, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hetek.hu/belfold/199903/ujabb_perpatvar_a_nemzeti_korul |title=New quarrels around the National Theatre |work=Hetek.hu |date=1999-03-06 |accessdate=2009-10-11 |language=Hungarian }}&lt;/ref&gt; the bank of the Danube. This decision was met with anger from the Hungarian architect community, and a bid was held. György Vadász's won the bid. He did not modify Siklós's plans further,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20000703vadasz_2.html |title=György Vadász will likely quit from designing the National Theatre |date=2000-07-03 |accessdate=2009-10-11 |work=Origo |language=Hungarian }}&lt;/ref&gt; and construction began with Siklós's plans on September 14, 2000. The new National Theatre opened on March 15, 2002, Hungary's [[National day|National Day]].

==The New National Theatre==
[[File:Oldnemzeti.jpg|thumb|Memorial of the Old National Theatre in the Park]]
The new National Theatre is on the bank of the Danube in the [[Ferencváros]] district, situated on  Soroksári road, [[Grand Boulevard (Budapest)|Grand Boulevard]], and [[Rákóczi Bridge]].  It is a five minute walk from the [[Line H7 (Budapest HÉV)|Csepel HÉV]] (suburban railway). The Memorial of the Old National Theatre is located on the National Theatre grounds.

The theatre is 20,844 square meters (224,362.95 square feet), including an open-air stage. Functionally, it can be separated into three parts:
# The central unit, including the rounded auditorium and studio stage;
# The gangways, public areas, and horseshoe-shaped servicing areas;
# The surrounding park, which contains numerous memorials commemorating the Hungarian drama and film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nemzetiszinhaz.hu/en/about-the-theatre|title=About the theatre {{!}} Nemzeti Színház|last=|first=|date=|website=nemzetiszinhaz.hu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The nearby [[Palace of Arts (Budapest)|Palace of Arts]] was opened in 2005.

=== Directors ===
[[György Schwajda]] became the first director of the theater. He signed the "company's core" and founded the title ''Actor of the Nation'' with a financial reward. He resigned in the summer of 2002. After his resignation, Thomas Jordan won the bid to become the new director. He organized the public from the countryside and debuted the many counties of Hungary on stage. Jordan stepped down in 2008 and Robert Alföldi took over. Where Jordan advocated support for the nation-rearing, folk theatre, Alföldi opposed its efforts. In 2013, Attila Vidnyanszky missed an opportunity to lead the National Theater.

The '''North Halmahera languages''' are the [[Papuan languages]] of [[Halmahera]] and neighboring islands in [[Indonesia]]. The best known North Halmaheran language is [[Ternate language|Ternate]] (50&amp;nbsp;000 native speakers), which is a regional [[lingua franca]] and which, along with [[Tidore language|Tidore]], were the languages of the rival medieval [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]] and [[Sultanate of Tidore|Tidore]] sultanates, famous for their role in the [[spice trade]].

==Classification==

The classification used here is that of Voorhoeve 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Voorhoeve, C.L. 1988. The languages of the northern Halmaheran stock. Papers in New Guinea Linguistics, no. 26., 181-209. (Pacific Linguistics A-76). Canberra: Australian National University.&lt;/ref&gt;

West Makian is divergent, perhaps due to Austronesian influence. It was once classified as an [[Austronesian language]].

There is a degree of mutual intelligibility between the Galela–Tobelo languages, and Voorhoeve 1988 considered them dialects of a language he called ''Northeast Halmaheran'', though most speakers consider them to be distinct languages. ''Ethnologue'' adds [[Kao language|Kao]], which it classifies as Sahu but notes may be a marginal dialect of Pagu.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26185">Because [[Canada]] has, for over two centuries, contained both English- and French-speakers, the question of the language used in the administration of public affairs has always been a sensitive issue.

Among the aspect of this issue that have excited public attention from time to time are: 
*the perception of fairness or unfairness in hiring and promoting speakers of one official language over speakers of the other;
*the choice of one language over the other for meetings, documents, and internal memoranda (which are sometimes collectively characterized as the work “environment”);
*the promotion of bilingual job candidates over people who only speak only one or the other of the two official languages;
*the availability (or lack of availability) of language training for public servants, who cannot advance without the ability to speak both languages;
*the costs associated with language-based hiring and promotion practices, including the practice of paying a “bilingual bonus” to public servants capable of speaking both official languages;
*the need to provide government services to some Canadians in English, and to others in French.

==Ratio of native English-speakers to native French-speakers==

The issue of proportional hiring and promotion of speakers of both official languages has been an issue in Canadian politics since before Confederation. Members of each linguistic group have, at different times in the country’s history, complained of injustice when their group have been represented, in public service hiring and promotion, in numbers less than would be justified by their proportion of the national population.

For the greater part of Canada’s history, French-speakers were underrepresented, and English-speakers were overrepresented in the ranks of the public service. This disproportion became more pronounced in the more senior ranks of the Public Service. However, this trend has reversed itself in recent decades. Today, French is the first official language of 23% of Canada's population,&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada Census 2011 data. "http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/2011003/tbl/tbl3_1-1-eng.cfm"&lt;/ref&gt; with 29.2% of Public Service of Canada employees identifying French as their first official language,&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Annual Report on Official Languages 2010-2011. "http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/res/stats/demo11-eng.asp#toc01.2.c"&lt;/ref&gt; including 32% of management-level jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Annual Report on Official Languages 2010-2011. "http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/reports-rapports/ol-lo/10-11/arol-ralo/arol-ralo06-eng.asp#toc5.0"&lt;/ref&gt;

The first high-profile complaint of preferential hiring took place in 1834. One of the [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]] of the [[Lower Canada|Lower Canadian]] House of Assembly drew attention to the fact that French Canadians, who at the time were 88% of the colony's population, held only 30% of the posts in the 157-member colonial civil service. Moreover, the resolution stated, French Canadians were, "for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those [British immigrants] who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices...."&lt;ref&gt;'''Resolution 75.''' ''Resolved, That the number of the Inhabitants of the country being about 600,000, those of French origin are about 525,000, and those of British or other origin 75,000; and that the establishment of the civil government of Lower Canada, for the year 1832, accordingly to the yearly returns made by the Provincial Administration, for the information of the British Parliament, contained the names of 157 officers and others receiving salaries, who are apparently of British or foreign origin and the names of 47 who are, apparently, natives of the country, of French origin; that this statement does not exhibit the whole disproportion which exists in the distribution of the public money and power, the latter class being, for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices; that the accumulation of many of the best paid and most influential, and at the same time incompatible, offices in the same person, which is forbidden by the laws and by sound policy, exists especially for the benefit of the former class; and that two-thirds of the persons included in the last commission of the peace issued in the province, are apparently of British or foreign origin, and one-third only of French origin.''&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[responsible government]] in the 1840s, the power to make civil service appointments was transferred to elected politicians, who had a strong incentive to ensure that French Canadian voters did not feel that they were being frozen out of hiring and promotions. Although no formal reform of the hiring and promotion process was ever undertaken, the patronage-driven hiring process seems to have produced a more equitable representation of the two language groups. In 1863, the public service of the united [[Province of Canada]] (which included both of the former colonies of [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]]) had grown to include 450 officials at its administrative headquarters. Of these, 161 persons, or about 36%, were French Canadians. However, French-speaking civil servants accounted for only 20% of the total payroll, suggesting that they were mainly confined to the lower ranks of the colonial administration.&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Hodgetts ''Pioneer Public Service: An Administrative History of the United Canadas, 1841-1867.'' Toronto: Canadian Government Series, no. 7, 1955, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between 1867 and the turn of the Twentieth Century, French-Canadians made up about one-third of the Canadian population, and seem also to have represented about one-third of civil service appointments at junior levels, although they had only about half that much representation at most senior level.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Forsey]] writes: “In the Dominion Civil Service, Côté’s ''Political Appointments'', 1867-1895, shows that, over that period, eliminating duplications, the French Canadians had rather over a third of the official of the House and of the two Dominion Courts; rather less than a third of other officials of the rank of Deputy Minister and, of the officials from Chief Clerk up to Deputy Minister rather less than one-seventh.”
Source—Eugene Forsey, ''Freedom and Order: Collected Essays.'' Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1974, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, it seems to have been the case that throughout the entire period between Confederation and the introduction of merit-based hiring and promotion in 1919, the percentage of French-speakers in the civil service relatively closely matched their percentage of the Canadian population because French-Canadians occupied a more-or-less proportionate share of cabinet posts, and they appointed public servants who were personally loyal to them. This so-called "[[spoils system]]" ensured a rough equity between members of the two language groups. A quarter-century after this system had been abolished, it was summarized as follows in a submission to the 1946 [[Royal Commission on Administrative Classifications in the Civil Service]]:

{{cquote|Before 1919, positions in the bureaucracy were distributed, in large measure, under a patronage system (spoils system) even though some efforts at reform had been put in place and had introduced a degree of permanence in head offices. French-speaking statesmen, just like their [English-speaking] colleagues, were therefore able to obtain their share of the patronage. General administration was not very complicated in those days and ministers could personally take charge of administering the internal organization of their respective departments, as it was possible to personally know every one of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Chambre de Commerce du District de Montréal, ''Mémoire soumis à la Commission Royale d'Enquête sur le Service Civil Fédéral''. April, 1946, p. 14. The original passage is in French, but the words "spoils system" are in English in the original.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1918, just before the reforms began, the percentage of francophones in the [[Public Service of Canada|federal civil service]] stood at just under 22%. The drop in the percentage of French-speakers was in part due to the fact that the proportion of Canadians who were French-speaking was gradually declining; in the 1921 census, persons of French origin were down to 27.9% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Joy, ''Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992, p. 121 (Table 20).&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist]] government then in power had almost no representation in Quebec, which meant that for several years there were no French-Canadian ministers appointing and promoting their fellow French-speakers.

The percentage of French-speakers would, however, drop much further as a result of the replacement of a patronage-based appointment system with a merit-based system that was largely based upon the ability to perform efficiently in English. By 1946, according to figures presented in the House of Commons, native speakers of French had declined to only 13% of public service posts.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, House of Commons Debates, 1946, 2nd Session, IV, 3520.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, French-speakers represented slightly under 30% of the Canadian population.&lt;ref&gt;In the 1941 census, French was the mother tongue of 29.2% of Canada's population. See Richard Joy, ''Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1992, p. 120 (Table 19).&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have represented the low point, in terms of inequitably low representation for Francophones within the Public Service; by 1964, French-speakers had risen to 21.5% of the Public Service (which itself had grown to 137,000 officials, meaning that 29,500 French-speakers were employed by the federal government).&lt;ref&gt;Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism’', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969), Table 49, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this represented a substantial improvement, French-speakers at this time represented about 28% of Canada’s population, and therefore continued to be underrepresented. Moreover, French-Canadians continued to be grouped at the bottom of the seniority scale: They represented 23.7% of junior employees earning less than $4,000 per year, but only 10.4% of senior officials with earnings in the highest category (over $15,000).&lt;ref&gt;Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism'', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969), Figure 9, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, the issue of Canada’s seemingly perpetual inability to create an equitable distribution of jobs in the country’s rapidly expanding public service was becoming a key grievance underlying [[Quebec nationalism]].  In 1961, a [[Glasscoe Commission|Royal Commission studying the structure of the federal bureaucracy]] organized a special committee to study the issue of bilingualism within the Public Service. The Commission’s 1962 report included recommendations that the federal government “adopt active measures to develop bilingual capacities among its employees on a selective basis,” and that it more actively recruit qualified French Canadians who would have the potential to advance to the senior ranks of the federal administration.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Government Organization'', vol. I (Ottawa, 1962), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part on the basis of this recommendation, the government of Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] established a [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], which made language reform within the public service one of its highest priorities.  Book III of the Royal Commission’s multi-volume report, published in 1969, recommended a radical redesign of the Public Service of Canada, in order to establish full equality between the two official languages in the federal administration, and a permanently equitable distribution of jobs, at all levels of seniority, between French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;Canada, ''Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism'', vol. III, ''The Work World'' (Ottawa, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent increase in ratio of native French-speakers===
Since the report of the Royal Commission in 1969, the percentage of Francophones in the public service of Canada has increased, and the percentage of Anglophones has decreased.  Both Francophones and Anglophones are overrepresented in the public service due to the number of Canadians who speak neither English nor French.

When looking at public service positions in various regions of the country, the same trend has occurred; however it is much less pronounced outside of the national capital region surrounding Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec.

===Increased Francophone representation in management positions===

===Increased number of ‘bilingual imperative’ positions===
Positions in the public service are classified in four ways, depending on the required linguistic capacity of the candidate for the position: bilingual imperative, English essential, French essential or either French or English essential. The bilingual imperative category is further broken down into the level of both languages the candidate is required to speak.  Since 1989 there has been a sharp increase in the number of positions classified as ‘bilingual imperative’ and a sharp decrease in the number of positions open to unilingual Canadians.

==Current situation==
Today, the built-in barriers to the hiring and promotion of francophones have been overcome. French-speakers ceased to be underrepresented in the Public Service in 1978, and the percentage of public servants who are francophones has been growing steadily ever since. At the management level, French-speakers ceased to be under-represented in 1995. There is now a growing over-representation of persons with French as their first official language in the Public Service. In 2007, francophones occupied 31.5% of positions in the core public administration, and 26.9% in institutions subject to the ''Official Languages Act'', overall.&lt;ref name=2006Report/&gt; Bilingualism is desirable for politicians; [[John Turner]]'s fluency in both English and French, for example, helped him become [[leader of the Liberal Party of Canada|leader of the Liberal Party]] and Prime Minister in 1984.&lt;ref name="martin19840618"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/18/world/man-in-the-news-new-leader-for-canada-john-napier-turner.html | title=New Leader for Canada: John Napier Turner | work=The New York Times | date=1984-06-18 | accessdate=11 September 2015 | author=Martin, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, positions in the core public administration broke down as follows:

"Bilingual" - 40.2%
"English Essential" - 51.2%
"French Essential" - 4.0%
"English or French Essential" - 4.4%&lt;ref name=2006Report&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report on Official Languages 2006-2007|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/rp/0607ol05-eng.asp|publisher=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|date=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2008-09 annual report, the Commissioner for Official Languages wrote, "A vast majority of federal institutions have yet to create a workplace where their employees feel comfortable using either official language and are encouraged to do so." He identified the following problem areas:

* "French is not used as much as it should be as a language of work in federal offices located in the National Capital Region and outside Quebec."
* "French does not have its rightful place in communications between the federal government’s head offices and its regional offices in Quebec."
* "English remains underused as a language of work in the Quebec offices of federal institutions."&lt;ref name="2008Report-chap2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/html/ar_ra_2008_09_p7_e.php|title=Chapter 2: Vision, Leadership and Commitment: Fundamentals of the Full Implementation of the Act|date=2009-05-25|work=Annual Report 2008-2009 |publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of language proficiency on the part of some managers may contribute to the situation. The Commissioner wrote in his report: "Some managers hinder the use of the minority language, either because they are not proficient enough in the language or because they hesitate to use it. Similarly, Francophones fearing that their professional contribution will not be fully recognized tend to work in English when their superiors do not use French daily and do not stress the importance of using it."&lt;ref name="2008Report-chap2"/&gt;

In contemporary [[Japanese culture]], '''otokonoko''' (男の娘 ''Otoko no ko'', "male daughter" or "male girl"), or '''''otoko no musume''''', are men who [[cross-dress]] as women.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 26 May 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ashcraft|first=Brian|title=What Is Japan's Fetish This Week?

The term originated in Japanese [[manga]]&lt;ref name="Vice 8 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=OTOKONOKO : DES GARÇONS TROP MIGNONNES|url=https://www.vice.com/fr/vice-japon/otokonoko-des-garcon-trop-mignonnes|accessdate=5 January 2014|newspaper=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Internet culture in the 2000s, but the concept reflects a broad range of earlier traditions and examples of male [[Drag (clothing)|drag-wearing]] in Japan, such as ''[[onnagata]]'' in [[kabuki]] theater, and in the career of cross-dressing entertainer [[Akihiro Miwa]]. ''Otokonoko'' is a play on the word 男の子, also pronounced ''otokonoko'' and meaning "boy". Its popularity increased around 2009, with the rise of dedicated [[maid café]]s, fashion stores, cosmetic products, and a range of popular media in the ''[[otaku]]'' culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dot.asahi.com/wa/2014053000082.html|title=「男の娘」「女装子」と呼ばれる人々 “中性化受け入れ”円満な夫婦の鍵 〈週刊朝日〉|last=森友|first=ひい子|date=2 June 2014|work=AERA dot.

The concept of ''otokonoko'' does not directly correspond to a particular [[sexual identity]] or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Otokonoko'' may be of any [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Kotaku 26 May 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice 8 August 2013" /&gt;

By extension, ''otokonoko'' is also a genre of media and fiction about cross-dressing men, aimed at a male audience. It is part of the spectrum of ''[[Shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' entertainment (targeted at young boys) and ''[[seinen]]'' entertainment (targeted at young men), and often contains erotic or romantic elements. ''Otokonoko'' characters have also begun to appear in mainstream Japanese popular entertainment such as [[manga]], [[anime]] and video games.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 26 May 2011" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4006">'''Passion gap''' or '''Cape Flats smile''' is a dental modification originating in [[Cape Flats]], [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] in which people deliberately remove the upper front teeth (maxillary [[incisor]]s) for fashion and status. The practice is popular among lower class [[Coloureds]]&lt;!-- THIS DOES NOT MEAN "PEOPLE OF COLOR", IT IS THE PROPER NAME OF A SPECIFIC SOCIAL GROUP IN SA --&gt; and has occasionally been done by [[White South African|White]] and [[Chinese South Africans]] in the area.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=vice/&gt;

==Reception==

For many years, Cape Town residents had their upper front teeth extracted due to regional cultural fashion. A 2003 study performed by the [[University of Cape Town]] found that the main reasons for extracting teeth were fashion and peer pressure followed by gangsterism and medical purposes.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The dental modification is particularly popular in the Cape Flats section of Cape Town. In an interview of 2,167 Coloured&lt;!-- THIS DOES NOT MEAN "PEOPLE OF COLOR", IT IS THE PROPER NAME OF A SPECIFIC SOCIAL GROUP IN SA --&gt; people in the Western Cape, 41% have had teeth extracted. Of those who have undergone the procedure, 44.8% were male. Children as young as 11 have had their front teeth extracted for aesthetics.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

Other reasons for a passion gap include the belief of improved [[oral sex]] and kissing. Another belief is that fishermen extract their teeth to whistle louder to one another. Though the practice is still popular in the region today,{{when|date=March 2018}} perception is changing. Some employers specifically forbid the display of a passion gap.&lt;ref name=news24/&gt;

==History==
Dental modification in [[Southern Africa]] has been documented for 1500 years. Other forms of dental modification are more prevalent in the northern regions of Africa. Deliberate incisor removal in Western Cape remains an exception.&lt;ref name=ncbi/&gt;

The current trend of passion gaps started in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

==See also==
*[[Body modification]]

==Medical implications==

While there are no specific medical problems caused by aesthetic dental extraction, the passion gap is often described by [[anaesthesiologists]] in the region as a potential cause of difficult [[intubation]].  Lack of normal dentition is known to be associated with difficulty in managing the airway, and a passion gap can result in the [[laryngoscope]] blade moving into the artificial gap between the teeth, reducing the available space to pass an [[endotracheal tube]] and running the risk of lacerating the entrotracheal tube cuff on the remaining adjacent incisor or canine tooth.

The '''Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag''' ({{lang-fil|Panunumpa ng Katapatan sa Watawat ng Pilipinas}}) is the pledge to the [[Flag of the Philippines|flag]] of the [[Philippines]].  It is one of two national pledges, the other being the [[Patriotic Oath (Philippines)|Patriotic Oath]], which is the Philippine national pledge.

The Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag is recited at flag ceremonies immediately after the Patriotic Oath or, if the Patriotic Oath is not recited, after the [[Lupang Hinirang|national anthem]].

The pledge was legalized under Executive Order No. 343, finalized by the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] from a draft prepared by the [[Commission on the Filipino Language]], approved by then-[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] on [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]] (June 12), 1996,&lt;ref name=EO343&gt;{{cite web

[[Music]] is considered to be in the [[public domain]] if it meets any of the following criteria:
*All rights have expired.
*The authors have explicitly put a work into the public domain.
*There never were copyrights.

If a piece of music does not fall within public domain and is under copyright, then it is unlawful to reproduce, perform, distribute, or create a new version of that music without a proper license.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pdinfo.com/copyright-law/copyright-and-public-domain.php|title=Copyright and Public Domain|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Public Domain Information Project|publisher=Haven Sound, Inc.|access-date=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[compulsory license]] laws, some of these actions may in fact be lawful, but the infringing party would then be liable for any royalty the copyright holder may charge for the use of their work.

==Background==
In the [[United States]], any musical works published before 1922, in addition to those voluntarily placed in public domain, exist in the public domain. In most other countries, music generally enters the public domain in a period of fifty to seventy-five years after the composer's death. (Public domain rights must be verified for each individual country.) It is important to note the distinction between "musical works" (sheet music and other compositions) and "sound recordings" (audio files, CDs, records), as virtually all sound recordings will remain copyrighted until 2067 unless it is explicitly placed into the public domain by its creators or rights holders, or it is made by an employee or officer of the United States government acting in an official capacity. Before the Music Modernization Act, the status of copyright on sound recordings in the United States from before such copyrights were nationalized 1972 was somewhat nebulous. The copyrights granted prior to that were considered a state issue and, even if no state law provided for it, some courts established an extra-legal [[common law copyright]], the exact nature of which was inconsistently applied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pdinfo.com/Copyright-Law/Public-Domain-Sound-Recordings.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union and Canada, sound recordings were copyrighted for fifty years until 2013. On January 1, 2013, [[the Beatles]]' single "[[Love Me Do]]" entered the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-beatles-love-me-do-hits-the-public-domain-in-europe-202736&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2013, European sound recordings are now protected for 70 years, which is not retroactive.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law360.com/articles/492241/a-look-at-europe-s-new-music-copyright-law&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Canada changed the copyright length to 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6612571/canada-offically-extends-copyright-term-to-70-years "Canada Offically {{sic|nolink=yes}} Extends Copyright Term to 70 Years"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2016, a court ruled that "[[Happy Birthday to You]]" was in the public domain, and [[Warner/Chappell Music]] was required to pay $14 million to the song's licensees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/warner-music-pays-14-million-863120&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, president [[Donald Trump]] signed the [[Music Modernization Act]], which will bring sound recordings into the public domain either 95 years after they were released or 120 years after they were recorded, whichever comes first.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/new-music-modernization-act-has-major-fix-older-recordings-will-belong-public&lt;/ref&gt; Songs recorded before 1923 will expire on October 11, 2021; recordings made between 1923 and 1946 will be protected for 100 years after release; recordings made between 1947 and 1956 will be protected for 110 years; and all recordings made fron 1957 to February 15, 1972 will have their protection terminate on February 15, 2067.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2018/11/music-modernization-act-whats-in-it-why-is-it-in-there-is-it-a-good-thing.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources/projects==
Inherently, all historical musical works (pre-1922) are public domain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Classical sheet music, for example, is widely available for free use and reproduction. Some more current works are also available for free use through public works projects such as [[Internet Archive]]. This and similar projects aim to preserve and make readily available thousands of public domain music files, many of which have been recorded by projects dedicated to recording music for public use.

'''''River of Gods''''' is a 2004 [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by British writer [[Ian McDonald (author)|Ian McDonald]]. It depicts a futuristic India in 2047, a century after its [[Partition of India|independence from Britain]], characterized both by ancient traditions and advanced technologies such as [[artificial intelligence]]s, robots and [[nanotechnology]]. The novel won the [[British Science Fiction Award]] in 2004&lt;ref name="WWE-2004"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for a [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel follows a number of different characters' viewpoints on and around the date of 15 August 2047, the centenary of India's partition and independence from the [[British Raj|colonial British Raj]]. This future India has become [[balkanized]] into a number of smaller competing states, such as [[Awadh]], Bharat, and Bangla. The global information network is now inhabited by artificial intelligences, [[phonetics|phonetically]] called ''aeais'' in the novel, of varying levels of intelligence.

Aeais higher than level 2.5 (able to pass the [[Turing test]] and imitate humans) are banned, and their destruction ("excommunication") is the responsibility of "Krishna Cops", like Mr. Nandha. While some pockets of the subcontinent are still steeped in ancient tradition and values, mainstream culture is replete with aeais in TV entertainment and robotic swarms in defense. During such a time, Ranjit Ray steps down from his control of Ray Power, a key energy company, and the responsibility falls on his son Vishram Ray. The playboy Vishram is struggling to make it on his own as a [[stand-up comedian]] in Scotland when he is flown back to [[Varanasi]] to assume this role, for which he finds himself terribly ill-equipped but eventually surprisingly effective. He learns that his company is working on harvesting [[zero-point energy]] from other universes, and sees the [[particle collider]] built by his father with the help of Odeco, a clandestine investment firm.

After a prolonged drought, a severe water shortage threatens to jeopardize the peace between the subcontinental states. To avert this crisis, governments are melting [[glacier]]s and modifying natural systems. To take advantage of the unrest, a [[Hindu]] fundamentalist leader named N.K Jeevanji organises a "rath yatra" on a spectacular [[juggernaut]]. He starts releasing key information to the press via Najia Askarzadah, an ambitious Swedish-Afghan reporter with a desire to be part of history as it is being made.

Lisa Durnau notices an apocalyptic crisis brewing in Alterre, a simulated evolution of earth created by AI scientist Thomas Lull, who is currently hiding in a South Indian coastal village. While Lisa is sent into space to investigate an [[asteroid]], Thomas Lull runs into Aj, a girl with mysterious powers that allow her to see into people's lives, pasts and futures. He decides to follow her and protect her during her quest to find her own true identity, but it is soon revealed that Aj's powers extend beyond mere mortals, when she brings a robot army to a halt with the raise of a hand.

Tal is a beautiful nute (of [[neutral gender]]) involved in the designing team of India's greatest [[soap opera|"soapi"]], ''Town &amp; Country'', some of the main stars of which are not human actors, but aeais. Tal falls prey to a conspiracy that compromises the career of Shaheen Badoor Khan, Private Secretary to the Prime Minister Sajida Rana, leading to her assassination and the fall of the government. All this leads to riots and popular fury against [[Muslim]]s and [[transsexual]]s across Varanasi.

Lisa Durnau discovers that at the center of the mysterious asteroid is an 8-billion-year-old grey sphere, possibly a [[black hole]] remnant, or an alien artifact from another civilization. This "Tabernacle" communicates a message to the scientists, and this leads Lisa to India to find Thomas Lull, who alone can explain this phenomenon.

==Explanation of title==
The title refers to the sacred [[Ganges River]], which is analogous to the unceasing flow of time in Hindu mythology. Characters visit the river during the novel, and a large portion of the action takes place in the holy city of [[Varanasi]], which is traditionally associated with the Ganges, and is the focal point in the story.

* '''Vishram Ray''' is an aspiring stand-up comedian who finds himself controlling the energy giant Ray Power, after his father's sudden retirement into [[sanyas]].
* '''Tal''' is a genderless nute working as a set designer for India's most ubiquitous tivi soapi - Town &amp; Country, watched by millions.

==History==

[[Image:Scva.jpg|thumb|right|Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]]The Sainsbury Research Unit (SRU) had its origins in 1984, when Sir [[Robert Sainsbury]] and Lady Lisa Sainsbury had the idea of creating a department in the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]]  to be an academic complement to the [[Africa]]n, [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American]] material in their collection.

The SRU began operations in 1988 with two faculty, two library/support staff and three MA students. By 2011 there were six faculty, six library/support staff, eight MAs, fifteen research students, visiting fellows, research associates and many dozens of alumni contributing to its fields of study. 

The SRU hosts [https://web.archive.org/web/20110405023114/http://www.sru.uea.ac.uk/research-symposia.php symposia], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110405023114/http://www.sru.uea.ac.uk/research-symposia.php workshops] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110405022917/http://www.sru.uea.ac.uk/research.php research] projects and has a dedicated [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009103503/http://www.sru.uea.ac.uk/library.php library] also housed in the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts.

{{italic title}}
'''''Salmacida Spolia''''' was the last [[masque]] performed at the English Court before the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]]. Written by Sir [[William Davenant]], with costumes, sets, and stage effects designed by [[Inigo Jones]] and with music by Lewis Richard, it was performed at [[Whitehall Palace]] on 21 January [[1640 in literature|1640]].

In English, the title means "Salmacian spoils," and refers to an ancient Greek legend: a band of barbarians pillaging the Greek city of [[Halicarnassus]] in [[Asia Minor]] are pacified and civilized by drinking from the fountain of [[Salmacis]].&lt;ref&gt;Leapman, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; The masque was intended to convey a message of yielding and pacification, because [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had just ended his eleven-year period of personal rule and called for a new session of [[Parliament]]. In an effort to create an amicable atmosphere for the coming Parliamentary session, several leading aristocratic members of the Parliamentary party were cast in the masque, including [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford]], and [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke]]. (This effort at political theatre quickly proved useless: the Parliament that followed was the famous [[Short Parliament]].)

The masque was unique in that both Charles I and his queen, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], performed in it; the Queen's mother, [[Marie de' Medici]], was in the audience. In the masque, The King "personated" the role of Philogenes ("lover of the people"), a good but misunderstood ruler. Philogenes endures a fierce tempest that features the spirit of Discord, to reach an ensuing prosperous calm. A chariot descends from the cloudy heavens, carrying the personifications Concord and the Good Genius of Great Britain. The Queen, pregnant at the time, also descends from the heavens, "in a transparent brightness of thin exhalations, such as the gods are feigned to descend in."

A complex anti-masque featured, among other characters, quack doctors offering "cures" that can only make the chaos greater&amp;mdash;for example, "Essence of dissimulation to enforce Love" and "An Opiade of the spirit of Muskadine taken in good quantity to bedward, to make one forget his Creditors." The anti-masque figures, as shown in Jones's surviving sketches, were "bizarrely dressed, physically deformed, and even obscene...one of them is equipped with an enormous erect penis...."&lt;ref&gt;Raylor, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The King dispels evil influences from a "golden throne surrounded by palm trees and heroic statues."&lt;ref&gt;Leapman, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

The masque featured elaborate dancing, and the sophisticated [[special effects]] that were Jones's specialty: for example,

:"[storm and gale, etc., and:] in the midst was a globe of the Earth, which at an instant falling on fire, was turned into a Fury, her hayre upright, mixt with snakes, her body leane wrinkled and of a swarthy colour [etc.]"  

The masque concluded with an idealized cityscape of London, replete with "magnificent buildings," and with another of Jones's famous and stunning cloudscapes, "a heaven opened full of deities."

The royal couple were highly pleased with the masque, and danced it again on the next [[Shrove Tuesday]]. The public response, such as there was among the restricted audience, appears to have been less positive, as contemporary witnesses reported more "disorder" among the crowd than usual. An element of negativity in the masque's reception was comprehensible, since it attributes the disorder of the realm to the stubbornness of the King's subjects ("the people's giddy fury"), and hints that the royal power won't always be held in check.

Davenant later adapted aspects of ''Salmacida Spolia'' to create his famous ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]],'' the "first English opera."&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

As was often the case, the masque was published in [[book size|quarto]] soon after its performance, in this instance by the bookseller [[Thomas Walkley]].&lt;ref&gt;The quarto is dated "1639," since prior to 1751 the English began the new year on 25 March, not 1 January. See: [[Old Style and New Style dates]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was reprinted in a [[book size|duodecimo]] volume in 1750, by William Rufus Chetwood.

The '''social history of viruses''' describes the influence of [[virus]]es and viral infections on human history. [[Epidemic]]s caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic period]], around 12,000 years ago, when humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities. This allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]]. [[Plant virus|Viruses of plants]] and livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as [[potyvirus]]es of potatoes and [[rinderpest]] of cattle had devastating consequences.

[[Smallpox]] and [[measles]] viruses are among the oldest that infect humans. Having evolved from viruses that infected other animals, they first appeared in humans in  Europe and  North Africa thousands of years ago. The viruses were later carried to the New World by Europeans during the time of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquests]], but the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] had no natural resistance to the viruses and millions of them died during epidemics. Influenza [[pandemic]]s have been recorded since 1580, and they have occurred with increasing frequency in subsequent centuries. The [[1918 flu pandemic|pandemic of 1918–19]], in which 40–50 million died in less than a year, was one of the most devastating in history.

[[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Edward Jenner]] were the first to develop [[vaccine]]s to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the [[electron microscope]] in the 1930s, when the science of [[virology]] gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of [[poliomyelitis]] that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. [[HIV]] is one of the most [[pathogen]]ic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by [[horizontal gene transfer|transferring genes]] across species, play important roles in [[ecosystem]]s and are essential to life.

==In prehistory==
Over the past 50,000–100,000&amp;nbsp;years, as [[modern humans]] increased in numbers and dispersed throughout the world, new infectious diseases emerged, including those caused by viruses.&lt;ref name="pmid15306389"&gt;{{cite journal |author=McMichael AJ |title=Environmental and social influences on emerging infectious diseases: past, present and future |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=359 |issue=1447 |pages=1049–1058 |year=2004 |pmid=15306389 |pmc=1693387 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2004.1480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, humans lived in small, isolated communities, and most epidemic diseases did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett and Armelagos, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smallpox]], which is the most lethal and devastating viral infection in history, first emerged among agricultural communities in India about 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Villarreal, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; The virus, which only infected humans, probably descended from the [[poxviruses]] of rodents.&lt;ref name="pmid19833230"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hughes AL, Irausquin S, Friedman R |title=The evolutionary biology of poxviruses |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=50–59 |year=2010 |pmid=19833230 |pmc=2818276 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2009.10.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567-1348(09)00216-0 |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans probably came into contact with these rodents, and some people became infected by the viruses they carried. When viruses cross this so-called "species barrier", their effects can be severe,&lt;ref name="pmid15617321"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Georges AJ, Matton T, Courbot-Georges MC |title=[Monkey-pox, a model of emergent then reemergent disease] |language=French |journal=Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=12–19 |year=2004 |pmid=15617321 |doi=10.1016/j.medmal.2003.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and humans may have had little [[immune system|natural resistance]]. Contemporary humans lived in small communities, and those who succumbed to infection either died or developed immunity. This [[adaptive immune system|acquired immunity]] is only passed down to offspring temporarily, by [[antibody|antibodies]] in breast milk and other antibodies that cross the  [[placenta]] from the mother's blood to the unborn child's. Therefore, sporadic outbreaks probably occurred in each generation. In about 9000&amp;nbsp;BC, when many people began to settle on the fertile flood plains of the [[River Nile]], the population became dense enough for the virus to maintain a constant presence because of the high concentration of susceptible people.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 6"&gt;Tucker, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Other epidemics of viral diseases that depend on large concentrations of people, such as [[mumps]], [[rubella]] and [[polio]], also first occurred at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neolithic]] age, which began in the Middle East in about 9500&amp;nbsp;BC, was a time when humans became farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This agricultural revolution embraced the development of [[monoculture]] and presented an opportunity for the rapid spread of several species of [[plant virus]]es.&lt;ref name="pmid18575612"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gibbs AJ, Ohshima K, Phillips MJ, Gibbs MJ |title=The prehistory of potyviruses: their initial radiation was during the dawn of agriculture |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=e2523 |year=2008 |pmid=18575612 |pmc=2429970 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002523 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002523 |editor1-last=Lindenbach |editor1-first=Brett |accessdate=19 December 2014|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2523G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The divergence and spread of [[sobemovirus]]es&amp;nbsp;– southern bean mosaic virus&amp;nbsp;– date from this time.&lt;ref name="pmid18704169"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fargette D, Pinel-Galzi A, Sérémé D, Lacombe S, Hébrard E, Traoré O, Konaté G |title=Diversification of rice yellow mottle virus and related viruses spans the history of agriculture from the neolithic to the present |journal=PLOS Pathogens |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e1000125 |year=2008 |pmid=18704169 |pmc=2495034 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000125 |editor1-last=Holmes |editor1-first=Edward C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the [[potyvirus]]es of potatoes, and other fruits and vegetables, began about 6,600 years ago.&lt;ref name="pmid18575612"/&gt;

About 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago the humans who inhabited the lands around the [[Mediterranean basin]] began to domesticate wild animals.

Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp. 40–50&lt;/ref&gt; The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, more ancient, viruses have been less of a threat. [[Herpesviridae|Herpes viruses]] first infected the ancestors of modern humans over 80 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Crawford 225"&gt;Crawford (2000), p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have developed a tolerance to these viruses, and most are infected with at least one species.&lt;ref name="pmid22168421"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=White DW, Suzanne Beard R, Barton ES |title=Immune modulation during latent herpesvirus infection |journal=Immunological Reviews |volume=245 |issue=1 |pages=189–208 |year=2012  |pmid=22168421 |pmc=3243940 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-065X.2011.01074.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records of these milder virus infections are  rare, but it is likely that early hominids suffered from colds, influenza and diarrhoea caused by viruses just as humans do today.

==In antiquity==
[[File:Polio Egyptian Stele.jpg|right|thumb|upright|An [[Egypt]]ian [[stele]] thought to depict a [[poliovirus]] victim, [[18th Dynasty]] (1580–1350 BC)]]

Among the earliest records of a viral infection is an [[Egypt]]ian [[stele]] thought to depict an Egyptian priest from the [[18th Dynasty]] (1580–1350 BC) with a [[foot drop|foot drop deformity]] characteristic of a [[poliovirus]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;Shors, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mummy]] of  [[Siptah]]&amp;nbsp;– a ruler during the 19th&amp;nbsp;Dynasty&amp;nbsp;– shows signs of [[poliomyelitis]], and that of [[Ramesses V]] and some other Egyptian mummies buried over 3000&amp;nbsp;years ago show evidence of smallpox.&lt;ref name="isbn0-226-15556-0"&gt;Donadoni, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; There was an epidemic of smallpox in Athens in 430 BC, in which a quarter of the Athenian army and many of the city's civilians died from the infection.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Measles]] is an old disease, but it was not until the 10th century that the Persian physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (865–925) – known as "Rhazes" – first identified it.&lt;ref name="Levins, pp. 297–298"&gt;Levins, pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; Rhazes used the Arabic name ''hasbah'' for measles. It has had many other names including ''rubeola'' from the [[Latin]] word ''rubeus'', "red", and ''morbilli'', "small plague".&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; The close similarities between measles virus, [[canine distemper|canine distemper virus]] and  [[rinderpest]] virus have given rise to speculation that measles was first transmitted to humans from domesticated dogs or cattle.&lt;ref name="Karlen, p.57"&gt;Karlen, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The measles virus appears to have fully diverged from the then-widespread rinderpest virus by the 12th century.&lt;ref name="pmid20202190"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furuse Y, Suzuki A, Oshitani H |title=Origin of measles virus: divergence from rinderpest virus between the 11th and 12th centuries |journal=Virology Journal |volume=7 |page=52 |year=2010 |pmid=20202190 |pmc=2838858 |doi=10.1186/1743-422X-7-52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A measles infection confers lifelong immunity. Therefore, the virus requires a high population density to become [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], and this probably did not occur in the [[Neolithic|Neolithic age]].&lt;ref name="Levins, pp. 297–298"/&gt;  Following the emergence of the virus in the [[Middle East]], it reached India by 2500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="pmid20459960"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Retief F, Cilliers L |title=Measles in antiquity and the Middle Ages |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=216–217 |year=2010 |pmid=20459960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measles was so common in children at the time that it was not recognised as a disease.

One of the earliest descriptions of a virus-infected plant can be found in a poem written by the Japanese [[Empress Kōken]] (718–770), in which she describes a plant in summer with yellowing leaves. The plant, later identified as ''[[Eupatorium lindleyanum]]'', is often infected with [[tomato yellow leaf curl virus]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahy, (a) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Middle Ages rabid dog.jpg|right|thumb|A woodcut from the [[Middle Ages]] showing a rabid dog]]
The rapidly growing population of Europe and the rising concentrations of people in its towns and cities became a fertile ground for many infectious and contagious diseases, of which the [[Black Death]]&amp;nbsp;– a bacterial infection&amp;nbsp;– is probably the most notorious.&lt;ref name="pmid11632234"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gottfried RS |title=Population, plague, and the sweating sickness: demographic movements in late fifteenth-century England |journal=The Journal of British Studies |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=12–37 |year=1977 |pmid=11632234 |doi=10.1086/385710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for smallpox and influenza, documented outbreaks of infections now known to be caused by viruses were rare. [[Rabies]], a disease that had been recognised for over 4000&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref name="Mahy 243"&gt;Mahy, (b) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; was rife in Europe, and continued to be so until the development of a vaccine by [[Louis Pasteur]] in 1886.&lt;ref name="Shors, p. 352"&gt;Shors, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; The average life expectancy in Europe during the Middle Ages was 35&amp;nbsp;years;  60% of children died before the age of 16, many of them during their first 6&amp;nbsp;years of life. Physicians – what few there were – relied as much on astrology as they did on their limited medical knowledge. Some treatments for infections consisted of ointments prepared from cats that had been roasted in hedgehog fat.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, (2009) p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Among the plethora of diseases that caused childhood death were measles, influenza and smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crusades]] and the [[Muslim conquests]] aided the spread of smallpox, which was the cause of frequent epidemics in Europe following its introduction to the continent between the fifth and seventh centuries.&lt;ref name="pmid16200144"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riedel S |title=Edward Jenner and the history of smallpox and vaccination |journal=Proceedings (Baylor University.

Measles was endemic throughout the highly populated countries of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrist, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In England the disease, then called "mezils", was first described in the 13th century, and it was probably one of the 49&amp;nbsp;plagues that occurred between 526 and 1087.&lt;ref name="pmid20459960"/&gt;
Rinderpest, which is caused by a virus closely related to measles virus, is a disease of cattle known since Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The disease, which originated in Asia, was first brought to Europe by the invading [[Huns]] in 370. Later invasions of [[Mongol]]s, led by [[Genghis Khan]] and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent.&lt;ref name="Barrett 87"&gt;Barrett, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; At the time rinderpest was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.&lt;ref name="Barrett 87"/&gt;

==Early to late modern period==

A short time after [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] on 22 August 1485, his army suddenly went down with "the [[English sweat]]", which contemporary observers described as a new disease.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; The disease, which was unusual in that it mainly affected the affluent, might have originated in France where Henry VII had recruited soldiers for his army.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; An epidemic hit London in the hot summer of 1508. Victims died within a day, and there were deaths throughout the city. The streets were deserted apart from carts transporting bodies, and King Henry declared the city off limits except for physicians and apothecaries.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-104053-X"&gt;Penn, pp. 325–326&lt;/ref&gt; The disease spread to Europe, arriving in Hamburg in July 1529 where one to two thousand victims died within the first few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  During the following months it wreaked havoc in Prussia, Switzerland, and northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt; The last outbreak was in England in 1556.&lt;ref name =Mortimer2012&gt;Mortimer (2012), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; The disease – which killed tens of thousands of people – was probably influenza&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; or a similar viral infection,&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; but records from the time when medicine was not a science can be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; As medicine became a science, the descriptions of disease became less vague.&lt;ref name=Elmer2004&gt;Elmer, p. xv&lt;/ref&gt; Although medicine could do little at the time to alleviate the suffering of the victims of infection, measures to control the spread of diseases were used. Restrictions on trade and travel were implemented, stricken families were isolated from their communities, buildings were fumigated and livestock killed.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

References to influenza infections date from the late 15th and early 16th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; but  infections almost certainly occurred long before then.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, pp. 39–57&lt;/ref&gt; In 1173, an epidemic occurred that was possibly the first in Europe, and in 1493, an outbreak of what is now thought to be [[swine influenza]], struck Native Americans in [[Hispaniola]]. There is some evidence to suggest that source of the infection was pigs on [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s ships.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; During an influenza epidemic that occurred in England between 1557 and 1559, five per cent of the population – about 150,000 – died from the infection. The mortality rate was nearly five times that of the 1918–19 pandemic.&lt;ref name =Mortimer2012/&gt;  The first pandemic that was reliably recorded began in July 1580 and swept across Europe, Africa, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The mortality rate was high&amp;nbsp;– 8,000 died in Rome.&lt;ref name="pmid11576290"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Potter CW |title=A history of influenza |journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology |volume=91 |issue=4 |pages=572–579 |year=2001  |pmid=11576290 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2672.2001.01492.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=1364-5072&amp;date=2001&amp;volume=91&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=572|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next three pandemics occurred in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, including that during 1781–82, which was probably the most devastating in history.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; This began in November 1781 in China and reached [[Moscow]] in December.&lt;ref name="pmid11576290"/&gt; In February 1782 it hit [[Saint Petersburg]], and by May it had reached Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Within six weeks, 75 per cent of the British population were infected and the pandemic soon spread to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americas and Australia remained free of measles and smallpox until the arrival of European colonists between the 15th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="pmid15306389"/&gt; Along with measles and influenza, smallpox was taken to the Americas by the Spanish.&lt;ref name="pmid15306389"/&gt; Smallpox was endemic in Spain, having been introduced by the [[Moors]] from Africa.&lt;ref name="Glynn 31"&gt;Glynn, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1519, an epidemic of smallpox broke out in  the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] in Mexico. This was started by  the army of [[Pánfilo de Narváez]],  who followed [[Hernán Cortés]]  from Cuba and had an African slave suffering from smallpox aboard his ship.&lt;ref name="Glynn 31"/&gt; When the Spanish finally entered the capital in the summer of 1521, they saw it strewn with the bodies of smallpox victims.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The epidemic, and those that followed during 1545–1548 and 1576–1581, eventually killed more than half of the native population.&lt;ref&gt;Berdan, pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Spanish were immune;  with his army of fewer than 900 men it would not have been possible for Cortés to defeat the Aztecs and conquer Mexico without the help of smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] populations were devastated later by the inadvertent spread of diseases introduced by Europeans.&lt;ref name="pmid15306389"/&gt; In the 150 years that followed Columbus's arrival in 1492, the Native American population of North America was reduced by 80 per cent from diseases, including measles, smallpox and influenza.&lt;ref&gt;Standford, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett and Armelagos, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; The damage done by these viruses significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, pp. 61–68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valdiserri p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, smallpox was endemic in Europe. There were five epidemics in London between 1719 and 1746, and large outbreaks occurred in other major European cities. By the end of the century about 400,000&amp;nbsp;Europeans were dying from the disease each year.&lt;ref name="Tucker 12-13"&gt;Tucker, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; It reached South Africa in 1713, having been carried by ships from India, and in 1789 the disease struck Australia.&lt;ref name="Tucker 12-13"/&gt; In the 19th century, smallpox became the single most important cause of death of the [[Australian Aborigines]].&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1546 [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] (1478–1553) wrote a classic description of measles. He thought the disease was caused by "seeds" (''seminaria'') that were spread from person to person. An epidemic hit London in 1670, recorded by [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624–1689), who thought it was caused by toxic vapours emanating from the earth.&lt;ref name="pmid20459960" /&gt;  His theory was wrong but he was a skilled observer and kept meticulous records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sloan AW |title=Thomas Sydenham, 1624–1689 |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=275–278 |year=1987  |pmid=3303370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yellow fever]] is an often lethal disease caused by a [[flavivirus]]. The virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes (''[[Aedes aegypti]]'') and first appeared over 3,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Mahy, (b) p.  514&lt;/ref&gt; In 1647, the first recorded epidemic occurred on [[Barbados]]  and was called "Barbados distemper" by [[John Winthrop]], who was the governor of the island at the time. He passed [[quarantine]] laws to protect the people&amp;nbsp;– the first ever such laws in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; Further epidemics of the disease occurred in North America in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="pmid1604377"/&gt; The first known cases of [[dengue fever]] occurred in Indonesia and Egypt in 1779. Trade ships brought the disease to the US, where an epidemic occurred in [[Philadelphia]] in 1780.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7910-8506-6"&gt;Chakraborty, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder (Dutch - Flower Still Life - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ambrosius Bosschaert]] (1573–1620) "Still Life"]]
Many paintings can be found in the museums of Europe depicting [[tulips]] with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the [[still life]] studies of [[Johannes Bosschaert]], were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this [[tulip mania]] in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much as a house.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2011), pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a [[Tulip breaking virus|virus]] accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from [[jasmine]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahy, (a) pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Weakened by the virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2011), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the Irish [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845–1852, the commonest cause of disease in potatoes was not the [[Phytophthora infestans|mould]] that causes blight, it was a virus. The disease, called "curl", is caused by [[potato leafroll virus]], and it was widespread in England in the 1770s, where it destroyed 75 per cent of the potato crop. At that time, the Irish potato crop remained relatively unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, Larry, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Vaccination|Inoculation}}
Lady [[Mary Wortley Montagu]] (1689–1762) was an aristocrat, a writer and the wife of a [[Member of Parliament]]. In 1716, her husband, Edward Wortley Montagu, was appointed British Ambassador in Istanbul. She followed him there and two weeks after her arrival discovered the local practice of protection against smallpox by [[variolation]]&amp;nbsp;– the injection of pus from smallpox victims into the skin.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p. 6"/&gt; Her younger brother had died of smallpox, and she too had had the disease. Determined to spare her five-year-old son Edward from similar suffering, she ordered the embassy surgeon Charles Maitland to variolate him. On her return to London, she asked Maitland to variolate her four-year-old daughter in the presence of the king's physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Montagu persuaded the [[George II of Great Britain|Prince and Princess of Wales]] to sponsor a public demonstration of the procedure. Six prisoners who had been condemned to death and were awaiting execution at [[Newgate Prison]] were offered a full pardon for serving as the subjects of the public experiment. They accepted and were variolated in 1721. All the prisoners recovered from the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  To test its protective effect one of them, a nineteen-year-old woman, was ordered to sleep in the same bed as a ten-year-old smallpox victim for six weeks. She did not contract the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The experiment was repeated on eleven orphan children, all of whom survived the ordeal, and by 1722  even [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]'s grandchildren had been inoculated.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was not entirely safe and there was a one in fifty chance of death.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure was expensive; some medical practitioners charged between £5 and £10 and some sold the method to other practitioners for fees between £50 to £100, or for half of the profits. Variolation became a lucrative franchise, but it remained beyond the means of many until the late 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; At the time nothing was known about viruses or the [[immune system]], and no one knew how the procedure afforded protection.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jenner cartoon from 1802.jpg|left|thumb|A cartoon from 1802 depicting Jenner vaccinating&amp;nbsp;– the recipients are shown with cows emerging from their bodies.]]

[[Edward Jenner]] (1749–1823), a British rural physician, was [[wiktionary:variolate|variolated]] as a boy.&lt;ref&gt;Booss, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He had suffered greatly from the ordeal but survived fully protected from smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner knew of a local belief that dairy workers who had contracted a relatively mild infection called [[cowpox]] were immune to smallpox. He decided to test the theory (although he was probably not the first to do so).&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 1796 he selected "a healthy boy, about eight years old for the purpose of inoculation for the Cow Pox".&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The boy,  [[James Phipps]] (1788–1853),  survived the experimental inoculation with cowpox virus and suffered only a mild fever. On 1 July 1796, Jenner took some "smallpox matter" (probably infected pus) and repeatedly inoculated Phipps's arms with it. Phipps survived and was subsequently inoculated with smallpox more than 20&amp;nbsp;times without succumbing to the disease. Vaccination&amp;nbsp;– the word is derived from the Latin ''vacca'' meaning "cow"&amp;nbsp;– had been invented.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Jenner's method was soon shown to be safer than variolation, and by 1801 more than 100,000 people had been vaccinated.&lt;ref name =Lane140&gt;Lane, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite objections from those medical practitioners  who still practised variolation, and who foresaw a decline in their income, free vaccination of the poor was introduced in the UK in 1840. Because of associated deaths, variolation was declared illegal in the same year.&lt;ref name =Lane140/&gt; Vaccination was made compulsory in England and Wales by the 1853 [[Vaccination Act]], and parents could be fined £1 if their children were not vaccinated before they were three months of age. The law was not adequately enforced, and the system for providing vaccinations,  unchanged since 1840, was ineffective. After an early compliance by the population only a small proportion were vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, pp. 39–45&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory vaccination was not well received and, following  protests, the Anti-Vaccination League and the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League were formed in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Following the anti-vaccination campaigns there was a severe outbreak of smallpox in [[Gloucester]] in 1895, the city's first  in twenty years; 434 people died, including 281 children.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the British government conceded to the protesters and the Vaccination Act of 1898 abolished fines and made provision for a "[[conscientious objector]]" clause&amp;nbsp;– the first use of the term&amp;nbsp;– for parents who did not believe in vaccination. During the following year, 250,000 objections were granted, and by 1912 less than half of the population of newborns were being vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1948, smallpox vaccination was no longer compulsory in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louis Pasteur and rabies===
[[File:Louis Pasteur, foto av Paul Nadar, Crisco edit.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Louis Pasteur]]
Rabies is an often fatal disease caused by the infection of mammals with [[rabies virus]]. In the 21st century it is mainly a disease that affects wild mammals such as  foxes and bats, but it is one of the oldest known virus diseases: ''rabies'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word (''rabhas'') that dates from 3000 BC,&lt;ref name="Shors, p. 352"/&gt;  which means "madness" or "rage",&lt;ref name="isbn0-471-90341-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Zuckerman, Arie J. |title=Principles and practice of clinical virology |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1987 |page=459 |isbn=0-471-90341-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disease has been known for over 4000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Mahy 243"/&gt; Descriptions of rabies can be found in  [[Mesopotamia]]n texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Rabies and rabid rogs in Sumerian and Akkadian Literature | author=Yuhong, Wu | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | year=2001 | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=32–43 | jstor=606727 | doi=10.2307/606727}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called it "lyssa" or "lytta", meaning "madness".&lt;ref name="Mahy 243"/&gt;  References to rabies can be found in the [[Laws of Eshnunna]], which date from 2300&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) wrote one of the earliest undisputed descriptions of the disease and how it was passed to humans. [[Celsus]], in the first century AD, first recorded the symptom called [[wikt:hydrophobia|hydrophobia]] and suggested that the saliva of infected animals and humans contained a slime or poison&amp;nbsp;– to describe this he invented the  word "virus".&lt;ref name="Mahy 243"/&gt; Rabies does not cause epidemics, but the infection was greatly feared because of its terrible symptoms, which include insanity, hydrophobia and death.&lt;ref name="Mahy 243"/&gt;

In France during the time of Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) there were only a few hundred rabies infections in humans each year, but cures were desperately sought. Aware of the possible danger, Pasteur  began to look for the "microbe" in mad dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;  Pasteur showed that when the dried spinal cords from dogs that had died from rabies were crushed and injected into healthy dogs they did not become infected. He repeated the experiment several times on the same dog with tissue that had been dried for fewer and fewer days, until the dog survived even after injections of fresh rabies-infected spinal tissue. Pasteur had immunised the dog against rabies, as he later did with 50 more.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rabies cartoon circa 1826.jpg|left|thumb|A cartoon from 1826 depicting a rabid dog on a London street]]

Although Pasteur had little idea how his method worked, he tested it on a boy, [[Joseph Meister]] (1876–1940), who was brought to Pasteur by his mother on 6 July 1885. He was covered in bites, having been set upon by a mad dog.  Meister's mother begged Pasteur to help her son. Pasteur was a scientist, not a physician, and he was well aware of the consequences for him if things were to go wrong. He nevertheless decided to help the boy and injected him with increasingly virulent rabid rabbit spinal tissue over the following 10&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Later Pasteur wrote, "as the death of this child appeared inevitable, I decided, not without deep and severe unease&amp;nbsp;... to try out on Joseph Meister the procedure, which had consistently worked on dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  Meister recovered and returned home with his mother on 27 July. Pasteur successfully treated a second boy in October that same year; Jean-Baptiste Jupille (1869–1923) was a 15-year-old shepherd boy who had been severely bitten as he tried to protect other children from a rabid dog.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur's method of treatment  remained in use for over 50&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="pmid9218283"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(96)00314-3 |author=Dreesen DW |title=A global review of rabies vaccines for human use |journal=Vaccine |volume=15 |pages=S2–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9218283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little was known about the cause of the disease until 1903 when [[Adelchi Negri]] (1876–1912) first saw microscopic lesions&amp;nbsp;– now called [[Negri bodies]]&amp;nbsp;– in the brains of rabid animals.&lt;ref name="pmid8804019"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2990.1996.tb00893.x |vauthors=Kristensson K, Dastur DK, Manghani DK, Tsiang H, Bentivoglio M |title=Rabies: interactions between neurons and viruses.

[[Paul Remlinger]] (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s long, now known to be the size of [[rhabdovirus]] particles&amp;nbsp;– the virus that causes rabies.&lt;ref name="Mahy 243"/&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, evidence for the existence of viruses was obtained from experiments with filters that had pores too small for bacteria to pass through; the term "filterable virus" was coined to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2000), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1930s most scientists believed that viruses were small bacteria, but following the invention of the [[electron microscope]] in 1931 they were shown to be completely different, to a degree that not all scientists were convinced they were anything other than accumulations of toxic [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10905259"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kruger DH, Schneck P, Gelderblom HR |title=Helmut Ruska and the visualisation of viruses |journal=Lancet |volume=355 |issue=9216 |pages=1713–1717 |year=2000 |pmid=10905259 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02250-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed radically when it was discovered that viruses contain genetic material in the form of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2000), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Once they were recognised as distinct biological entities they were soon shown to be the cause of numerous infections of plants, animals and even bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, pp. 22–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the many diseases of humans that were found to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one, smallpox, has been eradicated. The diseases caused by viruses such as HIV and influenza virus have proved to be more difficult to control.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Other diseases, such as those caused by [[arboviruses]], are presenting new challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Levins, pp. 123–125, 157–168, 195–198, 199–205&lt;/ref&gt;

As humans have changed their behaviour during history, so have viruses. In ancient times the human population was too small for pandemics to occur and, in the case of some viruses, too small for them to survive. In the 20th and 21st century increasing population densities, revolutionary changes in agriculture and farming methods, and high speed travel have contributed to the spread of new viruses and the re-appearance of old ones.&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahy, (b) p. 585&lt;/ref&gt;  Like smallpox, some viral diseases might be conquered, but new ones, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]), will continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; Although vaccines are still the most powerful weapon against viruses, in recent decades [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed to specifically target viruses as they replicate in their [[host (biology)|hosts]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 influenza pandemic]] showed how rapidly new [[Strain (biology)|strains]] of viruses continue to spread around the world, despite efforts to contain them.&lt;ref name="pmid20568566"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taubenberger JK, Morens DM |title=Influenza: the once and future pandemic |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=125 Suppl 3 |pages=16–26 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20568566 |pmc=2862331 |issue=Suppl 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in virus discovery and control continue to be made. [[Human metapneumovirus]], which is a cause of respiratory infections including [[pneumonia]], was discovered in 2001.&lt;ref name="pmid12033771"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van den Hoogen BG, Bestebroer TM, Osterhaus AD, Fouchier RA |title=Analysis of the genomic sequence of a human metapneumovirus |journal=Virology |volume=295 |issue=1 |pages=119–132 |year=2002 |pmid=12033771 |doi=10.1006/viro.2001.1355}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vaccine for the [[papillomavirus]]es that cause [[cervical cancer]] was developed between 2002 and 2006.&lt;ref name="pmid17972339"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frazer IH, Lowy DR, Schiller JT |title=Prevention of cancer through immunization: Prospects and challenges for the 21st century |journal=European Journal of Immunology |volume=37 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S148–155 |year=2007  |pmid=17972339 |doi=10.1002/eji.200737820}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, [[human T-lymphotropic virus|human T lymphotropic viruses 3 and 4]] were discovered.&lt;ref name="pmid15911757"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wolfe ND, Heneine W, Carr JK, Garcia AD, Shanmugam V, Tamoufe U, Torimiro JN, Prosser AT, Lebreton M, Mpoudi-Ngole E, McCutchan FE, Birx DL, Folks TM, Burke DS, Switzer WM |title=Emergence of unique primate T-lymphotropic viruses among central African bushmeat hunters |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=102 |issue=22 |pages=7994–7999 |year=2005 |pmid=15911757 |pmc=1142377 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0501734102|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.7994W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative was re-launched with a plan to [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradicate poliomyelitis]]  by 2015.&lt;ref name="pmid20455167"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pirio GA, Kaufmann J |title=Polio eradication is just over the horizon: the challenges of global resource mobilization |journal=Journal of Health Communication |volume=15 Suppl 1 |pages=66–83 |year=2010 |pmid=20455167 |doi=10.1080/10810731003695383}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the largest virus, [[Megavirus|Megavirus chilensis]] was discovered to infect [[Amoeboid|amoebae]].&lt;ref name="pmid21987820"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arslan D, Legendre M, Seltzer V, Abergel C, Claverie JM |title=Distant mimivirus relative with a larger genome highlights the fundamental features of Megaviridae |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=108 |issue=42 |pages=17486–17491 |year=2011 |pmid=21987820 |pmc=3198346 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1110889108|bibcode=2011PNAS..10817486A }}&lt;/ref&gt; These giant viruses have renewed interest in the role viruses play in evolution and their position in the [[tree of life#Science|tree of life]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smallpox eradication===
{{main|Smallpox}}
[[File:Rahima Banu.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Rahima Banu, the last person known to have contracted smallpox, in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Smallpox virus was a major cause of death in the 20th century, killing about 300&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It has probably killed more humans than any other virus.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 an agreement was reached by the [[World Health Assembly]] (the decision-making body of the [[World Health Organization]]) to start an "intensified smallpox eradication programme" and attempt to [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicate]] the disease within ten years.&lt;ref name="Glynn 200"&gt;Glynn, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, smallpox was still endemic in 31 countries&lt;ref name="Crawford p. 220"&gt;Crawford (2000), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; including Brazil, the whole of the Indian sub-continent, Indonesia and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Glynn 200"/&gt; This ambitious goal was considered achievable for several reasons: the vaccine afforded exceptional protection; there was only one type of the virus; there were no animals that naturally carried it; the [[incubation period]] of the infection was known and rarely varied from 12 days; and infections always gave rise to symptoms, so it was clear who had the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shors, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

Following mass vaccinations, disease detection and containment were central to the eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, [[Botswana]] and [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="Crawford p. 220"/&gt; Finally, after 13 years of coordinated [[disease surveillance]] and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated in 1979.&lt;ref name="pmid15931293"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belongia EA, Naleway AL |title=Smallpox vaccine: the good, the bad, and the ugly |journal=Clinical Medicine &amp; Research |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=87–92 |year=2003  |pmid=15931293 |pmc=1069029 |doi=10.3121/cmr.1.2.87 |url=http://www.clinmedres.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15931293 |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the main weapon used was [[vaccinia virus]], which was used as the vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not a weakened form of smallpox.&lt;ref&gt;Glynn, pp. 186–189&lt;/ref&gt;

The eradication campaign led to the death of [[Janet Parker]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the [[University of Birmingham]] who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 126–131&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States in 2001, the World Health Organization proposed the destruction of all the known remaining stocks of smallpox virus that were kept in laboratories in the US and Russia.&lt;ref name="pmid21470459"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weinstein RS |title=Should remaining stockpiles of smallpox virus (variola) be destroyed? |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=681–683 |date=April 2011 |pmid=21470459 |pmc=3377425 |doi=10.3201/eid1704.101865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fears of [[bioterrorism]] using smallpox virus and the possible need for the virus in the development of drugs to treat the infection have put an end to this plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/health/us-stockpiles-smallpox-drug-in-case-of-bioterror-attack.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Wary of attack with s, U.S. buys up a costly drug |author=McNeil Jr DG |publisher=New York Times |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Had the destruction gone ahead, smallpox virus might have been the first to be made extinct by human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles===
{{Main|Measles}}
Before the introduction of vaccination in the US in the 1960s there were more than 500,000&amp;nbsp;cases each year resulting in about 400&amp;nbsp;deaths. In developed countries children were mainly infected between the ages of three and five years old, but in developing  countries half the children were infected before the age of two.&lt;ref&gt;Dick, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  In the US and the UK, there were regular annual or biannual epidemics of the disease, which depended on the number of children born each year.&lt;ref name="pmid10650003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Earn DJ, Rohani P, Bolker BM, Grenfell BT |title=A simple model for complex dynamical transitions in epidemics |journal=Science |volume=287 |issue=5453 |pages=667–670 |year=2000  |pmid=10650003 |doi= 10.1126/science.287.5453.667|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10650003|accessdate=19 December 2014|bibcode=2000Sci...287..667E }} Free registration is required.&lt;/ref&gt; The current epidemic strain evolved in the first part of the 20th century&amp;nbsp;– probably between 1908 and 1943.&lt;ref name="pmid18217182"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pomeroy LW, Bjørnstad ON, Holmes EC |title=The evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the paramyxoviridae |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=98–106 |year=2008  |pmid=18217182 |pmc=3334863 |doi=10.1007/s00239-007-9040-x|bibcode=2008JMolE..66...98P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London between 1950 and 1968 there were epidemics every two years, but in  [[Liverpool]], which had a higher birth rate, there was an annual cycle of epidemics. During the [[Great Depression]] in the US before the Second World War the birth rate was low, and epidemics of measles were sporadic. After the war the birth rate increased, and epidemics occurred regularly every two years. In developing countries with very high birth rates, epidemics occurred every year.&lt;ref name="pmid10650003"/&gt; Measles is still a major problem in densely populated, less-developed countries with high birth rates and lacking effective vaccination campaigns.&lt;ref name="pmid17327206"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conlan AJ, Grenfell BT |title=Seasonality and the persistence and invasion of measles |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=274 |issue=1614 |pages=1133–1141 |year=2007  |pmid=17327206 |pmc=1914306 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0030 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17327206 |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, following a mass vaccination programme that was known as "make measles a memory", the incidence of measles in the US had fallen by 90 per cent.&lt;ref name = "Oldstone 135"&gt;Oldstone, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Similar vaccination campaigns in other countries have reduced the levels of infection by 99 per cent over the past 50&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Susceptible individuals remain a source of infection and include those who have migrated from countries with ineffective vaccination schedules, or who refuse the vaccine or choose not to have their children vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;
Humans are the only natural host of measles virus.&lt;ref name = "Oldstone 135"/&gt; Immunity to the disease following an infection is lifelong; that afforded by vaccination is long term but eventually wanes.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, p. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the vaccine has been [[MMR vaccine controversy|controversial]]. In 1998, [[Andrew Wakefield]] and his colleagues published a fraudulent research paper and he claimed to link the [[MMR vaccine]] with [[autism]]. The study was widely reported and fed concern about the safety of vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, pp. 156–158&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield's research was identified as fraudulent and in 2010, he was struck off the UK medical register and can no longer practise medicine in the UK.&lt;ref name="Waterhouse2012"&gt;Waterhouse, pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of the controversy, the MMR vaccination rate in the UK fell from 92 per cent in 1995, to less than 80 per cent in 2003.&lt;ref name="pmid23604089"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wise J |title=Largest group of children affected by measles outbreak in Wales is 10–18 year olds |journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) |volume=346  |pages=f2545 |year=2013 |pmid=23604089 |doi=10.1136/bmj.f2545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of measles rose from 56 in 1998  to 1370 in 2008, and similar increases occurred throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Waterhouse2012"/&gt; In April 2013, an epidemic of measles in [[Wales]] in the UK broke out, which mainly affected teenagers who had not been vaccinated.&lt;ref name="pmid23604089"/&gt;  Despite this controversy, measles has been eliminated from Finland, Sweden and Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Japan abolished mandatory vaccination in 1992, and in 1995–1997 more than 200,000&amp;nbsp;cases were reported in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Measles remains a [[public health]] problem in Japan, where it is now endemic;  a National Measles Elimination Plan was established in December 2007, with a view to eliminating the disease from the country.&lt;ref name="pmid18818586"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Progress toward measles elimination—Japan, 1999–2008 |journal=MMWR.

===Poliomyelitis===
{{Main|History of poliomyelitis|Poliomyelitis eradication}}
[[File:Poumon artificiel.jpg|right|thumb|Hospital staff examining a patient in a tank respirator "[[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]]", during the Rhode Island polio epidemic of 1960]]
During the summers of the mid-20th century, parents in the US and Europe dreaded the annual appearance of poliomyelitis (or polio), which was commonly known as "infantile paralysis".&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; The disease was rare at the beginning of the century, and worldwide there were only a few thousand cases per year, but by the 1950s there were 60,000&amp;nbsp;cases each year in the US alone&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; and an average of 2,300 in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notifiable-diseases-historic-annual-totals  "Notifiable diseases: historic annual totals" Public Health England]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1916 and 1917 there had been a major epidemic in the US; 27,000&amp;nbsp;cases and 6,000&amp;nbsp;deaths were recorded, with 9,000&amp;nbsp;cases in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; At the time nobody knew how the virus was spreading.&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the city's inhabitants, including scientists, thought that impoverished slum-dwelling immigrants were to blame even though the prevalence of the disease was higher in the more prosperous districts such as [[Staten Island]]&amp;nbsp;– a pattern that had also been seen in  cities like Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Many other industrialised countries were affected at the same time. In particular, before the outbreaks in the US, large epidemics had occurred in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Mahy (b), p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the rise of polio in industrialised countries in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease is caused by a virus that is passed from person to person by the [[faecal-oral route]],&lt;ref name="Dobson, p. 166"&gt;Dobson, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; and naturally infects only humans.&lt;ref name="Karlen 153"&gt;Karlen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence.&lt;ref name="Dobson, p. 166"/&gt; Although the virus was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild.&lt;ref&gt;Oldstone, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.&lt;ref name="Karlen 153"/&gt;

Following the development of vaccines in the mid-1950s, mass vaccination campaigns took place in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, after a campaign promoted by the [[March of Dimes]], the annual number of polio cases fell dramatically; the last outbreak was in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the World Health Organization along with others launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and by 1994 the Americas were declared to be free of disease, followed by the Pacific region in 2000 and Europe in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2012, only 223 cases were reported by the World Health Organization. Mainly poliovirus type 1 infections, 122 occurred in [[Nigeria]], one in [[Chad]], 58 in [[Pakistan]] and 37 in [[Afghanistan]]. Vaccination teams often face danger; seven vaccinators were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria at the beginning of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21381773 |title=Nigeria polio vaccinators shot dead in Kano |date=8 February 2013 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Pakistan, the campaign was further hampered by the murder on 26 February 2013 of a police officer who was providing security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/08/polio-workers-nigeria-shot-dead |title=Polio workers in Nigeria shot dead |first=David |last=Smith |date=8 February 2013 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) is the virus that – when the infection is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Most virologists believe that HIV originated in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] during the 20th century,&lt;ref name="pmid9989410"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gao F, Bailes E, Robertson DL, Chen Y, Rodenburg CM, Michael SF, Cummins LB, Arthur LO, Peeters M, Shaw GM, Sharp PM, Hahn BH |title=Origin of HIV-1 in the chimpanzee ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'' |journal=Nature |volume=397 |issue=6718 |pages=436–441 |year=1999 |pmid=9989410 |doi=10.1038/17130|bibcode=1999Natur.397..436G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus.

The full scale of the epidemic&amp;nbsp;– and that the virus had been silently emerging over several decades&amp;nbsp;– was not known.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, pp. 15–21&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV crossed the species barrier between chimpanzees and humans in Africa in the early decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2013), pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; During the years that followed there were enormous social changes and turmoil in Africa. Population shifts were unprecedented as vast numbers of people moved from rural farms to the expanding cities, and the virus was spread from remote regions to densely populated urban conurbations.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2013), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The incubation period for AIDS is around 10 years, so a global epidemic starting in the early 1980s is credible.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; At this time there was much scapegoating and stigmatisation.&lt;ref&gt;Levins, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; The "out of Africa" theory for the origin of the HIV pandemic was not well received by Africans, who felt that the "blame" was misplaced. This led the World Health Assembly to pass a 1987 resolution, which stated that HIV is "a naturally occurring [virus] of undetermined geographic origin".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Weeks, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIV pandemic has challenged communities and brought about social changes throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Valdiserri p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions on sexuality are more openly discussed. Advice on sexual practices and drug use&amp;nbsp;– which were once taboo&amp;nbsp;– is sponsored by many governments and their healthcare providers.&lt;ref&gt;Valdiserri pp. 14–17&lt;/ref&gt; Debates on the ethics of provision and cost of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|anti-retroviral drugs]], particularly in poorer countries, have highlighted inequalities in healthcare and stimulated far-reaching legislative changes.&lt;ref&gt;Weeks, pp. 303–316&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries the impact of HIV/AIDS has been profound; key organisations such as healthcare, defense and civil services have been severely disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Valdiserri p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Life expectancy has fallen. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy was 79 years in 1991 but by 2001 it had fallen to 39 years.&lt;ref&gt;Valdiserri pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influenza===
{{main|Influenza}}
[[File:1918FluVictimsStLouis.jpg|right|thumb|Members of the [[American Red Cross]] removing a victim of the Spanish influenza from a house in 1918]]
When influenza virus undergoes a [[genetic shift]] many humans have no immunity to the new strain, and if the population of susceptible individuals is high enough to maintain the chain of infection,  pandemics occur. The genetic changes usually happen when different strains of the virus co-infect animals, particularly birds and swine. Although many viruses of [[vertebrate]]s are restricted to one species, influenza virus is an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The last pandemic of the 19th century occurred in 1899 and resulted in the deaths of 250,000&amp;nbsp;people in Europe. The virus, which originated in Russia or Asia, was the first to be rapidly spread by people on trains and steamships.&lt;ref name="Karlen 144"&gt;Karlen, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

A new strain of the virus emerged in 1918, and the subsequent pandemic of [[Spanish flu]] was one of the worst natural disasters in history.&lt;ref name="Karlen 144"/&gt; The death toll was enormous; throughout the world around 50&amp;nbsp;million people died from the infection.&lt;ref name="pmid16494711"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Taubenberger JK, Morens DM |title=1918 Influenza: the mother of all pandemics |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–22 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16494711 |pmc=3291398 |doi=10.3201/eid1201.050979}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 550,000&amp;nbsp;reported deaths caused by the disease in the US, ten times the country's losses during the First World War,&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; and 228,000&amp;nbsp;deaths in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;  In India there were more than 20 million deaths, and in [[Western Samoa]] 22 per cent of the population died.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, pp. 364–365&lt;/ref&gt;  Although cases of influenza occurred every winter, there were only two other pandemics in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 another new strain of the virus emerged and caused a pandemic of [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|Asian flu]]; although the virus was not as [[Virulence|virulent]] as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when [[Hong Kong flu]] emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain.&lt;ref&gt;Mahy, (b) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic was the least severe, but 33,800 were killed in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Shors, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2000), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent pandemic occurred in 2009, but none of the last three has caused anything near the devastation seen in 1918. Exactly why the strain of influenza that emerged in 1918 was so devastating is a question that still remains unanswered.&lt;ref name="Karlen 144"/&gt;

===Yellow fever, dengue and other arboviruses===
{{main|Arbovirus}}
[[File:Aedes aegypti bloodfeeding CDC Gathany.jpg|thumb|''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' feeding on human blood]]
Arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted to humans and other vertebrates by blood-sucking insects. These viruses are diverse; the term "arbovirus"&amp;nbsp;– which was derived from "arthropod-borne virus"&amp;nbsp;– is no longer  used in formal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] because many species of virus are known to be spread in this way.&lt;ref name="pmid16568903"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weaver SC |title=Evolutionary influences in arboviral disease |journal=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |volume=299  |pages=285–314 |year=2006 |pmid=16568903 |doi=10.1007/3-540-26397-7_10 |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |isbn=3-540-26395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 500&amp;nbsp;species of arboviruses, but in the 1930s only three were known to cause disease in humans: [[yellow fever|yellow fever virus]], [[dengue virus]] and [[Pappataci fever|Pappataci fever virus]].&lt;ref&gt;Levins, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 of such viruses are now known to cause human diseases including [[encephalitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahy, (b) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellow fever is the most notorious disease caused by a flavivirus.&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The last major epidemic in the US occurred in 1905.&lt;ref name="pmid1604377"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(92)90255-O |author=Patterson KD |title=Yellow fever epidemics and mortality in the United States, 1693–1905 |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=34 |issue=8 |pages=855–865 |year=1992  |pmid=1604377}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the building of the [[Panama Canal]] thousands of workers died from the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid4576836"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ziperman HH |title=A medical history of the Panama Canal |journal=Surgery, Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=104–114 |year=1973 |pmid=4576836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow fever originated in Africa and the virus was brought to the Americas on cargo ships, which were harbouring the ''Aedes aegypti'' mosquito that carries the virus. The first recorded epidemic in Africa occurred in [[Ghana]], in West Africa, in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s the disease re-emerged in Brazil. [[Fred Soper]], an American [[epidemiologist]] (1893–1977), discovered the importance of the [[sylvatic cycle]] of infection in non-human hosts, and that infection of humans was a "dead end" that broke this cycle.&lt;ref name="pmid7809386"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ansari MZ, Shope RE |title=Epidemiology of arboviral infections |journal=Public Health Reviews |volume=22 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–26 |year=1994 |pmid=7809386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the yellow fever vaccine is one of the most successful ever developed,&lt;ref name="pmid19520559"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrett AD, Teuwen DE |title=Yellow fever vaccine – how does it work and why do rare cases of serious adverse events take place? |journal=Current Opinion in Immunology |year=2009 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=308–313 |pmid=19520559 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2009.05.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; epidemics  continue to occur.

In the 1930s, [[St. Louis encephalitis]], [[eastern equine encephalitis]] and [[western equine encephalitis]] emerged in the US. The virus that causes [[La Crosse encephalitis]] was discovered in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Nile virus]] arrived in [[New York (state)|New York]]   in 1999.&lt;ref name="pmid20403311"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiter P |title=West Nile virus in Europe: understanding the present to gauge the future |journal=[[Eurosurveillance]] |volume=15 |issue=10 |page=19508 |year=2010  |pmid=20403311}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, dengue virus is the most prevalent arbovirus and increasingly virulent strains of the virus have spread across Asia and the Americas.&lt;ref name="pmid20513545"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ross TM |title=Dengue virus |journal=Clinics in Laboratory Medicine |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=149–160 |year=2010  |pmid=20513545 |doi=10.1016/j.cll.2009.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hepatitis viruses===
{{main|Viral hepatitis}}
[[Hepatitis]] is a disease of the liver that has been recognised since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, p. 745&lt;/ref&gt;  Symptoms include [[jaundice]], a yellowing of the skin, eyes and body fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  There are numerous causes, including viruses&amp;nbsp;– particularly [[hepatitis A virus]], [[hepatitis B virus]] and [[hepatitis C virus]].&lt;ref name="pmid21047029"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharapov UM, Hu DJ |title=Viral hepatitis A, B, and C: grown-up issues |journal=Adolescent Medicine: State of the Art Reviews |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=265–286, ix |year=2010  |pmid=21047029}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout history epidemics of jaundice have been reported, mainly affecting soldiers at war. This "campaign jaundice"  was common in the Middle Ages. It occurred among [[Napoleon]]'s armies and during most of the major conflicts of the 19th and 20th centuries, including the [[American Civil War]], where over 40,000 cases and around 150 deaths were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The viruses that cause epidemic jaundice were not discovered until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="pmid8385046"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Purcell RH |title=The discovery of the hepatitis viruses |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=104 |issue=4 |pages=955–963 |year=1993  |pmid=8385046 |doi=10.1016/0016-5085(93)90261-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names for epidemic jaundice, hepatitis A, and for blood-borne infectious jaundice, hepatitis B, were first used in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; following a publication in 1946 giving evidence that the two diseases were distinct.&lt;ref name="pmid19993377"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maccallum FO |title=Homologous serum hepatitis |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=655–657 |year=1946  |pmid=19993377 |pmc=2181938}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, the first virus  that could cause hepatitis was discovered.

The discovery of hepatitis B virus and the invention of tests to detect it have radically changed many medical, and some cosmetic procedures.  The screening of [[Blood donation|donated blood]], which was introduced in the early 1970s, has dramatically reduced the transmission of the virus.&lt;ref name="pmid22305086"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allain JP, Candotti D |title=Hepatitis B virus in transfusion medicine: still a problem? |journal=Biologicals: Journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=180–186 |year=2012  |pmid=22305086 |doi=10.1016/j.biologicals.2011.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Donations of human [[blood plasma]] and [[Factor VIII]] collected before 1975 often contained infectious levels of hepatitis B virus.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Until the late 1960s, [[hypodermic needle]]s were often reused by medical professionals, and tattoo artists' needles were a common source of infection.&lt;ref name="pmid9708051"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greif J, Hewitt W |title=The living canvas |journal=Advance for Nurse Practitioners |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=26–31, 82 |year=1998 |pmid=9708051}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, [[needle exchange programme]]s were established in Europe and the US to prevent the spread of infections by [[Recreational drug use|intravenous drug users]].&lt;ref name="pmid20199955"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nacopoulos AG, Lewtas AJ, Ousterhout MM |title=Syringe exchange programs: impact on injection drug users and the role of the pharmacist from a U.S. perspective |journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=148–157 |year=2010 |pmid=20199955 |doi=10.1331/JAPhA.2010.09178}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures also helped to reduce the subsequent impact of HIV and hepatitis C virus.&lt;ref name="pmid20738828"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perkins HA, Busch MP |title=Transfusion-associated infections: 50 years of relentless challenges and remarkable progress |journal=Transfusion |volume=50 |issue=10 |pages=2080–2099 |year=2010 |pmid=20738828 |doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02851.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-human animal viruses===
{{main|Veterinary virology|Epizootics}}
Epizootics are outbreaks (epidemics) of disease among non-human animals.&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-375158-6"&gt;Dubovi, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included [[foot-and-mouth disease]], rinderpest of cattle, [[avian influenza|avian]] and swine influenza, [[swine fever]] and [[bluetongue]] of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock can be devastating both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.&lt;ref&gt;Shors, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

First appearing in East Africa in 1891, rinderpest, a disease of cattle, spread rapidly across Africa.&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; By 1892, 95 per cent of the cattle in East Africa had died. This resulted in a famine that devastated the farmers and nomadic people, some of whom were entirely dependent on their cattle. Two thirds of the population of [[Maasai people]] died. The situation was made worse by epidemics of smallpox that followed in the wake of the famine.&lt;ref&gt;Norton-Griffiths, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the 20th century rinderpest was common in Asia and parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of the disease was steadily reduced during the century by control measures that included vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; By 1908 Europe was free from the disease. Outbreaks did occur following the Second World War, but these were quickly controlled. The prevalence of the disease increased in Asia, and in 1957 [[Thailand]] had to appeal for aid because so many buffaloes had died that the [[paddy field]]s could not be prepared for rice growing.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Russia west of the [[Ural Mountains]] remained free from the disease&amp;nbsp;– [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] approved several laws on the control of the disease&amp;nbsp;– but cattle in eastern Russia were constantly infected with rinderpest that originated in Mongolia and China where the prevalence remained high.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; India controlled the spread of the disease, which had retained a foothold in the southern states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]], throughout the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; and had eradicated the disease by 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Africa suffered two major [[panzootic]]s in the 1920s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; There was a severe outbreak in [[Somalia]] in 1928 and the disease was widespread in the country until 1953. In the 1980s, outbreaks in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]] were controlled by the use of 26&amp;nbsp;million doses of vaccine, and a recurrence of the disease in 1997 was suppressed by an intensive vaccination campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the century rinderpest had been eradicated from most countries. A few pockets of infection remained in Ethiopia and Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1994 the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was launched by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) with the aim of global eradication by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, pp. 136–138&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, the FAO and the [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] announced that "rinderpest as a freely circulating viral disease has been eliminated from the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Final_Report_May2011.pdf |title=Joint FAO/OIE Committee on Global Rinderpest Eradication |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations; World Organisation for Animal Health |format=PDF |date=May 2011 |page=10 |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious infection caused by an [[aphthovirus]], and is classified in the same family as poliovirus. The virus has infected animals, mainly [[ungulate]]s, in Africa since ancient times and was probably brought  to the Americas in the 19th century by imported livestock.&lt;ref name="pmid19687036"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paton DJ, Sumption KJ, Charleston B |title=Options for control of foot-and-mouth disease: knowledge, capability and policy |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=364 |issue=1530 |pages=2657–2667 |year=2009  |pmid=19687036 |pmc=2865093 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0100 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19687036 |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foot-and-mouth disease is rarely fatal, but the economic losses incurred by outbreaks in sheep and cattle herds can be high.&lt;ref name="pmid12523714"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scudamore JM, Trevelyan GM, Tas MV, Varley EM, Hickman GA |title=Carcass disposal: lessons from Great Britain following the foot and mouth disease outbreaks of 2001 |journal=Revue Scientifique et Technique (International Office of Epizootics) |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=775–787 |year=2002  |pmid=12523714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last occurrence  of the disease in the US was in 1929, but as recently as 2001, several large [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|outbreaks]] occurred throughout the UK and thousands of animals were killed and burnt.&lt;ref name="pmid15648172"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/3-540-27109-0_1 |author=Mahy BW |title=Introduction and history of foot-and-mouth disease virus |journal=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |volume=288 |pages=1–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15648172 |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |isbn=3-540-22419-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural hosts of influenza viruses are pigs and birds, although it has probably infected humans since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals.&lt;ref name="pmid20591211"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Suarez DL |title=Avian influenza: our current understanding |journal=Animal Health Research Reviews |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=19–33 |year=2010  |pmid=20591211 |doi=10.1017/S1466252310000095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages.

===Plant viruses===
{{main|Plant virus}}
[[File:Weisse-Fliege.jpg|right|thumb|Whiteflies (''[[Trialeurodes vaporariorum]]'') are the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of [[cassava mosaic virus]].]]
During the 20th century, many "old" diseases of plants were found to be caused by viruses. These included [[maize streak]] and [[cassava mosaic virus|cassava mosaic disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;
As with humans, when plants thrive in close proximity, so do their viruses. This can cause huge economic losses and human tragedies. In [[Jordan]] during the 1970s, where tomatoes and [[cucurbitaceae|cucurbits]] (cucumbers, melons and gourds) were  extensively grown, entire fields were infected with viruses.&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-429601-7"&gt;Kurstak, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], thirty different viruses infected crops such as [[legumes]] and vegetables. In Kenya cassava mosaic virus, maize streak virus and groundnut viral diseases caused the loss of up to 70 per cent of the crop.&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-429601-7"/&gt;
[[Cassava]] is the most abundant crop that is grown in eastern Africa and it is a staple crop for more than 200 million people. It was introduced to Africa from South America and grows well in soils with poor fertility. The most important disease of cassava is caused by cassava mosaic virus, a [[geminiviridae|geminivirus]], which is transmitted between plants by [[whitefly|whiteflies]]. The disease was first recorded in 1894 and outbreaks of the disease occurred in eastern Africa throughout the 20th century,   often resulting in famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Legg JP |title=Emergence, spread and strategies for controlling the pandemic of cassava mosaic virus disease in east and central Africa |journal=Crop Protection |year=1999 |volume=18 |doi=10.1016/S0261-2194(99)00062-9 |issue=10 |pages=627–637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s the [[sugarbeet]] growers in the western US suffered huge economic loss caused by damage done to their crops by the [[leafhopper]]-transmitted [[beet curly top virus]]. In 1956, between 25 and 50 per cent of the rice crop in Cuba and Venezuela was destroyed by [[rice hoja blanca virus]]. In 1958, it caused the loss of many rice fields in Colombia. Outbreaks recurred in 1981, which caused losses of up to 100 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Levins, pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghana between 1936 and 1977, the mealybug-transmitted [[cacao swollen-shoot virus]] caused the loss of 162 million [[Theobroma cacao|cacao trees]], and additional trees were lost at the rate of 15 million each year.&lt;ref&gt;Levins, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, in [[Kansas]], US, seven per cent of the wheat crop was destroyed by [[wheat streak mosaic virus]], spread by the [[Aceria|wheat curl mite]]  ''(Aceria tulipae)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hansing D, Johnston CO, Melchers LE, Fellows H |year=1949 |title=Kansas Phytopathological Notes: 1948 |journal=Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science (1903–) |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=363–369 |jstor=3625805 |doi=10.2307/3625805}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s [[papaya ringspot virus]] – a [[potyvirus]] – caused a devastating loss of [[papaya|solo papaya]] crops on [[Oahu]], Hawaii. Solo papaya had been introduced to the island in the previous century but the disease had not been seen on the island before the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Hasegawa, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Such disasters occurred when human intervention caused ecological changes by the introduction of crops to new [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s and viruses. Cacao is native to South America and was introduced to West Africa in the late 19th century. In 1936, swollen root disease had been transmitted to plantations by mealybugs from indigenous trees.&lt;ref&gt;Levins, pp. 184–195&lt;/ref&gt; New habitats can trigger outbreaks of plant virus diseases. Before 1970, the [[rice yellow mottle virus]] was only found in the [[Kisumu]] district of Kenya, but following the irrigation of large areas of East Africa and extensive rice cultivation, the virus spread throughout East Africa.&lt;ref name="Levins, p. 185"&gt;Levins, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Human activity  introduced plant viruses to native crops. The [[citrus tristeza virus]] (CTV) was introduced to South America from Africa between 1926 and 1930. At the same time, the aphid ''[[Toxoptera citricida|Toxoptera citricidus]]'' was carried from Asia to South America and this accelerated the transmission of the virus. By 1950, more than six million citrus trees had been killed by the virus in [[São Paulo]], Brazil.&lt;ref name="Levins, p. 185"/&gt; CTV and citrus trees probably [[Coevolution|coevolved]] for centuries in their original countries. The dispersal of CTV to other regions and its interaction with new citrus varieties resulted in devastating outbreaks of plant diseases.&lt;ref name="pmid18705856"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moreno P, Ambrós S, Albiach-Martí MR, Guerri J, Peña L |title=Citrus tristeza virus: a pathogen that changed the course of the citrus industry |journal=Molecular Plant Pathology |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=251–268 |year=2008  |pmid=18705856 |doi=10.1111/j.1364-3703.2007.00455.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the problems caused by the introduction&amp;nbsp;– by humans&amp;nbsp;– of plant viruses, many countries have strict importation controls on any materials that can harbour dangerous plant viruses or their insect vectors.&lt;ref&gt;Thresh, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging viruses==
{{see also|Emergent virus}}
Emerging viruses are those that have only relatively recently infected the host species.&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;Crawford (2011), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, many emerging viruses have come from other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2011), pp. 34–50&lt;/ref&gt; When viruses jump to other species the diseases caused in humans are called ''[[zoonoses]]'' or ''zoonotic infections''.&lt;ref&gt;Levins, p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;

===SARS===
{{main|SARS}}
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a new type of [[coronavirus]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahy, (b) p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans,&lt;ref name="pmid22094080"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weiss SR, Leibowitz JL |title=Coronavirus pathogenesis |journal=Advances in Virus Research |volume=81|pages=85–164 |year=2011 |pmid=22094080 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385885-6.00009-2 |series=Advances in Virus Research |isbn=978-0-12-385885-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt; The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2011), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.&lt;ref&gt;Dubovi,  p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Nile virus===
{{main|West Nile virus}}
West Nile virus, a flavivirus,  was first identified in 1937 when it was found in the blood of a feverish woman. The virus, which is carried by mosquitoes and birds, caused outbreaks of infection in North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s and by the 1960s horses in Europe  fell victim. The largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in [[Cape Province]], South Africa and 10,000 people became ill.&lt;ref name="Mahy"&gt;Mahy, (b) pp. 504–505&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing frequency of epidemics and epizootics (in horses) began in 1996, around the Mediterranean basin, and by 1999 the virus had reached New York City. Since then the virus has spread throughout the US.&lt;ref name="Mahy" /&gt; In the US, mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in late summer, and the number of cases of the disease increases in mid July to early September. When the weather becomes colder, the mosquitoes die and the risk of disease decreases.&lt;ref name="pmid23860989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Petersen LR, Brault AC, Nasci RS |title=West Nile virus: review of the literature |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=310 |issue=3 |pages=308–315 |date=July 2013 |pmid=23860989 |pmc=4563989 |doi=10.1001/jama.2013.8042}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, many outbreaks have occurred;  in 2000 a surveillance programme began in the UK to monitor the incidence of the virus in humans, dead birds, mosquitoes and horses.&lt;ref name="pmid17054715"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morgan D |title=Control of arbovirus infections by a coordinated response: West Nile Virus in England and Wales |journal=FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=305–312 |year=2006  |pmid=17054715 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-695X.2006.00159.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosquito ''([[Culex modestus]])'' that can carry the virus breeds on the marshes of north [[Kent]].

===Nipah virus===
{{main|Henipavirus}}
In 1997 an outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford (2011), p. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; A new [[Paramyxoviridae|paramyxovirus]] was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named [[Nipah virus]], after the village where he had lived. The infection was caused by a virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.&lt;ref name="pmid16329551"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chua KB, Chua BH, Wang CW |title=Anthropogenic deforestation, El Niño and the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia |journal=The Malaysian Journal of Pathology |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=15–21 |year=2002  |pmid=16329551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viral haemorrhagic fevers===
{{main|Viral hemorrhagic fever}}
[[File:Marburg virus.jpg|thumb|[[Marburg virus]]]]
Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the ''[[Filoviridae]]''. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause [[viral hemorrhagic fever|viral haemorrhagic fever]], and include the [[Ebola]] and [[Marburg virus]]es. The Marburg virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 after an outbreak in [[Angola]]. Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, there were 252 cases including 227 deaths.&lt;ref name="pmid16775337"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Towner JS, Khristova ML, Sealy TK, Vincent MJ, Erickson BR, Bawiec DA, Hartman AL, Comer JA, Zaki SR, Ströher U, Gomes da Silva F, del Castillo F, Rollin PE, Ksiazek TG, Nichol ST |title=Marburgvirus genomics and association with a large hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Angola |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=80 |issue=13 |pages=6497–6516 |year=2006  |pmid=16775337 |pmc=1488971 |doi=10.1128/JVI.00069-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the grandmother's funeral, which was attended  by her family and caregivers, the disease spread to neighbouring villages. By March 2014 the outbreak was severe enough to raise the concern of local health officials who reported it to the Guinean Ministry of Health. By the middle of the year the epidemic had spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;Quammen, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2015, the World Health Organization reported over 27,000 cases of the disease, which had resulted in more than 11,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-24-june-2015|title=Ebola Situation Report - 24 June 2015|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beneficial viruses ==

Sir [[Peter Medawar]] (1915–1987) described a virus as "a piece of bad news wrapped in a protein coat".&lt;ref name="isbn0-07-160402-2"&gt;Quoted in: {{cite book |vauthors=Peterson E, Ryan KJ, Ahmad N |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology |edition=5th |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |year=2010 |page=101 |isbn=0-07-160402-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the [[bacteriophage]]s, viruses had a well-deserved reputation for being nothing but the cause of diseases and death. The discovery of the abundance of viruses and their overwhelming presence in many ecosystems has led modern virologists to reconsider their role in the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name="pmid19811946"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thurber RV |title=Current insights into phage biodiversity and biogeography |journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=582–587 |year=2009 |pmid=19811946 |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2009.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that there are about 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; viruses on Earth.

'''Social Networking Pedagogy''' is a [[philosophy of education]] described by curriculum theorists [[Thomas Patrick Huston]] and [http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Hallie DeCatherine Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} as a form of learner-driven [[participatory culture]] where the user’s experience is reciprocal, consisting of a range of input and output experiences mediated by [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies.  The range of individual and unique differentiated user experiences form a composite impression on the individual which functions as an [[Epistemology|epistemic form]] of how we come to know and experience the world and its social, cultural, political and economic realities.     

In educational settings, social networking pedagogical approaches place [[Social_network|social networking]] technologies at their core, thus presenting expansive opportunities for education to extend the [[curriculum]] beyond the traditional walls of educational institutions by reaching into the daily-lived experiences of individuals. The [[Archive|archival]] features and lack of [[Temporality|temporal]] constraints associated with Internet technologies sustain continually changing currents that educators can connect to [[Student_voice|student-driven]] interests by engaging them with [[Trending_topic#Trends|trending topics]].  Through Social Network Pedagogy, educators can develop a teaching [[Praxis_(process)|praxis]] where the classroom and social space blend and individuals’ creative contributions are acknowledged for their cultural value.  

[http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?TabId=16364 Jones]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [[Thomas_Patrick_Huston|Huston]] began theorizing the development of Social Networking Pedagogy during their tenure as doctoral students at the [[Indiana University School of Education]] where they were colleagues in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120507204235/http://education.indiana.edu/Default.aspx?alias=education.indiana.edu%2Fedci Department of Curriculum and Instruction].  They point to the fields of [[cultural studies]] and [[critical pedagogy]], especially the contributions of [http://davidtrend.net/ David Trend] with his book [https://books.google.com/books/about/Cultural_Pedagogy.html?id=B5kYZvntIEwC Cultural Pedagogy" Art, Education, Politics] and critical theorist [[Henry Giroux]].

The name "'''Whitechapel Boys'''" identifies a loosely-knit group of Anglo-[[Jewish]] writers and artists of the early 20th century.  It is named after [[Whitechapel]], which contained one of London's main Jewish settlements and from which many of its members came.  These members included [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Joseph Leftwich]], Jacob Kramer, Morris Goldstein, [[Stephen Winsten]], [[John Rodker]], [[Lazarus Aaronson]] and its only female member, [[Clara Birnberg]].&lt;ref name="Dickson&amp;MacDougall"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickson |first1=Rachel |last2=MacDougall |first2=Sarah |year=2004 |title=The Whitechapel Boys |journal=[[Jewish Quarterly]] |publisher=Routledge |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=29–34 |doi=10.1080/0449010X.2004.10706848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacDougall |first=Sarah |editor-last1=Walsh |editor-first1=Michael J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">'''Willy Moog''' (also: Wilhelm or Willi Moog; born 22 January 1888 in [[Sinntal|Neuengronau]] (community of Sinntal) – 24 October 1935 in [[Braunschweig]]) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[educator]].

== Life ==

Willy Moog studied from 1906 to 1909 in [[Berlin]], [[Munich]] and [[Gießen]]; his areas of primary focus were Germanic Studies and Philosophy. He was inspired by the Berlin lectures of [[Georg Simmel]] and studied Neo-Kantianism with the school around [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. 1915-1918 he served, against his will, as soldier in [[World War I]], at a customs office at the Prussian-Polish-Russian border.  In 1919, Moog married Mathilde Buss (1884-1958), an artist painter and lyric.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry "Moog, Willy" in ''Stadtlexikon Darmstadt'', Darmstadt 2006 (in German; Dictionary on the history of the city Darmstadt in Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had one daughter, Marianne Moog-Hoff (1921-1999), who during [[World War II]] emigrated to [[Oslo]] in Norway and married a Norwegian.

In the early 1930s, Moog faced severe problems with the [[Nazi]] government, who ruled the federal state of Braunschweig, impersonated by president [[Dietrich Klagges]], before [[Adolf Hitler]] came into power.  Moog committed suicide in fall 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicole C. Karafyllis]]: ''Willy Moog (1888-1935): Ein Philosophenleben''. Freiburg: Karl Alber (2015, in German), chapter III.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1909 he wrote a dissertation on the psychology of literature under the supervision of [[Karl Groos]] at the [[Universität Gießen]], entitled "Natur und Ich in Goethes Lyrik" (''Nature and I in Goethe's lyrics'').  During the First World War, Moog published his first book ''Kant's views on Peace and War'' (1917). Moog was a fervent [[pacifist]]. In 1919, he accomplished his [[habilitation]] at [[Universität Greifswald]] with the book on ''Logik, Psychologie und Psychologismus'', a then well-known classic on the interdisciplinary debates on [[psychologism]]. In Greifswald, he also learned about the philosophy of [[William James]] through one of his peers, [[Johannes Rehmke]].

In 1924 Moog became Full Professor of Philosophy, Pedagigcs and Psychology at [[Braunschweig University of Technology]].  From 1927-1930 he was Dean of the Faculty of Cultural Studies. In 1930, his renowned book ''Hegel und die Hegelsche Schule'' was published and received international attention.  It was translated into Spanish by [[José Gaos]] in 1931. Moog extensively contributed to the [[history of philosophy]], on which he wrote two textbooks, allied by a two volume set on the ''History of [[Pedagogics]]'' (Vol. I, 1927; Vol. II 1933, 9th ed. 1991). With the help of [[Max Frischeisen-Köhler]], the co-edited Volume III of [[Friedrich Ueberweg]] ''Grundriß der Geschichte der Philosophie'' (on early modern philosophy) appeared in 1924. Moog was well connected to the philosophers of his time, among them [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Arthur Liebert]], [[Helmuth Plessner]], [[Heinrich Scholz]] and [[Max Wentscher]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis: ''Willy Moog (1888-1935): Ein Philosophenleben''. Freiburg: Karl Alber (2015, in German), chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A long-term research project on Moog is located at the philosophy department of [[Technische Universität Braunschweig|Technischen Universität Braunschweig]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/philosophie/historie |title=Zur Historie des Seminars |author=Nicole Karafyllis |publisher=[[Technische Universität Braunschweig]] |date=2011-12-15 |access-date=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first biography on Moog, written by philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], has been published in January 2015 at the German Karl Alber Verlag in [[Freiburg]]. During her biographical research, she found out that Willy Moog's relatives are directly related to the US-American pioneer of synthesizer [[Robert Moog]] (whose grandfather came from the region around [[Marburg]] in Germany).
