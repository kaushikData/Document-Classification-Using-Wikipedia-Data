The majority of [[Islam]]ic commentators do not believe that [[Ali]] [[Patronymic#Arabic|ibn]] [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]] ({{lang-ar|عَـلِي ابْـن أَبُـو طَـالِـب|‘Alī ibn Abū Ṭālib}}) is mentioned explicitly in the [[Quran]].{{efn|An exception is in [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]]'s Kitab al-Munazarat, there is a specific mention of the words ''‘Aliyyan'' ({{lang-ar|عَـلِـيًّـا}}), ''‘Aliyyun'' ({{lang-ar|عَـلِيٌّ}}) and ''‘Alayya'' ({{lang-ar|عَـلَيَّ}}) in the [[Quran]] which, he believes, according to grammatical rules are the names to [[Ali]]. Examples of these, he says, are the following verses: ''In the (mother of the Book which is with Us, he is Ali, full of wisdom'';{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#43:4 Quran, 43: 4]}} ''We appointed for them Ali as a voice of truth'';{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#19:50 Quran, 19: 50]}} and ''This is the straight path of Ali''{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#15:41 Quran, 15: 41]}}&lt;ref name="Leaman"/&gt; }}&lt;ref name="Leaman"/&gt; However, [[Shia|Shi'ite]] scholars and some [[Sunni]] scholars interpret many Quranic verses as referring to Ali. Shi'ite scholars also believe other [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imams]] have been referred in the Quran. They believe Imams are referred to as "the signs of [[God in Islam|Allah]], the way, the straight path, the light of [[Allah]], the inheritors of the Book, the people of knowledge, the holders of authority and other such designations,"&lt;ref name="Leaman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Momen "&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'ite sources state, [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] answers: "Allah revealed [[Salat]] to his Prophet but never said of three or four [[Rakat]]s, revealed [[Zakat]] but did not mention to its details, revealed [[Hajj]] but did not count its [[Tawaf]] and the Prophet interpreted their details. Allah revealed this verse and Prophet said this verse is about Ali, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] and the other [[Twelve Imams]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naseri|first1=AliAkbar|title=Imamat and Shifa'at|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feyrahi|first1=Davoud|title=General coordinates of Imaamat|journal=Shia Studies Quarterly|issue=3 and 4|url=http://farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8406130237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'ite scholars, thus, have argued that a quarter of Qur'anic verses are stating the station of imams.&lt;ref name="Momen "/&gt; Such a view is rejected by Sunni scholars, who argue that some of these verses instead refer to the [[Quraysh]] or [[Muhammad's wives]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{Cite quran|3|61| translator=    s| quote= "Surely the case of Jesus is like the case of Adam. He created him out of dust, then he said to him, "Be', and he was. This is the truth from thy Lord, so be thou not of those who doubt.

In the year 10 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (631/32 CE), a Christian envoy from [[Najran]] (now in southwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]) came to [[Muhammad]] to debate doctrines regarding [[Jesus in Islam|‘Īsā]] ({{lang-ar|عِـيْـسَى}}, [[Jesus]]). After Muhammad likened Jesus' miraculous birth to the creation of [[Islamic view of Adam|Ādam]] ({{lang-ar|آدَم}}, [[Adam]]),{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#3:59 Quran, 3: 59]}}—who was born to neither a mother nor a father — and when the Christians did not accept the Islamic doctrine about Jesus, Muhammad was instructed to call them to [[Event of Mubahala|Mubahalah]] where each party should ask God to destroy the false party and their families&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni historians, except [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]] who do not name the participants, mention Muhammad, [[Fatimah]], Hasan and Husayn, and some agree with the Shi'ite tradition that Ali was also among the participants in this event on the side of Muhammad. Accordingly, in the [[Event of Mubahala#Verse of Mubahalah|verse of Mubahalah]] it is argued that the phrase "our sons" is representative of Hasan and Husayn, "our women" would refer to Fatimah, and that "ourselves" would be Muhammad and Ali.&lt;ref name="Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|author-link=Oliver Leaman|title=The Quran: an Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] e-Library|isbn=978-0-415-32639-1|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madelung 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mavani" /&gt;

In the Shi'ite version of the [[Farewell Sermon]], immediately after Muhammad had finished [[The event of Ghadir Khumm#The sermon|his sermon]] at Ghadir Khumm, the following verse of the Quran was revealed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=al-Bahrani|first1=Seyyed Hashim|title=Al-Burhan Fi Tafsir al-Quran|volume=1|pages=434–437|title-link=Al-Burhan Fi Tafsir al-Quran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Makarem Shirazi|first1=Naser|title=Tafsir Nemooneh|volume=4|pages=263–271|title-link=Tafsir Nemooneh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobhani|first1=Ja'far|title=Al-Iman va al-Kofr fi al-Ketab va al-Sunnah|volume=1|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion (5:3).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Abu Dhar al-Ghifari]], one of the earliest converts to Islam, was said to have related the following [[hadith]] to [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tha'labi]], the [[Sunni]] author of the ''[[Tafsir al-Thalabi]]'':{{sfnp|Shomali|2004|pp=140–142}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;One day, I was praying with [[Muhammad in Islam|the Prophet]] in the mosque when a beggar walked in. No one responded to his pleas. The beggar raised his hands towards the heavens and said, "[[Allah]]! Be a witness that I came to the [[Prophet's Mosque]] and no one gave me anything." Imam Ali ([[Peace be upon him (Islam)|a]]) was bowing during his prayer at that time. He pointed his little finger, on which was a ring, towards the beggar who came forward and took away the ring. The incident occurred in the Prophet's presence, and he raised his face towards heaven and prayed:&lt;blockquote&gt;"O Lord! my brother [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] had begged of Thee to open his breast and to make his work easy for him, to loosen the knot of his tongue so that people might understand him, and to appoint from among his relations his brother, as his ''wali'', and to strengthen his back with [[Aaron|Harun]] and to make Harun his partner in his work. O Allah! Thou said to Musa, 'We will strengthen thy arm with thy brother. No one will now have access to either of you!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|20|25|36|style=ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; O Allah! I am Muhammad and Thou hast given me distinction. Open my breast for me, make my work easy for me, and from my family appoint my brother Ali as my ''wali''.

{{main|The verse of purification}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{Cite quran|33|33| translator=    s| quote= And stay in your houses and do not display your finery like the displaying of the [[Jahiliyyah|Ignorance]] of yore; and keep up the Salah, and pay the Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger.

According to [[Wilferd Madelung]], "the great majority of the reports quoted by al-Tabari in his commentary on this verse support this interpretation."{{efn|See Tabari, Jarir XXII, 5–7.}}{{efn|Madelung writes "the verse addressed to the wives of the Prophet: 'Stay in your houses, and do not show yourselves in spectacular fashion like that of the former time of ignorance. Perform the prayer, give alms, and obey God and His Messenger. God desires only to remove defilement from you, o people of the house (ahl al-bayt)^ and to purify you (yutahhirakum) completely' (XXXIII 33). Who are the 'people of the house' here? The pronoun referring to them is in the masculine plural, while the preceding part of the verse is in the feminine plural. This change of gender has evidently contributed to the birth of various accounts of a legendary character, attaching the latter part of the verse to the five People of the Mantle ahl al-kisa: Muhammad, Ali, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, [[Ibn Kathir]], in his tafsir of the verse, says "the [Sunni] scholars are unanimously agreed that they ([[Muhammad's wives]]) were the reason for revelation in this case&amp;nbsp;... but others may be included by way of generalization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir|publisher=IslamKotob|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Paleo-Balkan languages}}

The '''Balkan sprachbund''' or '''Balkan language area''' is the [[sprachbund|ensemble]] of [[areal feature]]s—similarities in grammar, syntax, vocabulary and phonology—among the languages of the [[Balkans]]. Several features are found across these languages though not all need apply to every single language. The languages in question may be wholly unrelated, belonging to various branches of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] (such as [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Hellenic languages|Greek]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]) or even outside of Indo-European (such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]]). Some of the languages use these features for their standard language (i.e. those whose homeland lies almost entirely within the region) whilst other populations to whom the land is not a cultural pivot (as they have wider communities outside of it) may still adopt the features for their local register.

While they may share little vocabulary, their grammars have very extensive similarities; for example they have similar [[grammatical case|case]] and [[verb conjugation]] systems and have all become more [[Analytic language|analytic]], although to differing degrees.

==History==
[[File:Andree64-1.jpg|thumb|right|Ethnic composition map of the [[Balkans]] from [[Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas]], 1st Edition, Leipzig 1881]]
The earliest scholar to notice the similarities between Balkan languages belonging to different families was the [[Slovenia]]n scholar [[Jernej Kopitar]] in 1829.&lt;ref name="kopitar"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kopitar | first =  Jernej K. | year = 1829 | title = Albanische, walachische und bulgarische Sprache | journal = Jahrbücher der Literatur (Wien) | volume = 46 | pages = 59–106 | isbn = 3-89131-038-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[August Schleicher]] (1850)&lt;ref name="schleicher"&gt;August Schleicher, ''Linguistische Untersuchungen'', vol. 2: ''Die Sprachen Europas in systematischer Übersicht''. Bonn: H. B. König, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt; more explicitly developed the concept of [[areal linguistics|areal relationships]] as opposed to genetic ones, and [[Franc Miklošič]] (1861)&lt;ref name="miklosich"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miklosich | first = F. | year = 1861 |title = Die slavischen Elemente im Rumunischen | journal = Denkschriften der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philosophisch-historische Classe| volume= 12 | pages = 1–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the relationships of Balkan Slavic and Romance more extensively.

[[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] (1923),&lt;ref name=Trubetzkoy&gt;{{cite journal | last = Trubetzkoy | first = N.S. | title= Vavilonskaja bašnja i smešenie jazykov | journal = Evrazijskij vremennik | volume = 3 | year = 1923 | pages= 107–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kristian Sandfeld-Jensen]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;K. Sandfeld, ''Balkanfilologien: En oversigt over dens resultater og problemer''. Copenhagen: Lunp, 1926; translated into French as ''Linguistique balkanique: problèmes et résultats''. Paris: Champion, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gustav Weigand]] (1925, 1928)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weigand |first=Gustav |title= Vorwort, zugleich Programm des Balkan-Archivs |journal=Balkan-Archiv.  |volume=1|year=1925 | pages=V–XV}}; Gustav Weigand, “Texte zur vergleichenden Syuntax der Balkansprachen”, ''Balkan Archiv'' IV (1928): 53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the theory in the 1920s and 1930s.

In the 1930s, the Romanian linguist [[Alexandru Graur]] criticized the notion of “Balkan linguistics,” saying that one can talk about “relationships of borrowings, of influences, but not about Balkan linguistics”.&lt;ref&gt;Chase Faucheux, ''Language Classification and Manipulation in Romania and Moldova'', M.A. thesis, Louisiana State University, 2006 quoting André Du Nay, ''The Origins of the Rumanians: The Early History of the Rumanian Language'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Balkan language area" was coined by the [[Romanians|Romanian]] linguist [[Alexandru Rosetti]] in 1958, when he claimed that the shared features conferred the Balkan languages a special similarity. [[Theodor Capidan]] went further, claiming that the structure of Balkan languages could be reduced to a standard language.  Many of the earliest reports on this theory were in [[German language|German]], hence the term "Balkansprachbund" is often used as well.

==Languages==
The languages that share these similarities belong to five distinct branches of the Indo-European languages:
* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]
* [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] ([[Greek language|Greek]])
* [[Romance languages|Romance]] ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Megleno-Romanian language|Megleno-Romance]] and [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]])
* [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]]—largely the [[Torlakian dialect]]s of Serbian, which are transitional between the three, rather than [[Shtokavian]], [[Kajkavian]] and [[Chakavian]])
* [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Romani language|Romani]])

The Finnish linguist [[Jouko Lindstedt]] computed in 2000 a "Balkanization factor" which gives each Balkan language a score proportional with the number of features shared in the Balkan language area.&lt;ref name="langcontact"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lindstedt | first =  J. | year = 2000 | chapter = Linguistic Balkanization: Contact-induced change by mutual reinforcement | pages = 231–246 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QqQgBVXp_H4C | editor = D.

Gilbers | display-editors = et al. | title = Languages in Contact | location = Amsterdam &amp; Atlanta, GA | publisher = Rodopi | series = Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics, 28. | isbn = 90-420-1322-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were:

| 11.5
|-

|}

Another language that may have been influenced by the Balkan language union is the [[Judaeo-Spanish]] variant that used to be spoken by [[Sephardi Jews]] living in the Balkans. The grammatical features shared (especially regarding the tense system) were most likely borrowed from Greek.

==Origins==
The source of these features as well as the directions have long been debated, and various theories were suggested.

===Thracian, Illyrian or Dacian and Albanian as successive language===
Since most of these features cannot be found in languages related to those that belong to the language area (such as other Slavic or Romance languages),{{Dubious|date=March 2011}} early researchers, including Kopitar, believed they must have been inherited from the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] (e.g. [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Dacian language|Dacian]]) which formed the [[Substratum|substrate]] for modern Balkan languages.  But since very little is known about Paleo-Balkan languages, it cannot be determined whether the features were present. The strongest candidate for a shared Paleo-Balkan feature is the postposed article. The Albanian language originates from one of these languages or possibly a mix of them.

===Greek===
Another theory, advanced by Kristian Sandfeld in 1930, was that these features were an entirely Greek influence, under the presumption that since Greece "always had a superior civilization compared to its neighbours", Greek could not have borrowed its linguistic features from them. However, no ancient dialects of Greek possessed Balkanisms, so that the features shared with other regional languages appear to be post-classical innovations. Also, Greek appears to be only peripheral to the Balkan language area, lacking some important features, such as the postposed article. Nevertheless, several of the features that Greek does share with the other languages (loss of dative, replacement of infinitive by subjunctive constructions, object clitics, formation of future with auxiliary verb "to want") probably originated in [[Medieval Greek]] and spread to the other languages through Byzantine influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horrocks|first1=Geoffrey|title=Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester|pages=227–229|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin and Romance===
The Roman Empire ruled all the Balkans, and [[Common Romanian|local variation of Latin]] may have left its mark on all languages there, which were later the substrate to Slavic newcomers. This was proposed by [[Georg Solta]]. The weak point of this theory is that other Romance languages have few of the features, and there is no proof that the Balkan Romans were isolated for enough time to develop them. An argument for this would be the structural borrowings or "linguistic [[calque]]s" into Macedonian from Aromanian, which could be explained by Aromanian being a substrate of Macedonian, but this still does not explain the origin of these innovations in Aromanian. The analytic perfect with the auxiliary verb "to have" (which some Balkan languages share with Western European languages), is the only feature whose origin can fairly safely be traced to Latin.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Multiple sources===
The most commonly accepted theory, advanced by Polish scholar Zbigniew Gołąb, is that the innovations came from different sources and the languages influenced each other: some features can be traced from Latin, Slavic, or Greek languages, whereas others, particularly features that are shared only by Romanian, Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian, could be explained by the substratum kept after Romanization (in the case of Romanian) or Slavicization (in the case of Bulgarian). Albanian was influenced by both Latin and Slavic, but it kept many of its original characteristics.

Several arguments favour this theory. First, throughout the turbulent [[history of the Balkans]], many groups of people moved to another place, inhabited by people of another ethnicity. These small groups were usually assimilated quickly and sometimes left marks in the new language they acquired. Second, the use of more than one language was common in the Balkans before the modern age, and a [[Drift (linguistics)|drift]] in one language would quickly spread to other languages.  Third, the dialects that have the most "balkanisms" are those in regions where people had contact with people of many other languages.

==Features==

===Grammatical features===

====Case system====
The number of cases is reduced, several cases being replaced with prepositions, the only exception being Serbo-Croatian. In [[Bulgarian grammar|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian grammar|Macedonian]], on the other hand, this development has actually led to the loss of all cases except the [[vocative case|vocative]].

A common case system of a Balkan language is:

* [[Nominative case|Nominative]]
* [[Accusative case|Accusative]]
* [[Dative case|Dative]] / [[Genitive case|Genitive]] ([[Syncretism (linguistics)|merged]])
* [[Vocative case|Vocative]]

=====Syncretism of genitive and dative=====
In the Balkan languages, the [[genitive case|genitive]] and [[dative case|dative]] cases (or corresponding prepositional constructions) undergo [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]].

--&gt;
|}

Note: In Romanian this is an exception, and it only applies when referring to individual countries, e.g. ''{{lang|ro|în Germania}}'', ''{{lang|ro|în Franța}}'', etc. The rule is that ''into'' translates as ”''{{lang|ro|la}}''” when trying to express destination, e.g. ''{{lang|ro|la Atena}}'', ''{{lang|ro|la Madrid}}'', ''{{lang|ro|la vale}}'', ''{{lang|ro|la mare}}'', etc but even in this case the same preposition is used to express direction and location.

====Verb tenses====

===== Future tense =====
The future tense is formed in an [[analytic language|analytic]] way using an auxiliary verb or particle with the meaning "will, want", referred to as de-volitive, similar to the way the future is formed in English.  This feature is present to varying degrees in each language.  Decategoralization is less advanced in fossilized literary Romanian ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'' and in Serbo-Croatian ''{{lang|sh|ću, ćeš, će}}'', where the future marker is still an inflected auxiliary. In modern Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian, Aromanian, and spoken Romanian, decategoralization and erosion have given rise to an uninflected tense form, where the frozen third-person singular of the verb has turned into an invariable particle followed by the main verb inflected for person (compare Rom 1.sg. ''{{lang|ro|voi}}'', 2.sg. ''{{lang|ro|vei}}'', 3.sg. ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' &gt; invariable ''{{lang|ro|va}}'' &gt; mod. ''{{lang|ro|o}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Heine &amp; Tania Kuteva, ''Language Contact and Grammatical Change'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[Torlakian dialect]]s also have an invariant future tense marker in the form of the proclitic third-person-singular present form of the verb 'to want': ''{{lang|sh|će vidim}}'' ({{lang|sh|ће видим}}) 'I will see', ''{{lang|sh|će vidiš}}'' ({{lang|sh|ће видиш}}) "you will see", ''{{lang|sh|će vidi}}'' ({{lang|sh|ће види}}) 'he/she/it will see'.

| (Erli)&lt;ref&gt;Romani dialects outside of the Balkans generally do not express the future tense in this way. Unlike the avoidance of the infinitive, which had already come to encompass all Romani varieties before many of them were brought out of the Balkans into the rest of Europe, the formation of the future tense with a devolitive particle is apparently a later development, since it is only seen in those dialect groups that have not left the Balkans.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analytic perfect tense=====
The analytic perfect tense is formed in the Balkan languages with the verb "to have" and, usually, a past passive participle, similarly to the construction found in Germanic and other Romance languages: e.g. Romanian ''{{lang|ro|am promis}}'' "I have promised", Albanian ''{{lang|sq|kam premtuar}}'' "I have promised". A somewhat less typical case of this is Greek, where the verb "to have" is followed by the so-called {{lang|el|απαρέμφατο}} ('invariant form', historically the aorist infinitive): {{lang|el|έχω υποσχεθεί}}. However, a completely different construction is used in Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, which have inherited from Common Slavic an analytic perfect formed with the verb "to be" and the past ''active'' participle: {{lang|bg|обещал съм}}, ''{{lang|bg-Latn|obeštal sǎm}}'' (Bul.) / {{lang|sr|обећао сам}}, ''{{lang|sr|obećao sam}}'' (Ser.) - "I have promised" (lit. "I am having-promised"). On the other hand, Macedonian, the third Slavic language in the sprachbund, is like Romanian and Albanian in that it uses quite typical Balkan constructions consisting of the verb ''to have'' and a past passive participle ({{lang|mk|имам ветено}}, ''{{lang|mk-Latn|imam veteno}}'' = "I have promised"). Macedonian also has a perfect formed with the verb "to be", like Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian.

=====Renarrative mood=====
The so-called [[Inferential mood#Renarrative in the Balkan languages|renarrative mood]] is another shared feature of the Balkan languages, including Turkish. It is used for statements that are not based on direct observation or common knowledge, but repeat what was reported by others. For example, Патот '''бил''' затворен in Macedonian means "The road was closed (or so I heard)". A speaker who uses the [[indicative mood]] instead and states "Патот '''беше''' затворен" implies thereby that they personally witnessed the road's closure.

=====Avoidance or loss of infinitive=====
The use of the infinitive (common in other languages related to some of the Balkan languages, such as Romance and Slavic) is generally replaced with subjunctive constructions, following early Greek innovation.

* in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Tosk Albanian, the loss of the infinitive is complete
* in [[Demotic Greek|demotic]] (vernacular) Greek, the loss of the infinitive was complete, whereas in literary Greek (''[[Katharevousa]]'', abolished in 1976) it was not; the natural fusion of the vernacular with ''Katharevousa'' resulted in the creation of the contemporary common Greek (Modern Standard Greek), where the infinitive, when used, is principally used as noun (e.g. {{lang|el|λέγειν}} "speaking, fluency, eloquence", {{lang|el|γράφειν}} "writing", {{lang|el|είναι}} "being", etc.) deriving directly from the ancient Greek infinitive formation. But its substitution by the subjunctive form when the infinitive would be used as a verb is complete. Most of the times, the subjunctive form substitutes the infinitive also in the cases when it would be used as a noun (e.g. {{lang|el|το να πας}} / {{lang|el|το να πάει κανείς}} "to go, the act of going", {{lang|el|το να δεις}} / {{lang|el|βλέπεις}} "to see/be seeing, the act of seeing" instead of the infinitive "{{lang|el|βλέπειν}}", etc.)
* in Aromanian and Southern Serbo-Croatian dialects, it is almost complete
* in Gheg Albanian and Megleno-Romanian, it is used only in a limited number of expressions
* in standard Romanian (prepositional phrase: ''{{lang|ro|a}}'' + verb stem) and Serbo-Croatian, the infinitive shares many of its functions with the subjunctive. In these two languages, the infinitive will always be found in dictionaries and language textbooks. However, in Romanian, the inherited infinitive form (''{{lang|ro|-are}}'', ''{{lang|ro|-ere}}'', and ''{{lang|ro|-ire}}'') is now used only as a verbal noun.
* Turkish as spoken in [[Sliven]] and [[Shumen|Šumen]] has also almost completely lost the infinitive, but not verbal nouns using the same grammatical form. This is clearly due to the influence of the Balkan sprachbund.

For example, "I want to write" in several Balkan languages:
{| class="wikitable"
! Language
! Example
! Notes
|-
| Albanian
| ''{{lang|sq|Dua '''të shkruaj'''}}''
| as opposed to Gheg ''{{lang|sq|'''me fjet'''}}'' "to sleep" or ''{{lang|sq|'''me hangër'''}}'' "to eat"
|-
| Aromanian
| ''{{lang|rup|Vroi '''să scriu / ăngrăpsescu'''}}''
|
|-
| Macedonian
| {{lang|mk|Сакам '''да пишувам'''}} [''{{lang|mk-Latn|sakam '''da pišuvam'''}}'']
|
|-
| Bulgarian
| {{lang|bg|Искам '''да пиша'''}} [''{{lang|bg-Latn|iskam '''da piša'''}}'']
|
|-
| Modern Greek
| {{lang|el|Θέλω '''να γράψω'''}} [''{{lang|el-Latn|Thélo }}'']
| as opposed to older Greek {{lang|grc|ἐθέλω '''γράψαι'''}}
|-
| Romanian
| ''{{lang|ro|Vreau '''să scriu'''}}'' (with subjunctive)
&lt;br/&gt;''{{lang|ro|Vreau '''a scrie'''}}'' (with infinitive)
|The use of the infinitive is preferred in writing in some cases only. In speech it is more commonly used in the northern varieties ([[Transylvanian varieties of Romanian|Transylvania]], [[Banat subdialect of Romanian|Banat]], and [[Moldavian subdialect of Romanian|Moldova]]) than in [[Wallachian subdialect of Romanian|Southern varieties]] (Wallachia) of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Mădălina Spătaru-Pralea|title=Concurența infinitiv-conjunctiv în limba română|url=http://educati.doc.unibuc.ro/madalina-spataru-pralea-doctorand/1106|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form is still the form with subjunctive.
|-
| Serbian
| ''{{lang|sr|Želim '''da pišem'''}}'' / {{lang|sr|Желим '''да пишем'''}}
| As opposed to the more literary form: ''{{lang|sr|Želim '''pisati'''}}'' / {{lang|sr|Желим '''пиcaти'''}}, where ''{{lang|sr|pisati}}'' / {{lang|sr|пиcaти}} is the infinitive. Both forms are grammatically correct in standard Serbian and do not create misunderstandings, although the colloquial one is more commonly used in daily conversation.
|-
| Bulgarian Turkish
| ''{{lang|tr|isterim '''yazayım'''}}''
| In Standard Turkish in Turkey this is ''{{lang|tr|'''yazmak istiyorum'''}}'' where ''{{lang|tr|yazmak}}'' is the infinitive.
|-
| Romani (Erli)
| ''{{lang|rom|Mangav '''te pišinav'''}}''
| Many forms of Romani add the ending ''{{lang|rom|-a}}'' to express the indicative present, while reserving the short form for the subjunctive serving as an infinitive: for example ''{{lang|rom|'''mangava''' te pišinav}}''. Some varieties outside the Balkans have been influenced by non-Balkan languages and have developed new infinitives by generalizing one of the finite forms (e.g. Slovak Romani varieties may express "I want to write" as ''{{lang|rom|kamav '''te irinel/pisinel'''}}'' — generalized third person singular — or ''{{lang|rom|kamav '''te irinen/pisinen'''}}'' — generalized third person plural).

But here is an example of a relict form, preserved in Bulgarian:
{| class="wikitable"

! Translation
! Notes
|-
|rowspan="5"| Bulgarian
| {{lang|bg|Недей '''да пишеш'''.}}
| {{lang|bg|Недей '''писа'''.}}
| Don't write.
| rowspan="5" | The first part of the first three examples is the prohibitative element {{lang|bg|недей}} ("don't", composed of {{lang|bg|не}}, "not", and {{lang|bg|дей}}, "do" in the [[imperative mood|imperative]]). The second part of the examples, {{lang|bg|писа}}, {{lang|bg|я}}, {{lang|bg|зна}} and {{lang|bg|да}}, are relicts of what used to be an infinitive form ({{lang|bg|писати}}, {{lang|bg|ясти}}, {{lang|bg|знати}} and {{lang|bg|дати}} respectively). This second syntactic construction is colloquial and more common in the eastern dialects. The forms usually coincide with the [[bulgarian verbs#Past Aorist Tense (Aoristus)|past aorist tense of the verb]] in the third person singular, as in the case of {{lang|bg|писа}}; some that ''don't'' coincide (for example {{lang|bg|доща}} instead of {{lang|bg|ще дойда}} "I will come") are highly unusual today, but do occur, above all in older literature.

The last example is found only in some dialects.
|-
| {{lang|bg|Недей '''да ядеш'''.}}
| {{lang|bg|Недей '''я'''.}}
| Don't eat.
|-
| {{lang|bg|Недей '''да знаеш'''.}}

| {{lang|bg|Можете ли ми '''да'''?}}
| Can you give me?
|-
| 
| {{lang|bg|Немой '''чете'''}}
| Don't read
|}

====Bare subjunctive constructions====
Sentences that include only a subjunctive construction can be used to express a wish, a mild command, an intention, or a suggestion.

This example translates in the Balkan languages the phrase "You should go!", using the subjunctive constructions.

|-
|Albanian
|Të shkosh!

|Meglenian
|S-ti duts!
|-
|Aromanian
|S-ti duts!
|}

====Morphology====

=====Postposed article=====
With the exception of Greek, Serbo-Croatian, and Romani, all languages in the union have their [[definite article]] attached to the end of the noun, instead of before it. None of the related languages (like other Romance languages or Slavic languages) share this feature, with the notable exception of the [[Northern Russian dialects#Morphology|northern Russian dialects]], and it is thought to be an innovation created and spread in the Balkans.

However, each language created its own internal articles, so the Romanian articles are related to the articles (and [[demonstrative]] [[pronoun]]s) in Italian, French, etc., whereas the Bulgarian articles are related to demonstrative pronouns in other Slavic languages.

=====Numeral formation=====
The Slavic way of composing the numbers between 10 and 20, e.g. "one + on + ten" for eleven, called superessive, is widespread. Greek does not follow this.

{| class="wikitable"
!Language
!The word "Eleven"
!compounds
|-
| Albanian
| "njëmbëdhjetë"
| një + mbë + dhjetë
|-
| Aromanian
| "unsprădzatsi", commonly, " unspră" 
| un + spră + dzatsi
|-
| Bulgarian
| "единадесет"
| един + (н)а(д) + десет
|-
| Macedonian
| "единаесет"
| еде(и)н + (н)а(д) + (д)есет
|-
| Romanian
| "unsprezece" or, more commonly, "unșpe"
| un + spre + zece &lt; *unu + supre + dece; unu + spre; the latter is more commonly used, even in formal speech.
|-
| Serbo-Croatian
| "jedanaest/једанаест"
| jedan+ (n)a+ (d)es(e)t/један + (н)а + (д)ес(е)т. This is not the case only with South Slavic languages. This word is formed in the same way in most Slavic languages, e.g. Polish - "jedenaście", Czech - "jedenáct", Slovak - "jedenásť", Russian - "одиннадцать", Ukrainian - "одинадцять", etc.
|}

=====Clitic pronouns=====
Direct and indirect objects are cross-referenced, or [[clitic doubling|doubled]], in the verb phrase by a [[clitic]] (weak) pronoun, agreeing with the object in gender, number, and case or case function. This can be found in Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian.  In Albanian and Macedonian, this feature shows fully grammaticalized structures and is obligatory with indirect objects and to some extent with definite direct objects; in Bulgarian, however, it is optional and therefore based on discourse.  In Greek, the construction contrasts with the clitic-less construction and marks the cross-referenced object as a topic. Southwest Macedonia appears to be the location of innovation.

For example, "I see George" in Balkan languages:
{| class="wikitable"
!Language
!Example
|-
| Albanian
|"'''E''' shoh Gjergjin"
|-
|Aromanian
|"'''U-''' ved Yioryi"
|-
|Bulgarian
|"Гледам '''го''' Георги."
|-
|Macedonian
|"'''Гo''' гледам Ѓорѓи."
|-
|Greek
|"'''Τον''' βλέπω τον Γιώργο"
|-
| Romanian
| "'''Îl''' văd pe Gheorghe."
|}

Note: The neutral case in normal ([[subject–verb–object|SVO]]) word order is without a clitic: "Гледам Георги." However, the form with an additional clitic pronoun is also perfectly normal and can be used for emphasis: "Гледам го Георги." And the clitic is obligatory in the case of a topicalized object (with OVS-word order), which serves also as the common colloquial equivalent of a passive construction. "Георги го гледам."

=====Adjectives=====
The replacement of synthetic adjectival comparative forms with analytic ones by means of preposed markers is common.  These markers are:
*Bulgarian: ''по-''
* Macedonian: ''по'' (prepended)
*Albanian:  ''më''
*Romanian:  ''mai''
*Modern Greek:  ''πιο'' (pió)
*Aromanian: ''(ca)ma''

Macedonian and Modern Greek have retained some of the earlier synthetic forms. In Bulgarian and Macedonian these have become proper adjectives in their own right without the possibility of [further] comparison. This is more evident in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''виш'' = "higher, superior", ''ниж'' = "lower, inferior". Compare with similar structures in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: ''висш(-(ия(т))/а(та)/о(то)/и(те))'' = "(the) higher, (the) superior" (''по-висш(-(ия(т))/а(та)/о(то)/и(те))'' = "(the) [more] higher, (the) [more] superior"; 'най-висш(-(ия(т))/о(то)/а(та)/и(те))' = "(the) ([most]) highest, supreme"; ''нисш'' (also spelled as ''ни'''з'''ш'' sometimes) = "low, lower, inferior", it can also possess further comparative or superlative as with 'висш' above.

=====Suffixes=====
Also, some common suffixes can be found in the language area, such as the diminutive suffix of the Slavic languages (Srb. Bul. Mac.) "-ovo" "-ica" that can be found in Albanian, Greek and Romanian.

===Vocabulary===

====Loanwords====
Several hundred words are common to the Balkan union languages; the origin of most of them is either [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] or [[Turkish language|Turkish]], as the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire]] directly controlled the territory throughout most of its history, strongly influencing its culture and economics.

Albanian, Aromanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian also share a large number of words of various origins:

====Calques====
Apart from the direct loans, there are also many [[calque]]s that were passed from one Balkan language to another, most of them between Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Greek, Aromanian and Romanian.

For example, the word "ripen" (as in fruit) is constructed in Albanian, Romanian and (rarely) in Greek (''piqem'', ''a (se) coace'', ψήνομαι), in Turkish ''pişmek'' by a derivation from the word "to bake" (''pjek'', ''a coace'', ψήνω).&lt;ref&gt;In Greek, usually in the mediopassive voice, and applicable not only to fruits but other natural products: Babiniotis, Λεξικό της νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας (1998), gives the example "φέτος ψήθηκαν νωρίς τα καλαμπόκια".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the wish "(∅/to/for) many years":

This is also present in other Slavic languages, eg. Polish ''chcąc nie chcąc''.

===Phonetics===
The main phonological features consist of:
*the presence of an unrounded central vowel, either a mid-central [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}} or a high central vowel phoneme
**''ë'' in Albanian; ''ъ'' in Bulgarian; ''ă'' in Romanian;  ''ã'' in Aromanian
**In Romanian and Albanian, the schwa is obtained via centralizing unstressed {{IPA|/a/}}
***Example:  Latin ''camisia'' "shirt" &gt; Romanian ''cămașă'' {{IPA|/kə.ma.ʃə/}}, Albanian ''këmishë'' {{IPA|/kə.mi.ʃə/}})
**The schwa phoneme occurs across some [[Dialects of Macedonian|dialects of the Macedonian language]], but is absent in the [[Standard Macedonian|standard]].
*some kind of [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] in stressed syllables with differing patterns depending on the language.
**Romanian:
***a mid-back vowel ends in a low glide before a nonhigh vowel in the following syllable.
***a central vowel is fronted before a front vowel in the following syllable.
**Albanian:  back vowels are fronted before ''i'' in the following syllable.

This feature{{which|date=April 2015}} also occurs in Greek, but it is lacking in some of the other Balkan languages; the central vowel is found in Romanian, Bulgarian, some dialects of Albanian, and Serbo-Croatian, but not in Greek or Standard Macedonian.

Less widespread features are confined largely to either Romanian or Albanian, or both:
*frequent loss of ''l'' before ''i'' in Romanian and some Romani dialects
*the [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] between ''n'' and ''r'' in Albanian and Romanian.
*change from ''l'' to ''r'' in Romanian, Greek and very rarely in Bulgarian and Albanian.
*the raising of ''o'' to ''u'' in unstressed syllables in Bulgarian, Romanian and Northern Greek dialects.
*change from ''ea'' to ''e'' before ''i'' in Bulgarian and Romanian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6455">The '''Canterbury and York Society''' is a British [[text publication society]] founded in 1904. It publishes scholarly editions of English medieval (pre-[[English Reformation|Reformation]]) ecclesiastical records, notably episcopal registers. 

==History and activities==
The Society was founded in 1904. The genealogist and publisher [[William Phillimore Watts Phillimore|W.P.W. Phillimore]] was prominent in its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Kate |last=Tiller |title=Phillimore [formerly Stiff], William Phillimore Watts (1853–1913) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online  |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/57556 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was taken from those of the two [[Ecclesiastical province|province]]s of the [[Church of England]], [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Province of York|York]]; and its joint presidents are the two current [[Archbishop]]s of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]].

It endeavours to publish one volume a year: its 100th volume appeared in 2010. The great majority of its publications are editions of the registers of bishops and archbishops (of which it has published over fifty, some in several volumes); but other types of ecclesiastical record also fall within its remit. 

The Society holds an annual meeting, which includes a lecture on an aspect of English church history by a leading scholar.

Membership (individual or institutional) is open to all. In return for an annual subscription, the member receives that year's volume and the right to purchase back volumes at a discount.

'''''Castes and Tribes of Southern India''''' is a seven-volume encyclopedia of social groups of [[Madras Presidency]] and the princely states of [[Travancore]], [[Mysore kingdom|Mysore]], [[Coorg]] and [[Pudukkottai]] published by British museologist [[Edgar Thurston]] and [[K. Rangachari]] in 1909.

==Background==

The seven-volume work was one of several such publications resulting from the [[Ethnographic Survey of India]] project which was formally instituted by the [[British Raj|Government of British India]] in 1901. The Survey was intended to record details of the manners, customs and physical features of Indian castes and tribes using in part the [[anthropometric]] methods that had first been used in India by [[Herbert Hope Risley]] for his own survey of the tribes and castes of [[Bengal]]. An eight-year period of funding was allotted for the purpose.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p240&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concept of Race in South Asia |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |year=1995 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Robb |first=Crispin |last=Bates |chapter=Race, Caste and Tribe in Central India: the early origins of Indian anthropometry |isbn=978-0-19-563767-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwNkQgAACAAJ |page=240 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government in India appointed a Superintendent of Ethnography for each [[Provinces of British India|province]].&lt;ref name=Bates1995p240 /&gt; Thurston, who had been Superintendent of the [[Government Museum, Chennai|Madras Government Museum]] since 1885,&lt;ref name=Vundru2010&gt;{{cite news|title=Mosaic of Communities|first=Raja Shekhar |last=Vundru |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2010/01/24/stories/2010012450180400.htm|date=24 January 2010|newspaper=The Hindu |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; had already conducted some ethnographic work in his studies of the [[hill tribes]] of [[Nilgiris District]], published in 1894, and elsewhere. He was appointed Superintendent for [[Madras Presidency]], while [[L. K. Ananthakrishna Iyer]] and [[N. Subramania Iyer]] were respectively appointed Superintendents for the princely states of [[Cochin]] and [[Travancore]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The reports for the two princely states were later integrated with Thurston's work to form the ''Castes and Tribes of Southern India'',{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} as were the results of Thurston's earlier researches into the hill tribes.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  The [[state of Mysore]] was allocated to Thurston for anthropometric survey but excluded for ethnographic survey.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In his investigations in Madras Presidency, Thurston was assisted by K. Rangachari of the Government Museum.

==Survey==

Thurston investigated the characteristics of over 300 castes and tribes of South India, representing over 40&amp;nbsp;million people across an area of {{convert|150000|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref name=Vundru2010 /&gt; He was a disciple of Risley, who believed in a racial theory for the basis of caste, and borrow anthropometric equipment from the [[Asiatic Society of Bengal]], including a [[Lovibond comparator|Lovibond Tintometer]], to assist in his survey of Madras. Thurston had to overcome suspicions felt by his subjects during the conduct of the survey, and sometimes had to rely on his official position as a representative of the government in order to obtain the measurements that he needed. Some believed that Thurston had been sent on a mission to kill them in order then to display their stuffed bodies in the Madras museum, while others considered his measuring to be a prelude to their recruitment into the army or to kidnap them, and yet others thought that the equipment used to measure their height was a [[gallows]]. A consequence of these difficulties was that his [[sample size]] was often as low as 30 – 60 members of a caste or tribe, and sometimes as little as six or seven.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p241&gt;{{cite book |title=The Concept of Race in South Asia |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Delhi |year=1995 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Robb |first=Crispin |last=Bates |chapter=Race, Caste and Tribe in Central India: the early origins of Indian anthropometry |isbn=978-0-19-563767-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwNkQgAACAAJ |page=241 |accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' magazine, in its September 1910 issue, described the work as

{{quote|a monumental record of the varied phases of south Indian tribal life, the traditions, manners and customs of people. Though in some respects it may be corrected or supplemented by future research it will long retain its value as an example of out-door investigation, and will remain a veritable mine of information, which will be of value.&lt;ref name=Vundru2010 /&gt;}}

More recently, [[Crispin Bates]] has said that Thurston generally displayed "often lurid, [[orientalism|orientalist]] imaginings" in his writings and has noted of the publications produced as a consequence of the Ethnographic Survey that {{quote|One of the most ludicrous was Thurston's study of southern India. Thurston was the curator of the government museum in Madras, and clearly saw the study of racial types among the Indians as an extension of his daily routine of labelling and pinning [[butterflies]] and of collecting and categorising the varieties of plants.&lt;ref name=Bates1995p240 /&gt;}}

&lt;!-- IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO THIS MESSAGE, YOUR EDIT WILL BE ROLLED BACK WITHOUT WARNING.
Only place entries here that are links to actual Wikipedia articles about notable open source configuration management software. External links, redlinks, non-notable sites will be removed. If you have questions, use the talk page. Please try to keep entries in alphabetical order. Adding unnecessary links or text to any other section (such as the "References" section) will also be removed. Thanks.

This is a comparison of notable [[Free software|free]] and [[Open-source software|open source]] [[software configuration management|configuration management software]], suitable for tasks like server configuration, [[Orchestration (computing)|orchestration]] and [[infrastructure as code]] typically performed by a [[system administrator]].

==Basic properties==
"Verify mode" refers to having an ability to determine whether a node is conformant with a guarantee of not modifying it, and typically involves the exclusive use of an internal language supporting read-only mode for all potentially system-modifying operations. "[[Mutual authentication|Mutual auth]]" refers to the client verifying the server and vice versa. "Agent" describes whether additional [[Daemon (computing)|software daemons]] are required. Depending on the management software these agents are usually deployed on the target system or on one or many central "controller" servers.

| {{partial}}&lt;ref&gt;LCFG does not provide its own transport mechanism; it relies on an external program, most often Apache. Using Apache it should be possible to do mutual authentication in several ways; however the documentation at [http://www.lcfg.org/doc/guide.pdf The Complete Guide to LCFG], Section 9.4: Authorization and Security, shows access control based on IP address ranges, implying that the client does not authenticate itself to the server via an SSL certificate; it also does not mention if the LCFG client checks the validity of the server's SSL certificate (such as via a per-site fingerprint distributed with the client, or a chain of trust to an accredited CA). It mentions that there can be a per-client password in the profile, but also states that ''"The contents of the LCFG profile should be considered public"''.&lt;/ref&gt;
| {{partial}}&lt;ref&gt;LCFG supports encrypted communications channels (SSL via Apache); however the documentation at [http://www.lcfg.org/doc/guide.pdf The Complete Guide to LCFG], Section 9.4: Authorization and Security, states that ''"The contents of the LCFG profile should be considered public"''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short descriptions==
Not all tools have the same goal and the same feature set. To help distinguish between all of these software packages, here is a short description of each one.

;[[Ansible (software)|Ansible]]
:Combines multi-node deployment, ad-hoc task execution, and configuration management in one package. Manages nodes over SSH and requires python (2.6+ or 3.5+) to be installed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html#control-machine-requirements|title=Installation — Ansible Documentation|date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modules work over JSON and standard output and can be written in any language. Uses YAML to express reusable descriptions of systems.

;[[Bcfg2]]
:Software to manage the configuration of a large number of computers using a central configuration model and the [[client–server model|client–server paradigm]]. The system enables reconciliation between clients' state and the central configuration specification. Detailed reports provide a way to identify unmanaged configuration on hosts. Generators enable code or template based generation of configuration files from a central data repository.

;[[CFEngine]]
:Lightweight agent system. Manages configuration of a large number of computers using the client–server paradigm or stand-alone. Any client state which is different from the policy description is reverted to the desired state. Configuration state is specified via a declarative language.&lt;ref name="scriptrock.com"&gt;https://www.scriptrock.com/blog/puppet-cfengine/&lt;/ref&gt; CFEngine's paradigm is convergent "computer immunology".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usenix.org/event/lisa98/full_papers/burgess/burgess.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[cdist]]
:cdist is a zero dependency configuration management system: It requires only ssh on the target host, which is usually enabled on all Unix-like machines. Only the administration host needs to have Python 3.2 installed.

;[[Chef (software)|Chef]]
:Chef is a configuration management tool written in Erlang,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chef Github repository|url=https://github.com/chef/chef-server}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses a pure Ruby [[Domain-specific language|DSL]] for writing configuration "recipes". These recipes contain resources that should be put into the declared state. Chef can be used as a client–server tool, or used in "solo" mode.&lt;ref name="alansharp-paul"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scriptrock.com/articles/puppet-vs-chef-battle-wages/|title=Puppet vs. Chef - The Battle Wages On|author=Alan Sharp-Paul|work=scriptrock.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[ISconf]]
:Tool to execute commands and replicate files on all nodes. The nodes do not need to be up; the commands will be executed when they boot. The system has no central server so commands can be launched from any node and they will replicate to all nodes.

;[[Juju (software)|Juju]]
:Juju concentrates on the notion of service, abstracting the notion of machine or server, and defines relations between those services that are automatically updated when two linked services observe a notable modification.

;Local Configuration system ([[LCFG]])
:LCFG manages the configuration with a central description language in XML, specifying resources, aspects and profiles. Configuration is deployed using the client–server paradigm. Appropriate scripts on clients (called ''components'') transcribe the resources into configuration files and restart services as needed.

;Open PC server integration ([[Opsi]])
:Opsi is [[desktop management]] software for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] clients based on [[Linux]] servers. It provides automatic [[software deployment]] (distribution), [[installation (computer programs)#Types|unattended installation]] of OS, [[patch (computing)|patch]] management, hard- and software inventory, license management and [[software asset management]], and administrative tasks for the [[configuration management]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.org/features/&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[PIKT]]
:PIKT is foremost a monitoring system that also does configuration management. "PIKT consists of a sophisticated, [[feature-rich]] file preprocessor; an innovative scripting language with unique labor-saving features; a flexible, centrally directed process scheduler; a customizing file installer; a collection of powerful command-line extensions; and other useful tools."

;[[Puppet (software)|Puppet]]
:Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system configuration, distributed using the client–server paradigm (using [[XML-RPC]] protocol in older versions, with a recent switch to [[Representational State Transfer|REST]]), and a library to realize the configuration. The resource abstraction layer enables administrators to describe the configuration in high-level terms, such as users, services and packages. Puppet will then ensure the server's state matches the description. There was brief support in Puppet for using a pure Ruby DSL as an alternative configuration language starting at version 2.6.0. However this feature was deprecated beginning with version 3.1.&lt;ref name="scriptrock.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alansharp-paul"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ruby DSL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://puppetlabs.com/blog/ruby-dsl/|title=Puppet &amp; Ruby DSL - Puppet Labs|work=Puppet Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ruby DSL is Deprecated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/3/reference/whats_new.html#ruby-dsl-is-deprecated|title=Puppet 3.0 — 3.4 Release Notes|work=puppetlabs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Quattor]]
:The quattor information model is based on the distinction between the desired state and the actual state. The desired state is registered in a fabric-wide configuration database, using a specially designed configuration language called [[Pan (programming language)|Pan]] for expressing and validating configurations, composed out of reusable hierarchical building blocks called templates. Configurations are propagated to and cached on the managed nodes.

;[[Radmind]]
:Radmind manages hosts configuration at the file system level. In a similar way to [[Tripwire (software)|Tripwire]] (and other configuration management tools), it can detect external changes to managed configuration, and can optionally reverse the changes. Radmind does not have higher-level configuration element (services, packages) abstraction. A graphical interface is available (only) for OS X.

;[[Rex (software)|Rex]]
:Rex is a remote execution system with integrated configuration management and software deployment capabilities. The admin provides configuration instructions via so-called ''Rexfiles''. They are written in a small [[Domain-specific language|DSL]] but can also contain arbitrary Perl. It integrates well with an automated build system used in [[Continuous integration|CI]] environments.

;[[Rudder (software)|Rudder]]
: Rudder is an easy to use, web-driven, role-based solution for IT infrastructure Automation &amp; Compliance. A lightweight agent installed on all managed hosts applies configuration and verifies it regularly, centralising reporting data to a main server. Pre-defined modules enable quick and simple configuration for many scenarios, and a web-based interface allows you to build extra modules.

;[[Salt (software)|Salt]]
:Salt started out as a tool for remote server management. As its usage has grown, it has gained a number of extended features, including a more comprehensive mechanism for host configuration. This is a relatively new feature facilitated through the Salt States component. With the traction that Salt has gotten in the last bit, the support for more features and platforms might continue to grow.

;[[SmartFrog]]
:Java-based tool to deploy and configure applications distributed across multiple machines. There is no central server; you can deploy a .SF configuration file to any node and have it distributed to peer nodes according to the distribution information contained inside the deployment descriptor itself.

;[[Spacewalk (software)|Spacewalk]]
:Spacewalk is an open source Linux and Solaris systems management solution and is the upstream project for the source of Red Hat Network Satellite. Spacewalk works with RHEL, Fedora, and other RHEL derivative distributions like CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc. There are ongoing efforts on getting it packaged for inclusion in Fedora. Spacewalk provides systems inventory (hardware and software information, installation and updates of software, collection and distribution of custom software packages into manageable groups, provision systems, management and deployment of configuration files, system monitoring, virtual guest provisioning, starting/stopping/configuring virtual guests and delegating all of these actions to local or LDAP users and system entitlements).

;[[Software Testing Automation Framework|STAF]]
:The Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) enables users to create cross-platform, distributed software test environments. STAF removes the tedium of building an automation infrastructure, thus enabling users to focus on building their automation solution. The STAF framework provides the foundation upon which to build higher level solutions, and provides a pluggable approach supported across a large variety of platforms and languages.

;[[Synctool]]
:Synctool aims to be easy to understand, learn and use. It is written in Python and makes use of SSH (passwordless, with host based or key based authentication) and rsync. No specific language is needed to configure Synctool. Synctool has dry run capabilities that enable surgical precision.

'''''Estoire des Engleis''''' (English: ''History of the English'') is a chronicle of [[English history]] composed by [[Geffrei Gaimar]]. Written for the wife of a landholder in [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Hampshire]], it is the oldest known history chronicle in the [[French language]]. Scholars have proposed various dates for the chronicle's writing; the middle to late 1130s is commonly accepted. Largely based upon, or directly translated from, pre-existing chronicles, the ''Estoire des Engleis'' documents English history from the 495 landing of [[Cerdic of Wessex]] to the death of [[William II of England|William II]] in 1100. The original chronicle opened with England's mythical Trojan beginnings, but all portions which document the period before Cerdic have been lost.

[[Geffrei Gaimar]] wrote the ''Estoire des Engleis'' for Constance, the wife of Ralf FitzGilbert.&lt;ref name="Harper-BillHouts2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Harper-Bill|author2=Elisabeth Van Houts|title=A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EeBxpPmDh9QC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2007|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-1-84383-341-3|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzGilbert, who, according to Gaimar in the chronicle's epilogue, commissioned its writing,&lt;ref name="Damian-Grint1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Damian-Grint|title=The New Historians of the Twelfth-century Renaissance: Inventing Vernacular Authority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5UeHRCiJJ-YC&amp;pg=PA49|year=1999|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85115-760-3|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; possessed land in [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=jhu&gt;{{cite web|title=The Date of Geoffrey Gaimar's Estoire des Engleis, the Connections of His Patrons, and the Politics of Stephen's Reign|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chaucer_review/v042/42.1dalton.html|website=muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaimar himself may have been FitzGilbert's [[chaplain]],&lt;ref name="Damian-Grint1999"/&gt; or perhaps a [[secular clergy|secular clerk]].&lt;ref name=jhu/&gt; Scholars have varying opinions concerning the date of the chronicle's writing, with commonly accepted ranges including March 1136 – April 1137 and 1135–1140. Gaimar possibly started the chronicle's composition in Hampshire and completed it in Lincolnshire.&lt;ref name=jhu/&gt;

Ian Short, an Emeritus Professor of French at [[Birkbeck, University of London]],&lt;ref name=bbk&gt;{{cite web|title=Emeritus Professor Ian Short|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/languages/our-staff/emeritus-staff/ian-short|website=bbk.ac.uk|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the chronicle was written "to provide a vast panorama of the Celto-British, Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-Norman dynasties in the British Isles from Trojan times until the death of William Rufus."&lt;ref name=jhu/&gt; It is the oldest known history chronicle written in the [[French language]].&lt;ref name=jhu/&gt; The chronicle was written with a Norman bias, stating that the Normans were the true successors to the English throne.&lt;ref name="Damian-Grint1999"/&gt; As mentioned in the chronicle's epilogue, it opened with England's mythical Trojan beginnings when it was first written.&lt;ref name=fdslive&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/13/9780199569427.pdf|website=fdslive.oup.com|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this first portion of the chronicle, known as the ''Estoire des Troiiens'', along with another early part named the ''Estoire des Bretuns'', has been lost.&lt;ref name=jhu/&gt; The present-day copy begins with the 495 landing of [[Cerdic of Wessex]] in England, and ends with [[William II of England|William II]]'s death in 1100.&lt;ref name=fdslive/&gt; The chronicle was written in [[couplets]],&lt;ref name="Spence2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Spence|title=Reimagining History in Anglo-Norman Prose Chronicles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VNHSsvRlLOwC&amp;pg=PA9|date=1 April 2013|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-1-903153-45-1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing 6,532 [[octosyllable]]s.&lt;ref name=oup&gt;{{cite web|title=Estoire des Engleis: History of the English|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199569427.do|website=ukcatalogue.oup.com|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four manuscripts of the ''Estoire des Engleis'' currently exist. The title ''Estoire des Engleis'' derives from the [[British Library]] version.&lt;ref name="Spence2013"/&gt;

The ''Estoire des Engleis'' is based upon pre-existing chronicles. For instance, the now lost portions of the chronicle, the ''Estoire des Troiiens'' and ''Estoire des Bretuns'', likely used information from the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', which was written by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]. After this, starting with Cerdic, the chronicle is primarily a translation of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' to about 959. Its accuracy is questioned by scholars, but the chronicle is nonetheless recognized as valuable in other areas of study.&lt;ref name=jhu/&gt;

'''Fearless Critic Media''' is a US publishing house best known for its books ''The Wine Trials'', ''The Beer Trials'', and the Fearless Critic series of restaurant guidebooks to US cities. The publishing house was founded in 2004, merged with [[Workman_Publishing_Company|Workman]] in 2008, and currently has eight restaurant guides in print—[[Austin|Austin, Texas]], [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], [[Portland, Oregon]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. In 2014, Fearless Critic launched a new nonfiction imprint whose first title will be the March 2015 hardcover ''Blind Taste: A Defense of Fast Food &amp; Cheap Beer'', by [[Robin Goldstein]], author of ''The Wine Trials''. Fearless Critic books are distributed by [[Independent_Publishers_Group|IPG]].

== Rating system ==
The Fearless Critic restaurant guide series uses a 10-point rating scale (1.0 to 10.0). In 2007, with the Houston guide, the series experimented with a letter grading system (from A+ to D-), but has since moved back to the original 10-point scale.

== Series name change ==
The Fearless Critic restaurant guide series was called "The Menu" until 2005. Older titles in the Northeast US still bear "The Menu" title.

== Controversy over ratings ==
Fearless Critic has incited debate on food boards such as [[Chowhound]] over its harsh ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== ''The Wine Trials'' ==
Fearless Critic's nonfiction polemic book ''The Wine Trials'', by [[Robin Goldstein]], sparked debate over its claim that non-expert wine drinkers preferred cheap bottles to more expensive bottles in scientific blind tastings. It went on to sell more than 100,000 copies in three editions, becoming the world's bestselling guide to cheap wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== ''Wine Spectator'' Award of Excellence controversy ==
On August 15, 2008, ''Wine Trials'' author [[Robin Goldstein]] revealed that he had submitted an application for a ''[[Wine Spectator]]'' Award of Excellence for an imaginary restaurant in Milan, which he named "Osteria L'Intrepido" ("Fearless Restaurant"), and that the non-existent restaurant had won the award. The expose was reported widely across the media and blogosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Grupo Colina''' (Spanish for "hill group") was a military [[anti-communist]] [[death squad]] created in [[Peru]] that was active from 1990 until 1994, during the administration of [[Alberto Fujimori]]. The group is known for committing several [[human rights]] abuses, including an eight-month period of 1991–92 that saw a total of 34 people killed in the [[Barrios Altos massacre]], the [[Santa massacre]], and the [[La Cantuta massacre]].

==Background==
In 1980, Peruvian [[Maoism|Maoist]] [[Abimael Guzman]] launched a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] with his group [[Shining Path]].  [[Internal conflict in Peru|This war]], as well as a war launched by the [[left-wing politics|leftist]] group known as the [[Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] continued into the 1990s, when Alberto Fujimori was elected president. It was then that suspected guerrillas and civilians began dying at the hands of Grupo Colina.

The Grupo Colina, believed to be mandated by Fujimori, victimized trade unions and activists that spoke out against the Peruvian government, by intimidation or sometimes murder.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Barbier |first=Chrystelle|title=Victims of Alberto Fujimori's death squads unearthed in Peru |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/06/peru-human-rights-fujimori |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
When the [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]] investigated the La Cantuta massacre, [[Nicolás Hermoza Ríos]], Commander General of the Armed Forces, put [[tank]]s on the streets and declared that he would not tolerate the Congress insulting the armed forces. The Congress largely backed down.

Later, some members of Grupo Colina were put on trial. Fujimori signed a controversial law that granted amnesty to anyone accused of, tried for, convicted of, or sentenced for human rights violations that were committed by the armed forces or police. When a court found this law unconstitutional, Fujimori signed a new law removing the right of [[judicial review]] over amnesty laws. This second law was known as the "Barrios Altos Law" because it ensured that those members of Grupo Colina who committed the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] would be freed. Eventually, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] struck down both amnesty laws.

Since the collapse of the Fujimori government, several people have been tried for Grupo Colina's crimes, [[Alberto Fujimori's arrest and trial|including Fujimori himself]], who was tried and convicted for the La Cantuta massacre and the Barrios Altos massacre. Testimony in defense of Fujimori has been offered by group leaders, [[Jesús Sosa Saavedra]] and [[Santiago Martin Rivas]], who claim that Fujimori was an unwitting participant in the Grupo Colina's actions.&lt;ref name="Peruvian Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.peruviantimes.com/18/%E2%80%9Ckerosene%E2%80%9D-says-former-anti-corruption-prosecutor-pressured-him-to-implicate-fujimori-in-death-squad-massacres/1122/ |title="Kerosene" says former anti-corruption prosecutor pressured him to implicate Fujimori in death squad massacres |first=Alan |last=La Rue |work=Peruvian Times |date=2008-12-08 |accessdate=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other trials have established that Grupo Colina was not an informal group of renegade officers but an organic part of the Peruvian state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pj.gob.pe/CorteSuprema/documentos/SENTENCIA_CANTUTA_SPE_CSJLIMA_100408.pdf Sentencia Caso La Cantuta (Julio Ronald Salazar Monroe y otros)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528234109/http://www.pj.gob.pe/CorteSuprema/documentos/SENTENCIA_CANTUTA_SPE_CSJLIMA_100408.pdf |date=2008-05-28}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julio Salazar]], former ''de jure'' chief of the [[National Intelligence Service (Peru)|National Intelligence Service]] (SIN), was sentenced to thirty-five years of [[prison]] for his role in the La Cantuta massacre. During Salazar's tenure at the SIN, [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] was the ''de facto'' SIN chief and national security advisor. Montesinos is currently imprisoned in the [[Callao]] Military Prison outside of [[Lima]] and faces over seventy trials for various human rights abuses, as well as charges of [[arms trafficking]], [[drug trafficking]], and [[political corruption]]. The operational chief of Grupo Colina, [[Santiago Martín Rivas]], is also imprisoned.

The '''Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution''' ('''LLMNR''') is a protocol based on the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) packet format that allows both [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link. It is included in [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows Server 2008]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb878128 LLMNR: The Cable Guy]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also implemented by [[systemd]]-resolved on Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/609740/ |title=systemd 216 available |accessdate=2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; LLMNR is defined in RFC 4795.

==Protocol details==
In responding to queries, responders listen on [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] port 5355 on the following link-scope [[Multicast address]]:
* IPv4 - 224.0.0.252, [[MAC address]] 01-00-5E-00-00-FC
* IPv6 - FF02:0:0:0:0:0:1:3 (this notation can be abbreviated as FF02::1:3), MAC address 33-33-00-01-00-03
The responders also listen on [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] port 5355 on the [[unicast]] address that the host uses to respond to queries.

== Packet header structure ==
{| width="700" align="center"
|-
|

|}

* ID - A 16-bit identifier assigned by the program that generates any kind of query.
* QR - Query/Response.
* OPCODE - A 4-bit field that specifies the kind of query in this message.  This value is set by the originator of a query and copied into the response.  This specification defines the behavior of standard queries and responses (opcode value of zero). Future specifications may define the use of other opcodes with LLMNR.
* C - Conflict.
* TC - TrunCation.
* T - Tentative.
* Z - Reserved for future use.
* RCODE - Response code.
* QDCOUNT - An unsigned 16-bit integer specifying the number of entries in the question section.
* ANCOUNT - An unsigned 16-bit integer specifying the number of resource records in the answer section.
* NSCOUNT - An unsigned 16-bit integer specifying the number of name server resource records in the authority records section.      
* ARCOUNT - An unsigned 16-bit integer specifying the number of resource records in the additional records section.

The '''Director of the British Museum''' is the head of the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], a post currently held by [[Hartwig Fischer]]. He is responsible for that institution's general administration and reports its accounts to the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]]. The actual governance of the British Museum, however, is delegated to its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/about_us/management_and_governance/museum_governance.aspx Principal Librarians and Directors of the British Museum], British Museum, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Museum's inception its most senior member of staff was called "Principal Librarian". The job title became "Director and Principal Librarian" in 1898, and "Director" in 1973, on the separation of the [[British Library]] from the museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7414">Many '''cities in Europe''' have different names in different languages. Some cities have also undergone [[Geographical renaming|name changes]] for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known different names for all major cities that are geographically or historically and culturally in [[Europe]]. It also includes some smaller towns that are important because of their location or history.

This article does not offer any opinion about what the "original", "official", "real" or "correct" name of any city is or was. Cities are listed alphabetically by their '''current best-known name in English'''. The English version is followed by variants in other languages, in alphabetical order by name, and then by any historical variants and former names. Several cities have [[diacritics]] in their listed name in English. It is very common that the press strip the diacritics and that means a parallel diacritic-free version is very often used in English. Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents may be listed.

Note: The blue asterisks generally indicate the availability of a Wikipedia article in that language for that city; it also provides additional reference for the equivalence.  Red asterisks or a lack of an asterisk indicate that no such article exists, and that these equivalents without further footnotes should be viewed with caution.

Between 2006 and 2008 it was funded by a European Union research project of the same name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=PROJ_ICT&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=1&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=011ca2def8a7:ccd3:321e9807&amp;RCN=79390|title=European Commission : CORDIS : Projects &amp; Results Service : Networked environment for personal ontology-based management of unified knowledge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that grouped together industrial and academic actors to develop various Semantic Desktop technologies.

== Implementations ==
Three active implementations of NEPOMUK exist: A [[C++]]/[[KDE]]-based variant, a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based variant, and a commercial version. More versions were created during the EU project between 2006 and 2008, some active beyond the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnowsis.com/about/blog/2010/11/20/how-does-gnowsis-relate-nepomuk-and-others How Does Gnowsis Relate to NEPOMUK and Others?] Blogpost dated 20.11.2010. Written by Leo Sauermann who contributed to the NEPOMUK project. 6 implementations of NEPOMUK are listed&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KDE ===
''NEPOMUK-KDE'' was originally featured as one of the newer technologies in [[KDE Software Compilation 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nepomuk.kde.org/ NEPOMUK-KDE project]&lt;/ref&gt; It used [[Soprano (KDE)|Soprano]] as the main RDF data storage and parsing library, while handling ontology imports through the [[Redland RDF Application Framework|Raptor parser plugin]] and the [[Redland RDF Application Framework|Redland storage plugin]]; all RDF data was stored by [[Virtuoso Universal Server|Virtuoso]] which also handled full-text indexing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trueg.wordpress.com/2011/09/22/about-strigi-soprano-virtuoso-clucene-and-libstreamanalyzer/|title=About Strigi, Soprano, Virtuoso, CLucene, and Libstreamanalyzer|first=Sebastian|last=Trüg|date=22 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a technical level, NEPOMUK-KDE allowed associating metadata to various items present on a normal user's desktop such as files, bookmarks, e-mails, and calendar entries. Metadata could be arbitrary RDF. Tagging is the most user-visible metadata application.

As the KDE SC 4 series of releases progressed, it became apparent that NEPOMUK was not delivering the performance and user experience that had initially been anticipated.  As a result of this, in KDE SC 4.13 a new indexing and semantic search technology ''Baloo'' was introduced, with a short transition period allowing applications to be ported and data to be migrated before the removal of NEPOMUK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KDE's Next Generation Semantic Search|url=http://dot.kde.org/2014/02/24/kdes-next-generation-semantic-search|accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KDE Community Wiki - Baloo|url=http://community.kde.org/Baloo|accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Baloo initially used [[SQLite]] but currently uses [[Lightning Memory-Mapped Database|LMDB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baloo 5.15|url=http://vhanda.in/blog/2015/10/baloo-5-15/|accessdate=2015-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
for storage, and [[Xapian]] for searching.

=== Zeitgeist ===
The [[Zeitgeist (framework)|Zeitgeist]] framework, used by [[GNOME]] and Ubuntu's [[Unity (user interface)|Unity user interface]], uses the NEPOMUK ontology, as does the [[Tracker (search software)|Tracker]] search engine.

=== Java ===
The Java-based implementation of NEPOMUK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/|title=Semantic Desktop[.]org|first=Tudor|last=Groza|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201200408/http://dev.nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/|archivedate=2007-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was finished at the end of 2008 and served as a proof-of-concept environment for several novel semantic desktop techniques. It features its own frontend (''PSEW'') that integrates search, browsing, recommendation, and peer-to-peer functionality. The Java implementation uses the [[Sesame (framework)|Sesame]] RDF store and the Aperture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aperture.sourceforge.net/|title=Aperture Framework|first=Leo Sauermann, Christiaan|last=Fluit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; framework for integrating with other desktop applications such as mail clients and browsers.

A number of artifacts have been created in the context of the Java research implementation:
* WikiModel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimodel.sourceforge.net/|title=Welcome to the framework!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refinder by Gnowsis ===
Implementation of the commercial [[Software as a service]] product ''Refinder''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getrefinder.com|title=Home  - Refinder|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; started in 2009 and a limited beta-version was released in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futurezone.at/stories/1664740/ Refinder: Das nächste Level des Hyperlinks] Article in Futurezone by Jakob Steinschaden, 3.12.2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Refinder'' was developed by Gnowsis, a spin-off company of the [[German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence| German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)]] (project lead in the NEPOMUK EU project). The start-up was shut down in late 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getrefinder.com/about/blog/2013/11/09/we-are-shutting-refinder-down|title=We are shutting Refinder down - Refinder|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no plans to make the implementation code available.

''Refinder'' uses the same data formats as the other implementations, but using [[Software as a service]] instead of the desktop approach of the other implementations.

== Data formats ==
* PIMO &amp;mdash; the data format used for describing a Personal Information Model, describing Persons, Projects, Topics, Events, etc., also used in NEPOMUK-KDE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/11/01/pimo/|title=Personal Information Model (PIMO)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228042334/http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/11/01/pimo/|archivedate=2008-12-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* NIE &amp;mdash; the NEPOMUK Information Element Ontology (and the associated ontologies NFO etc.), describing resources on a desktop (files, mails, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/nie/ NEPOMUK Information Element Ontology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230072038/http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/nie/ |date=2008-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ORCID''' '''iD''' ('''Open Researcher and Contributor ID''') is a nonproprietary [[alphanumeric code]] to uniquely identify [[scientist|scientific]] and other [[Academic authorship|academic authors]] and contributors.&lt;ref name="Nature09"&gt;Editorial (2009).

''ChemViews magazine''. {{doi|10.1002/chemv.201500088}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This addresses the problem that a particular author's contributions to the [[scientific literature]] or publications in the [[humanities]] can be hard to recognize as most [[personal name]]s are not unique, they can change ([[Maiden and married names|such as with marriage]]), have cultural differences in name order, contain inconsistent use of first-name abbreviations and employ different [[writing system]]s. It provides a persistent identity for humans, similar to that created for content-related entities on digital networks by [[digital object identifier]]s (DOIs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossref.org/01company/orcid.html Crossref &amp; ORCID].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ORCID organization, ORCID Inc., offers an open and independent registry intended to be the ''de facto'' standard for contributor identification in research and [[academic publishing]]. On 16 October 2012, ORCID launched its registry services&lt;ref name="launchORCID"&gt;{{cite web |title=ORCID Launches Registry |url=http://about.orcid.org/news/2012/10/16/orcid-launches-registry |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ORCID vs ISNI; ORCID lanceert vandaag hun Author Register - Artikel -  SURFspace |url=https://www.surfspace.nl/artikel/936-orcid-vs-isni-orcid-lanceert-vandaag-hun-author-register/ |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started issuing user identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Register for an ORCID iD |url=http://orcid.org/register |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and launch==
ORCID was first announced in 2009 as a collaborative effort by the research community "to resolve the author name ambiguity problem in scholarly communication".&lt;ref name="ORCID Announcement"&gt;{{cite web |title=RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS ANNOUNCE COLLABORATION AMONG BROAD CROSS-SECTION OF COMMUNITY TO RESOLVE NAME AMBIGUITY IN SCHOLARLY RESEARCH|url=http://orcid.securesites.net:80/media/pdf/ORCID_Announcement.pdf |accessdate=19 June 2018 |via=internet archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202055935/http://orcid.securesites.net:80/media/pdf/ORCID_Announcement.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative" - hence the name ORCID - was created temporarily prior to incorporation.&lt;ref name="Nature.ORCID_group"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to the Open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative (or ORCID) group on Nature Network |url=http://network.nature.com/groups/orcid/forum/topics/6533 |accessdate=1 June 2017 |via=internet archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060218/http://network.nature.com/groups/orcid/forum/topics/6533 |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/115257-what-is-the-relationship-between-the-orcid-initiat|title=What is the relationship between the ORCID Initiative and ORCID, Inc.? – Feedback &amp; support for ORCID|website=support.orcid.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A prototype was developed on software adapted from that used by [[Thomson Reuters]] for its [[ResearcherID]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://about.orcid.org/content/press-release-orcid-funding-and-development-efforts-target |title= Press Release: ORCID funding and development efforts on target| date=15 August 2011 |quote=ORCID also announced today that Thomson Reuters has provided ORCID with a perpetual license and royalty free use of ResearcherID code and intellectual property, giving ORCID the critical technology to create its system.}} {{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ORCID, Inc., was incorporated as an independent nonprofit organization incorporated in August 2010 in Delaware, United States of America, with an international board of directors.&lt;ref name="Wiley12"&gt;{{cite web |title=Wiley-Blackwell Publishing News: An Update on the Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier (ORCID) |author=Craig Van Dyck |url=http://blogs.wiley.com/publishingnews/2012/08/28/an-update-on-the-open-researcher-and-contributor-identifier-orcid-2/ |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orcid.org/sites/default/files/orcidincde-certificateofincorporation-121130175812-phpapp01.pdf|title=Certificate of Incorporation of ORCID Inc.|date=5 August 2010|publisher=State of Delaware|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its executive Director, [[Laure Haak]], was appointed in April 2012.&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-your-number-is-up-1.10740|title=Scientists: your number is up|last=Butler|first=Declan|date=30 May 2012|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2016, the board is chaired by [[Veronique Kiermer]] of [[PLOS]]&lt;ref name="board"&gt;{{cite web|title=ORCID team|url=https://orcid.org/node/9#board|accessdate=1 November 2017|language=en|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the former chair was [[Ed Pentz]] of [[Crossref]]). ORCID is freely usable and [[interoperable]] with other ID systems.&lt;ref name="Nature09"/&gt; ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers on 16 October 2012.&lt;ref name="launchORCID"/&gt; Formally, ORCID iDs are specified as URIs,&lt;ref name="DG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.org/trademark-and-id-display-guidelines |title=Trademark and iD Display Guidelines |publisher=ORCID |accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the ORCID iD for [[John Wilbanks]] is &lt;nowiki&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/116780-structure-of-the-orcid-identifier |title=Structure of the ORCID Identifier |publisher=ORCID}}&lt;/ref&gt; (both https:// and http:// forms are supported; the former became canonical in November 2017&lt;ref name="API2-1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meadows|first1=Alice|title=Announcing API 2.1 - ORCID iDs are now HTTPS!|url=https://orcid.org/blog/2017/11/16/announcing-api-21-orcid-ids-are-now-https|publisher=ORCID|accessdate=16 November 2017|language=en|date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, some publishers use the short form, e.g. "ORCID: 0000-0002-4510-0385"&lt;ref name="Asakura" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:ORCID |title=Template ORCID |work=[[Wikipedia]] |accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as a [[URN]]).

ORCID iDs are a subset of the [[International Standard Name Identifier]] (ISNI),&lt;ref name="ISNI-ORCID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isni.org/isni_and_orcid |title=ISNI and ORCID |publisher=ISNI |accessdate=29 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304210352/http://www.isni.org/isni_and_orcid |archivedate=March 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (as ISO 27729), and the two organizations are cooperating. ISNI will uniquely identify contributors to [[book]]s, [[television programme]]s, and [[newspaper]]s, and has reserved a block of identifiers for use by ORCID,&lt;ref name="ISNI-ORCID" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ORCID.ISNI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://about.orcid.org/content/what-relationship-between-isni-and-orcid |title=What is the relationship between ISNI and ORCID? |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the range 0000-0001-5000-0007 to 0000-0003-5000-0001.&lt;ref name="Structure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.orcid.org/knowledgebase/articles/116780|title=Structure of the ORCID Identifier|publisher=ORCID|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible for a person to legitimately have both an ISNI and an ORCID iD&lt;ref name="ISNI-AM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isni-url.oclc.nl/isni/0000000031979523 |title=ISNI 0000000031979523 |publisher=ISNI |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ORCID-AM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5882-6823 |title=ORCID 0000-0001-5882-6823 |publisher=ORCID |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; – effectively, two ISNIs.

Both ORCID and ISNI use 16-character identifiers,&lt;ref name="ORCID.ISNI" /&gt; using the digits 0–9, and separated into groups of four by hyphens.&lt;ref name="Asakura" /&gt; The final character, which may also be a letter "X" representing the value "10" (for example, [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Nick Jennings]]' ORCID iD is &lt;nowiki&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X&lt;/nowiki&gt;,&lt;ref name="Asakura" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X |title=Nick Jennings |publisher=ORCID |accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]]'s is &lt;nowiki&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9079-593X&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9079-593X|title=Stephen Hawking (0000-0002-9079-593X) - ORCID {{!}} Connecting Research and Researchers|last=ORCID|website=orcid.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a MOD 11-2 [[check digit]] conforming to the [[ISO 7064|ISO/IEC 7064:2003]] standard.

An ORCID account for a fictitious person, [[Josiah Carberry]], exists as &lt;nowiki&gt;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097&lt;/nowiki&gt;, for use in testing and as an example in documentation and training material.&lt;ref name=orcid-carbery&gt;{{cite web |title=Josiah Carberry |url=http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097 |publisher=ORCID, Inc |work=Biography |accessdate=22 December 2014|quote=Josiah Carberry is a fictitious person.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The aim of ORCID is to aid "the transition from science to e-Science, wherein scholarly publications can be mined to spot links and ideas hidden in the ever-growing volume of scholarly literature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.orcid.org/about ORCID: About us].&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggested use is to provide each researcher with "a constantly updated ‘digital curriculum vitae’ providing a picture of his or her contributions to science going far beyond the simple publication list".&lt;ref name="Nature09"/&gt; The idea is that other organizations will use the open-access ORCID database to build their own services.

It has been noted in an [[editorial]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that ORCID, in addition to tagging the contributions that scientists make to papers, "could also be assigned to data sets they helped to generate, comments on their colleagues’ blog posts or unpublished draft papers, edits of Wikipedia entries and much else besides".&lt;ref name="Nature09"/&gt;

In April 2014, ORCID announced plans to work with the [[Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information]] to record and acknowledge contributions to [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="KSpeak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgespeak.com/newsArchieveviewdtl.asp?pickUpBatch=2424 |title=Latest news on the stm publishing industry from scope e knowledge center pvt ltd |date=9 April 2014 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter dated 1 January 2016 eight publishers, including the [[Royal Society]], the [[American Geophysical Union]], [[Hindawi Publishing Corporation|Hindawi]], the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], [[PLOS]], and [[Science (journal)|Science]], committed to requiring all authors in their journals to have an ORCID iD.&lt;ref name="OpenLetter2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orcid.org/content/requiring-orcid-publication-workflows-open-letter|title=Requiring ORCID in Publication Workflows: Open Letter|last=various|date=1 January 2016|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TSK-2016-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/01/07/why-some-publishers-are-requiring-orcid-ids-for-authors-an-interview-with-stuart-taylor-the-royal-society/|title=Why Some Publishers are Requiring ORCID iDs for Authors: An Interview with Stuart Taylor, The Royal Society|date=7 January 2016|work=[[The Scholarly Kitchen]]|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members, sponsors and registrants ==
By the end of 2013 ORCID had 111 member organizations and over 460,000 registrants.&lt;ref name="orcidEnd2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.org/blog/2014/01/03/orcid-2013-year-review |title=2013 Year in review |publisher=ORCID, Inc |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orcidmembers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orcid.org/about/community/members |title=Members |publisher=ORCID, Inc |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Beirne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordjournals.com/for_societies/partner_newsletter_orchid.html |title=OUP and ORCID |last=O'Beirne |first=Richard |publisher=Oxford Journals |accessdate=15 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330144707/http://www.oxfordjournals.com/for_societies/partner_newsletter_orchid.html |archivedate=30 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2014, ORCID announced the one-millionth registration.&lt;ref name="1mTweet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mobile.twitter.com/ORCID_Org/status/533587481686704128 |title=Tweet |date=2014-11-15 |publisher=ORCID |accessdate=15 November 2014 |quote=It’s official! 1M of you have an ORCID iD! We thank the community, and look forward to continued collaboration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|11|25}}, the number of registered accounts reported by ORCID was 5,641,303.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://orcid.org/statistics|title=ORCID|last=ORCID|website=orcid.org|language=en|access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizational members include many research institutions such as [[Caltech]] and [[Cornell University]], and publishers such as [[Elsevier]], [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] and [[Nature Publishing Group]]. There are also commercial companies including [[Thomson Reuters]], academic societies and funding bodies.&lt;ref name="ORCID.members"&gt;[http://about.orcid.org/about/community/sponsors ORCID Sponsors]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant-making bodies such as the Wellcome Trust (a charitable foundation) have also begun to mandate that applicants for funding provide an ORCID identifier.&lt;ref name="Wilsdon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/HEFCE,2014/Content/Pubs/Independentresearch/2015/The,Metric,Tide/2015_metric_tide.pdf|title=The Metric Tide|last=Wilsdon|date=July 2015|accessdate=10 July 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National implementations ===

In several countries, consortia, including government bodies as partners, are operating at a national level to implement ORCID. For example, in Italy, seventy universities and four research centres are collaborating under the auspices of the {{ill|Conference of Italian University Rectors|it|Conferenza dei rettori delle università italiane}} (CRUI) and the [[National Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research Institutes]] (ANVUR), in a project implemented by Cineca, a not-for-profit consortium representing the universities, research institutions, and the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name="Meadows"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orcid.org/blog/2015/06/19/italy-launches-national-orcid-implementation|title=Italy Launches National ORCID Implementation |last=Meadows|first=Alice |publisher=ORCID |date=22 June 2015|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the government's [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) and [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) "encourage all researchers applying for funding to have an ORCID identifier".&lt;ref name="NHMRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/grants-funding/policy/nhmrc-and-arc-statement-open-researcher-and-contributor-id-orcid|title=NHMRC and ARC Statement on Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)|date=10 April 2015|publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French scientific article repository [[Hyper_Articles_en_Ligne|HAL]] is also inviting its users to enter their ORCID number.&lt;ref name="HAL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doc.archives-ouvertes.fr/identifiant-auteur-idhal-cv/|title=Identifiant auteur IdHAL et CV|date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Oxford Latin Dictionary''''' (or '''OLD''') is the standard English lexicon of [[Classical Latin]], compiled from sources written before AD 200. Begun in 1933, it was published in [[Fascicle (book)|fascicles]] between 1968 and 1982; a lightly revised second edition was released in 2012.

The dictionary was created in order to meet the need for a more modern Latin-English dictionary than [[A Latin Dictionary|Lewis &amp; Short's ''Latin Dictionary'']], while being less ambitious in scope than the unfinished ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Latinae]]''. It was based on a new reading of classical sources, based on the advances in lexicography in creating the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== History ==
Although Lewis and Short's ''Latin Dictionary'' was widely used in the English world by the end of the nineteenth century, its faults were widely felt among classicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Oxford University Press had attempted the creation of a new Latin dictionary as early as 1875, these projects failed. The OLD was spurred by the submission of a report in 1924 by [[Alexander Souter]] on the deficiencies of Lewis and Short; he eventually became the dictionary's first editor. The compilation of the more than one million quotations on which the work was based began in 1933. After Souter's retirement in 1939, [[Cyril Bailey]] and [[J.M. Wyllie]] were appointed co-editors. From 1949, Wyllie was the sole editor, and he was replaced, following tensions among the editorial staff, in 1954 by [[P.G.W. Glare]], who remained in the position until the completion of the lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary was originally published in eight fascicles at two-yearly intervals from 1968 until 1982. The complete dictionary contains c. 40,000 entries (covering 100,000 senses). It was generally well received by classicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Other members of the editorial staff included [[Charles Oscar Brink|C.O. Brink]] (1938–42), E.A. Parker (1939–46), [[Margaret Alford|M. Alford]] (1942–45), [[John Chadwick|J. Chadwick]] (1946–52), B.V. Slater (1947–49), [[David Clayton Browning|D.C. Browning]] (1949–50), W.M. Edwards (1950–69), [[J.D. Craig]] (1952–53), C.L. Howard (1952–58), [[Godfrey Edmund Turton|G.E.

Raven]] (1969–70).

In 2012, a second edition of the dictionary was published in two volumes (the binding of the 1982 single-volume edition has a tendency to fall apart under the paper's weight), removes some English translations now considered to be archaic, and presents the material in a clearer fashion using the [[Arno (typeface)|Arno]] typeface.

== Comparison with other dictionaries ==
Although the OLD was intended as a replacement for Lewis and Short’s dictionary from 1879, its lack of information about Latin writings from after AD 200 has drawn criticism from its users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Short's coverage of late and ecclesiastical Latin (if inconsistent), combined with the fact that this dictionary is freely available online, has meant that it has remained in continuous use.

The ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Latinae]]'' is far more ambitious than the OLD, but after more than 100 years only two thirds of this comprehensive dictionary has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Pearl in Palm page 14b.png|thumb|220px|Page from the ''Pearl in the Palm'' found at the Northern [[Mogao Caves]]]]
The '''''Pearl in the Palm''''' or the '''''Timely Pearl''''' ([[Tangut script|Tangut]]: {{Tangut|𗼇𘂜𗟲𗿳𗖵𘃎𘇂𗊏|L2344 L5882 L1014 L3589 L0433 L5370 L1136 L2583}}; {{zh|c=番漢合時掌中珠|p=Fān-Hàn Héshí Zhǎngzhōngzhū}}) is a bilingual glossary between the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Tangut language|Tangut]] languages.  It survives as a single complete copy of a 12th-century woodblock printed book that was discovered in the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] city of [[Kharakhoto]].  In addition, a single page from a different copy of the same edition of the ''Pearl in the Palm'' was found at the Northern [[Mogao Caves]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=敦煌研究院藏国家珍贵古籍介绍(三) | url=http://www.dha.ac.cn/03F9/index.htm | publisher=[[Dunhuang Academy]] | date=2011-01-05 | accessdate=2013-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book transcribes the pronunciation of Chinese words into Tangut characters, and the pronunciation of Tangut characters into Chinese characters, and so is a very important source for Tangut historical [[phonology]], and was the primary source before the publication of monolingual Tangut dictionaries.

==Discovery==
In 1909, the Russian explorer [[Pyotr Kozlov]] unearthed a number of texts and artefacts in [[Ejin Banner]], Inner Mongolia, including the ''Pearl in the Palm'' and transported them back to [[St. Petersburg]], Russia. There, [[Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov]], professor at [[Saint Petersburg State University]], who was aware of its value, added them to his collection.  It is now in the collection of the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] in Saint Petersburg.

In 1912, Chinese scholars [[Luo Zhenyu]] and [[Feng Ge]] visited Ivanov upon learning about the work in his possession, and were given access to nine pages, which they photocopied for study. In 1922 Luo Zhenyu met Ivanov again, in Tianjin. It was only then he would only have access to the full text, then ordered his son to make a full copy.

The Belgian scholar [[Luc Kwanten]] visit to the Soviet Union in the late 1970s, and was able to photograph the whole of "The Pearl in the Palm".  In 1982, the book finally saw the light of day when the photographed version was published in the United States.

==Content and style==

The original book consists of 37 [[xylograph]] folios in [[concertina]] format. The preface is identical content written in both Chinese and Tangut. From the sentence "How can you mix with foreigners without learning foreign words, How can you be counted amongst the Han without learning Han words" (不學番言，則豈和番人之眾；不會漢語，則豈入漢人之數) it is clear that the book aimed to facilitate the Tanguts and the Chinese to learn each other's languages.

The book contains words 414 CPC{{Clarify|date=September 2011}}, according to three powers are divided into nine categories: celestial bodies, celestial images, sky changes, terrestrial bodies, terrestrial images, terrestrial use, human body, human phase, human matters. One category is the most extensive content: personnel issues accounts for half of all the content.

Each entry contains four elements: from right to left, Tangut phonetics in Chinese, Tangut script, Chinese script, and Chinese phonetics in Tangut. The book is important in understanding and interpretation of the now dead Tangut language.

The '''{{lang|de|Schwules Museum*}}''' ('''Gay Museum*''') is a museum exhibiting [[LGBT culture|LGBT life]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], which opened in 1985.
[[File:Schwules Museum* Berlin.JPG|thumb|{{lang|de|Schwules Museum*}} House]]

==History and mission==
The impetus for the founding of the {{lang|de|Schwules Museum*}} was a successful exhibition on [[gay]] topics at the Berlin Museum ({{lang|de|[[Märkisches Museum]]}}) in summer 1984, called ''Eldorado''. It was the first public exposition in Germany of recent research on gay life. In 1985 the organisation {{lang|de|Verein der Freunde eines Schwulen Museums in Berlin e.V.}} was founded and opened its own museum dedicated exclusively to LGBT topics at {{lang|de|[[Mehringdamm]] 61}} in the district of {{lang|de|[[Kreuzberg]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://bewegung.taz.de/organisationen/schwulesmuseum |title=Schwules Museum - Freunde eines Schwulen Museums e.V. |work=[[Die Tageszeitung]] |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was located above a gay nightclub.

From December 2004 to May 2013, there was a permanent exhibition called {{lang|de|Selbstbewusstsein und Beharrlichkeit. 200 Jahre schwule Geschichte}} ("Self-Awareness and Endurance: 200 Years of Gay History"). It depicted the strategies, options and problems of gay people in seeking to live a self-determined life, find others and organise networks in the period from 1790 to 1990. In association with this theme, the social and legal background was presented, such as the anti-gay [[Paragraph 175]] of the German penal code; the associated marginalisation, persecution and [[criminalisation of homosexuality]]; as well as the successes of the [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gay-web.de/kultur/schwulesmuseum.html |title=Selbstbewusstsein und Beharrlichkeit — 200 Jahre schwule Geschichte: Die ständige Ausstellung des Schwulen Museums |work=gay-web.de |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421003555/http://www.gay-web.de/kultur/schwulesmuseum.html |archivedate=2009-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment the permanent exhibition is not displaced, but it is planned to open again in 2016.{{update inline |date=November 2017 }}

In the summer of 2013, it moved to a former printing house in {{lang|de|Lützowstraße 73}}, more than doubling its exhibition space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/neueroeffnung-schwules-museum-berlin-a-911225.html |title=Zarte Fußballer und Frauen mit Bart |trans-title=Tender footballers and women with beards |author=Ingeborg Wiensowski |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=16 July 2013 |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the world's first gay museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sara Richards |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/nprberlinblog/2010/02/schwules_museum.html |title=Berlin's Schwules Museum, Exploring The Past And Present |work=[[NPR]] blogs |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=3 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum shows several temporary exhibitions every year. These include historical exhibitions illuminating particular periods or historical developments, such as ''Goodbye to Berlin. {{lang|de|100 Jahre Schwulenbewegung}}'' ("Goodbye to Berlin: 100 Years of the Gay Rights Movement", 1997). The exhibition {{lang|de|Verfolgung homosexueller Männer in Berlin 1933–45}} ("Persecution of Homosexual Men in Berlin 1933–45"), in collaboration with the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp#The Sachsenhausen camp today|{{lang|de|Sachsenhausen|nocat=y}} Memorial]], dealt with the [[persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|experience of gays in the Nazi era]].

The museum also holds series of exhibitions on individuals, groups and organisations, such as {{lang|de|[[Der Kreis]]}} ("The Circle") and {{lang|de|Gesellschaft für Reform des Sexualrechts}} ("Society for the Reform of Sexual Law"). A continuing series of homages to gay people in public life has included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], {{lang|fr|[[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]}}, {{lang|fr|[[Michel Foucault]]}} and [[Thomas Mann]].

Through the second half of 2015, {{lang|de|Schwules Museum*}} and the German Historical Museum presented the exhibition {{lang|de|Homosexualität_en}} ("Homosexuality_ies"), jointly funded by the {{ill|German Federal Cultural Foundation|de|Kulturstiftung des Bundes}} and the {{ill|Cultural Foundation of the German states|de|Kulturstiftung der Länder}} and displaying a great range on the history, politics and culture of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dhm.de/en/ausstellungen/archive/2015/homosexuality-ies.html |title=Homosexuality_ies |publisher=[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] |date=2015 |accessdate=12 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum archive houses periodicals going back to 1896 and a collection of photographs, videos, films, sound recordings, autographs, art works, and ephemera. The library currently contains approximately 10,000 books on homosexuality.

In December 2009, the museum received its first allocation of public money, a two-year grant from the cultural funds of the [[Berlin Senate]], and declared that this would make possible a planned broadening of its focus to encompass other alternative [[sexual identities]] other than [[male homosexuality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siegessaeule.de/news/senatsgeld-fuer-das-schwule-museum.html |title=Senatsgeld für das Schwule Museum |trans-title=Public funds for the {{lang|de|Schwule Museum}} |work=Siegessäule |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2010 |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesbian.or.at/news/1260533540 |title=Das Schwule Museum in Berlin erhält Senatsförderung |trans-title=The Gay Museum in Berlin receives Senate funding |publisher=rainbow.at |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2010 |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt; above all a further emphasis on [[lesbian]] and [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesben.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6064:berlin-das-schwule-museum-wird-immer-lesbischer&amp;catid=130:historisches&amp;Itemid=132 |title=Berlin: Das Schwule Museum wird immer lesbischer |trans-title=Berlin: The Gay Museum is becoming more and more lesbian |publisher=lesben.org |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620185458/http://lesben.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6064:berlin-das-schwule-museum-wird-immer-lesbischer&amp;catid=130:historisches&amp;Itemid=132 |archivedate=20 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Settlers' House''' was built in 1845 in [[East Charlotte, Vermont]].  The house is set up at the [[Shelburne Museum]] to show visitors life in the 18th century.  The [[barn]] situated next to the house was built as a working demonstration in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315094815/http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/ |archive-date=2009-03-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
French Canadian lumberjacks probably built the '''Settlers’ Cabin''' in [[East Charlotte, Vermont]] in about 1800. Constructed of hand-hewn and [[dovetail]]ed beech and pine timbers, Settlers’ Cabin is typical of the type of structure that Vermont settlers, loggers, and trappers often built as temporary homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204192743/http://shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=25 |archivedate=2009-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Shelburne Museum]] acquired the structure in 1955, [[clapboard (architecture)]] facing obscured the log structure beneath. After moving the building’s exterior walls to the grounds intact, the Museum provided a new foundation, replaced the roof, and restored the cabin’s single interior room, stone fireplace, and sleeping loft. The structure, in combination with the adjacent hay barn, which the Museum constructed in 2001, now houses the Museum’s only living exhibition that reveals how early Vermont settlers lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204192743/http://shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=25 |archivedate=2009-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 the Museum constructed the [[sawmill]] adjacent to Settlers’ Cabin. In colonial America wood was needed to construct everything from sailing ships to storage kegs and lumber, forested by loggers like the French Canadians who built Settlers’ Cabin, quickly emerged as the most important cash crop of 18th-century America. The Museum’s Sawmill illustrates how this [[cash crop]] was prepared for market.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiftly moving water can create energy powerful enough to run machinery. While in operation, the water’s motion forced the sawmill’s saw blade up and down, enabling it to cut through logs directed into its path. At full speed, the saw cut two strokes per second, which allowed a sawyer to cut a ten-foot board in eight minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the term “sawmill” referred both to the mill building and to the machinery it contained. Shelburne’s Sawmill was built to house equipment from a [[South Royalton, Vermont]] sawmill that was operated by Jeremiah Trescott and his partner Captain Stevens from the late 18th century. The Shepard family, descendants of Trescott, continued to operate the mill until the early 20th century and later donated its contents to the Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy, Mary Evelyn Wood.History of Royalton, Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest section of the cottage dates to 1671, with additions in the mid-18th century. It is constructed of stone and timberframe components. The house was originally located at the intersection of New Dorp Lane and Cedar Grove Avenue in the [[New Dorp Beach]] section of Staten Island,&lt;ref name = "ref1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Postcard, "The Old Britton House"|url=https://statenisland.pastperfectonline.com/photo/89596DCA-B38A-4D2D-967B-243647013968|website=Staten Island Historical Society Online Collections Database|publisher=Historic Richmond Town|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was moved to its current location in 1967 when it was threatened with demolition.

==History of ownership==
The earliest section of the house was built to serve court and government functions. One of its earliest known inhabitants was town clerk and justice of the peace Obadiah Holmes, the son of early Rhode Island settler [[Obadiah Holmes]], who came from Long Island. In 1679, he transferred ownership of the property to his son Obadiah. Nathaniel Britton, an ancestor of the man for whom the cottage is named, acquired the house in 1695. Isaac Cubberly bought the house in 1761 and the house remained in his family for eighty-six years. [[Nathaniel Lord Britton|Dr. Nathaniel Lord Britton]], a botanist and the creator of the [[New York Botanical Garden]], became the owner of the house in the 19th century and deeded the house to the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1915.

{{short description|19th/20th/21st-century series of critical editions of Shakespeare's works}}
'''''The Cambridge Shakespeare''''' is a long-running series of [[critical editions]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. The name encompasses three distinct series: ''The Cambridge Shakespeare'' (1863–1866), ''The New Shakespeare'' (1921–1969), and ''The New Cambridge Shakespeare'' (1984–).

==The Cambridge Shakespeare (1863–1866)==
[[File:The Works of William Shakespeare, Vol. 1 (1863) - title page.jpg|thumb|The title page of ''The Works of William Shakespeare'', Vol. 1 (1863) edited by William George Clark and John Glover.]]
''The Cambridge Shakespeare'' was edited by [[William George Clark]] and [[William Aldis Wright]] and released in nine volumes between 1863 and 1866. Clark and Wright used the ''[[First Folio]]'' (1623) as their base text and collated it with the second, third, and fourth folios as well as all the known quarto editions. The edition modernized the orthography to 19th-century standards rather than preserve the variable [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] spelling, but generally left the grammar and metre unchanged.

In the edition, each page of a play contains a critical apparatus at the end. Where the folio text differs markedly from the quarto editions the quarto text is included in small type after the main text. Notes on variants, emendations, or pointing out or clarifying passages of particular difficulty or interest are placed at the end of each play.

In what a modern editor called "a bold move for a Victorian edition", Clark and Wright restored various original phrases that had previousøly been considered profane, where needed to preserve metre or meaning.

In 2009, [[Cambridge University Press]] reissued all nine volumes as part of their ''Cambridge Library Collection'' which aims to preserve access to "books of enduring scholarly value". The reissued editions are:

==The New Shakespeare (1921–1969)==
''The New Shakespeare'' was published between 1921 and 1969.&lt;ref name=NewCambridge&gt;Publication preface to The New Cambridge Shakespeare, ''Henry VIII'', by Philip Brockbank, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The series was edited by [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[J. Dover Wilson]].&lt;ref name=NewCambridge/&gt;

The earlier volumes of the series contain critical introductions by Quiller-Couch (signed "Q") and written in a ''[[belles lettres]]'' style that, according to R. A. Foakes in ''The Oxford Handbook to Shakespeare'' (2003), have been "largely forgotten". The textual work by Wilson, however, "proved enormously influential."

In the 1921 edition of ''[[The Tempest]]'', Wilson included a [[facsimile]] of the [[manuscript]] for ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'' and a full discussion of the copy for the texts, which afterward became required reading in the field. Shakespeare's hand in the manuscript for ''Sir Thomas More'' was discovered by [[Edward Maunde Thompson]] in ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study'' (1916)—and treated in detail in what is still the definitive study: ''Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More'' (1923) by [[Alfred W. Pollard]], [[W. W. Greg]], [[R. W. Chambers]] and Wilson—but ''The New Shakespeare'' was the first series of editions to bring this discovery to bear on editing Shakespeare. The series was also the first to apply Pollard's recognition of the primacy of the quartos to textual work.

The last volume of the series was ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', edited by J. C. Maxwell in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Prefatory note, ''Henry VIII'', The New Shakespeare, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Cambridge Shakespeare (1984–)==
[[Image:NewCambridgeShakespeare.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of a New Cambridge Shakespeare edition]]
''The New Cambridge Shakespeare'' began in 1984, and several editions were published each year, so that today, all of Shakespeare's plays and poems are available in the series. The series was designed to replace ''The New Shakespeare'' series.

The New Cambridge editions feature lengthy introductions and copious annotation. They are distinctive in appearance, being taller in shape than most of their competitors. The earliest editions featured cyan covers with an illustration by C. Walter Hodges of the relevant play in performance on an Elizabethan stage. In the 1990s, these covers were replaced with a new uniform blue design featuring a multicoloured sketch of Shakespeare's face based on a drawing by [[David Hockney]]. In the 2000s, the series was reissued again with each play receiving a specific photographic image (in colour).

The earliest editions in the series feature drawings by [[C. Walter Hodges]] that reconstruct the appearance of the plays when first produced in the [[Elizabethan theatre]]; this practice continued until Hodges' death in 2004.

Notable editions published in the series include the first ever edition of the disputed play ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' to be published as Shakespeare's as part of a series; and a controversial edition of ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' that rejects the conventional thesis that the play was poorly printed and the result of [[collaborative authorship]].

The series also uniquely produces fully edited modern-spelling editions of [[quarto]] texts when they differ significantly from the standard received text of the play. These include editions of the [[Hamlet#Texts|first quarto of ''Hamlet'']], the [[Henry V (play)#Date and text|first quarto of ''Henry V'']], [[King Lear#Date and text|quarto ''King Lear'']], the [[Richard III (play)#Date and text|''Richard III'']], the quarto of ''[[Othello]]'', the [[Romeo and Juliet#Date and text|first quarto of ''Romeo and Juliet'']], and ''[[The Taming of a Shrew]]'', an alternate version of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''.

The general editors of the series are [[Philip Brockbank]] (1984-1990) and [[Brian Gibbons (scholar)|Brian Gibbons]] (1990-present), with individual editors, or pairs of, assigned to cover separate plays and poetry.

Robert Forsythe and his wife Fiona curate elements of '''The Forsythe Collection'''. The collections are huge and include materials in three public repositories.  Of the material now in public ownership or curation the largest element is The Forsythe Collection in the National Railway Museum at York's Search Engine Archive. The central theme of their collecting is the ephemera of travel and transport. A thought that is especially driven by the recognised concept of "grey literature" (printed materials with no bibliographical trace).

[[File:Summerinbroadland1890.jpg|Summer in Broadland by H M Doughty. Jarrold edition of 1890.|300px|right]]

==Origins==

The Forsythe Collection (in a conscious manner) may well date back to the early 20th century. James Forsythe (1916-2004)&lt;ref name=wherrytrust&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nrocat.norfolk.gov.uk/Dserve/DServe.exe?dsqServer=NCC3CL01&amp;dsqIni=dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqSearch=((text)=%27forsythe%27)&amp;dsqPos=5| website=Norfolk Record Office| title=Norfolk Wherry Trust (additional)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the father of Robert Forsythe (1959-)&lt;ref name=wherrytrust /&gt; had a cousin Colin McFarlane. Colin avidly took up the Edwardian craze of collecting postcards (in his case of railways). James Forsythe as he grew up travelling the British Empire was introduced to stamp collecting. Both those historic collections remain part of the Forsythe Collection. When Robert Forsythe grew up in the Norfolk of the 1960s, his father was deeply involved in maritime heritage notably as Chairman of the [[Norfolk Wherry Trust]] caring for the [[Wherry Albion]]. James Forsythe had boated on the Norfolk Broads since his childhood. Maps and transport literature surrounded Robert. At school Robert Forsythe started to collect railway timetables in 1971 and the earliest letters establishing this collection survive at the Norfolk Record Office.&lt;ref name=farmaccounts&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nrocat.norfolk.gov.uk/Dserve/DServe.exe?dsqServer=NCC3CL01&amp;dsqIni=dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27forsythe%27%29| website=Norfolk Record Office| title=Farm accounts of Mr W.H. Knott, Stow Bridge, Downham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time Robert Forsythe became a museum curator, and met and married a librarian Fiona Forsythe. They built up a network of contributors and established what the railway world realised was a very special collection. Meanwhile as house moves forced decisions other elements of the family collections found public repositories. These embrace the Papers of Major James A. Forsythe, MBE (1916-2004),&lt;ref name=farmaccounts /&gt; in the Norfolk Record Office and the Cambridge University Centre of South Asian Studies.

==Transfer to National Railway Museum==
The transfer to the [[National Railway Museum]] at York took place in January 2009 and again in January 2012. Some 100 metres of shelved material were transferred. The essence of the transfer was the grey literature elements of the Forsythe Collection of Transport and Travel ephemera as it is described&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website=Culture 24| url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history%20%26%20heritage/art69587| title=Vast transport archive unleashes history of 20th century travel| date=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at York. This means the publicity materials: timetables, leaflets, handbills and brochures but in general not ISBN covered items nor "books" including guidebooks. Posters, tickets and postcards were also not transferred and these collections remain with the Forsythes. Nor were extensive model railway interests. Subsequently materials were used in the first APP generated at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=East Coast Timeline| url=http://timeline.nrm.org.uk/| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811013842/http://timeline.nrm.org.uk/| archivedate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another selective mention is of the material used in The Track Stars Exhibition in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Track Stars Exhibition| url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/~/media/Files/NRM/PDF/resourcepacks/Railfest%20track%20stars%20resource%20pack.pdf| website=National Railway Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TourBook''' is the [[brand name]] of a series of [[United States]] [[travel guide]]s published by the [[American Automobile Association]] (AAA).  The books are published annually in editions that cover one to five states each (depending on size).  Editions covering [[Canada|Canadian]] provinces are also available, created in association with the [[Canadian Automobile Association]] (CAA). Additional TourBooks have been published for [[Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]]. TourBooks are free to AAA and CAA members.

TourBooks provide an overview of each state or province, followed by detailed travel information for each state or province, organized by city.  The books provide listings of major attractions, lodging, and restaurants.  Highlighted attractions are identified with a "GEM" icon ("Great Experience for Members").  Most lodging and restaurants are rated using AAA's "Diamond" system, from one to five, with "one diamond" indicating basic but adequate facilities and service and "five diamond" being reserved for the highest levels of luxury and elegance.&lt;ref name="AAA_diamonds"&gt;[http://ww2.aaa.com/aaa/common/Tourbook/diamonds/whatisthis.html What Is This?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some establishments forgo AAA rating but are included for completeness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">'''Transport for London Group Archives''' is the official historical business archive for [[Transport for London]] (TfL) and its predecessor bodies.  It preserves and makes available to the public documents, photographs, plans and drawings relating to the company and its predecessor bodies, such as [[London Regional Transport|London Transport]].  It is based at TfL headquarters building, 55 Broadway, built over [[St James's Park underground station]].

== History ==

London Transport did not appoint an archivist until 1992, by which time a significant volume of records had accumulated in the vaults under 55 Broadway since the opening of the first Victorian underground lines in the 1860s.  With the formation of Transport for London in 2000, the corporate archives became the responsibility of TfL Group Archives and Records Management department.

== Material held ==

TfL Group Archives holds records from a large number of predecessor bodies, including: 
* The [[London General Omnibus Company]]
* [[London County Council Tramways]]
* [[London United Tramways]]
* The [[Metropolitan Railway]]
* The [[District Railway]]
* The [[Central London Railway]]
* The [[City and South London Railway]]
* The [[Northern line|Great Northern and City Railway]]
* The [[Hammersmith &amp; City line|Hammersmith and City Railway]]
* The [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London]]

Some of the records of predecessor companies, such as the Metropolitan Railway Company and early minutes from the [[London Passenger Transport Board]], are held on behalf of TfL by the [[London Metropolitan Archives]].

The majority of TfL Group Archives holdings are records of:
* London Transport (in its various incarnations running 1933-2000)
* Transport for London (2000–present day)

== Storage and access ==

Documents are stored offsite in the work-out parts of [[Winsford Rock Salt Mine]], [[Winsford]], [[Cheshire]], Britain's largest [[rock salt]] mine. The storage facility is operated by [[DeepStore Ltd.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepstore.co.uk/ Welcome to Deep Store]&lt;/ref&gt; a records' management company. Access to the archives is restricted and is by advance appointment only.  TfL Group Archives catalogue of all records held will be made available online and searchable to the public.

The '''Tribuna of the Uffizi''' is an [[octagon]]al room in the [[Uffizi]] gallery, [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  Designed by [[Bernardo Buontalenti]] for [[Francesco I de' Medici]] for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de’ Medici]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uffizi.org/museum/history/ History of the Uffizi Gallery], uffizi.org, retrieved 3 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; in 1584, the most important antiquities and High Renaissance and Bolognese paintings from the Medici collection were and still are displayed here. In 1737 the Grand Duchess [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]] ceded the collection to the Tuscan government, and by the 1770s the Uffizi (and in particular the Tribuna) was the hub for [[Grand Tour]]ists visiting Florence. 

[[Johann Zoffany]]'s [[Tribuna of the Uffizi (painting)|famous painting]] of the Tribuna, commissioned by [[Queen Charlotte]] of the United Kingdom in 1772, portrays the northeast section but varies the arrangement and brings in works not normally displayed in the room, such as [[Raphael]]’s ''[[Madonna della Sedia]]''.  Admiring the works of art are connoisseurs, diplomats and visitors to Florence, all identifiable.

'''''Umvolkung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔʊmˌfɔlkʊŋ|lang}}) is a term in [[Nazi ideology]] used to describe a process of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of members of the [[Volksdeutsche|German people]] (the ''[[Volk]]'') so that they would forget about their language and their origin.  As a [[neologism]], it echoes ''[[Umpolung]]'' "polarity inversion", leading to an interpretation akin to "ethnicity inversion".

The term is also used to describe the "re-[[Germanisation]]" of the German people, after new ''[[Lebensraum]]'' was conquered and the German people who already resided there would become more German again. Of course, Umvolkung in the first sense was seen as a negative process during the [[Third Reich]], while the second process was seen as desirable.

== Origin and background ==
The term was invented by [[Albert Brackmann]], a leader of the [[Ostforschung]], which was a research organization that investigated the character and the attitudes of people (the so-called "Verhalten") living in areas east of the German Reich, e.g. in Poland, Ukraine, Slovakia and Romania. 

There was a plan to conquer almost whole Eastern Europe and process the "Umvolkung", so all the former German people, who had slowly assimilated and mixed with the other ethnicities, would become more German again.

== Today's use ==
The term became a catchphrase and is often used to describe German fears of ''[[Überfremdung]]'' by immigrants or their descendants whose numbers have been constantly increasing since the foundation of the [[German Federal Republic]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}
