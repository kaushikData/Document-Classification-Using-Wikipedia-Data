'''ASSIST''' ('''&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;merican &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;econdary &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;chools for &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;nternational &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;tudents and &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;eachers''') is a [[nonprofit]], international [[Student exchange program|student exchange organization]] based in the United States and active in more than twenty countries worldwide. ASSIST places academically and extracurricularly excelling international students on one-year merit-based scholarships at American [[independent school|independent]] secondary schools.

== Structure ==

ASSIST is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization with [[tax-exempt]] status incorporated in the state of [[Vermont]]. ASSIST is designated by the [[United States State Department]] as an authorized Exchange Visitor Program and is listed with the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel. This arrangement allows ASSIST to use the services of American facilities and staff overseas and has made possible the endorsement and support of international government officials. ASSIST is able to facilitate the issuance of the [[J-1 visa]], under which some of its students study in the United States for one academic year on Exchange Visitor status.

==History==
ASSIST was founded in 1969 by Paul G. Sanderson, Jr., then [[Suffield Academy]]’s Director of Admissions, who wanted to enrich American independent secondary schools through an international educational community. Sanderson began with a class of 13 students and started ASSIST as an educational and cultural exchange program to bring talented young men and women to study in the United States on one-year scholarships.

From its original base in Germany, ASSIST has expanded to numerous other countries and has brought students from nations underrepresented in member schools’ student bodies.

After the death of Sanderson, Kenneth and Betsy Lindfors were appointed to lead ASSIST. During their 13-year tenure, ASSIST expanded substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Hall: ''ASSIST, 1969-2009. Today's Scholars, Tomorrow's Leaders.'' ASSIST, Suffield 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Following their retirement, the ASSIST Board of Directors named Robert and Anne Stanley as the third leadership team in ASSIST’s history. Today, Robert Stanley continues as President, joined by Martin Milne as Vice President for School and Family Relations, and Meg Milne Moulton as Vice President for Marketing &amp; Communications.

To date, more than 4,300 students from 51 countries have become ASSIST Scholars.

== Scholar selection ==
[[File:ASSIST student exchange class 2013-14.jpg|thumbnail|ASSIST class of 2013/2014]]
ASSIST's recruitment and interview teams travel around the world interviewing potential program candidates. In 2013, from a pool of 1,650 applications, 725 finalists were invited to an interview, and 161 were accepted as ASSIST Scholars.

Over 90% of ASSIST students earn honors or high [[Honors student|honors]] academic standing each year. Students are also selected to make contributions to the artistic, athletic, community service and other [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular programs]] and to share their own cultural backgrounds. In the class of 2013/2014, ASSIST scholars come from 20 countries, including [[Somaliland]], and have fluency in three languages on average. Their talents range from award-winning athletes to championship debaters to nationally-recognized musicians.

==Member schools and countries ==
All ASSIST member schools are independent high schools and are members of the [[National Association of Independent Schools]]. Every school agrees to accept at least one international student on a full scholarship and may also accept additional students on partial scholarships. The scholarship includes [[tuition]] and [[room and board]]. Scholarships are offered for one year only, after which the scholar must return home to complete his or her secondary education.

ASSIST reviews member schools twice annually. Each school is visited by ASSIST staff and volunteers to ensure that the programs available meet the needs of the students who apply to the ASSIST program.

The organization is active in more than twenty countries per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.assist-inc.org/about-assist/assist-countries|title=ASSIST Countries|website=www.assist-inc.org|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its head office is located in [[Suffield, Connecticut]], United States.

The '''Akhundov Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]: ''Axundov adına Azərbaycan Dövlət Akademik Opera və Balet Teatrı''), formerly known as the '''Mailov Theatre'''&lt;ref name="azerbintl"&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/54_folder/54_articles/54_opera.html Opera in Azerbaijan] by Azer Rezayev. ''Azerbaijan International''. #5.4. Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[opera house]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. It was built in 1911.

==History==
The theatre was built at the request of magnate [[Mailov brothers|Daniel Mailov]] and funded by magnate [[Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]]. In 1910, famous [[Russia]]n [[soprano]] [[Antonina Nezhdanova]] visited Baku giving several concerts at various clubs and performance venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.bakupages.com/pubs/bakustories/10004_ru.php On Baku for Those Who Has Never Been There] by Elena Kolmanovskaya. ''Baku Pages''. 31 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; On a ball organized on the occasion of Nezhdanova's departure at the local casino, she was asked whether she would like to visit Baku again. Her response was negative followed by a concern that in a city of so many wealthy people no one would fund the construction of a decent opera theatre where singers could fully demonstrate their musical talent. Daniel Mailov who had grown to admire both Nezhdanova's voice and persona during her tour decided to use this opportunity and offered her to revisit Baku in one year to attend the opening of a new opera theatre, which he would order to build in her honour.&lt;ref name="msul"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.baku.ru/enc-show.php?cmm_id=276&amp;id=56249&amp;c=1731 The Opera and Ballet Theatre] by [[Manaf Suleymanov]]. ''The Past Days''. 1990&lt;/ref&gt; According to an urban legend, Mailov and his brother were not invited to a housewarming ball of a famous opera singer from [[Baku]] whose new house (now the head office of [[SOCAR]]) was one of the most outstanding pieces of architecture in the city. The Mailovs therefore decided to erect a building of their own outdoing the "tactless" singer.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The Russian architect and civil engineer of Armenian&lt;ref&gt;[http://sias.ru/upload/iblock/763/Kazarian_140x205.pdf Armenia-Russia: The dialogue in the space of artistic culture, Materials of International symposium, Moscow 2010, p. 16 (by Dr. M. Gasparyan)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026183257/http://sias.ru/upload/iblock/763/Kazarian_140x205.pdf |date=October 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Армянская культура в 1800-1917 гг., Вахе Эрканьян, 1985, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; descent [[Nikolai Bayev]] designed the architectural sketch of the theatre.&lt;ref name="azerbintl"/&gt; However the construction of such grandiose building in a year was unheard of at the time and required many safety measures to be taken. The Mailovs decided not to wait for the approval of the City Council but were ordered to stop the construction as it violated building regulations.&lt;ref name="msul"/&gt; Soon Bayev managed to convince the city legislature and received its approval. Azeri magnate Zeynalabdin Taghiyev who had earlier sponsored the construction of the Taghiyev Theatre (present-day [[Azerbaijan State Musical Comedy Theatre]]) expressed his doubts that the new theatre could be fully constructed in such a short period of time. Daniel Mailov laid a bet: if the Mailovs did not manage to get the theatre built on time, they would offer it to Taghiyev as a gift; if the theatre was indeed built by 1911, Taghiyev would have to cover all the building expenses.&lt;ref name="msul"/&gt;

The three-shift work at the site involving 200 workers ensured speedy construction of the building. All works were completed in less than 10 months. The total costs for construction exceeded 250,000 rubles.&lt;ref name="azerbintl"/&gt; The city mayor [[Peter Martynov]] accompanied by architects and engineers examined the newly built theatre and confirmed its safety. As promised, Taghiyev paid all the expenses. The official opening of the Mailyovs' Theatre was scheduled on 28 February 1911. Daniel Mailov notified Nezhdanova of the ceremony by telegramme beforehand, and the renowned soprano became the first singer to perform at the new opera house. Most of Baku's multiethnic elite attended the event; among the ones not present was the opera singer who had not invited the Mailovs to his housewarming ball.&lt;ref name="msul"/&gt;

In 1916, the theatre acquired a resident organization ([[Pavel Amirago]]'s opera troupe) and began to function on a permanent basis. In 1920, it became a state theatre known as the Opera and Ballet Theatre. In 1925, the Azerbaijani Opera Troupe, the Russian Opera Troupe and the Drama Troupe united to become the official resident organization, and in 1927 the theatre was named after writer [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]]. In 1959, it received the status of an academic theatre.

In 1985, the newly renovated theatre mysteriously burned down. In 1987, all the restoratory works were finished and the theatre reopened its doors.&lt;ref name="azerbintl"/&gt;

Singers who have been associated with opera company include, [[Azer Zeynalov]], [[Javid Samadov]], and [[Shovkat Mammadova]].

This is most fully developed in the fourth installment wherein a remote "Army Medical Lab" is attempting—as part of a secret military/commercial partnership—to tame the monster.

The '''Black Horror on the Rhine''' refers to a moral panic which was aroused in Germany concerning allegations of widespread war crimes, especially sexual war crimes, said to be committed by [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|Senegalese]] and other African soldiers serving in the French Army during the French [[occupation of the Rhineland]] between 1918-1930.

==Background==
[[File:Reims-Armée noire(1924).jpg|thumb|right|"To the heros of the Black Army": Monument to Senegalese soldiers of the French army who successfully defended [[Reims]] in July 1918]]
Following the [[Kiel Mutiny]] on 3 November 1918, revolutionary sailors visited numerous cities across Germany announcing the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]]. The German Army had already been experiencing a series of mutinies, particularly since the failure of the German [[Spring offensive]] which was brought to a halt in July 1918. Soldiers from the French [[Colonial army]] played a significant role in defending the city of [[Reims]] which was under siege during the German attack. As one German writer put it "It is not the French fighting at Reims. France has entrusted the protection of the ancient city of coronation to black and brown soldiers. It is true that the defence of Reims does not cost a drop of French blood, it is Negroes who are sacrificed."&lt;ref name="TDM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Troupes De Marine: Les coloniaux sauvent REIMS en 1918|url=https://www.troupesdemarine.org/traditions/histoire/hist010.htm|website=www.troupesdemarine.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the evening of 6 November 200 revolutionary soldiers had reached the city of [[Cologne]], where they joined local workers and soldiers to establish a Workers and Soldiers' Council, along the lines of the Russian [[soviets]]. When reports of this reached [[Wilhelm Groener]], Deputy Chief of Staff of the [[Imperial German Army]] he no longer supported the [[Wilhelm II]]'s plan to instigate a civil war, but rather joined the call of [[Friedrich Ebert]], leader of the [[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (MSPD) for the Kaiser to abdicate. This the Kaiser did on 9 November, and Ebert became [[Chancellor of Germany]] the same day. The MSPD became active in opposing the revolution and worked with the army to establish a [[Republic#Liberal republics|liberal republic]].

Thus the [[Rhineland]] had played a significant role in toppling the Kaiser and obliging the German state to accept the armistice. Likewise, the African soldiers of the French Army played a significant role in the defeat of the [[Imperial German Army]] in the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. This battle which was a decisive victory for the allies, saw the French Army using a massed tank attack alongside forces of its [[Troupes coloniales|colonial army]]. Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] wrote in his 1920 memoirs ''Mein Leben'': "Where there were no tanks our enemy sent black waves against us. Waves of black Africans! Woe to us when these waves reached our lines and massacred or worse, tortured our defenseless men!"{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=608}} Notwithstanding this somewhat odd remark by the [[German General Staff#German General Staff|Chief of the German General Staff]], the highly armed German Army used [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]] in attacks on French Colonial Troops in the [[Battle of Reims (1918)|battle of Reims]]. The American historian Keith Nelson considers Hindenburg's view of the Senegalese as typical of German views of the Senegalese, and claims there is evidence to suggest that many German soldiers were reluctant to surrender to the Senegalese out of the belief that they would be eaten as racist propaganda that the Senegalese were cannibals from "darkest Africa" was widely believed.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=608}}{{sfn|Fraser|1989|p=13}}

==French use of colonial troops==
Following the defeat of the [[Second French Empire]] by the Prussians in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870/1, a current of [[revanchism]] developed in France which sought to regain the lost territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] which had been ceded to the newly formed [[German Empire]]. Thus politicians such as [[Georges Clemenceau]], of the [[Radical Party (France)#Radicals before the party (1830–1901)|Radical Republicans]], opposed participation in the [[scramble for Africa]] as they were concern it would divert the Republic from objectives related regaining Alsace-Lorraine. Nevertheless, French officers repeatedly ignored orders, as they lead the French Army on various campaigns in Africa. [[Charles Mangin]], a career officer in the French Army with campaign experience in Africa set out to resolve these conflicting imperialist strategies in his book his 1910 book ''La force noire'' (''The Black Force'') He argued that as Germany had a greater population and a higher birth rate than France in the early 20th century this meant that the German Army was potentially going to be larger than the French Army. He proposed that the French had recruited extensively from their African colonies to provide an almost limitless source of manpower that could counter Germany's numerical superiority.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=607}} Thus the expansion of the [[French colonial empire#1870-1939|French colonial empire]] could be seen as complementing rather than competing with the desire to oblige Germany to return the lost territory.

===Political dilemma of citizenship for French colonial soldiers===
[[File:7e RTA est son drapeau en 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of the [[7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment]] in 1917]]
One of the products of the [[French revolution]] was a concept of the nation linked to citizenship and military service. The [[levée en masse]] or forced mass [[conscription|military conscription]] was introduced in 1793 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].&lt;ref name="Fogarty"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogarty|first1=Richard S.|title=Race and War in France: Colonial Subjects in the French Army, 1914–1918|date=2008|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801888243|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=28Pd4ZoFKSgC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=race+legislation+France+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5UO_PcR50_&amp;sig=JCZx0boThOsC-33wmcHmw6N4vi0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigx_S13_naAhVpCMAKHbvdC2k4ChDoAQguMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=race%20legislation%20France%201914&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the demand that by serving in the French Army, colonial subjects should gain full French citizenship. However whilst military service provided a very clear expression of political allegiance to the state, French society had developed the idea of the [[statut personnel]] by which particularly French Muslims would have a distinct status, being governed by [[Koranic law]] administered by local religious authorities.&lt;ref name="Fogarty"/&gt; As the norms of Islam permitted [[polygamy]], this created what were considered insurmountable problems by those who defended an [[assimilationist]] viewpoint. Many of the assimilationists saw the culture and civilisation of France as something far superior to what they regarded as the barbaric customs of their non-European subjects. Another political current, the associationists advocated something along the lines of [[indirect rule]]  as practised by the [[British Empire]]. They saw the colonised subjects as having to find their own path to civilisation and relied on local elites to manage the colonial system on the ground.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Martin|title=The French Empire Between the Wars: Imperialism, Politics and Society|date=2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719077555|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pXrXQU33avQC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=French+associationism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eM2SUTCP4M&amp;sig=Z85HfetQ5mINyOIWU8Rc25gT0OA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9mM_vwvraAhWkDMAKHY-sCXUQ6AEIQTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=French%20associationism&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both, however, viewed the subject peoples as being in debt to their conquerors, who by dominating them offered the allegedly profound benefits of French culture.&lt;ref name="Fogarty"/&gt; Thus, despite the egalitarian ideology of the [[French Third Republic]] – which would theoretically exclude any [[Color line (racism)|color line]] – the development of French colonies created a quite different reality.

===Election of Blaise Diagne===
[[Image:Blaise Diagne-1921.jpg|thumb|right|Blaise Diagne, Sengalese champion of citizenship for military service]]
However the election of [[Blaise Diagne]] in February 1914 provided a champion for the demand of citizenship rights for colonial soldiers. Diagne represented the [[Four Communes]], the four oldest colonial towns in [[French West Africa]] which had won the right to send deputies to the [[Chamber of Deputies]] following the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 revolution]].
Within the ideology of the republic, having Africans and Asians fighting in the French Army was proof of the universalism of French civilization which was open to all. Unlike the British who sent an Indian Army corps to the Western Front in October 1914, which was pulled out in 1916 once there were enough white divisions to replace the Indians, the French kept their Algerian, Tunisian, Moroccan, Senegalese, Malagasy and Vietnamese divisions on the front-line right to the end of war. Through in practice, there was a color line in France, within the context of the times France was a nation that was relatively open to non-white people with for example the African-American singer [[Josephine Baker]] finding a degree of acceptance in France that she never found in her own country. The French called anyone from French West Africa "Senegalese" regardless if they actually came from Senegal or not; many of the "Senegalese" were not from Senegal.

Through Germany had also recruited soldiers in its African colonies both before and during World War I, the British blockade prevented any ''Askaris'' from fighting in Europe for Germany.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=607-608}} During the war, German propaganda had often attacked the French for deploying African soldiers to fight in Europe, claiming that black men were innately savage and barbaric and it was unacceptable for the French to use Senegalese soldiers in Europe as it "endangered" European civilization.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=608}}

Under the terms of the armistice which ended the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on 11 November 1918, the Allies had the right to occupy the Rhineland, and during the negotiations the Germans had specifically demanded that no Senegalese be included in the French occupation force.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=609}} However, as the terms of the armistice were dictated to the Germans, this was of little import. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on 28 June 1919, the Allies had the right to occupy the Rhineland until 1935, through in fact the last Allied forces were pulled out of the Rhineland in June 1930. The German fears of the Senegalese were widely shared amongst [[white people]] in the English-speaking world, and both the U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] asked the French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] that no Senegalese being used as occupation troops in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=609-610}}

==Non-European troops arrive==
The first non-European troops to arrive in Germany were soldiers from the [[Siamese Expeditionary Forces]] who arrived in [[Neustadt an der Weinstraße|Neustadt]], in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] in December 1918. However, their presence which lasted until July 1919 did not cause great upset. Concerns were raised about the subsequent arrival of African troops in the Rhineland, first a regiment from Madagascar, and then the first Senegalese unit in May 1919.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=611}} General Mangin had gone out of his way to ensure that African units were stationed as part of the Rhineland occupation force.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=611}} The French deployed African soldiers to the Rhineland in part as not to ensure that build-up of black troops in France, and partly because the Germans had asked them not to be deployed.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=612-613}} Mangin had insisted since the French were the victors, they were not going to be dictated to by the vanquished.For Diagne it was important that his fellow Senegalese be deployed to the Rhineland as a way of showing that they were equal and enjoyed the same respect as white French citizens.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=80}} In a meeting with Clemenceau, Diagne had insisted that if French civilization was truly universal, then the Senegalese should allowed to march into the Rhineland alongside the rest of the French Army and not be excluded simply because the Germans found them offensive.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=80}} The Francophile Diagne, who believed in the ideal of France's "civilizing mission" in Africa, had played a key role in the recruitment soldiers in Senegal to fight for France, and thus had more influence than what his position as a mere Deputy might suggest. The "colored" troops in the Rhineland were conscripts from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Senegal, Madagascar and Vietnam.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} At their peak, the "colored" soldiers were 14% of the French occupation force in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} On 1 August 1919, an ultra-nationalist group called the ''[[Rheinische Volkspflege]]'' (Protectors of the Rhenish People) was founded with the purpose of seeking to turn public opinion against French support for the Rhenish separatism, and who hit upon the idea of using alleged crimes committed by blacks serving in the French Army as the best way to do so.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} Closely allied to the ''Rheinische Volkspflege'' was the woman's group, the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' which was founded in early 1920.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} The articles published by the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' articulated "fantastical visions of imperialism and cultural decline" as the mass rapes alleged to be committed by the Senegalese became a metaphor for Franco-German relations.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=475}}

==''Rheinische Volkspflege'' and ''Rheinische Frauenliga''==
On 1 August 1919, an ultra-nationalist group called the ''[[Rheinische Volkspflege]]'' (Protectors of the Rhenish People) was founded with the purpose of seeking to turn public opinion against French support for the Rhenish separatism, and who hit upon the idea of using alleged crimes committed by blacks serving in the French Army as the best way to do so.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} Closely allied to the ''Rheinische Volkspflege'' was the woman's group, the ''[[Rheinische Frauenliga]]'' which was founded in early 1920.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} The articles published by the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' articulated "fantastical visions of imperialism and cultural decline" as the mass rapes alleged to be committed by the Senegalese became a metaphor for Franco-German relations.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=475}}
The  ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' was in very close contact with [[E. D. Morel]]–a leading British radical liberal and an advocate of the viewpoint that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh on Germany–and much of Morel's writings on the issue was based on reports provided to him by the ''Rheinische Frauenliga''.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=475}} Morel, a white supremacist who was obsessed with a fear of the sexuality of black men, genuinely believed that black men had an uncontrolled sexuality that made them want to rape white women with abandon, and throughout his writings on the subject he accused the Senegalese of raping German women on an industrial scale, claiming that thousands upon thousands of German women and girls were raped by the Senegalese on a daily basis.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=476}} The African-American historian [[Clarence Lusance]] accused Morel of leading "one of the most racist political campaigns to be launched in the first half of the 20th century".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=476}}

==Responses to the Kapp Putsch==
[[File:3e ri entrait à Francfort Illustration 1920.JPG|The band of the [[3rd Moroccan Tirailleurs Regiment]] of the French Army as they marched into Frankfurt 6 April 1920|thumb|right]]
There was political turmoil in Germany when it came to signing the Versailles Treaty. In June 1919 [[Philipp Scheidemann]], the first democratically elected [[Chancellor of Germany]] resigned when faced with allied ultimatum that it should be signed with none of the changes the German government had requested. His was succeeded as Chancellor by [[Gustav Bauer]]. The terms of the treaty meant that the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[Freikorps]] which the [[Weimar government]] had created to crush the [[revolutionary movement]] faced being disbanded. Rather than submit to this, [[Wolfgang Kapp]] gathered significant Army officers around him and launched the [[Kapp Putsch]]. The success of the Putsch would open up a possibility of a recommencement of the First World War, a fact not lost on [[Marshal Foch]].

Initially, there were only a few complaints from the German side about the presence of the Senegalese in the Rhineland, and not until April 1920 when the French used Moroccan soldiers to [[French occupation of Frankfurt|occupy Frankfurt]] that a hysterical campaign against the French use of "colored" soldiers began in Germany.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=614}} The issue of the deployment of "colored" troops was first discussed in the ''Reichstag'' in January 1920.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}} Ray Beveridge, a German-American woman living in Germany had given a series of speeches in Hamburg and Munich in February–March 1920 warning of the dangers of miscegenation  to "the purity of the German race" caused by the presence of the Senegalese in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=476}} E.D. Morel had written in a letter to the editor of ''The Nation'' on 27 March 1920 about the French who "thrust barbarians–barbarians belonging to a race inspired by Nature with tremendous sexual instincts into the heart of Europe".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=615}}

In early April 1920, Germany violated the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by sending the ''Reichswehr'' into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, which led the French to occupy Frankfurt on 6 April 1920  as a reprisal, saying that they would not leave Germany's business capital until the ''Reichswehr'' left the demilitarized zone.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} One of the French Army units involved in occupying Frankfurt was a Moroccan company that fired into a crowd of demonstrators.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} Under the front-page of ''The Daily Herald'' on 9 April 1920, there was a cover story reporting on the occupation of Frankfort by Morel whose title read: "Frankfurt runs red with blood French Blood Troops Use Machine-guns on Civilians".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} The next day another front-page article by Morel had the title: "Black Scourge In Europe Sexual Horror Let Loose by France On Rhine Disappearance of Young German Girls".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} Morel wrote France is "thrusting her black savages into the heart of Germany", saying these "primitive African savages, the carriers of syphilis, have become a horror and a terror".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=1}} As Morel was a man whose left-wing "credentials were unimpeachable" as he had gone to prison for opposing British involvement in the First World, his articles attracted much attention both in Britain and abroad.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=2}} Like many other British leftists, Morel was bitterly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles which denounced as an unjust treaty which he blamed on a revanchist France.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=3}}

In his 1919 book ''The Black's Man Burden'', Morel had denounced mandate system of the Treaty of Versailles for the former German colonies Africa, writing that black people could not survive "modern capitalist exploitation".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=3}} Morel wrote that "French militarists, whose schemes are a menace to the entire world" would use these "Negroes, Malagasies, Berbers and Arabs...in the interest of a capitalist and militant Order".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=3}} Specifically, Morel believed the French would use their African troops to put down strikes by the white working classes in Europe, and the theme of the French Army's Senegalese soldiers are as a brutal force upholding capitalism was a recurring one in Morel's articles in ''The Daily Herald'' in 1919 and 1920.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=3-4}} Given Morel's views about the Senegalese and his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, he was predisposed to believe any horror story that might come out of the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=4}}

==Height of the campaign==
The ''Auswärtige Amt'' saw a chance to turn international opinion against France over this issue, and in April 1920 began a sustained propaganda campaign against the French use of "colored" troops.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=615}} The ''Auswärtige Amt'' issued "talking points" to German newspapers, which all through the spring of 1920 ran front-page stories accusing the Senegalese of sorts of atrocities against German civilians.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=615}} The stories about the ''Die schwarze Schand'' ("the black shame") appeared frequently in the German press in the spring of 1920, running what Nelson called hysterical stories with "astonishing" frequency.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=615}} The German [[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany|MSPD]] chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]] in a speech complained that "Senegalese Negroes occupy the University of Frankfort and guard the Goethe House!"{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} The Foreign Minister, Dr. [[Adolf Köster]], in a note to the Allied governments wrote: "if we should suffer from the occupation, we will accept the inferior discipline...among your white troops if only you we will rid us of this black plague!"{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} 
[[File:Black Scourge in Europe Daily Herald April 10 1920.png|thumb|right|Morel's article in ''The Daily Herald'' on 10 April 1920 titled Black Scourge in Europe]]
Morel had published in the left-wing newspaper ''The Daily Herald'' on 10 April his "indictment of the colored outrages" in the Rhineland, which attracted much attention.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} Morel wrote about the Senegalese soldiers that during the First World War  "primitive African barbarians...stuffed their haversacks with eye-balls, ears and heads of the foe".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} Morel went on to write about "barely restrainable bestiality of the black troops" and depicted the Senegalese in the Rhineland as engaging in a reign of terror against German civilians, raping and killing without mercy.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} In an appeal to his female readers, Morel asked the question: "is there no obligation laid upon womenhood as such, in a matter of this kind which goes to the very root of any decent instinct the war may have left alive among the white peoples of the earth?"{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} Morel wrote that "black savages" have uncontrolled sexual impulses that ''"must be satisfied upon the bodies of white women!''" (emphasis in the original).{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=73}}  Despite his claim not to hate black people, Morel wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There they [the African soldiers] have become a terror and a horror unimaginable to the countryside, raping girls and women-for well known physiological reasons, the raping of a white woman by a negro is nearly always accompanied by serious injuries and not infrequently has fatal results; spreading syphilis, murdering inoffensive civilians, often getting completely out of control; the terrible barbaric incarnation of a barbarous policy, embodied in a so-called peace treaty which puts the clock back 2, 000 years".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=484}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a leader (editorial) written by the editor of ''The Daily Herald'', [[George Lansbury]], approved of Morel's article and asked that France pull all African troops out of the Rhineland at once.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} On 12 April 1920, Lansbury wrote again on the subject, saying if the French did not sent the Senegalese back to Africa at once, "we shall have savages used to blackleg, and to coerce, the workers of all European countries".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=477}} On the same day, ''The Daily Herald'''s headlines read: "Brutes in French Uniforms Danger to German women from 30, 000 Blacks Brothels not enough".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=6}} The Central Committee of Women's Co-operative Guild in a statement expressed its "horror and indignation" at the use of Senegalese troops in the Rhineland, asked the British government pressure the French government to send all African troops back to Africa and called for an international agreement to ban "the use of any native African troops by any European power".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=478}} On 27 April 1920, a mass protest meeting was held in London that was organised jointly by all of the main British feminist groups, namely the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], the [[National Federation of Women Workers]], the Federation of Women Teachers, the [[Women's Co-operative Guild]], the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries and the Fabian Women's Group to condemn France for the alleged war crimes committed by the Senegalese.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=478}} At the meeting, Morel asked: that in the interests of good feeling between all the races of the world and the security of all women, this
meeting calls upon the League of Nations to prohibit the importation into Europe for warlike purposes of troops belonging to primitive peoples."{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=50}}

[[Claude McKay]], the Jamaican writer and [[industrial unionism|industrial unionist]] who had arrived in London several months earlier, wrote a letter to ''The Daily Herald'', which was not published, asking:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Why this obscene maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a proletarian paper?" Rape is rape; the colour of the skin doesn't make it different. Negroes are no more over-sexed than Caucasians; mulatto children in the West Indies and America were not the result of parthenogenesis. If Negro troops had syphilis, they contracted it from the white and yellow races. As for German women, in their economic plight they were selling themselves to anyone. I do not protest because I happen to be a Negro...I write because I feel that the ultimate result of your propaganda will be further strife and blood-spilling between whites and the many members of my race...who have been dumped down on the English docks since the ending of the European war...Bourbons of the United States will thank you, and the proletarian underworld of London will certainly gloat over the scoop of the Christian-Socialist pacifist ''Daily Herald''.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=17}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Another letter to the editor of ''The Daily Herald'' which was published on 17 April 1920 came from the africanist [[Norman Leys]] and criticized Morel for "his so-called physiological facts", which are "one of the great sources for racial hatred and should never be given currency".'{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=17}}

Morel's article received much attention and 50, 000 Swedish women signed a petition which was presented at the French Embassy in Stockholm asking the French to withdraw their "savage" Senegalese soldiers from the Rhineland.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} In an article in ''The Labour Leader'' on 22 April 1920, Morel wrote the African soldiers were the "passively obedient instrument of capitalist society" and a threat to the working classes of the nations of Europe.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=4}} Reflecting his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, Morel blamed the "black horror" on the French who deliberately committed this "supreme outrage" of sending these "tens of thousands of savage men" to the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=5}} Morel predicated the "black horror"  would cause another world war, writing that the average German boy was thinking: "''Boys these men raped your mothers and sisters''" (emphasis in the original) .{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=5}} General [[Christopher Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson|C.B. Thomson]] of the British Army published an article in ''The Daily Herald'', which stated that based on his extensive service in Africa, that he knew about the "sexual proclivities" of Africans "who in default of their own race must have intercourse with European women".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=6-7}} General Thomson denounced France for training "these savages" who are "being taught to despise the European races".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=7}} On 14 April 1920, a Labour MP, [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Josiah Wedgwood]], stated in the House of Commons that his party "did not consider Senegalese proper troops to garrison German towns" and asked the government to apply pressure on France to pull out the Senegalese.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=9}} In the spring and summer of 1920, Labour MPs repeatedly raised the issue of the "black horror" in the Rhineland and demanded the government do something to force the French to pull out their African soldiers.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=9-10}} In September 1920 at a meeting of the [[Trade Union Congress]], free copies of Morel's pamphlet ''The Horror on the Rhine'' were handed to the delegates so that they learn about the "injustices" of Versailles and the "horrors" faced by the working class of the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=6}}

On 30 April 1920, the left-wing Vancouver newspaper, the ''British Columbia Federationist'' ran a front-paper cover story "The Black Scourge Is Now Ravaging Europe".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=483}} The article began that the following story "was a revelation so horrible that only the strongest sense that it is our duty to let the public know what is being done would induce use to publish it".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=483}} On 10 May 1920, the Prime Minister of Sweden, [[Hjalmar Branting]], declared in a speech his belief in the truth of Morel's claims, saying that as a white man he was outraged that the French would deploy Senegalese troops in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=488}} In August 1920, Morel first used the phrase "the black horror on the Rhine" in one of his pamphlets to describe the alleged atrocities.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=616}} In the United States, so many letters had been received by outraged citizens that President Wilson in June 1920 asked Secretary of State [[Bainbridge Colby]], to have the American ambassador in Paris, [[Hugh Campbell Wallace]], to investigate these stories.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}} General Henry T. Allen, the commander of the American occupation force in Coblenz together with the diplomat E.L. Dresel carried out an investigation and reported on 25 June 1920 that almost all of the stories about the "black horror on the Rhine" were baseless.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}}  Dresel wrote nearly all of the stories about atrocities were untrue and General Allen praised the "good discipline" of the Senegalese.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}} Both men concluded that the stories about the "black horror on the Rhine" were being made to influence U.S. public opinion.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}} After the [[Red Summer]] of 1919, which had seen widespread race riots across the United States causing hundreds of deaths, most of them African-American, white American public opinion was very sensitive to stories about "uppity" blacks getting out of hand, and was inclined to sympathize with those who claimed to be threatened by blacks.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}} The U.S. government did not chose to make these reports public at the time.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=617}}

A reporter for ''The Nation'', Lewis Gannett, who went to the Rhineland to investigate the allegations found them to be mostly false.{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}} Gannett found that there had been cases of rape of German women and girls by the Senegalese, but the total number was far smaller than what had been alleged by Morel; that white French troops had also raped German women, a matter that did not interest Morel very much; and that in rape cases "the French have inflicted severe punishment upon all soldiers guilty of transgressing against the civil population".{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}} A study done by the British journalist J. Ellis Baker in  published in July 1921 edition of ''Current History'' found that between 1918-1921 that there had been a total of 72 creditable allegations of criminal conduct made against "colored troops" in the Rhineland, and of which only 9 concerned allegations of rape.{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}} Baker's study also listed 96 allegations of criminal conduct which had been judged "doubtful"  and 59 which were found to be "unjustified".{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}} The German journalist [[Maximilian Harden]] wrote that the sex between "colored" soldiers in the French Army and German women in the Rhineland was mostly consensual, writing: "German women were chiefly responsible for the mingling of colored and white blood which has taken place by the Rhine".{{sfn|Lusane|2002|p=74}}

The German historian Christian Koller in an exhaustive study of complaints made by the Rhinelanders against "colored" French occupation forces found that most of the complaints were of a petty nature, such as playing unauthorized football games in parks.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} Most of the complaints about violence by "colored" soldiers in [[Worms]] involved Moroccans, usually brawls in the streets, and Koller found that complaints about sexual violence from the Senegelese were "rare" with the mayor of Worms actually wanting the "well disciplined" Senegalese to stay rather than be replaced by the more combative Moroccans.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} In Wiesbaden, relations between the Rhinelanders and the French occupation forces were more tense with references to brawls, property damage and "four cases of death caused by the colored troops", which was less than those that white French troops were accused of.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} Koller also noted the vague nature of the "black horror" claims and that when it came to specifics, many of the claims of rape by the Senegalese have a "sameness" to not only the accounts of the alleged rapes, but even the same words and phrasing, which led Koller to conclude that the accounts were almost certainly fabricated.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} On the whole, Koller found that there were isolated cases of rape by "colored" soldiers, but there was nothing to support the claim of a reign of terror in the Rhineland by "colored" forces.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=2}} The historian Raffael Scheck wrote most German newspapers outside of the Rhineland ran the "Black Horror" stories, but in fact it seems that relations between the "colored" troops and the Rhinelanders were "mostly friendly, sometimes ''too'' friendly for the critics" as some Rhenish women gave birth to illegitimate children with African, Berber, Arab and Asian features known by the disparaging term, the Rhineland Bastards.{{sfn|Scheck|2006|p=96}}

In the summer of 1920, Morel visited the Rhineland to investigate the matter himself, and in August 1920, he published his pamphlet ''The Horror on the Rhine''.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=479}} Within a month, all 5, 000 copies of ''The Horror on the Rhine'' had sold out and by April 1921 there had been 8 editions of ''The Horror on the Rhine''.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=479}} The third edition of ''The Horror on the Rhine'' featured endorsed by the former German chancellor Prince Max of Baden; [[Jean Longuet]] of the French Socialist Party; four Socialist members of the Italian parliament; and General C. B. Thomson.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=479}} In ''The Horror on the Rhine'', Morel wrote about black men having an uncontrolled, fierce sexuality that made them want to rape white women.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=480}} Morel wrote: "In ones or twos, sometimes in parties, big, stewart men from the warmer climes, armed with sword-bayonets or knives, sometimes with revolvers, living unnatural lives of restraint, their fierce passions hot within them, roam the countryside".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=480}} The African-American philosopher [[Alain LeRoy Locke]] visited the Rhineland to investigate Morel's claims and found them mostly baseless.{{sfn|Galen Last|2015|p=183}} Locke also interviewed the soldiers of the French Army, which he praised as a multi-racial force when skin color did not matter, and stated the morale of the Senegalese was holding up well.{{sfn|Galen Last|2015|p=183}}

==International reception==
The claims made by the German government did influence American public opinion. [[Dudley Field Malone]], the leader of the [[Farmer–Labor Party]], wrote to President Wilson that: "thoughtful persons in America and throughout the world are horrified by the victimization of German women and girls by half-savage African troops".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} The French writer [[Romain Rolland]] issued a statement approving of Morel's articles and declared: "The incredible blindness of statesmen who without realizing it are turning Europe over to the black and yellow continents, which they are armed with their own hands, is itself the unconscious instrument of Destiny".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=485}} [[Lothrop Stoddard]], a professor at Harvard, an avowed white supremacist and eugenist, had just published his best-selling book ''The Rising Tide of Color Against World-wide White Supremacy'', warning of a black-Asian threat to the "white races".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=482}} Upon reading Morel's  ''The Horror on the Rhine'', Stoddard promptly issued his approval, warning of the "extreme fecundity" of blacks and that "black blood, once entering a human stock, seems never to really bred out again".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=482}} In October 1920, a debate took place at a conference of Protestant clergymen at the World Ecumenical Conference in Geneva, when a Lutheran pastor from Germany asked the conference to condemn the "black horror".{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=21}} The African-American Reverend John R. Hawkins, representing the African Methodist Episcopal church from Washington D.C. said in response: ""It was most unfortunate...he should take occasion to drag into this place for high and lofty sentiments the slime and venom of the monster, colour prejudice...Crimes committed by soldiers drunk with the feeling of resentment and the passions of bloody battles have followed all wars; there is no reason for making this invidious distinction and holding up the coloured troops alone to be guilty of such atrocities...The dusky sons of Ham, whether from Africa or America, have come to Europe are among the bravest of the brave and the noblest of the noble, and I will not be silent while their record is attacked."{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=21}}

The ''Christian Science Monitor'' in an editorial on 28 October 1920 wrote: "France has gone even further than an eye-for-eye and has outplayed Germany at its worse, in a way so terrible that it is impossible to indulge in details".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} Two weeks later, the ''Christian Science Monitor'' (CSM) retracted the editorial after receiving a letter from the French consul in Koblenz who showed that the total number of Senegalese in the Rhineland were 5 000, not the 50, 000 alleged by the ''Christian Science Monitor''; that there had been a total of 13 reported cases of rape of German women by the Senegalese, not the thousands alleged by the CSM; and that in all 13 cases, the rapists had been sentenced to death after being convicted with the consul noting sharply that the French Army did not tolerate rapists in its ranks.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} The ''Auswärtige Amt'' seeing that the stories about the "black horror on the Rhine" were effective in gaining international sympathy for the ''Reich'' greatly increased its propaganda with pamphlets detailing the alleged war crimes committed by the Senegalese being published in English, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} The ''Auswärtige Amt'' attached so importance to the promoting the "Black Horror on the Rhine" stories that the German embassies in Lima and Santiago were ordered to make publicizing ''Die schwarze Schand'' their main priority.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=618}} Nelson described the pamphlets handed out by the German diplomats-some of which were written by "cranks" and which verged on the pornographic in their depiction of fair German girls being raped by brutish Africans-as presenting a long list of rapes said to be committed by the Senegalese against German women and girls on the orders of their French officers.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619}} In 1921, a film was produced in Munich about the "black horror on the Rhine" that played all over Germany and in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619}} In June 1921, Beveridge gave a speech at the Sagebiel Hall in Hamburg attended by some 50, 000 people during she accused the Senegalese of raping thousands of German women and girls since they had arrived in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=474}}

Much of the fury that the "colored" troops generated in Germany was due to the way that they inverted the normal racial hierarchy with black, brown and Asian men holding power over white Germans.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} A recurring theme of German complaints against the Senegalese was that Germany had now been "colonized" by Africans.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} A German writer, Alfred von Wrochem, in his best-selling book ''The Colonization of the Rhineland by France'' had attacked the French for undermining belief in worldwide white supremacy by using Senegalese troops.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} During World War I, the presence of Africans fighting in the French Army had in the word of the British historian Barbara Bush had made "trans-racial sex between white women and black men of all classes an obsession with white men".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} The stationing of Senegalese troops in the Rhineland had tapped into these fears.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=472}} The British ambassador to Germany, [[Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon|Lord D'Abederon]] wrote: "The war increased the German's respect for, and his dislike of the English, but has done nothing to diminish his belief in his own superior sturdiness compared with the French. This will continue subconsciously and subcutaneously whatever happens-even though France possesses an overpowering army and the Germans have no organised means of resistance".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250}} A theme of much the "black horror" propaganda was that of a massive contempt for the French who had to use "colored" troops to fight their wars.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250}} One of the leading "black horror" propagandists, August Ritter von Eberlein, wrote: "Without her colored troops, France is not in a position in the present tense situation to maintain her militarism and imperialism".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250}}

The fear of sexuality of black men was especially felt very strongly by white feminists and throughout the 1920s, feminist publications in the United States and the United Kingdom presented the "black horror on the Rhine" stories as true.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=473}} An interesting exception was when ''The British Columbia Federationist'' ran an article in October 1920 titled "France Creates Hell West of the Rhine", accusing the Senegalese soldiers of committing "numberless outrages against women and girls".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=485}} The Canadian historian Peter Campbell noted that the "fascinating aspect" was that there were no letters to the editor of the ''British Columbia Federationist'' expressing either approval or disapproval; which he noted was odd given the way in which the article appealed to the prejudices in the most base way, suggesting that the largely white, working-class readers of ''British Columbia Federationist'' did not approve of the anti-black message.{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=485-486}} In France, a French Socialist [[Charles Gide]] wrote on 16 March 1921 edition of the newspaper ''Foi et Vie'' that Morel claimed that he wanted to protect the Africans, but: "''le genre de protection de M. Morel rappelle un peu le precepte que fait afficher la Society protectrice des animaux: 'Soyez bons pour les betes'''" (Mr. Morel's kind of protection is a little reminiscent of the precepts of the Society for the Protection of Animals: 'Be good to the animals').{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=19}}

One group founded in Munich in September 1921 to campaign against the "black horror" was the ''Notbund'' led by Heinrich Distler.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=137}} Known for its enthusiastic hyperbole and its usually false claims, the ''Notbund'''s pamphlets claimed the Senegalese were raping 100 women/per day in the Rhineland and the Malagasy had caused epidemics of tuberculosis, dysentery, syphilis, malaria, Malta fever, leprosy, Phagedänismus and parasitic worms in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=140}} Appealing to the medical ignorance of its readers, the ''Notbund'' maintained that it was possible to contract leprosy solely by being in the presence of a black man without even touching him.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=140}} In Britain, Norman Angell in his 1921 book ''The Fruits of Victory'' wrote the worse aspect of the Treaty of Versailles was the stationing of the Senegalese in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=11-12}} Angell accused the French of putting "cannibals from the African forests" into the "cultured" university towns of the Rhineland.{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=12}}

==Racial fears==
The motivations of the "black horror" writers differed greatly. The German sociologist Iris Wigger divided the writers into two types; a "liberal racism" that embraced writers such as E.D Morel and the former Italian Prime Minister [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]] who used the "black horror" stories primarily as a weapon for attacking the Treaty of Versailles, and a "conservative racism" that embraced figures such as the German writer Guido Kreutzer and the American actress Ray Beveridge mainly found within in Germany that used the "black horror" stories primarily as a weapon for attacking the Weimar Republic.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=113-114}}

===Racism on the left===
In Morel's own mind, he was an anti-racist who was fighting for the Africans.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=52}} Morel believed that Africans were far closer to nature than Europeans and as such, the Africans had “the uneducated soul of the savage” and were not up to the demands of modern industrial society.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=52}} As such, Morel believed that blacks being creatures of "strong emotions" needed to be protected from "modern civilization" which they were allegedly not capable of handling, which explained his campaigning against the [[Congo Free State]] which tried to bring modern work discipline to the Congo in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=51-52}} At the same time, Morel believed that Africans, lacking the self-discipline of whites, had an uncontrolled sexuality.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=52-53}} In a 1911 essay after visiting Nigeria, Morel had written the "reproduction" of the black race was the main "obsession" of all black people, writing about the "instinctive and mysterious" call of racial need which supposedly made all black people obsessed with sex all the time to the exclusion of everything else, declaring that "sexual obsession" was the "elementary racial desire" of black people.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=53}} In this viewpoint, as long as Africans were left in their "natural savage state", all would be well as Africans were not capable of meeting the sexual self-discipline of Europeans, which is why Morel condemned the efforts of missionaries in Africa.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=53}} Through Morel had been very forceful in condemning the cruel exploitation of the Congo Free State, Morel believed in imperialism, just not the cruel exploitative imperialism of the Congo Company, writing it was the duty of whites to serve as the "trustees" for blacks and the "great white father" who would protect the "basic human rights" of Africans while at the same time accepting the "infantile" nature of black people who not the equal in any way of whites.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=54}} [[File: 1922_Edmund_Dene_Morel.jpg|thumb|right|Morel in 1922]]
Morel was very anti-French not only because of his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, but because of the nature of France's ''mission civilisatrice'' ("civilizing mission") in Africa whereby any African who was willing to embrace the French language and culture would become French and theoretically the equal of whites threatened to upend Morel's beliefs in the essential biological inferiority of blacks.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=55-56}} Morel believed that the Africans were committing outrageous crimes against Germans in the Rhineland because the French had empowered them by least theoretically making them into black Frenchmen who were just as much citizens of the republic as anyone else.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=55-56}} Precisely because Morel believed in the uncontrolled sexuality of blacks, it was self-evident to him that the "sexually uncontrolled and uncontrollable" Senegalese would run amok in the Rhineland, raping every German female in sight.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=57}} As part of his call for international solidarity with a Germany alleged to be victimized by the Treaty of Versailles, Morel wrote: ‘For the working classes the importation of Negro mercenaries by the hundred thousand from the heart of Africa, to fight the battles and execute the lusts of capitalist governments in the heart of Europe is...a terrifc portent. The workers, alike in Britain, France, and Italy will be ill-advised if they allow it to pass in silence because today the victims happen to be German.”{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=59}} Morel used the alleged massive sexual violence committed against women in the Rhineland as a call for racial togetherness, writing it was in the interests of all white peoples to assist Germany with revising the terms of Versailles which permitted the "black horror on the Rhine".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=60}} In the same way, Morel used the "black horror" as a way of attacking France which had caused a  “sexual horror on the Rhine” and whose “reign of terror” was a “giant evil” that should inspire “shame into all four corners of the world” and ultimately should “a revision of the Versailles Treaty and the relief for Germany.”{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=60}}

Nitti, a liberal Italian politician was known for his calls for an "United States of Europe", believing that only when all of the nations of Europe become one would all of the problems of modern Europe be solved.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=61-63}} In this regard, Nitti was strongly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles, which he called the "instrument of oppression" against Germany, the "most cultured nation" in the world.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=64}} As part of his critique of Versailles, Nitti wrote that the French had put the most "backward nations" in the Rhineland, declaring some of the "most cultured cities in Europe" that been subjected to "Negro violence" and to "physical and moral trials unknown for centuries in civilized countries".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=65}} Nitti wrote the occupation of the Rhineland "had no military aim" but rather was an "attempt to force Germany to the point of moral exhaustion".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=65}} At the same time, Nitti, who was very well worried about the prospect of a Communist revolution in Germany, used the "black horror" stories as a way of creating unity in Germany, urging that all Germans regardless of class should unite in the common struggle against France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=64-65}} As part of his call for European unity, Nitti went out of his way to portray France's African soldiers as an alien body that did not belong in Europe at all, which allowed him to condemn France as the nation responsible for this state of affairs.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=66}} Nitti wrote the Senegalese were guilty of "any form of violence and crime" as their "yesterday the representatives of cannibalistic races" whom were now occupying the "country of the greatest thinkers in Europe".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=66}} Throughout his speeches and essays, Nitti drew a contrast between Europeans who constituted civilization vs Africans who represented barbarism.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=69}} Nitti even so far as to say he was shocked to see and hear "music gangs of Negroes and Berbers of Africa" play "African music programmes" on the "squares of the occupied cities".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=69}} Nitti wrote for him it "seemed unbearable" that Germans whose nation was a "cradle of musical genius" to listen to "Negro music".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=69}} As part of his call to revise Versailles, Nitti urged that the other European nations together with the United States were under the obligation to "save culture...from the flood of barbarism" as "Germany's fall" would mean "the downfall of one the largest driving forces of humanity".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=66-67}} As part of his demand for a pan-Western effort to save Germany, Nitti wrote he could hear the “cry of pain of the German woman", which he wrote was a “most terrible accusation against Christian peoples,” who called themselves “civilized and democratic.”{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=70}}

Wigger stated that writers on both sides were equally racist, but there was a difference between those as Morel and Nitti whose main interest was in revising the terms of Versailles in Germany's favor, and those like Kreutzer and Beveridge whose main interest was in proving the Weimar Republic was too "weak" to stand up to France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=113-114}} The same conclusion was reached by the British historian Peter Collar who wrote: "...there existed in Germany a fundamental disagreement over the value of propaganda and the use to which it might be put. To the idealists of the new Republic it offered a way for Germany to advance her cause abroad in the widest sense and to get away from the excesses of the Wilhelmine era...The Right saw things quite differently. In the far Right, exemplified in party political terms by the DNVP and by some within the Bavarian BVP, there existed a deep desire to return to past authoritarian certainty, a past that was idealised in the imaginaton. The concepts behind the new Republic were totally alien and were to be opposed at every opportunity."{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=258-259}} The campaign against the "black horror" was not one campaign coordinated by the ''Reich'' government, but several different campaigns launched by the ''Reich'', Bavarian, and Prussian governments together with a number of private groups.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250-251}} With the notable exceptions of the Communists and [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democrats]], every political group in Germany endorsed the "black horror" campaign thought Collar described the [[Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany]] more as "fellow travelers in the propaganda war rather than a driving force".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=251}} Racism was so pervasive in Europe at the time that the "black or colored man was generally considered by the white European to be his inferior".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=250}}

===Racism on the right===
Ray Beveridge, a conservative Germanophile American actress and an ardent racist who was of the leading speakers on the subject, used the "black horror" as a call for a right-wing ''Volksgemeinschaft'' ("people's community"), urging the German people to reject the Weimar republic and rally around the ''völkisch'' right, which she claimed were the only men capable of "standing up" to France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=72 &amp; 114}} Beveridge was well known for her exaggerated claims and a speaking style that sought to appeal to the worse prejudices in her audience, often spoke about the "mindless blacks" with "enormous sex drives and unrestrained passion" who allegedly would attack "white women, white girls, white youth, often old people and even children".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=77}} Beveridge usually began her speeches with the remark:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Why do I come here, an American, to speak to you about the ''Schwarze Schmach''? Because I come from a nation that ever since it came into being has been threatened by black and yellow problems and the black and yellow peril!...I appeal to women in the world! I appeal to all men worthy of the name. Help! White women, white boys are in danger everyday, every hour of the day as long as a black is allowed to have power over a white women!"{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=126}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; An avowed white supremacist, Beveridge sought to impute the worse about black men, saying in one speech:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Victims of the promiscuous passions of the blacks are found half dead in meadows and ditches, their clothes in tatters, their delicate young bodies torn by the brutality of the attacks. Many have bite wounds which show clearly how wildly the black beast has fallen on his victim. I could quote innumerable examples with names and dates; and it must not be forgotten that almost all these men are infected with venereal diseases"."{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=126-127}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beveridge's speeches were well attended and are described in contemporary newspaper reports as being greeted with huge applause, but others involved in the "black horror" campaign like Margarete Gärtner, the chairwoman of the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'', regarded Beveridge as a liability as she was prone to making exaggerated and false claims in her speeches that were easily rebutted by the French.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=127-129}} The ''Auswärtige Amt'' in a report stated that Beveridge was harming the German side as she "outdoes the ''Notbund'' in her hysterical extremes".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=176-177}} Collar called Beveridge the most extreme of all the speakers on the theme of the "black horror", describing her as the preferred spokeswoman of the "extreme right" in Germany with her speeches being "nothing less than an incitement to racial hatred".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=129}} In one of her speeches, Beveridge said: "Your weapons have been taken from you, but there still remains a rope and a tree. Take up the natural arms which our men from the South resort: lynch! Hang every black who assaults a white person!"{{sfn|Reinders|1968|p=16}} However, Collar wrote that Beveridge who was fluent in German was a "charismatic orator...able to whip up her audience into a frenzy".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=216}} Linking all this together was Bevridge's call for the ''Volksgemeinschaft'', saying that the "German spirit, the German science, the German culture, and the German work" were more than enough to defeat France, provided that all Germans stand "faithfully together" and put the nation ahead of "party politics".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=76}} In a speech in a Munich beerhall, Beveridge declared: "Germans unite-unity is power-only with power can you shake the chains of Versailles!".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=76}}

As part of her appeal, Beveridge spoke the need to keep the ''Volkskörper'' (the collective "racial body" of the German people) pure, and as such German women as the bearers of the next generation of Germans had the most important part of the ''Volkskörper''.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=74}} In Beveridge's mind, the alleged sexual crimes against German women were bad enough, but even worse by threatening the ''Volkskörper'' threatened the very existence of the German "race".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=74}} For Beveridge, the purity of the ''Volkskörper'' was so important that any man who did not fight against the "black horror" was not only a  “slacker” and “traitor of his country”, but also a  “traitor against the white race.”{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=74}} Beveridge often spoke of her "shame" for the “German race” who was not willing “to protect” the “honour”  of his women from the ''Fremdkörper'' (alien body) that was now threatening the ''Volkskörper'' in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=74}} At the time of the Munich Beerhall ''putsch'', Beveridge came out in support for the National Socialists, declaring it “an enormous honor” to mobilise, together with her German husband, “the ''Chiemgau'' for Adolf Hitler”.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=72}} At the time, Beveridge had said in a speech that Hitler together with General Erich Ludendorff were her “German heroes”.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=72}} Beveridge later on in the 1930s renounced her U.S. citizenship to become a German citizen, joined the NSDAP, and was a well known "admirer of Hitler"."{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=128}}

Likewise, the ''völkisch''  German writer Guido Kreutzer used the "black horror on the Rhine" as a way of attacking both what he saw as the "unjust" Treaty of Versailles and even more so the Weimar Republic, which was too "weak" to stand up to France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=83-84}}  In his very popular 1921 novel ''Die Schwarze Schmach: Der Roman des geschändeten Deutschlands'' (''The Black Shame A Novel of Disgraced Germany''), Kreutzer portrayed the Senegalese and Moroccan soldiers as thuggish rapists who violate thousands upon thousands of innocent German girls in the Rhineland, who have all the stereotypical "Aryan" look with fair skin, blonde hair and blue eyes; the hero of the novel repeatedly calls the Senegalese "nigger scum".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84-85}} The preface to  ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' was written by the  ''völkisch'' activist  [[Ernst Graf zu Reventlow|Count Ernst zu Reventlow]] whom praised the novel as a much needed call for the ''Volksgemeinschaft''.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84}} Reventlow wrote that Jesus Christ had taught all Christians to love their neighbor, which he took to mean all Germans should love the Rhinelanders and hate the French, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is this national hatred that we need! It must pulsate evenly throughout the German people, uniting them and driving them forward. This hatred of an entire people, despite a lack of weapons, will build an insuperable force and, from a certain moment in time, an irresistible one. It must act everywhere and at every moment against the French interloper. In the long term, no conqueror has ever been able to withstand such hatred and at this time in Germany the conqueror is not even there by virtue of his own power."{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=167-168}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; In this regard, Reventlow complained that the German people were far too disunited at present, and needed to become united by hating the French, which was why he recommended reading the novel.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=168}}

Kreutzer used ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' as a way of attacking the Weimar Republic which is portrayed as a weak and ineffective in face of the "black horror on the Rhine", and called for Germans to embrace a "strongman" leader who would rule as a dictator.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84-85}}  The cover of ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' featured an ape-like black man wearing the uniform of a French Army private holding a half-naked white woman with a lascivious expression on his face.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=116}} The hero of the novel is Baron von Yrsch, an aristocrat, former Prussian Army general, war hero and a friend of the former Emperor Wilhelm II who lives on his estate outside of an unnamed town in the Rhineland together with his beautiful daughter, whom the Senegalese naturally want to rape.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84}} Yrsch complains about the weak Emperor who abdicated and left into exile while leaving his 70 million loyal subjects "in the abyss".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=166}} Reflecting his nationalistic views, Kreutzer has a French officer say: "The German Army was the moral victor. Only numerical superiority and hunger had finally forced it to its knees. France by itself would have been overrun by Germany in less than four weeks without being able to offer any serious resistance".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=166}} To humiliate Yrsch, the French demand they be allowed to open a brothel on the grounds of his estate to be operated by his daughter Marlene.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=166-167}} The Moroccans serving in the French Army are described as having "a rough-hewn black-brown face; bulging yellowish eyes buried deep under the forehead beneath the steel helmet; the predator teeth dazzlingly bright between the burning red lips".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=167}}

Another supporting character is Lampré, the son of a Rhineland industrialist and a Rhenish separatist whom initially collaborates with the French, but sees the error of his ways when confronted with the "black horror" and in the climax of the novel saves Yrsch's daughter from being raped by a "mulatto" French Army officer by killing him.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84}} When the collaborating mayor orders Yrsch out of the town, thousands of the ''Burschenschaften'' (student fraternities) join forces with the town's workers in a demonstration to persuade him to stay.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84}} The villain of the novel is the "mulatto" Captain Mustapha Hassan of the French Army; the fact that "half-Arabian" Hassan is a Muslim, the self-proclaimed "black raven of Allah", who is a descendant of Muslim warriors who fought against the Crusades was meant by Kreutzer to show that France is not longer a "civilized" European Christian nation, but has rather become a "mulatto" nation that has rejected the values of the European family of nations.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}} In an important symbolic moment, when Captain Hassan tries to rape Yrsch's daughter and Lampré comes to her defense, Hassan's white chauffeur fires a shot at him with his revolver that instead shoots off a finger of a statue of Christ in front of a church, thereby showing the French have turned their backs on Christian Europe.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}} In another important scene, Lampré confronts his Rhenish separatist father to tell him that he "wants to be German again" rather than associate with the "niggers" of France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}}  Lampré's industrialist father is portrayed as blinded by greed and he has to decided to support Rhenish separatism out of the potential to make millions from working with the French.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}} Ultimately, Lampré's father sees the error of his ways and he too rediscovers his pride in being German again.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=88}} The Lamprés ''pere'' and ''fils'' represent the elegantly cosmopolitan and Francophile Catholic middle classes of the Rhineland who often resented Prussian militarism as crude and overbearing, seeing themselves as a more civilized type of German.

Kreutzer also used ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' as a way of reinforcing traditional gender roles as German women are portrayed as a weak and passive, unable to protect themselves from the rampaging Senegalese and Moroccans, needing the "manly" German men to protect them.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} Using  ''völkisch'' language, Kreutzer called for all Germans to feel for their "tormented ''volksgenossen''" (national comrades) in the Rhineland, rediscover their "national source of strength" by uniting against the common foe, and allow "the ''völkisch'' spark to spread".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} In the novel, the bodies of German women represent both literally and symbolically the tormented German nation attacked by African "savages" with the female body serving as a symbol of German racial purity.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} Significantly, the children born to German mothers and Senegalese fathers are all born "physically and morally degenerate" and are not considered to be German.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} Furthermore, all of the women raped are by the Senegalese cease to be German the moment they are raped, and it is made clear that there is no place in the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' for them.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=85}} Kreutzer accuses France of seeking to "undermine the nation's health" by allowing African soldiers to "rape and defile" German women, who are portrayed as virtuous, wholesome and chaste symbols of German racial purity, blessed with the sacred task of bearing the next generation of Germans.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=95}}

Lampré rejects his French lover, a licentious dancer and a "worldly little animal" whose "soulless chirping voices" and overt sexuality he finds repulsive for the more wholesome and German figure of Marlene von Yrsch.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=95}} Marlene von Yrsch is blessed with all the beauty of her "race", having a "girly pristine charm", blonde hair worn in a "Greek node", "wise eyes", an "elegantly narrow face" with beautiful "curved brows" and a "slim shape" to her body.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=96}}  Marlene von Yrsch is a symbol of not only Germany, but also of the white race in general, marking out the all that was beautiful in the world vs. the hideously deformed bodies of the Senegalese, Moroccan and Vietnamese soldiers serving in the French Army.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=96}} The mere sight of her causes Lampré to desert from the French Foreign Legion as he sees in her a "woe reminder of the fatherland lost forever" as his mind is flooded with images of his lost ''Heimat'', filling him with "shame" for having fought for France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=96}} By contrast, Captain Mustapha Hassan is portrayed as a sexual predator with "primitively carved features" and a "brutal" sexuality, an ugly man with beady lips who "bites like an animal" at the sight of Marlene.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=96-97}} When Marlene rejects his advances, calling him a "half-civilized savage" with "all the arrogance of her race", he becomes obsessed with raping her in revenge.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=97}} Lampré vows to protect Marlene, saying she will not be "fair game for this nigger", saying his "conscience as a human being and a man" will not let do otherwise and thereby redeems himself for his "treason" for having fought for France in the Foreign Legion.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=97-98}}

Finally, Kreutzer used ''Die Schwarze Schmach'' as a way of attacking the Social Democrats as group of working class characters in the Rhineland in the novel ultimately abandoned the SPD as they find it is only right-wing leaders like Yrsch who can create the  ''Volksgemeinschaft'' that will allow Germany to stand up to France.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=113}} Reflecting Kreutzer's conservative politics, in ''Die Schwarze Schmach'', the working class characters finally learn the SPD is a divisive force that weakens the German people by dividing the working class from the rest of the German people, and it is when the Rhenish working class learn to accept leadership from traditional elites such as the aristocracy and the industrialists that the German people can finally be united as one in the form of the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' to stand up to France, Germany's ancient archenemy which was responsible for the "black horror on the Rhine".{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=84-90}} In the novel, the working class march under the "old black-white-red flags" to protest the "black horror" and the expulsion order against the "national hero" Yrsch; in Germany the colors red, white and black symbolize the right while the colors red, black and gold symbolize the left.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=90}} In one scene, a delegation of workers led by a huge union official respectfully pay a visit to Yrsch's estate to ask him to lead them on a struggle against the French, which was Kreutzer's way of showing that Germans needed to defer to their traditional elites to become great again.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=90}} In paternal relationship, aristocrats like Yrsch understand the problems of the working class, and argue for fair treatment of the workers by their employers, which was Kreutzer's way of saying that in the  ''Volksgemeinschaft'' the German people would all be united together as a one big happy family.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=90-91}} The novel repeatedly hammers home the point that only if the German people are united as one in the form of the ''Volksgemeinschaft'' can Germany recover from the defeat of 1918, and throughout the novel Germans are of all classes are seen as victimized by the French and their "colored" troops.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=89}} Wigger suggested that Kreutzer was using his racism as a way of uniting all Germans together as the working class characters find the question of racial purity more important than their wages, working conditions and standards of living, and at one point a union official says that every working-class family must be opposed to "mad strikes and Communist agitations" that weaken the unity of the German nation.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=92}} In this regard, when the union leaders rebuke Lampré's father for his treasonous activities, he ceases to be an "exploitative" capitalist and turns into a "good German capitalist", having a very paternal relationship with his workers whom he takes care of and in their return defer to him.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=93}}

At the end of the novel, Lampré marries Marlene and becomes a killing machine, saying no-one will ever threaten his "German sanctuary again", and his "soul is finally at peace" as he takes up the task of killing Senegalese and Moroccans with gusto.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=98}} He and his bride enjoy a brief moment of happiness as they "raved and kissed" by the banks of the river Rhine and sing the song ''Lovers by the Rhine''; subsequently an attempt to escape the Rhineland ends with Marlene being killed while Lampré who once rejected German nationalism sees it is too late for him and that his "treason" for having served France can never be fully redeemed.{{sfn|Wigger|2017|p=98}} Collar wrote that in Kreutzer's novel, the "Black Horror" was "...almost subsidiary in his eyes to a bigger issue-the simple fact that Germany had lost the war. The book was simply the expression of his resentment and fury...The tenor of the book leaves little doubt that it reflected the views of the extreme right-wing ''völkisch'' circles, for whom defeat had come as a crushing blow and for whom the new Republic was an abomination. For them the ''Schwarze Schmach'' was clearly but one element in the array of grievances against France. Incitement of public hatred leading to a war of revenge in the indefinite future was much in evidence".{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=167-168}}

==French response==
In response to stories about the "black horror on the Rhine", the French government published pamphlets settling to rebut the "calumnies" while several French newspapers in editorials accused the Germans of engaging in racism.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619}} In 1921 the French government published a pamphlet ''La campagne contre les troupes noires'', defending the Senegalese and pointing out inaccuracies in the articles by Morel and Beveridge's speeches, for instance, stating that 50, 000 Senegalese had not been stationed in the Rhineland with the total number of "colored" troops in the Rhineland numbering 25, 000, of which 4, 00 were Senegalese.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=221}} The pamphlet also quoted from German newspapers such as ''Sozialistische Republik'', ''Der Christliche Pilger'' and ''Deutsche pazifistische Monatsschrift'', which all ran stories testifying to the good behavior of the "colored" troops.{{sfn|Collar|2013|p=222}} In Paris, the ''Comité d'Assistance aux Troupes Noires'' was founded to defend the reputation of the Senegalese.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619}} French Army doctors published statistics showing that there was not an abnormally high rate of sybills among the Senegalese and the German claim that the Africans had brought sleeping sickness to the Rhineland could not be true as none of the Senegalese stationed in the Rhineland had sleeping sickness.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619-620}} Love letters between German women and their Senegalese boyfriends were published in French newspapers in attempt to show that the Senegalese were not the mindless brutes intent upon raping white women as claimed by the German government.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=619-620}} The American historian Julia Roos wrote the debate about the "Black Horror" stories cut across ideological lines with for instance in France it was chiefly left-wing groups that felt the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh on Germany who were the most receptive towards promoting "black horror" stories while it was conservatives believed in the justice of Versailles who defended the Senegalese against the "black horror" claims.&lt;ref name=Roos-2015&gt;{{cite web

==Reception in the United States==
However, the French efforts were in vain. On the night of 28 February 1921, a protest rally attended by 12, 000 was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City where France was condemned for the "black horror on the Rhine".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=620}} A Republican Representative, [[Frederick A. Britten]], issued resolution condemning France for the "black horror on the Rhine", and which called the Senegalese "semi-civilized, useless and oft-times brutal defamers of women".{{sf|Campbell|2014|p=488-489}} The American feminist Harriet Connor Brown in a letter to the State Department written in early 1921 accused Senegalese soldiers of rape, attempted rape, "immoral crimes against boys" and of forcing German officials in the Rhineland to open brothels for their benefit.{{sf|Campbell|2014|p=490}} The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom issued a statement condemning the "black horror on the Rhine" that was signed by all 25 of its white members of its central committee, and the only one who refused to sign was the lone African-American on the central committee, [[Mary Church Terrell|Mary Terrell]], who refused to sign a statement that was a "direct appeal to race prejudice".{{sf|Campbell|2014|p=490}}

The Francophile Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge had received leaked copies of the reports by Allen and Dresel, which he read out on the Senate floor "as act of justice and comity to a friendly nation [France]".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=620}} Liberal American journals like ''The Nation'' and ''The New Republic'' ran several articles debunking the claims of "the black horror on the Rhine", showing that there were relatively few cases of rape by the Senegalese soldiers.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=621-622}} ''The New York Times''  in an article on 25 June 1921 wrote about "a horrid lack of horrors on the Rhine".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=622}} By 1921, many mayors in the Rhineland were complaining in letters to the ''Reich'' government in Berlin that the "black horror" propaganda had been too successful, charging that the picture of the Rhineland overrun by Senegalese soldiers looting, raping and killing with impunity, had destroyed the tourist trade.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=622}} For this reason, the Rhenish mayors asked the ''Reich'' government stop the "black horror" propaganda which had ruined the tourism trade in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=622}}

==Story revives==
When [[Raymond Poincaré]], a French conservative well known for his views about upholding the Treaty of Versailles, became the French premier in 1922, there was a much revival of the "black horror on the Rhineland" stories both in Germany and abroad.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=622}} In Washington, Democratic Senator [[Gilbert Hitchcock]] in a speech on the Senate floor asked the administration of President Warren G. Harding "suggest to France the substitution of white troops for black on the Rhine".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=623}} When the former French premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] visited the United States in November 1922, Senator Hitchcock confronted Clemenceau over the alleged "black outrages" in the Rhineland.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=623}} In a speech, Senator Hitchcock declared about the Senegalese: "They are men of an inferior, half-civilized race. They are brutes when stationed among white people, as the evidence shows".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=623}}  Otto Wiefeldt, the German ambassador in Washington asked that his superiors supply him with "current information preferably with sensational details" as he noted that the stories about the "black horror on the Rhine" were winning over American public opinion to a pro-German position.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=623}}

However, the French occupation of the Ruhr on 11 January 1923 caused the ''Auswärtige Amt'' to lose interest in the "black horror on the Rhine" story.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=624}} Poincaré deliberately used only white troops in occupying the Ruhr to avoid more "black horror" stories, through the claim that a Senegalese regiment had been stationed in [[Essen]] was widely believed in both Germany and abroad.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=624}} For most Germans, the French occupation of the Ruhr was a sufficiently "heinous crime against the peace" that there was no need to embellish it with "black horror" stories.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=624}} At the same time, the last American occupation troops had been withdrawn from the Rhineland in January 1923, which meant that American public opinion was less important in courting.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=624}} In a speech given in Darmstadt on 13 February 1923, the Social Democratic German president [[Friedrich Ebert]] said: "''daß die Verwendung farbiger Truppen niederster Kultur als Aufseher über eine Bevölkerung von der hohen geistigen und wirtschaftlichen Bedeutung der Rheinländer eine herausfordernde Verletzung der Gesetze europäischer Zivilisation ist''" ("the use of troops of the lowest culture over the population of the highest spiritual and economic importance in the Rhineland is a challenging violation of the laws of European civilization").{{sfn|Koller|2001|p=38}}

==Continuing obsession==
After 1921, the ''Reich'' government started to downplay the "Black Horror" propaganda, which had ruined tourism in the Rhineland, causing much resentment in a largely Catholic region that at very least wanted to break away from Protestant majority Prussia.&lt;ref name="Roos-2015" /&gt; Furthermore, many of those on the  ''völkisch'' right made much of the fact there were consensual sexual relationships between mostly lower-class women in the Rhineland and "colored" French Army soldiers, attacking these women for bringing the so-called "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" into world and threatening German racial purity.&lt;ref name="Roos-2015" /&gt; In the viewpoint of the Rhinelanders the obsession with relationships between German women and non-white French soldiers was highlighting an aspect of the French occupation that was not to their best advantage, and many of the groups like the ''Rheinische Frauenliga'' that at first promoted the story chose to downplay it as the 1920s went on.&lt;ref name="Roos-2015" /&gt; Finally the ''Reich'' government saw its own "Black Horror" propaganda boomerang. Since Germany had been more or less disarmed by the Treaty of Versailles, it was not possible for the ''Reich'' to go to war with France, and the  ''völkisch'' groups opposed to the Weimar Republic used the "black horror" stories as a way of attacking the Weimar Republic as an "emasculated" state incapable of standing up to France; such attacks especially resonated with right-wing men.&lt;ref name="Roos-2015" /&gt; The end of the Ruhr crisis in September 1923 together with the [[Dawes Plan]] in 1924 led to an improvement in Franco-German relations, and Berlin had less interest in pursuing "black horror" stories.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=625}} In January 1925, the French pulled out of the northern Rhineland and by this time there were hardly any "colored" troops by the Rhine.{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=625}} Despite this, the Canadian feminist [[Rose Henderson]] in a 1925 article in ''The British Columbia Federationist'' wrote "the power of France rests upon a black basis", which she called "one of the most menacing and sinister facts in history", going to condemn the French for training the Senegalese "to subdue and enslave white people".{{sfn|Campbell|2014|p=492}}

However, the "black horror on the Rhine" did much to shape German views of both the French and Africans. In ''Mein Kampf'', [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote: "7, 000, 000 people languish under alien rule and the main artery of the German people flows through the playground of black African hordes...It was and is the Jews who bring the Negro to the Rhineland, always with the same concealed thought and with the clear goal of destroying by the bastardization of the white race they hate".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=626}} In a 1928 speech, Hitler ranted against the "de-Germanization, Negrification and Judaization of our people".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=626}} In his 1930 book ''The Myth of the 20th Century'', [[Alfred Rosenberg]] denounced France for "contributing to the dehumanization of Europe by the means of blacks, just as had done by introducing Jewish emancipation 140 years ago".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=626}} The "black horror on the Rhine" story featured prominently in Nazi anti-French propaganda and throughout the Third Reich with a recurring image in posters showing French Army soldiers as "a hideous African molesting blonde Aryan women".{{sfn|Nelson|1970|p=626}} On 29 May 1940 in part of the preparations for an offensive scheduled for 5 June, the Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] ordered a major media campaign to bring back memories of the "Black Horror on the Rhine" as a reason to hate France, saying at a conference that he wanted journalists to run stories that it had been "a cultural and racial disgrace...to bring Negroes to the Rhineland" and to remind German people that the French once again had "colored" soldiers fighting for the republic.{{sfn|Scheck|2006|p=103}} During the offensive in June 1940 along the river Somme and during the pursuit into central France, the Wehrmacht massacred thousands of Senegalese taken prisoner to avenge the "black horror on the Rhine".{{sfn|Scheck|2006|p=3-4}} In the spring of 1920, the conscience of the world had been stirred by mostly imaginary crimes said to have been committed by the Senegalese against the Germans. Twenty years later in the spring of 1940, nobody cared about the massacres of the Senegalese soldiers by the Germans with the French authorities making little effort after 1945 to prosecute the man responsible.{{sfn|Scheck|2006|p=5}} Unlike the alleged "black horror on the Rhine" which received much media coverage, the massacres of Senegalese POWs in June 1940 received little attention either at the time or afterwards with most history books not even mentioning the massacres.

The '''Bosnian Cultural Center''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Bosanski kulturni centar'' / ''Босански културни центар'' - BKC) is a national cultural center located in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sarajevo.travel/ba/sta-raditi/bosanski-kulturni-centar/307|title=Bosanski kulturni centar|publisher=Sarajevo.travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center was established in 1966 and is housed in a former synagogue built in the [[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish Revival]] architectural style. The center is run as a public institution by the [[Sarajevo Canton]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-tourism.com/galerija-bkc-bosanski-kulturni-centar|title=Galerija BKC - Bosanski kulturni centar|publisher=Sarajevo-tourism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main article|Il Kal Grande}}
In 1923 the Jewish Municipality of Sarajevo drew out plans to build a monumental synagogue in the city, at that time the capital of the [[Banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Drinska banovina]], which was home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bkc.ba/||title=Historija|publisher=Official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary plans outlined the municipality's desire for the synagogue to be the largest in [[Southeastern Europe]]. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The motive behind the project was the fact that none of the city's existing synagogues could hold more then a fifth of the total Jewish congregation. &lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/magazin/kultura/bosanski-kulturni-centar-obiljezava-66-godisnjicu-rada/140410080|title=Bosanski kulturni centar obilježava 66. godišnjicu rada|publisher=Klix.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; A project board formed by the municipality and headed by notable Jewish industrialist, Avram Majer Altarac, purchased the land for 100,000 CHF, with construction beginning in 1926. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The famous Croatian [[Art Nouveau]] architect [[Rudolf Lubinski]] was hired to design the building. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; His concept of a lavish [[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish Revivalist]] design, which was prevalent in the architecture of Sarajevo since [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] times was green lighted, with constuction being completed in 1930. The synagogue, known as the [[Il Kal Grande]], was officially opened on 14 May 1931. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

After the [[Nazi]] invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the establishment of the puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]], severe racial laws were implemented by the occupying forced which lead to the desecration and looting of the synagogue in the first months of the occupation. &lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.jerusalim.org/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers/pavelic/index.html "''Jasenovac-Donja Gradina 1941–1945''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113192529/http://www.jerusalim.org/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers/pavelic/index.html |date=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war the Jewish Municipality, whose community was desecrated during the [[holocaust]] with over 90 percent being murdered in concentration camps &lt;ref name=JVL-BH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/bosnia.html |title=Bosnia-Herzegovina |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate= 24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, donated the building to the city of Sarajevo. In 1965 architect [[Ivan Štraus]] was chosen to head renovation work on the building, which was reestablished as the Đuro Đaković Center, named after Yugoslav communist and revolutionary [[Đuro Đaković]]. &lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The center contained a state of the art movie theatre, numerous workshops, classrooms and an art gallery.

In 1993, during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], the center was symbolically renamed the Bosnian Cultural Center. During subsequent years it has become the premier cultural center in Bosnia and Herzegovina, hosting weekly concerts, theatre productions and film screenings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/kultura/bkc-zanimljiv-julski-repertoar-za-sve-ukuse/117819||title=BKC: Zanimljiv julski repertoar za sve ukuse|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://avaz.ba/kantoni/sarajevo/384425/bosanski-kulturni-centar-mladi-glumci-izveli-predstavu-sumnjivi-autobus||title=Bosanski kulturni centar: Mladi glumci izveli predstavu ''Sumnjivi autobus''|publisher=avaz.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the venues of the [[Sarajevo Film Festival]], [[Sarajevo Jazz Festival]] and the main venue for [[Juventafest]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muzickazona.ba/scream-sarajevo-mozete-pogledati-sljedece-sedmice-u-bkc-u/9618/||title=‘Scream For Me Sarajevo’ možete pogledati sljedeće sedmice u BKC-u|publisher=muzickazona.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was expanded and renovated in 2015. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Further renovations are planned for 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centar.ba/novost/14444/opcina-centar-pomaze-obnovu-bosanskog-kulturnog-centra|title=Općina Centar pomaže obnovu Bosanskog kulturnog centra|publisher=Centar.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7479">'''Call-out culture''' (also known as '''outrage culture''') is a term for the social phenomenon of publicly [[Denunciation|denouncing]] perceived [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]], and other forms of [[Prejudice|bigotry]]. Denunciation ("call-outs") can happen in person or [[Online shaming|online]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedersdorf|first1=Conor|title=The Destructiveness of Call-Out Culture on Campus: Reflections from undergraduates of the social media era|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/call-out-culture-is-stressing-out-college-students/524679/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=October 21, 2017|date=May 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danuta Walters|first1=Suzanna|title=Academe's Poisonous Call-Out Culture|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Academe-s-Poisonous-Call-Out/240016|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=October 21, 2017|date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Shaun |title=In Defense of Call-out Culture |url=https://www.cityartsmagazine.com/defense-call-culture/ |publisher=City Arts Magazine |accessdate=July 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="av"&gt;Vansintjan, Aaron.

Some commentators contend that callout culture is a pernicious influence in both the academic and business worlds, citing the [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber|controversy at Google]] over a memorandum concerning the respective vocational interests of men and women, authored by former Google engineer [[James Damore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paresky|first1=Pamela|title=When 'Speak Out' Culture Becomes 'Callout' Culture: Welcome to the world of post-rational discourse|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-and-the-pursuit-leadership/201709/when-speak-out-culture-becomes-callout-culture|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=October 21, 2017|date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have argued that callout culture can harm [[Progressivism|progressive]] politics by attacking people perceived to have exhibited prejudiced behaviour, rather than using dialogue with such people to change such behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Asam. (March 2, 2015) [https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/a-note-on-call-out-culture "A Note on Call-Out Culture"]. ''[[Briarpatch]]'' Magazine. Retrieved August 3rd, 2018.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamad, Ruby, and Liddle, Celeste. (11 October 2017) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/intersectionality-not-while-feminists-participate-in-pile-ons "Intersectionality? Not while feminists participate in pile-ons"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved August 3rd, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 essay, "Exiting the Vampire Castle", by [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]], is often cited as an early critique of call-out culture. Fisher argued that "call-out culture" created a space where "where solidarity is impossible, but guilt and fear are omnipresent". Fisher also argues that call-out
culture reduces every political issue to criticizing the behaviour of individuals, instead of dealing with such political issues through collective action. &lt;ref name="av" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izaakson, Jen. (August 12, 2017 )[https://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/08/12/kill-normies-skewers-online-identity-politics/ ‘Kill All Normies’ skewers online identity politics]  Feminist Current. Retrieved 23 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

Call-out culture found a vehicle in social media. Both as consumers and as political activists, individuals found a means to communicate to a larger crowd in an expedient and pervasive manner. While call-out culture often publicly denounces perceived acts of bigotry, as stated above, it also refers to the act of publicly calling out a larger entity (such as an organization, business or vendor) usually by means of social media. In an effort to hold these businesses or organizations accountable, individuals will take to the online forums to "call them out". Whether the individual is addressed by a representative from within the organization or not, some of these posts or tweets (depending on the medium) can go viral and cause a PR headache for the business. 

The effects of call-out culture are also noted as more prevalent today on college-campuses, where most students are aware of the social justice culture that exists and is expressed online. There are some that are careful to avoid missteps (ex: cultural appropriation by way of a Halloween costume) in order to avoid public online call-outs and others that are exploring ways to deal with past aggressors by way of call-out online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/call-out-culture-is-stressing-out-college-students/524679/|title=The Destructiveness of Call-Out Culture on Campus|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|date=2017-05-08|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people argue in defense of call-out culture and contend that it is a form of social activism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cityartsmagazine.com/defense-call-culture/|title=In Defense of Call-out Culture|last=Scott|first=Shaun|date=February 1, 2018|work=City Arts Magazine|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual calling someone out is ultimately trying to either stop behavior they deem to be negative or prevent it from happening again. Others argue that the call-out culture today tends to be too aggressive and can often have life-altering affects on the individual being called out. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-call-in-mean-when-call-out-culture-feels-toxic-this-method-can-be-used-instead-9056343|title=This Is What It Means To Call Someone In, Instead Of Calling Them Out|last=Rodriguez-Cayro|first=Kyli|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Calvaire''''' (also known as '''''The Ordeal''''') is a 2004 [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Fabrice Du Welz]], starring [[Laurent Lucas]], [[Philippe Nahon]] and [[Jackie Berroyer]].

== Plot==

Marc Stevens is a struggling low-level performer, who makes his living performing light pop ballads and easy listening tunes at retirement homes and other small venues around Belgium. En route to perform at a [[Christmas special]], his van — which doubles as his home — breaks down during a storm and he is stranded deep in the woods. Lost, cold, and succumbing to the elements, Marc is rescued by a local, an emaciated young man named Boris, who takes Marc to a run down inn.

The sole occupant of the inn is its proprietor, Mr. Bartel, an amiable old man who lives there as a [[hermit]] of sorts. Claiming to be a retired [[standup comedian]], Bartel welcomes Marc to stay and offers to repair his van as a token of brotherhood between professional entertainers. Marc accepts the offer, but remains aloof, not speaking with Bartel about his own career or personal life.

The next morning, Mr. Bartel tows Marc's van into the front yard of the inn. Marc tells Bartel he is going for a walk, at which point Bartel suddenly becomes paranoid and aggressive, warning Marc not to go into the nearby village. Marc agrees, but during his walk he approaches a nearby farm, where he witnesses a family [[voyeurism|voyeuristically]] watching a teenage boy have intercourse with a pig, calling the experience "so tender". Meanwhile, rather than repairing Marc's van, Bartel snoops through Marc's living quarters and takes his mobile phone and some amateur pornographic photographs presented to Marc by a fan ([[Brigitte Lahaie]]).

That night, Bartel becomes even more aggressive, working himself into a frenzy while recalling his adulterous wife Gloria who abandoned him years before. He insists that Marc sing him a song before going to bed. The next day, Marc finds the homemade porn in the inn and realizes Bartel has been going through his things; when he attempts to call for help, he discovers that the telephone Bartel has been regularly using isn't even wired into the wall. Confronting Bartel, Marc discovers him vandalizing the van and pouring petrol over it; Bartel knocks Marc unconscious and blows the van up.

Marc wakes to find himself tied to a chair, clad only in an old [[sundress]]. Mr. Bartel, now babbling, addresses Marc as if he were his wife, asking why "she" has come back after leaving him. Mr. Bartel sets about shaving one half of Marc's scalp, to "protect" him from the villagers, before forcing him into bed and cuddling next to him.

The next day, Bartel ties Marc to a tractor and takes him out into the woods to chop down a [[Christmas]] tree. Marc escapes, but ends up getting caught in a [[snare trap|rabbit snare]]. He lies there prone while darkness falls, until Boris wanders by. Marc begs him for help, but Boris ignores his pleas, addressing Marc as if he were his lost dog. He sits beside Marc and pets and strokes him until the desperate Marc bites his leg, at which he goes away. The next morning, Bartel, alerted by Boris, retrieves Marc, driving him back to the inn covered by a blanket on the back of a hay truck. A pair of villagers see Boris driving the truck with something concealed under a blanket, but they take no action.

Back at the inn, Bartel chastises "Gloria" for running away, then [[crucifixion|crucifies]] Marc behind the inn before going into the village to have a drink at the local pub. Seemingly convinced that his wife was a "[[slut]]" who was sleeping with every man in town, Bartel warns the men drinking in the bar that now "she" has "returned", none of them can "have her". The men all appear frightened at Bartel's ramblings, but once he leaves, one of the patrons sits at the antique piano and begins to play nightmarishly discordant [[polka]] music. Gradually the men all get up and begin dancing with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calvaire|url=http://free.pages.at/koch3/calvaire.htm|work=www.reviews.ch.vu|publisher=www.reviews.ch.vu|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Koch|language=German|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223210128/http://free.pages.at/koch3/calvaire.htm#|archive-date=2012-02-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back at the inn, Bartel brings Marc into the kitchen and they sit down for Christmas dinner. Boris arrives with a calf, convinced that it is his missing dog. Bartel gives a tearful, impassioned speech about love, togetherness, and the spirit of the holidays, before a sudden rifle shot rings out and a bullet explodes through the inn's window, killing Boris. The villagers lay siege to the inn, rushing the inn with a pig on a leash as one would employ a dog, intent on reclaiming the calf, and it quickly becomes apparent that they are also intent on raping Marc, in the shared delusion that Marc is Bartel's returned wife. The villagers mortally wound Bartel before turning their attention to Marc; one of them then briefly rapes Marc on the dining room table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BORDERLINE WEIRD: CALVAIRE (2004)|url=http://366weirdmovies.com/borderline-weird-calvaire-2004|work=366 Weird Movies|publisher=Weird Movies|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Pamela De Graff|date=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shots are fired among the men and in the confusion Marc manages to escape from the mob and into the forest. He spends the night running from them through the woods, coming across a cemetery with an imposing crucified Christ gravestone, aligning with the [[Calvary (sculpture)|Calvaire]] of the title. Marc manages to elude all but one of the men, who is about to capture "Gloria" when he falls into a bog and starts being swallowed up by the mire. Crying and broken, Marc approaches the drowning man. Instead of using the man's gun against him - or making any attempt to save him - Marc watches as he sinks below the surface. Finally, just before the man's head sinks into the marsh, Marc, as Gloria, responds to his impassioned question by telling him that "she" does, in fact, love him. Within seconds, the villager is dead, and Marc is left alone in the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Spotlight: The Ordeal|url=http://www.ioncinema.com/news/id/1465/foreign_spotlight_the_ordeal|work=IonCinema.com|publisher=IonCinema.com|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Jameson Kowalczyk|date=6 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
The film received mixed and divided reviews from critics.
[[Peter Bradshaw]] from [[The Guardian]] awarded the film 4 out of a possible 5 stars, calling it "A brilliant black comic nightmare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Calvaire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101997/calvaire|website=The Guardian|publisher=Peter Bradshaw|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Marc Savlov from [[Austin Chronicle]] awarded the film a negative 1 &lt;small&gt;1/2&lt;/small&gt; out of 5 stars, stating, "Calvaire has a few passages of genuine dread – a barroom dance by the local villagers is just plain disturbing – but it takes so long to get going and fails to generate the necessary suspense to keep viewers engaged, that the horrific final act is too little, too late, while at the same time nearly being much too much".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savlov|first1=Marc|title=Calvaire - Film Calendar - The Austin Chronicle|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2006-09-08/400894/|website=Austin Chroncle.com|publisher=Marc Savlov|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot overview ==
A young [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] trainee, Annie Walker, is sent to work in the Domestic Protection Division (DPD) as a field agent. August "Auggie" Anderson, a blind tech operative, is Annie's guide in her new life. In the beginning, Annie's cover story is that she works in Acquisitions at the [[Smithsonian Museum]] but she is later let go. As of the fourth season, her new cover is that of a glamorous and well-connected importer/exporter, with expensive tastes and dealings that may not always be legal. The series traces Annie's evolution from a wide-eyed young operative who fetches coffee for her co-workers to a hardened spy who doesn't balk at enhanced interrogation.  This change in tone is also seen in the opening credits, which used [[chick lit]]-style graphics in the early seasons.  The cartoons, like the focus on Annie's home life with her sister, were gone in the fourth and fifth seasons.

== Cast and characters ==

A New Series From the Producers of "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith" and the Producer of the "Bourne" Trilogy..."&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the series takes place in Toronto, Ontario, at primary static sets housed in a studio, as well as at "stock" shooting locations throughout the local area. This is combined with material filmed at various international locations in which the series' episodes are set, such as Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name=hr0106/&gt;&lt;ref name=hr0507/&gt; capturing geographically unique elements of these places. In some instances, the series' producers use a stand-in location for shots where the costs and logistics of the actual location shoot are impractical, or if the location specified is fictional.

[[File:DabousGiraffe2.jpg|thumb|Smaller petroglyphs near the Dabous Giraffes]]
The '''Dabous Giraffes''' are a [[neolithic]] [[petroglyph]] by an unknown artist. Completed between 9000 BC and 5000 BC, the giraffe carvings were first documented by David Coulson in 1997 while on a photographic expedition at a site in [[Niger]], [[Africa]].

The carving is 20 feet in height and consists of two giraffes carved into the ''Dabous Rock'' with a great amount of detail. Dabous Rock is located on the sloping slope of a small rocky outcropping of sandstone in the first foothills of the Air Mountains. One of the giraffes is male, while the other, smaller, is female.

In the surroundings 828 images have been found engraved on the rocks, of which 704 are animals (bovidae, giraffes, ostriches, antelopes, lions, rincerontes and camels), 61 are human and 159 are indeterminate.

The Bradshaw Foundation is an organization dedicated to the protection and preservation of this petroglyph.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14177">The '''Dalton Plan''' is an educational concept created by [[Helen Parkhurst]]. It is inspired by the intellectual ferment at the turn of the 20th century. Educational thinkers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[John Dewey]] influenced Parkhurst while she created the Dalton Plan. Their aim was to achieve a balance between a child's talent and the needs of the community.

==Helen Parkhurst==
The American teacher Helen Parkhurst (1886-1973) developed at the beginning of the twentieth century the Dalton Plan to reform the then current pedagogics and the then usual manner of classroom management. She wanted to break the teacher-centered lockstep teaching. During her first experiment, which she implemented in a small elementary school as a young teacher in 1904, she noticed that when students are given freedom for self-direction and self-pacing and to help one another, their motivation increases considerably and they learn a lot more. In a later experiment in 1911 and 1912 Parkhurst re-organized the education in a large school for nine to fourteen year-olds. Instead of each grade, each subject was appointed its own teacher and its own classroom. The subject teachers made assignments: they converted the subject matter for each grade into learning assignments. In this way, learning became the students’ own work; they could carry out their work independently, work at their own pace and plan their work themselves. The classroom turned into a laboratory, a place where students are working, furnished and equipped as work spaces, tailored to meet the requirements of specific subjects. Useful and attractive learning materials, instruments and reference books were put within the students’ reach. The benches were replaced by large tables to facilitate co-operation and group instruction. This second experiment formed the basis for the next experiments, those in Dalton and New York, from 1919 onwards. The only addition was the use of graphs, charts enabling students to keep track of their own progress in each subject. From now on it was called the Dalton Plan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://xs4all.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg/Dalton-education "Dalton education"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 en 1922 Parkhurst explained the theory of the Dalton Plan in a series of articles published in “The Times Educational Supplement” and in her book “Education on the Dalton Plan”. It can be reconstructed as follows. The Dalton Plan is an “efficiency measure”: “a simple and economic reorganization of the school” (Parkhurst, 1922, 46). Lockstep teaching is not efficient, because: it is the teacher who does all the work. The Dalton Plan “creates conditions which enable ... the learner to learn” (34). Learning is the same as experience: “Experience is the best and indeed the only real teacher” (152). The school has to provide for sufficient experience. This cannot be achieved by keeping students as passive recipients, separating them from one another, holding them in one place, requiring them to remain silent, making them learn lessons by heart and subjecting them to whole class recitation. We can provide for experience through the “liberation of the pupil” and the “socialization of the school” (46). In the Dalton Plan, freedom is the opportunity to do the schoolwork oneself, to organize it oneself (how where and when) and to carry it out at one’s own pace, particularly to do it undisturbed and to work with commitment and concentration. Self-activity brings about experience. Something similar applies in the Dalton Plan to interaction and co-operation. When students are permitted to interact and work freely with one another and with teachers, in varying groups, in varied locations, with varied resources and materials, they come into contact with one another, the teachers, the subject matter and the learning materials in different ways. This means more experience and consequently more learning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://xs4all.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg/Dalton-education "Dalton education"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World wide==

In the 1920s and 1930s,, Dalton education was spread throughout the world. There is no certainty regarding the exact numbers of Dalton schools, but there was Dalton education in America, Australia, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan. Particularly in the Netherlands, China and Japan, Dalton education has remained in existence. In recent years there has been a revival of international interest. It crops up again, for instance, in England, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Netherlands is the country with the highest density of Dalton schools. In 2013 there were five hundred; most of them elementary schools.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Comprising five percent of all elementary schools, Dalton education is by far the largest educational reform movement in the Netherlands.{{fact|date=July 2017}}  And, contrary to Montessori, [[Jenaplan_schools|Jena Plan]] and [[Waldorf education]], it is steadily on the increase. The only Dalton school in the USA, is the school that Helen Parkhurst founded herself in 1919, and which she was subsequently to direct for more than twenty years: the Dalton School in New York. It is a renowned school. But today its fame is not due to its origins as an experiment in progressive education: the [[Dalton School]] is one of the most expensive private schools in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[https://xs4all.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg/Dalton-education "Dalton education"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Expand section|date=October 2013}}
Parkhurst's specific objectives were as follows:&lt;ref name=dewey&gt;Evelyn Dewey, [https://archive.org/details/daltonlaboratory00deweiala The Dalton Laboratory Plan], E.P. Dutton, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;
# To tailor each student's program to his or her needs, interests and abilities. 
# To promote each student's [[independence]] and dependability. 
# To enhance the student's social skills. 
# To increase their sense of responsibility toward others.

She developed a three-part plan that continues to be the structural foundation of a Dalton education:&lt;ref name=dewey /&gt;
# The [[House system|House]], a social community of students.
# The Assignment, a monthly goal which students contract to complete.
# The Laboratory, a subject-based classrooms intended to be the center of the educational experience. The laboratory involves students from fourth grade through the end of secondary education.

Students move between subject "laboratories" (classrooms) and explore themes at their own pace.

==Introduction in UK==

On May 27, 1920, a very enthusiastic article describing the working of the Dalton Plan in detail was published in the ''Times' Educational Supplement''.  Parkhurst "has given to the secondary school the leisure and culture of the University student; she has uncongested the curriculum; she has abolished the teacher's nightly preparation of classes and the child's nightmare of homework.  At the same time the children under her regime cover automatically all the ground prescribed for examinations 'of matriculation standard,' and examination failures among them are nil."{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The Dalton Plan is a method of education by which pupils work at their own pace, and receive individual help from the teacher when necessary. There is no formal class instruction.  Students draw up time-tables and are responsible for finishing the work on their syllabuses or assignments.  Students are also encouraged to help each other with their work. The underlying aim of the Dalton Plan is to achieve the highest mental, moral, physical and spiritual development of the pupil.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In the spring of 1921, English headmistress [[Rosa Bassett]] went to the Children's University School and stayed with Parkhurst. They spent hours talking about education. Parkhurst found Bassett in complete agreement with her ideas: "She was Dalton," Parkhurst wrote 50 years later. She described Bassett and Belle Rennie as the two people in England who were most enthusiastic and most helpful about the introduction of the Dalton Plan.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

It was in 1922 that the UK Board of Education gave official approval and many hundreds of schools in England adopted some form of the Dalton Plan. That same year Parkhurst published ''Education on the Dalton Plan''. In time it was claimed that there were a thousand "Dalton" schools in Japan, another thousand in India, and many in the Soviet Union, Poland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Schools==
Today there are a number of schools around the world and that employ variations of teaching methods based on the Dalton Plan. Most of the schools listed below interpret the Dalton Plan according to their needs. In some cases, they retain only a minimal part of the original Dalton Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Educator|url=https://www.educator.com|publisher=Educator|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dalton International]]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the only schools that have strong affiliation with Helen Parkhurst's Dalton School in New York are Dalton Tokyo and Dalton Nagoya.

'''EN 13402 Size designation of clothes''' is a European [[standardisation|standard]] for labelling [[Clothing sizes|clothes sizes]]. It is based on body dimensions, measured in [[centimetre]]s. It replaces many older national dress-size systems in popular use before the year 2007. Acceptance of this form of standardisation varies from country to country.  For example, the [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs]] has commissioned a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consumo-inc.es/Noticias/Notasdeprensa/2008/tallasIngles.htm |title=The anthropometric study of the female population has revealed the existence of three generalised body types, which should serve as a more accurate basis for sizing |publisher=Consumo-inc.es |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203153017/http://www.consumo-inc.es/Noticias/Notasdeprensa/2008/tallasIngles.htm |archivedate=3 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to categorise female body types with a view to harmonising Spanish clothing sizes with EN-13402.  Few other countries are known to have followed suit. For children's clothing it is the de facto standard in most of Europe already.

==Background==
There are three approaches for size-labelling of clothes:

; Body dimensions: The label states the range of body measurements for which the product was designed. (For example: bike helmet label stating "head girth: 56–60 cm")
; Product dimensions: The label states characteristic dimensions of the product. (For example: jeans label stating inner leg length of the jeans in centimetres or inches (not inner leg measurement of the intended wearer))
; Ad hoc size: The label states a size number or code with no obvious relationship to any measurement. (For example: Size 12, XL)

Traditionally, clothes have been labelled using many different ad hoc size systems.
This approach has led to a number of problems:
* For many types of garments, size cannot be adequately described by a single number because a good fit requires a match between two (or sometimes three) independent body dimensions. This is a common issue in sizing [[jeans]].
* Ad hoc sizes have changed with time due to changing demographics and increasing rates of obesity. This is often portrayed in media as [[vanity sizing]].
* Scalar ad hoc sizes based on 1950s anthropometric studies are no longer adequate, as changes in nutrition and life style have shifted the distribution of body dimensions.
* Mail order requires accurate methods for predicting the best-fitting size.
* Country-specific and vendor-specific labels incur additional costs.

Therefore, the European standards committee [[European Committee for Standardisation|CEN]]/TC 248/WG 10 started in 1996 the process of designing a new modern system of labelling clothes sizes, resulting in the standard EN 13402 "Size designation of clothes".

It is based on:
* body-dimensions
* the [[metric system]] ([[SI]])
* data from new [[Anthropometry|anthropometric]] studies of the European population performed in the late 1990s
* similar existing [[international standards]] ([[International Organisation for Standardisation|ISO]] 3635, etc.)

==EN 13402-1: Terms, definitions and body measurement procedure==
[[File:EN-13402-pictogram.png|thumb|right|European Standard (EN 13402-1) pictogram example for some cloting type (jacket?) with primary and secondary measurements.]]
The first part&lt;ref&gt;BSI, 2001. BS EN 13402-1:2001, Size Designation of Clothes - Part 1: Terms, definitions and body measurement procedure, London, UK: British Standards Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; of the standard defines the list of body dimensions to be used for designating clothes sizes, together with an anatomical explanation and measurement guidelines. All body dimensions are measured, preferably without or as few as possible clothes, in centimetres, except for the body mass.

The standard also defines a pictogram that can be used in language-neutral labels to indicate one or several of the following body dimensions.

; {{anchor|head}} '''head girth''' : maximum [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] girth (circumference) of the [[Human head|head]] measured above the [[ear]]s
; {{anchor|neck}} neck girth : girth of the neck measured with the [[tape measure]] passed 2&amp;nbsp;cm below the [[Adam's apple]] and at the level of the 7th [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]] [[vertebra]]
; {{anchor|chest}} chest girth (♂ men): maximum horizontal girth measured during normal breathing with the subject standing erect and the tape-measure passed over the [[shoulder blade]]s (scapulae), under the [[armpits]] (axillae), and across the [[chest]]
; {{anchor|bust}} bust girth (♀ women): maximum horizontal girth measured during normal breathing with the subject standing erect and the tape-measure passed horizontally, under the armpits (axillae), and across the bust prominence (preferably measured with moderate tension over a [[brassiere]] that shall not deform the [[breast]] in an unnatural way and shall not displace its volume)
; {{anchor|underbust}} underbust girth (♀ women): horizontal girth of the body measured just below the [[breast]]s
; {{anchor|waist}} waist girth : girth of the natural [[waist]]line between the top of the [[hip bone]]s (iliac crests) and the lower [[rib]]s, measured with the subject breathing normally and standing erect with the [[human abdomen|abdomen]] relaxed
; {{anchor|hips}} hip girth (♀ women): horizontal girth measured round the [[buttocks]] at the level of maximum circumference
; {{anchor|height}} [[Human height|height]] : vertical distance between the crown of the head and the soles of the feet, measured with the subject standing erect without shoes and with the feet together (for infants not yet able to stand upright: length of the body measured in a straight line from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet)
; {{anchor|legs}} inside leg length : distance between the [[crotch]] and the soles of the feet, measured in a straight vertical line with the subject erect, feet slightly apart, and the weight of the body equally distributed on both legs
; {{anchor|arms}} arm length: distance, measured using the tape-measure, from the armscye/shoulder line intersection ([[acromion]]), over the elbow, to the far end of the prominent wrist bone ([[ulna]]), with the subject's right fist clenched and placed on the hip, and with the arm bent at 90°
; {{anchor|hands}} hand girth: maximum girth measured over the knuckles ([[metacarpal]]s) of the open right hand, fingers together and thumb excluded
; {{anchor|feet}} foot length: horizontal distance between perpendiculars in contact with the end of the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel, measured with the subject standing barefoot and the weight of the body equally distributed on both feet
; {{anchor|mass}} body mass: measured with a suitable balance in kilograms

==EN 13402-2: Primary and secondary dimensions==

The second part&lt;ref&gt;BSI, 2002. BS EN 13402-2:2002, Size Designation of Clothes - Part 2: Primary and secondary dimensions, London, UK: British Standards Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; of the standard defines for each type of garment one "primary dimension".
This is the body measure according to which the product must be labelled.
Where men’s garments use the chest girth, women’s clothes are designed for a certain bust girth.

For some types of garment, a single measure may not be sufficient to select the right product. In these cases, one or two "secondary dimensions" can be added to the label.

The following table shows the ''primary'' (in bold) and ''secondary dimensions'' listed in the standard, leaving out the redundant words ''girth'', ''length'' and ''size'' for better overview.

==EN 13402–3: Measurements and intervals==

The third part&lt;ref&gt;BSI, 2004. BS EN 13402-3:2004, Size Designation of Clothes - Part 3: Measurements and Intervals.&lt;/ref&gt; of the standard defines [[preferred number]]s of primary and secondary body dimensions.

The product should not be labelled with the average body dimension for which the garment was designed (i.e., not "height: 176 cm."). Instead, the label should show the range of body dimensions from half the step size below to half the step size above the design size (e.g., "height: 172–180 cm.").

For heights, for example, the standard recommends generally to use the following design dimensions, with a step size of 8&amp;nbsp;cm:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Height
| … || 160 || 168 || 176 || 184 || 192 || 200 || …
|-
! Range
| … || 156–164 || 164–172 || 172–180 || 180–188 || 188–196 || 196–204 || …
|}

For trousers, the recommended step size for height is 4&amp;nbsp;cm:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Height
| … || 156 || 160 || 164 || 168 || 172 || 176
| 180 || 184 || 188 || 192 || 196 || 200 || …
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| … || 154–158 || 158–162 || 162–166 || 166–170 || 170–174 || 174–178
| 178–182 || 182–186 || 186–190 || 190–194 || 194–198 || 198–202 || …
|}

The standard defines similar tables for other dimensions and garments, only some of which are shown here.

===Men===

The standard sizes and ranges for chest and waist girth are defined in steps of 4&amp;nbsp;cm:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Men’s standard sizes for ''drop'' = −12&amp;nbsp;cm
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Chest girth
| 84 || 88 || 92 || 96 || 100 || 104 || 108 || 112
| 116 || 120 || 126 || 132 || 138 || 144
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| 82–86 || 86–90 || 90–94 || 94–98 || 98–102 || 102–106 || 106–110 || 110–114
| 114–118 || 118–123 || 123–129 || 129–135 || 135–141 || 141–147
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Waist girth
| 72 || 76 || 80 || 84 || 88 || 92 || 96 || 100
| 104 || 108 || 114 || 120 || 126 || 132
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| 70–74 || 74–78 || 78–82 || 82–86 || 86–90 || 90–94 || 94–98 || 98–102
| 102–106 || 106–111 || 111–117 || 117–123 || 123–129 || 129–135
|}

: ''drop'' = ''waist girth'' − ''chest girth''.
Example: While manufacturers will typically design clothes for ''chest girth'' = 100&amp;nbsp;cm such that it fits ''waist girth'' = 88&amp;nbsp;cm, they may also want to combine that ''chest girth'' with neighbouring ''waist girth'' step sizes 84&amp;nbsp;cm or 92&amp;nbsp;cm, to cover these drop types (−16&amp;nbsp;cm and −8&amp;nbsp;cm) as well.

The standard also suggests that neck girth can be associated with chest girth:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Association of neck and chest girth
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Neck girth
| 37 || 38 || 39 || 40 || 41 || 42 || 43 || 44

|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| 36.5–37.5 || 37.5–38.5 || 38.5–39.5 || 39.5–40.5 || 40.5–41.5 || 41.5–42.5 || 42.5–43.5 || 43.5–44.5
| 44.5–45.8 || 45.8–47.3 || 47.3–48.8 || 48.8–50.3 || 50.3–51.1
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Chest girth
| 88 || 92 || 96 || 100 || 104 || 108 || 112 || 116
| 120 || 126 || 132 || 138 || 144
|}

The standard further suggests that arm length can be associated with height:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Association of arm length and body height
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Height
| 156 || 160 || 164 || 168 || 172 || 176 || 180 || 184 || 188 || 192 || 196 || 200
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Arm length
| 60 || 61 || 62 || 63 || 64 || 65 || 66 || 67 || 68 || 69 || 70 || 71
|- style="text-align:center;"

|}

===Women===
[[Image:EN-13402-dress.png|thumb|EN 13402–1 pictogram example for dress size 88–72–96]]

====Dress sizes====
The standard sizes and ranges for bust, waist and hip girth are mostly based on a step of 4&amp;nbsp;cm, for larger sizes 5&amp;nbsp;cm (hip) or 6&amp;nbsp;cm (bust and waist):

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Women’s standard sizes for drop = &amp;minus;16&amp;nbsp;cm
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Bust girth
| 76 || 80 || 84 || 88 || 92 || 96 || 100 || 104 || 110

| 97–103 || 103–109 || 109–115 || 115–121 || 121–127 || 127–133 || 133–139
|- style="text-align:center;"

| 120–125 || 125–130 || 130–135 || 135–140 || 140–145 || 145–150 || 150–155
|}

====Bra sizes====
[[Image:EN-13402-bra.png|thumb|EN 13402–1 pictogram for bra size 70B]]
{{See also|Bra size}}

The European standard EN 13402 also defines bra sizes based on the "bust girth" and the "underbust girth". Bras are labeled with the under bust girth (rounded to the nearest multiple of 5&amp;nbsp;cm), followed by a letter code that indicates the "cup size" defined below, according to this table defined by the standard.

The standard sizes for brassiere are based on a step of 5&amp;nbsp;cm:
{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Underbust girth
| 60 || 65 || 70 || 75 || 80 || 85 || 90 || 95
| 100 || 105 || 110 || 115 || 120 || 125
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Range
| 58–62 || 63–67 || 68–72 || 73–77 || 78–82 || 83–87 || 88–92 || 93–97
| 98–102 || 103–107 || 108–112 || 113–117 || 118–122 || 123–127
|}

The secondary dimension ''cup size'' can be expressed in terms of the difference
: ''cup size'' = ''bust girth'' − ''underbust girth''
and can be labelled compactly using a letter code appended to the ''underbust girth'':

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="text-align:center;"
! Code
| AA|| A || B || C || D || E || F || G || H
|-
! Cup size range

;Example 1: Bra size 70B is suitable for women with ''underbust girth'' 68–72&amp;nbsp;cm and ''bust girth'' from 82–84&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;!--for 68cm--&gt; to 86–88&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;!--for 72cm--&gt;.
;Example 2: A woman with an ''underbust girth'' of 89&amp;nbsp;cm and a ''bust girth'' of 108&amp;nbsp;cm has ''cup size'' 19&amp;nbsp;cm (= 108&amp;nbsp;cm – 89&amp;nbsp;cm) or "D". Her underbust girth rounded to the nearest multiple of 5&amp;nbsp;cm is 90&amp;nbsp;cm. Therefore, her bra size according to the standard is 90D.

===Letter codes===

For clothes where a larger step size is sufficient, the standard also defines a letter code. This code represents the bust girth for women and the chest girth for men. The standard does not define such a code for children.
Each range combines two adjacent size steps. The ranges could be extended below XXS or above 3XL if necessary.

==EN 13402-4: Coding system==
{{update|part 4 of the standard|date=September 2011}}&lt;!--it feels it has been abandoned completely--&gt;
The fourth part of the standard is still under review. It will define a compact coding system for clothes sizes. This was originally intended primarily for industry use in databases and as a part of stock-keeping identifiers and catalogue ordering numbers, but later users have also expressed a desire to use compact codes for customer communication. Writing out all the centimetre figures of all the primary and secondary measures from EN 13402-2 can – in some cases – require up to 12 digits. The full list of centimetre figures on the pictogram contains a lot of redundancy and the same information can be squeezed into fewer [[character (computing)|character]]s with lookup tables. EN 13402-4 will define such tables.

An earlier draft of this part of the standard attempted to list all in-use combinations of EN 13402-3 measures and assigned a short 2- or 3-digit code to each. Some of the industry representatives involved in the standardization process considered this approach too restrictive. Others argued that the primary dimension in centimetres should be a prominent part of the code. Therefore, this proposal, originally expected to be adopted in 2005, was rejected.

Since then, several new proposals have been presented to the CEN working group. One of these, tabled by the [http://www.aedt.org/ European Association of National Organisations of Textile Traders (AEDT)], proposes a 5-character alphanumeric code, consisting of the 3-digit centimetre figure of the primary body dimension, followed by one or two letters that code a secondary dimension, somewhat like the system already defined for bra sizes.&lt;ref&gt;CEN/TC 248/WG 10 N 285&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an item designed for 100&amp;nbsp;cm bust girth, 104&amp;nbsp;cm &lt;!--(B): (104-100)/4=1, 0=&gt;A, …?--&gt; hip girth and 176&amp;nbsp;cm &lt;!--(G): A=152, step=4cm--&gt;height could bear the compact size code "100BG". This proposal was agreed upon in 2006, but later disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aedt.org/resources/aedt-publications/doc_download/108-study-on-labelling-of-textile-products#page=39 |title=Study on labelling of textile products |publisher=AEDT |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by Bogusławska-Bączek published in 2010 showed that there were still significant difficulties in identifying clothing sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

'''Eamonn McCann''' (born 10 March 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr Eamonn McCann|url=http://aims.niassembly.gov.uk/mlas/details.aspx?&amp;aff=11873&amp;per=5807&amp;sel=5&amp;ind=&amp;prv=0|website=Northern Ireland Assembly|publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an Irish politician, journalist and [[Activism|political activist]] from [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. In the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2016|2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election]], he was elected as an [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] for the [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle]] constituency. He served for nearly 9 months before losing his seat in [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 2017|2017]].

==Early life and education==
McCann was born and has lived most of his life in Derry. Raised Catholic, he attended [[St. Columb's College]] and is prominently featured in the documentary film, ''The Boys of St. Columb's''. He later attended [[Queen's University Belfast]], where he was president of the [[Literary and Scientific Society (Queen's University Belfast)|Literary and Scientific Society]], the university's debating society.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Career==
As a young man he was one of the original organisers of the [[Derry Housing Action Committee]] (DHAC), a radical campaign group focusing on access to social housing. DHAC organised, in conjunction with the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA), the second civil rights march in Northern Ireland. This march, which took place on 5 October 1968, is generally seen as the birth date of the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Movement]]. His political contemporaries included [[Bernadette Devlin]], for whom he served as an election agent.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He stood for election in the [[Foyle (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Foyle constituency]] at the [[Northern Ireland general election, 1969|1969 Northern Ireland general election]] for the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]], placing third with 1,993 votes (12.3% of the total).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/ldrcity.html|title=Northern Ireland Parliamentary Election Results: Boroughs: Londonderry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was tried (as one of the so-called [[Raytheon 9]]) in Belfast in May–June 2008 over alleged damage caused during the [[2006 Lebanon War|2006 War on Lebanon]] to a facility operated by multinational arms company [[Raytheon]] in Derry. The jury unanimously acquitted McCann, and all the other defendants, of charges of criminal damage to property belonging to Raytheon. The jury had heard that the groups's actions were prompted by repeated bombing of Lebanese property in which numerous civilians died and the wish to protect those lives and that property from being attacked by Israeli forces with weapons, weaponry systems and missiles supplied by Raytheon. The judge dismissed charges of [[affray]] after hearing the prosecution evidence. However, McCann was convicted of the theft of two computer discs, for which he received a 12-month conditional discharge.&lt;ref name=Raytheon_6_cleared&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.derryjournal.com/journal/Raytheon6-cleared.4176443.jp|title=Raytheon 6 cleared|work=[[Derry Journal]]|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement outside the court McCann said: "[We] have been vindicated. ... The jury have accepted that we were reasonable in our belief that ... Israeli ... Forces were guilty of war crimes in Lebanon in the summer of 2006. The action we took was intended to have, and did have, the effect of hampering or delaying the commission of war crimes".&lt;ref name=Raytheon_6_cleared/&gt;

His appearance at the funeral of former PIRA volunteer, Old Bailey bomber, and republican activist [[Dolours Price]], and a tribute he paid to her, was criticised by a son-in-law of [[Jean McConville]], who was kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the [[PIRA]]. Price was suspected of being one of the paramilitaries who took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0219/1224264799917.html|title=Price offers to help locate 'disappeared'|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=19 February 2010|accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrest Adams Now|work=[[Sunday Life (newspaper)|Sunday Life]]|date=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/2013/04/15/ira-tapes-boston-college|title=Boston College IRA interviews update|work=[[WBUR-FM]]|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCann explained that her family had asked him to speak at her funeral. He said: "I don't think I said anything at Dolours Price's grave that contradicted that [calling McConville's murder 'a horrible and unforgivable act'] ... The point I had in mind, the point I was making, was there are some people deeply implicated in the cruel murder of Mrs McConville who appear not to be undergoing any inner turmoil. They appear to find it very easy to handle the knowledge of their own involvement in that murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/headlines/mcconville-relative-raps-socialist-for-dolours-price-tribute-1-4733840|title=McConville relative raps socialist for Dolours Price tribute|work=[[The News Letter]]|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected as an [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] for [[Foyle (Assembly constituency)|Foyle]] in May 2016 but lost his seat in January 2017. While the number of seats in the Foyle constituency was reduced from six to five, McCann and People before Profit attracted criticism from [[Sinn Féin]] and pro-European activists for supporting [[Brexit]] in an area with the 4th highest remain vote (out of approximately 400 counting areas) in the whole of the United Kingdom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/northern-ireland-constituencies/N06000008|title=Foyle – Northern Ireland Assembly constituency – Election 2016|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/42032&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, McCann's vote increased in the 2017 election and he came close to taking the fifth seat from the DUP.

==Campaigning work==
McCann was central to the setting up of the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign; the role of his investigative journalism and decades of campaigning for justice for the Bloody Sunday families was recognised in 2010 when several of the families proposed him for the Paul Foot Award for campaigning journalism. Their citation &lt;ref&gt;http://www.private-eye.co.uk/paul-foot-award/2010&lt;/ref&gt; said: "EAMONN McCANN has been using his journalism to campaign for justice for the Bloody Sunday families for almost 40 years. The publication of the Saville Report in June marked a victory for the families, a victory of which McCann was very much a part.

In February 1972, within a month of the killings, McCann published the first pamphlet on Bloody Sunday, “What happened in Derry”. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s he wrote about the injustice of Bloody Sunday whenever he got the opportunity. In the run-up to 1992, the 20th anniversary of the massacre, McCann made a proposal to the families for a book to mark the occasion. The publication of Bloody Sunday in Derry: What Really Happened was crucial in helping to bring together all the Bloody Sunday families for the first time into a single campaign.

Throughout the 1990s McCann wrote constantly about Bloody Sunday, ensuring that every new piece of evidence about what had happened on the day and in the course of the subsequent cover-up was analysed and publicised. He wrote in the local Derry papers, in the Belfast Telegraph, the Irish Times, the Sunday Tribune, in the London Independent, the Guardian, the Observer – anywhere he could place a story. With the announcement of the Saville Tribunal, McCann's writing on Bloody Sunday came into its own. While other journalists focused only on the evidence of the more high-profile witnesses, McCann attended almost every day of the tribunal. He attended the hearings in London's Central Hall, paying his own costs to travel to and from London and staying with family while there. He wrote a weekly analysis for the Sunday Tribune in Dublin, and covered the proceedings daily for the Irish commercial radio station Today FM, as well as contributing articles to the Guardian, Observer, Irish Times, Irish Mirror and Irish Daily Mail."

McCann currently writes for the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and the ''[[Derry Journal]]''. He has written a column for the [[Dublin]]-based magazine, ''[[Hot Press]]'', and is a frequent commentator on the [[BBC]], [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] and other broadcast media. He worked as a journalist for the ''[[Sunday World]]'' newspaper and contributed to the original ''In Dublin'' magazine, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/eamonn-mccann-7.2705731|title=Eamonn McCann|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=belfast_telegraph_columns&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/columnists/eamonn-mccann/|title=Eamonn McCann|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hotpress.com/Eamonn-McCann/news/Hot-Press-columnist-Eamonn-McCann-elected-to-Stormont/17226995.html|title=Hot Press columnist Eamonn McCann elected to Stormont|work=[[Hot Press]]|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his journalistic work reflects what he himself describes&lt;ref&gt;''Dear God: The Price of Religion in Ireland'' (Paperback) by Eamonn McCann, Bookmarks (10 November 1999); {{ISBN|1-898876-58-4}}; {{ISBN|978-1-898876-58-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a "shuddering fascination" with religion which, when coupled with his profound skepticism, has made it a topic to which he has often returned.&lt;ref name=belfast_telegraph_columns/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/archives.php?author=2010155|title=Archives|work=[[Hot Press]]|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, McCann spoke with [[National Public Radio]] in the U.S. about the solidarity between the Catholic civil rights movement in Northern Ireland and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Drew|last=Tweksbury|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/newsandviews/2008/03/n_ireland_and_the_us_shared_ci.html|title=N. Ireland and the U.S.: A Shared Civil Rights Struggle|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, following [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|Crimea's referendum on joining Russia]], McCann had a piece published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' on the situation there. He commented: "After six years in office, Obama believes he has a right to invade anywhere, bomb anything, kill anybody whose jib the CIA doesn't like the cut of, irrespective of national or international law or, indeed, of the provisions of the US constitution. And now he lectures Putin on the necessity of 'respecting international law'. He has a nerve." 

In the same piece he wrote: "[[Vladimir Putin]] may run a vicious regime but the people of Crimea have a right to be accepted as Russian if that's what they want, which evidently they do",&lt;ref name=crimea&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/if-we-have-to-pick-a-side-over-crimea-let-it-be-russia-1.1731105|title=If we have to pick a side over Crimea, let it be Russia|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=20 March 2014|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added: "Putin is right that the main motivation of the US and Nato has been to encircle and enfeeble his country.

[[File:Rat coming out cage.jpg|thumb|300px| A rodent is not stimulated by the environment in a wire cage, and this affects its brain negatively, particularly the complexity of its synaptic connections]]
'''Environmental enrichment''' is the stimulation of the [[brain]] by its physical and social surroundings. Brains in richer, more stimulating environments have higher rates of [[synaptogenesis]] and more complex [[dendrites|dendrite arbors]], leading to increased brain activity. This effect takes place primarily during [[neurodevelopment]], but also during adulthood  to a lesser degree. With extra [[synapses]] there is also increased synapse activity, leading to an increased size and number of [[glia]]l energy-support cells. Environmental enrichment also enhances [[capillary]] vasculation, providing the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The [[neuropil]] (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands, thickening the cortex. Research on rodent brains suggests that environmental enrichment may also lead to an increased rate of [[neurogenesis]].

Research on animals finds that environmental enrichment could aid the treatment and recovery of numerous brain-related dysfunctions, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and those connected to [[aging]], whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development. Moreover, this research also suggests that environmental enrichment leads to a greater level of [[cognitive reserve]], the brain's resilience to the effects of conditions such as [[aging]] and [[dementia]].

Research on humans suggests that lack of stimulation delays and impairs cognitive development. Research also finds that attaining and engaging in higher levels of education, environments in which people participate in more challenging cognitively stimulating activities, results in greater cognitive reserve.

== Early research ==
[[Donald O. Hebb]] in 1947 found that rats raised as pets performed better on problem solving tests than rats raised in cages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hebb DO | title = The effects of early experience on problem solving at maturity | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 2 | pages = 306–7 | year = 1947 | doi = 10.1037/h0063667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research, however, did not investigate the brain nor use standardized impoverished and enriched environments. Research doing this first was started in 1960 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by [[Mark Rosenzweig (psychologist)|Mark Rosenzweig]], who compared single rats in normal cages, and those placed in ones with toys, ladders, tunnels, running wheels in groups. This found that growing up in enriched environments affected enzyme [[cholinesterase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0045402 |vauthors=Krech D, Rosenzweig MR, Bennett EL | title = Effects of environmental complexity and training on brain chemistry | journal = J Comp Physiol Psychol | volume = 53 | pages = 509–19 |date=December 1960 | pmid = 13754181 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work led in 1962 to the discovery that environmental enrichment increased [[cerebral cortex]] volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0041137 |vauthors=Rosenzweig MR, Krech D, Bennett EL, Diamond MC | title = Effects of environmental complexity and training on brain chemistry and anatomy: a replication and extension | journal = J Comp Physiol Psychol | volume = 55 | pages = 429–37 |date=August 1962 | pmid = 14494091 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, it was found that this was due to increased cerebral cortex thickness and greater [[synapse]] and [[glial]] numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/2041161a0 |vauthors=Altman J, Das GD | title = Autoradiographic Examination of the Effects of Enriched Environment on the Rate of Glial Multiplication in the Adult Rat Brain | journal = Nature | volume = 204 | pages = 1161–3 |date=December 1964 | pmid = 14264369 | issue = 4964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiamondKrech"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cne.901230110 |vauthors=Diamond MC, Krech D, Rosenzweig MR | title = The Effects of an Enriched Environment on the Histology of the Rat Cerebral Cortex | journal = J. Comp. Neurol. | volume = 123 | pages = 111–20 |date=August 1964 | pmid = 14199261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also starting around 1960, [[Harry Harlow]] studied the effects of [[maternal deprivation|maternal and social deprivation]] on [[rhesus monkey]] infants (a form of environmental stimulus deprivation). This established the importance of social stimulation for normal [[cognitive development|cognitive]] and emotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harlow HF, Rowland GL, Griffin GA | title = The Effect of Total Social Deprivation on the Development of Monkey Behavior | journal = Psychiatr Res Rep Am Psychiatr Assoc | volume = 19 | pages = 116–35 |date=December 1964 | pmid = 14232649 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synapses ==

=== Synaptogenesis ===

Rats raised with environmental enrichment have thicker cerebral cortices (3.3–7%) that contain 25% more [[synapses]].&lt;ref name="DiamondKrech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DiamondLaw"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamond MC, Law F, Rhodes H | title = Increases in cortical depth and glia numbers in rats subjected to enriched environment | journal = J.

=== Dendrite complexity ===
Environmental enrichment affects the complexity and length of the [[dendrite]] arbors (upon which synapses form). Higher-order dendrite branch complexity is increased in enriched environments,&lt;ref name="Greenough" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.176.4042.1445 |vauthors=Volkmar FR, Greenough WT | title = Rearing complexity affects branching of dendrites in the visual cortex of the rat | journal = Science | volume = 176 | issue = 4042 | pages = 1445–7 |date=June 1972 | pmid = 5033647 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5033647 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as can the length, in young animals, of distal branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0163-1047(92)90937-Y |vauthors=Wallace CS, Kilman VL, Withers GS, Greenough WT | title = Increases in dendritic length in occipital cortex after 4 days of differential housing in weanling rats | journal = Behav. Neural Biol. | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–8 |date=July 1992 | pmid = 1417672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activity and energy consumption ===
Synapses in animals in enriched environments show evidence of increased synapse activation.&lt;ref name="Sirevaag"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sirevaag AM, Greenough WT | title = Differential rearing effects on rat visual cortex synapses. III. Neuronal and glial nuclei, boutons, dendrites, and capillaries | journal = Brain Res. | volume = 424 | issue = 2 | pages = 320–32 |date=October 1987 | pmid = 3676831 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-8993(87)91477-6 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(87)91477-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synapses tend to also be much larger.&lt;ref name="sievaag85"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sirevaag AM, Greenough WT | title = Differential rearing effects on rat visual cortex synapses. II. Synaptic morphometry | journal = Brain Res. | volume = 351 | issue = 2 | pages = 215–26 |date=April 1985 | pmid = 3995348 | doi = 10.1016/0165-3806(85)90193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamma wave|Gamma oscillations]] become larger in amplitude in the hippocampus.&lt;ref name="Shinohara"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms2658 |vauthors=Shinohara Y, Hosoya A, Hirase H | title = Experience enhances gamma oscillations and interhemispheric asymmetry in the hippocampus | journal = Nat Commun | volume = 4 | pages = 1652 |date=April 2013 | pmid = 23552067 | url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n4/full/ncomms2658.html | issue=4 | pmc=3644069}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased energy consumption is reflected in glial and local capillary vasculation that provides synapses with extra energy.
* Glial cell numbers per neuron increase 12–14%&lt;ref name="DiamondKrech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DiamondLaw" /&gt;
* The direct apposition area of glial cells with synapses expands by 19%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones TA, Greenough WT | title = Ultrastructural evidence for increased contact between astrocytes and synapses in rats reared in a complex environment | journal = Neurobiol Learn Mem | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–56 |date=January 1996 | pmid = 8673406 | doi = 10.1006/nlme.1996.0005 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1074-7427(96)90005-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The volume of glial cell nuclei for each synapse is higher by 37.5%&lt;ref name="Sirevaag" /&gt;
* The mean volume of mitochondria per neuron is 20% greater&lt;ref name="Sirevaag" /&gt;
* The volume of glial cell nuclei for each neuron is 63% higher&lt;ref name="Sirevaag" /&gt;
* Capillary density is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borowsky IW, Collins RC | title = Metabolic anatomy of brain: a comparison of regional capillary density, glucose metabolism, and enzyme activities | journal = J. Comp. Neurol. | volume = 288 | issue = 3 | pages = 401–13 |date=October 1989 | pmid = 2551935 | doi = 10.1002/cne.902880304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Capillaries are wider (4.35 μm compared to 4.15 μm in controls)&lt;ref name="Sirevaag" /&gt;
* Shorter distance exist between any part of the [[neuropil]] and a capillary (27.6 μm compared to 34.6 μm)&lt;ref name="Sirevaag" /&gt;
These energy related changes to the [[neuropil]] are responsible for increasing the volume of the cerebral cortex (the increase in synapse numbers contributes in itself hardly any extra volume).

=== Motor learning stimulation ===
Part of the effect of environmental enrichment is providing opportunities to acquire [[motor skills]]. Research upon “acrobatic” skill learning in the rat shows that it leads to increased synapse numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.14.5568 |vauthors=Black JE, Isaacs KR, Anderson BJ, Alcantara AA, Greenough WT | title = Learning causes synaptogenesis, whereas motor activity causes angiogenesis, in cerebellar cortex of adult rats | journal = Proc.

U.S.A. | volume = 87 | issue = 14 | pages = 5568–72 |date=July 1990 | pmid = 1695380 | pmc = 54366 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kleim JA, Hogg TM, VandenBerg PM, Cooper NR, Bruneau R, Remple M | title = Cortical synaptogenesis and motor map reorganization occur during late, but not early, phase of motor skill learning | journal = J.

=== Maternal transmission ===
Environmental enrichment during [[pregnancy]] has effects upon the [[fetus]] such as accelerating its retinal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sale A, Cenni MC, Ciucci F, Putignano E, Chierzi S, Maffei L | title = Maternal Enrichment during Pregnancy Accelerates Retinal Development of the Fetus | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = e1160 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18000533 | pmc = 2063464 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001160 | url = http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001160 | editor1-last = Reh | editor1-first = Thomas }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurogenesis ==
Environmental enrichment can also lead to the [[neurogenesis|formation of neurons]] (at least in rats)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fan Y, Liu Z, Weinstein PR, Fike JR, Liu J | title = Environmental enrichment enhances neurogenesis and improves functional outcome after cranial irradiation | journal = Eur.

Neurosci. | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = 729–31 |date=June 2006 | pmid = 16648847 | doi = 10.1038/nn1696 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

Enriched environments affect the expression of [[genes]] in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus that determine neuronal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rampon C, Jiang CH, Dong H | title = Effects of environmental enrichment on gene expression in the brain | journal = Proc.

== Rehabilitation and resilience ==

Research in animals suggests that environmental enrichment aids in recovery from an array of neurological disorders and cognitive impairments. There are two mains areas of focus: neurological rehabilitation and [[cognitive reserve]], the brain's resistance to the effects of exposure to physical, natural, and social threats. Although most of these experiments used animal subjects, mainly rodents, researchers have pointed to the affected areas of animal brains to which human brains are most similar and used their findings as evidence to show that humans would have comparable reactions to enriched environments. The tests done on animals are thus meant to represent human simulations for the following list of conditions.

===Neurological rehabilitation===

====Autism====

A study conducted in 2011 led to the conclusion that environmental enrichment vastly improves the cognitive ability of children with [[autism]]. The study found that autistic children who receive olfactory and tactile stimulation along with exercises that stimulated other paried sensory modalities clinically improved by 42 percent while autistic children not receiving this treatment clinically improved by just 7 percent.&lt;ref name = Woo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woo CC, Leon M |title=Environmental Enrichment as an Effective Treatment for Autism: A Randomized Controlled Trial |journal=Behav Neurosci |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=487–97 |date=March 2011 |pmid=23688137 |doi=10.1037/a0033010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also showed that there was significant clinical improvement in autistic children exposed to enriched sensorimotor environments, and a vast majority of parents reported that their child's quality of life was much better with the treatment.&lt;ref name = Woo/&gt;  A second study confirmed its effectiveness.  The second study also found after 6 months of sensory enrichment therapy, 21% of the children who initially had been given an autism classification, using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, improved to the point that, although they remained on the autism spectrum, they no longer met the criteria for classic autism. None of the standard care controls reached an equivalent level of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Woo, Cynthia C. |author2=Donnelly, Joseph H. |author3=Steinberg-Epstein, Robin |author4=Leon, Michael | title=Environmental enrichment as a therapy for autism: A clinical trial replication and extension |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |pages= 412–422|date=Aug 2015 |pmid= 26052790|doi=10.1037/bne0000068 |volume=129 |issue=4 |pmc=4682896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy using the methodologies is titled Sensory Enrichment Therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20130605/sensory-focused-autism-therapy-shows-early-promise |title='Sensory-Focused' Autism Therapy Shows Early Promise |author=Mary Brophy Marcus |date=June 5, 2013 |website=webmd.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ksl.com/?sid=31896222&amp;nid=148&amp;title=autism-treatment-gives-utah-family-hope |title=Autism treatment gives Utah family hope |author=Nkoyo Iyamba |date=October 9, 2014 |website=ksl.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alzheimer's disease====

Through environmental enrichment, researchers were able to enhance and partially repair memory deficits in mice between ages of 2 to 7 months with characteristics of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Mice in enriched environments performed significantly better on object recognition tests and the [[Morris water navigation task|Morris Water Maze]] than they had when they were in standard environments. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment enhances visual and learning memory for those with Alzheimer's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Berardi N, Braschi C, Capsoni S, Cattaneo A, Maffei L |title=Environmental enrichment delays the onset of memory deficits and reduces neuropathological hallmarks in a mouse model of Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration |journal=J. Alzheimers Dis. |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=359–70 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17851186 |url=http://iospress.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=1387-2877&amp;volume=11&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=359 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been found that mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that were exposed to enriched environment before amyloid onset (at 3 months of age) and then returned to their home cage for over 7 months, showed preserved spatial memory and reduced amyloid deposition at 13 months old, when they are supposed to show dramatic memory deficits and amyloid plaque load. These findings reveal the preventive, and long-lasting effects of early life stimulating experience on Alzheimer-like pathology in mice and likely reflect the capacity of enriched environment to efficiently stimulate the [[cognitive reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verret L, Krezymon A, Halley H, Trouche S, Zerwas M, Lazouret M, Lassalle JM, Rampon C | title = Transient enriched housing before amyloidosis onset sustains cognitive improvement in Tg2576 mice | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 211–25 |date=Jan 2013 | pmid = 22727275 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012003004 | doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Huntington's disease====

Research has indicated that environmental enrichment can help relieve motor and psychiatric deficits caused by [[Huntington's disease]]. It also improves lost protein levels for those with the disease, and prevents striatal and hippocampal deficits in the BDNF, located in the hippocampus.&lt;ref name = Spires&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Spires TL, Grote HE, Varshney NK | title = Environmental enrichment rescues protein deficits in a mouse model of Huntington's disease, indicating a possible disease mechanism | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 24 | issue = 9 | pages = 2270–6 |date=March 2004 | pmid = 14999077 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1658-03.2004 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14999077 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have led researchers to suggest that environmental enrichment has a potential to be a possible form of therapy for those with Huntington's.&lt;ref name = Spires/&gt;

====Parkinson's disease====

Multiple studies have reported that environmental enrichment for adult mice helps relieve neuronal death, which is particularly beneficial to those with [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faherty CJ, Raviie Shepherd K, Herasimtschuk A, Smeyne RJ | title = Environmental enrichment in adulthood eliminates neuronal death in experimental Parkinsonism | journal = Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 170–9 |date=March 2005 | pmid = 15790541 | doi = 10.1016/j.molbrainres.2004.08.008 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169-328X(04)00403-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent study shows that environmental enrichment particularly affects the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], which is important for managing [[dopamine]] and acetylcholine levels, critical for motor deficits.&lt;ref name = Goldberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=NR|author2=Fields, V |author3=Pflibsen, L |author4=Salvatore, MF |author5= Meshul, CK |title=Social enrichment attenuates nigrostriatal lesioning and reverses motor impairment in a progressive 1-methyl-2-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of Parkinson's disease.|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|date=March 2012|volume=45|issue=3|pages=1051–67|pmid=22198503|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2011.12.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, it was found that environmental enrichment has beneficial effects for the social implications of Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name = Goldberg/&gt;

====Stroke====

Research done in animals has shown that subjects recovering in an enriched environment 15 days after having a [[stroke]] had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger infarct post-intervention than those who were not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and sensorimotor functions on animals post-stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Janssen H, Bernhardt J, Collier JM, Sena ES, McElduff P, Attia J, Pollack M, Howells DW, Nilsson M, Calford MB, Spratt NJ |title=An Enriched Environment Improves Sensorimotor Function Post-Ischemic Stroke|journal=Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair|date=12 September 2010|volume=24|issue=9|pages=802–813|doi=10.1177/1545968310372092|pmid=20834046}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study also found that environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities are much more likely to be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead of being alone or sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Heidi|author2=Ada, Louise |author3=Bernhardt, Julie |author4=McElduff, Patrick |author5=Pollack, Michael |author6=Nilsson, Michael |author7= Spratt, Neil J. |title=An enriched environment increases activity in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation in a mixed rehabilitation unit: a pilot non-randomized controlled trial|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|date=29 April 2013|pages=1–8|doi=10.3109/09638288.2013.788218|pmid=23627534 |volume=36 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rett syndrome====

A 2008 study found that environmental enrichment was significant in aiding recovery of motor coordination and some recovery of BDNF levels in female mice with conditions similar to those of [[Rett syndrome]]. Over the course of 30 weeks female mice in enriched environments showed superior ability in motor coordination to those in standard conditions.&lt;ref name = Kondo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kondo M, Gray LJ, Pelka GJ, Christodoulou J, Tam PP, Hannan AJ | title = Environmental enrichment ameliorates a motor coordination deficit in a mouse model of Rett syndrome--Mecp2 gene dosage effects and BDNF expression | journal = Eur. J. Neurosci. | volume = 27 | issue = 12 | pages = 3342–50 |date=June 2008 | pmid = 18557922 | doi = 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were unable to have full motor capability, they were able to prevent a more severe motor deficit by living in an enriched environment. These results combined with increased levels of BDNF in the cerebellum led researchers to conclude that an enriched environment that stimulates areas of the motor cortex and areas of the cerebellum having to do with motor learning is beneficial in aiding mice with Rett syndrome.&lt;ref name = Kondo/&gt;

====Amblyopia====

A recent study found that adult rats with [[amblyopia]] improved visual acuity two weeks after being placed into an enriched environment.&lt;ref name = Sale&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sale A, Maya Vetencourt JF, Medini P | title = Environmental enrichment in adulthood promotes amblyopia recovery through a reduction of intracortical inhibition | journal = Nat. Neurosci. | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 679–81 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17468749 | doi = 10.1038/nn1899 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study showed that another two weeks after ending environmental enrichment, the rats retained their visual acuity improvement. Conversely, rats in a standard environment showed no improvement in visual acuity. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment reduces GABA inhibition and increases BDNF expression in the visual cortex. As a result, the growth and development of neurons and synapses in the visual cortex were much improved due to the enriched environment.&lt;ref name = Sale/&gt;

====Sensory deprivation====

Studies have shown that with the help of environmental enrichment the effects of [[sensory deprivation]] can be corrected. For example, a visual impairment known as "dark-rearing" in the visual cortex can be prevented and rehabilitated. In general, an enriched environment will  improve, if not repair, the sensory systems animals possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7580.2009.01103.x |vauthors=Argandoña EG, Bengoetxea H, Lafuente JV | title = Physical exercise is required for environmental enrichment to offset the quantitative effects of dark-rearing on the S-100β astrocytic density in the rat visual cortex | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 215 | issue = 2 | pages = 132–140 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19500177 | pmc = 2740960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lead poisoning====

During development, [[gestation]] is one of the most critical periods for exposure to any lead. Exposure to high levels of lead at this time can lead to inferior spatial learning performance. Studies have shown that environmental enrichment can overturn damage to the hippocampus induced by [[lead poisoning|lead exposure]].&lt;ref name = Cao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cao|first=Xiujing|author2=Huang, Shenghai |author3=Ruan, Diyun |title=Enriched environment restores impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and water maze performance induced by developmental lead exposure in rats|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|date=April 2008|volume=50|issue=3|pages=307–313|doi=10.1002/dev.20287|pmid=18335502}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Learning and spatial memory that are dependent on the long-term potentiation of the hippocampus are vastly improve as subjects in an enriched environments had lower levels of lead concentration in their hippocampi. The findings also showed that enriched environments result in some natural protection of lead-induced brain deficits.&lt;ref name = Cao/&gt;

====Chronic spinal cord injuries====

Research has indicated that animals suffering from [[spinal cord injuries]] showed significant improvement in motor capabilities even with a long delay in treatment after the injury when exposed to environmental enrichment.&lt;ref name = Fischer&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fischer FR, Peduzzi JD | title = Functional Recovery in Rats With Chronic Spinal Cord Injuries After Exposure to an Enriched Environment | journal = J Spinal Cord Med | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–55 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17591227 | pmc = 2031947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social interactions, exercise, and novelty all play major roles in aiding the recovery of an injured subject. This has led to some suggestions that the spinal cord has a continued plasticity and all efforts must be made for enriched environments to stimulate this plasticity in order to aid recovery.&lt;ref name = Fischer/&gt;

====Maternal deprivation stress====

[[Maternal deprivation]] can be caused by the abandonment by a nurturing parent at a young age. In rodents or nonhuman primates, this leads to a higher vulnerability for
stress-related illness.&lt;ref name = Francis&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Francis DD, Diorio J, Plotsky PM, Meaney MJ | title = Environmental enrichment reverses the effects of maternal separation on stress reactivity | journal = J. Neurosci. | volume = 22 | issue = 18 | pages = 7840–3 |date=September 2002 | pmid = 12223535 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12223535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that environmental enrichment can reverse the effects of maternal separation on stress reactivity, possibly by affecting the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = Francis/&gt;

====Child neglect====

In all children, maternal care is one of the significant influences for hippocampal development, providing the foundation for stable and individualized learning and memory. However, this is not the case for those who have experienced [[child neglect]]. Researchers determined that through environmental enrichment, a neglected child can partially receive the same hippocampal development and stability, albeit not at the same level as that of the presence of a parent or guardian.&lt;ref name = Bredy&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0306-4522(02)00918-1 |vauthors=Bredy TW, Humpartzoomian RA, Cain DP, Meaney MJ | title = Partial reversal of the effect of maternal care on cognitive function through environmental enrichment | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 571–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12699791 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306452202009181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were comparable to those of child intervention programs, rendering environmental enrichment a useful method for dealing with child neglect.&lt;ref name = Bredy/&gt;{{failed verification|I do not have access to full article, but it describes a study with rats, in which the effects of being raised by mothers with low licking/grooming behavior were reversed through environmental enrichment at the behavioral level but not at the physiological level.|date=January 2014}}

=== Cognitive reserve ===

====Aging====

Decreased hippocampal neurogenesis is a characteristic of [[aging]]. Environmental enrichment increases neurogenesis in aged rodents by potentiating neuronal differentiation and new cell survival.&lt;ref name = Kumar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Speisman|first=RB|author2=Kumar, A |author3=Rani, A |author4=Pastoriza, JM |author5=Severance, JE |author6=Foster, TC |author7= Ormerod, BK |title=Environmental enrichment restores neurogenesis and rapid acquisition in aged rats.|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|date=January 2013|volume=34|issue=1|pages=263–74|pmid=22795793|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.05.023 |pmc=3480541}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, subjects exposed to environmental enrichment aged better due to superior ability in retaining their levels of spatial and learning memory.&lt;ref name = Kumar/&gt;

====Prenatal and perinatal cocaine exposure====

Research has shown that mice exposed to environmental enrichment are less affected by the consequences of [[Cocaine#Effects in pregnancy and nursing|cocaine exposure]] in comparison with those in standard environments. Although the levels of dopamine in the brains of both sets of mice were relatively similar, when both subjects were exposed to the cocaine injection, mice in enriched environment were significantly less responsive than those in standard environments.&lt;ref name = Solinas&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Solinas M, Thiriet N, El Rawas R, Lardeux V, Jaber M | title = Environmental enrichment during early stages of life reduces the behavioral, neurochemical, and molecular effects of cocaine | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 1102–11 |date=April 2009 | pmid = 18463628 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2008.51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thus concluded that both the activating and rewarding effects are suppressed by environmental enrichment and early exposure to environmental enrichment can help prevent [[drug addiction]].&lt;ref name = Solinas/&gt;

== Humans ==

Though environmental enrichment research has been mostly done upon rodents, similar effects occur in primates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kozorovitskiy Y, Gross CG, Kopil C | title = Experience induces structural and biochemical changes in the adult primate brain | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 102 | issue = 48 | pages = 17478–82 |date=November 2005 | pmid = 16299105 | pmc = 1297690 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0508817102 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16299105 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are likely to affect the human brain. However, direct research upon human synapses and their numbers is limited since this requires [[histological]] study of the brain. A link, however, has been found between educational level and greater dendritic branch complexity following autopsy removal of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobs B, Schall M, Scheibel AB | title = A quantitative dendritic analysis of Wernicke's area in humans.

=== Localized cerebral cortex changes ===
MRI detects localized [[cerebral cortex]] expansion after people learn complex tasks such as mirror reading (in this case in the right [[occipital cortex]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ilg R, Wohlschläger AM, Gaser C | title = Gray matter increase induced by practice correlates with task-specific activation: a combined functional and morphometric magnetic resonance imaging study | journal = J.

=== Institutional deprivation ===
Children that receive impoverished stimulation due to being confined to cots without social interaction or reliable caretakers in low quality [[orphanages]] show severe delays in cognitive and social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1994.tb01220.x |vauthors=Kaler SR, Freeman BJ | title = Analysis of environmental deprivation: cognitive and social development in Romanian orphans | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 769–81 |date=May 1994 | pmid = 7518826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 12% of them if adopted after 6 months of age show autistic or mildly autistic traits later at four years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rutter M, Andersen-Wood L, Beckett C | title = Quasi-autistic patterns following severe early global privation.

Such children show marked differences in their brains, consistent with research upon experiment animals, compared to children from normally stimulating environments. They have reduced brain activity in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex|orbital prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]], [[temporal cortex]], and [[brain stem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chugani HT, Behen ME, Muzik O, Juhász C, Nagy F, Chugani DC | title = Local brain functional activity following early deprivation: a study of postinstitutionalized Romanian orphans | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 1290–301 |date=December 2001 | pmid = 11707085 | doi = 10.1006/nimg.2001.0917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also showed less developed [[white matter]] connections between different areas in their cerebral cortices, particularly the [[uncinate fasciculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eluvathingal TJ, Chugani HT, Behen ME | title = Abnormal brain connectivity in children after early severe socioemotional deprivation: a diffusion tensor imaging study | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 2093–100 |date=June 2006 | pmid = 16740852 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2005-1727 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, enriching the experience of [[Premature birth|preterm infants]] with [[massage]] quickens the maturating of their [[EEG|electroencephalographic]] activity and their [[visual acuity]]. Moreover, as with enrichment in experimental animals, this associates with an increase in [[IGF-1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guzzetta A, Baldini S, Bancale A | title = Massage accelerates brain development and the maturation of visual function | journal = J.

=== Cognitive reserve and resilience ===
Another source of evidence for the effect of environment stimulation upon the human brain is [[cognitive reserve]] (a measure of the brain’s resilience to cognitive impairment) and the level of a person’s education. Not only is higher education linked to a more cognitively demanding educational experience, but it also correlates with a person’s general engagement in cognitively demanding activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1076/jcen.25.5.634.14572 |vauthors=Wilson R, Barnes L, Bennett D | title = Assessment of lifetime participation in cognitively stimulating activities | journal = J Clin Exp Neuropsychol | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 634–42 |date=August 2003 | pmid = 12815501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more education a person has received, the less the effects of aging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corral M, Rodríguez M, Amenedo E, Sánchez JL, Díaz F | title = Cognitive reserve, age, and neuropsychological performance in healthy participants | journal = Dev Neuropsychol | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–91 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16671863 | doi = 10.1207/s15326942dn2903_6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fritsch T, McClendon MJ, Smyth KA, Lerner AJ, Friedland RP, Larsen JD | title = Cognitive functioning in healthy aging: the role of reserve and lifestyle factors early in life | journal = Gerontologist | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–22 |date=June 2007 | pmid = 17565095 | doi = 10.1093/geront/47.3.307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; dementia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall CB, Derby C, LeValley A, Katz MJ, Verghese J, Lipton RB | title = Education delays accelerated decline on a memory test in persons who develop dementia | journal = Neurology | volume = 69 | issue = 17 | pages = 1657–64 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17954781 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000278163.82636.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; white matter hyperintensities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nebes RD, Meltzer CC, Whyte EM | title = The relation of white matter hyperintensities to cognitive performance in the normal old: education matters | journal = Neuropsychol Dev Cogn B Aging Neuropsychol Cogn | volume = 13 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 326–40 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16887777 | doi = 10.1080/138255890969294 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRI-defined brain infarcts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elkins JS, Longstreth WT, Manolio TA, Newman AB, Bhadelia RA, Johnston SC | title = Education and the cognitive decline associated with MRI-defined brain infarct | journal = Neurology | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 435–40 |date=August 2006 | pmid = 16894104 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000228246.89109.98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koepsell TD, Kurland BF, Harel O, Johnson EA, Zhou XH, Kukull WA | title = Education, cognitive function, and severity of neuropathology in Alzheimer disease | journal = Neurology | volume = 70 | issue = 19 Pt 2 | pages = 1732–9 |date=May 2008 | pmid = 18160675 | doi = 10.1212/01.wnl.0000284603.85621.aa }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roe CM, Mintun MA, D'Angelo G, Xiong C, Grant EA, Morris JC | title = Alzheimer's and Cognitive Reserve: Education Effect Varies with 11CPIB Uptake | journal = Arch.

Within the field of [[anthropology]] and other [[social science]]s, [[ethnography]] is a form of research that relies on a range of sources of data, but usually tends to rely mainly on [[participant observation]]. However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a ''genre of writing, one'' used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Works and Lives: The anthropologist as author|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=Stanford CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand. A work written using ethnographic realism may be referred to as a '''realist ethnography''', and classified as a subgenre of ethnography.

==Styles of ethnographic realism==
George Marcus and Dick Cushman described and categorized realist ethnographies under certain characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcus|first1=George|last2=Cushman|first2=Dick|title=Ethnographies as Texts|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=Jan 1, 1982|volume=11|pages=25–69|jstor=2155775|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.11.100182.000325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex''''', known in Japan as {{Nihongo|'''''Mobile Armored Riot Police: Stand Alone Complex'''''|攻殻機動隊 {{ruby-ja|Stand Alone Complex|スタンド・アローン・コンプレックス}},|Kōkaku Kidōtai Sutando Arōn Conpurekkusu}}, is a Japanese [[anime]] [[television series]] produced by [[Production I.G]] and based on [[Masamune Shirow]]'s [[manga]] ''[[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|Ghost in the Shell]]''. It was written and directed by [[Kenji Kamiyama]], with original character design by Hajime Shimomura and a soundtrack by [[Yoko Kanno]]. The first season aired from October 2002 to October 2003 and was positively received by critics. A second season titled '''''Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Mobile Armored Riot Police: S.A.C. 2nd GIG'''''|攻殻機動隊 {{ruby-ja|S.A.C. 2nd GIG|エス・エー・シー セカンド ギグ}},|Kōkaku Kidōtai Esu Ē Shī Sekando Gigu}}, aired from January 2004 to January 2005.

The series centers on the members of an elite law enforcement unit known as [[Public Security Section 9]] as they investigate cybercrime and terrorism cases; these cases often are connected to their pursuit of an elite "Super Class A" hacker and corporate terrorist known as "The Laughing Man". A series of associated short comic animations, titled ''[[Tachikomatic Days]]'', aired after each episode. These shorts star the [[Tachikoma]] "think-tanks" from the main series, and they typically relate directly to the story of the preceding ''Stand Alone Complex'' episode.

The first season was adapted into a feature-length [[OVA]] titled ''The Laughing Man'', which was released in 2005. The series had also received video game spin-offs for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], and [[mobile phone]]s. ''2nd GIG'' was also later adapted into a feature-length OVA entitled ''Individual Eleven'', which was released in 2006.&lt;ref name="intothenetwork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/39_/s08_/index.html |title=Into the Network: The Ghost in the Shell Universe |work=Production I.G. |accessdate=29 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w6v3lCn2?url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/39_/s08_/index.html |archivedate=30 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society|Solid State Society]]'', a TV-film sequel to the ''Stand Alone Complex'' series, was also released in that year.&lt;ref name="ProductionIG.SolidStateSociety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/47_/index.html |title=Production I.G. - Ghost in the Shell Solid State Society |work=Production I.G. |accessdate=29 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w6ucvbNQ?url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/47_/index.html |archivedate=30 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|World of Ghost in the Shell|List of Ghost in the Shell characters}}
[[File:Section 9 operators in 2nd GIG.jpg|left|thumb|The members of Section 9. From bottom left to top right: Paz, Borma, Saito, Batou, Motoko, Togusa, Aramaki, and Ishikawa]]
The series takes place in the year 2030, where many people have become [[cyborgs]] with [[prosthetic]] bodies. Primarily set in the fictional Japanese city of {{nihongo|Niihama, Niihama Prefecture|新浜県新浜市|Niihama-ken Niihama-shi|}}, the series follows the members of [[Public Security Section 9]], a special-operations task-force made up of former military officers and police detectives. While the group investigates various crimes, both seasons feature ongoing investigations into two incidents that embroil the group in corruption within other branches of the Japanese government.

===Season 1===
The first season of ''Stand Alone Complex'' focuses on the [[Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)|Laughing Man]] incident, wherein a [[Hacktivism|hacktivist]] ultimately reveals to the Major that he had discovered that several [[micromachine]] manufacturing corporations, in association with the Japanese government, suppressed information on an inexpensive cure to a debilitating cyberization disease [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|in order to profit]] from the more expensive micromachine treatment. He abducted one of the owners of the company and attempted to force him to reveal the truth on live television, resulting in the hacker live-hacking everyone's vision and cameras at the event to cover his face with the stylized laughing face logo that became synonymous with his image. His popularity spawned several genuine imitators, resulting in the series' titular Stand Alone Complex. When Section 9 discovers that these companies and several Japanese politicians later used the Laughing Man's image to garner public support and profit, they begin a campaign to disseminate the truth, ultimately leading to the Cabinet labeling them as domestic terrorists and forcibly disbanding them, resulting in the capture of several members and the apparent death of Motoko Kusanagi. However, it is all a ruse to deceive the government, and the very alive and well members of Section 9 regroup to bring the micromachine corporations and corrupt politicians to justice, resulting in the dissolution of the current Japanese government.&lt;ref name="intothenetwork" /&gt;

===Season 2===
The second season, ''2nd GIG'', set two years after the events of the first season, explores the political and social ramifications of the two world wars that took place prior to the events of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/02_/s08_/index.html#c |title= Interview: Kenji Kamiyama |work=Production I.G.|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Third and the Fourth World Wars, about three million Asians became refugees and were invited into Japan as a source of cheap labor. These "invited refugees", based on the reclaimed island of [[Dejima]], soon became unemployed in the post-war period, and their social unrest borders on outright war.&lt;ref name="2ndOVA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/39_/index.html|title= Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Individual Eleven|publisher=Production I.G|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 9's involvement in the refugee issue begins after they successfully stop a hostage crisis caused by a terrorist group known as the Individual Eleven, after which newly elected Prime Minister Yoko Kayabuki officially reinstates the organization. The group seems to be modeling themselves after the [[May 15 Incident]], where a group of naval officers assassinated the Prime Minister and then gained the support of the public, and hope to stir up the refugees' spirits by fighting for them against the Japanese government. The group also comes into contact with [[Kazundo Goda]], head of the [[Cabinet Intelligence Agency|Cabinet Intelligence Service]], who gets assistance from the group in defusing several instances between the refugees as well as assisting him in transporting [[plutonium]] through Dejima, result in several failures and refugee deaths, further straining relations. Section 9 ultimately discovers that Goda has been manipulating both events behind the scenes, leaking the social virus that creates the Individual Eleven ideology and creating a new Stand Alone Complex, as well as the intentional failures with the refugees. However, he cannot account for the charismatic [[Hideo Kuze]] who genuinely believes in the best for the refugees and helps rally for their independence from Japan. Throughout the investigation, Kusanagi discovers she may know Kuze from her childhood. Ultimately, Goda is found guilty of his part in the refugee incidents and killed before he can defect to the American Empire, but not before his ministrations also result in the death of Kuze.

In the film ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society]]'', taking place two years following the resolution of the Individual Eleven incident, the Major has left Section 9, and Togusa is now field commander, leading an investigation into several deaths of refugees from the Siak Republic, which results in the discovery of a government computer system coordinating the kidnappings of 20 thousand abused children who have had their cyberbrains replaced and placing them under the care of several senior citizens made comatose by another government program that takes care of all of their bodily needs. Their investigation, which brings the Major out of hiding, reveals an entity known as the Puppeteer behind the kidnappings, but the Puppeteer is a [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] formed by the collective will of the senior citizens, and it was only the Siak Republic's intent to use the kidnapped children in their plans that led to their downfall. However, the investigation further reveals that a member of the House of Representatives is also using the children for his nationalistic purposes, and Section 9 with the Major infiltrates a welfare center where the MP brainwashes the children, resulting in the Puppeteer revealing his own identity that the senior citizens wished to give the children free will in their future, with the politician interfering in that new plan.

Masamune Shirow, author of the original ''Ghost in the Shell'' manga, provided plot for several episodes, sketches of characters and mechanical designs (including the [[Tachikoma]]), and gave his approval to the scripts before production.&lt;ref name="ANN-Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2002-10-03 |title= Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Interview |accessdate=4 November 2011|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was produced with an 800 million yen investment. Kenji Kamiyama decided to make the anime television series as a "relative" to the manga and film, serving as a separate parallel world from both.&lt;ref name="intothenetwork" /&gt;

For the second season, [[Mamoru Oshii]] had contributed with his ideas to the concept of the entire series and initial planning stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/02_/index.html |title= Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd Gig |publisher=Production I.G|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shuko Murase]] stated that they were initially going to concentrate on how Japan was going to participate in war after [[9/11]] as intended to portray a fictional future. But by the time they were working on the episodes, the [[Iraq War]] had already started and Japan's Self-Defense Force was sent to Iraq. During this time Japan also had an election. Murase continued to state that he created the "Individual Eleven" episodes to express irresponsibility of the Japanese people when they voted for the politicians that planned to send Japanese troops to Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Mechademia4-interview"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scally|first=Deborah|author2=Drummond-Mathews, Angela |author3=Hairston, Marc.  |title= Mechademia 4: War/Time |chapter=Interview with Murase Shūkō and Satō Dai|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |pages=330–333 |isbn=978-0-8166-6749-9 |date=3 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'' received mostly positive from reviewers, who praised the series' high quality of animation and the musical score by [[Yoko Kanno]].&lt;ref name="ManiaChris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/ghost-shell-stand-alone-complex-vol-1_article_76211.html|title=Review of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Vol. #1|last=Beveridge|first=Chris|date=19 June 2004|work=Mania.com (formerly AnimeOnDVD)|accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THEM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=611|title=Review of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|last=Tucker|first=Derrick|work=T.H.E.M.

While parts of the technology seem unlikely in the time-frame allotted, none seems impossible."&lt;ref name="Locus" /&gt; In addition, several reviews mentioned what they perceived to be overarching themes explored in the series as a result of the setting; specifically, the meaning of humanity in a world where the lines between man and machine were becoming increasingly blurred,&lt;ref name="ANNR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Locus" /&gt; as well as various societal issues that might emerge as a result of advances in technology.&lt;ref name="ManiaChris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Locus" /&gt;

Reviewers agreed that the main "Laughing Man" storyline was satisfying, characterizing it variously as "interesting",&lt;ref name="Locus" /&gt; "complex",&lt;ref name="ManiaDani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/ghost-shell-stand-alone-complex-vol-2_article_77030.html|title=Review of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Vol. #2|last=Moure|first=Dani|date=21 February 2005|work=Mania.com (formerly AnimeOnDVD)|accessdate=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "engaging".&lt;ref name="THEM" /&gt; Reaction to the series' "Stand Alone" episodes, however, was mixed: some reviewers considered these episodes to be boring and, in some cases, the worst episodes of the series,&lt;ref name="THEM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Locus" /&gt; while others contended that they allowed further development of the characters and the futuristic setting.&lt;ref name="ManiaChris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ManiaDani" /&gt;

Certain commentators specifically focused on the series' success or failure in achieving the high standards set by the critically acclaimed 1995 film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]''. Opinion in this regard was divided: although these reviewers took an overall favorable view,&lt;ref name="ManiaChris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="THEM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDverdict" /&gt; some reviews criticized the quality of animation,&lt;ref name="THEM" /&gt; while others felt that the series' story lacked the depth of the original film.&lt;ref name="DVDverdict" /&gt; This "lack of depth", however, was attributed to the fact that ''Stand Alone Complex'' is an action-oriented series with a limited episode length in which to explore deeper themes.&lt;ref name="DVDverdict" /&gt;

Bolstering the generally positive reviews of the series, ''Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'' won an Excellence Prize (Animation Division) at the 2002 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]],&lt;ref name="JMediaArtsFest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/english/festival/2002/animation/000398/ |title=Excellence Prize, Animation Division: ''Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'' |publisher=[[Japan Media Arts Festival]] |year=2002 |accessdate=2 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sS9QFvvi?url=http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/english/festival/2002/animation/000398/ |archivedate=2 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Tokyo Anime Award|Notable Entry Award]] at the 2003 [[Tokyo International Anime Fair]],&lt;ref name="IntAnimeFair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyoanime.jp/tafweb/taf2003/e/compe/jyushou_list.html|title=Award-winning List|work=Tokyo International Anime Fair|accessdate=12 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220211810/http://www.tokyoanime.jp/tafweb/taf2003/e/compe/jyushou_list.html|archivedate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured in June 2004 by [[Newtype USA]], with a "double scoop" cover story.&lt;ref name="Madman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?releaseId=4117&amp;method=view |title=Newtype USA Vol. 3, #6 (June 2004) |work=Madman Entertainment |accessdate=9 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904021204/http://www.madman.com.au/actions/catalogue.do?releaseId=4117&amp;method=view |archivedate=4 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japan Media Arts Festival provided a brief summary of ''Stand Alone Complex'', calling it a "completely original television series...entertaining and easy to understand".&lt;ref name="JMediaArtsFest" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5473">In mathematics, '''Humbert series''' are a set of seven [[hypergeometric series]] Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Φ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ξ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Ξ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of two [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s that generalize [[confluent hypergeometric function|Kummer's confluent hypergeometric series]] &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of one variable  and the [[confluent hypergeometric limit function]] &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of one variable. The first of these double series was introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Pierre Humbert (mathematician)|first=Pierre|last= Humbert|year=1920}}.

==Definitions==
The Humbert series Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is defined for |''x''| &lt; 1 by the double series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_1(a,b,c;x,y) = F_1(a,b,-,c;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_{m+n} (b)_m} {(c)_{m+n} \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Pochhammer symbol]] (''q'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the rising factorial:

:&lt;math&gt;(q)_n = q\,(q+1) \cdots (q+n-1) = \frac{\Gamma(q+n)}{\Gamma(q)}~,&lt;/math&gt;

where the second equality is true for all complex &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; except &lt;math&gt;q=0,-1,-2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;.
 
For other values of ''x'' the function Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined by [[analytic continuation]].

The Humbert series Φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can also be written as a one-dimensional [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]-type [[integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_1(a,b,c;x,y) = \frac{\Gamma(c)} {\Gamma(a) \Gamma(c-a)} 
\int_0^1 t^{a-1} (1-t)^{c-a-1} (1-xt)^{-b} e^{yt} \,\mathrm{d}t, 
\quad \real \,c &gt; \real \,a &gt; 0 ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

This representation can be verified by means of [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] of the integrand, followed by termwise integration.

Similarly, the function Φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is defined for all ''x'', ''y'' by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_2(b_1,b_2,c;x,y) = F_1(-,b_1,b_2,c;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(b_1)_m (b_2)_n} {(c)_{m+n} \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
 
the function Φ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'' by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi_3(b,c;x,y) = \Phi_2(b,-,c;x,y) = F_1(-,b,-,c;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(b)_m} {(c)_{m+n} \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

the function Ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for |''x''| &lt; 1 by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_1(a,b,c_1,c_2;x,y) = F_2(a,b,-,c_1,c_2;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_{m+n} (b)_m} {(c_1)_m (c_2)_n \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

the function Ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''x'', ''y'' by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_2(a,c_1,c_2;x,y) = \Psi_1(a,-,c_1,c_2;x,y) = F_2(a,-,-,c_1,c_2;x,y) = F_4(a,-,c_1,c_2;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_{m+n}} {(c_1)_m (c_2)_n \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

the function Ξ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for |''x''| &lt; 1 by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Xi_1(a_1,a_2,b,c;x,y) = F_3(a_1,a_2,b,-,c;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a_1)_m (a_2)_n (b)_m} {(c)_{m+n} \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

and the function Ξ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for |''x''| &lt; 1 by the series:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Xi_2(a,b,c;x,y) = \Xi_1(a,-,b,c;x,y) = F_3(a,-,b,-,c;x,y) = \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{(a)_m (b)_m} {(c)_{m+n} \,m! \,n!} \,x^m y^n ~.
&lt;/math&gt;

:There are four related series of two variables, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which generalize [[hypergeometric function|Gauss's hypergeometric series]] &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of one variable in a similar manner and which were introduced by [[Paul Émile Appell]] in 1880.

'''''I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution''''' (usually shortened to '''''I Want My MTV''''') is a  2011 book about the rise of American cable television channel [[MTV]], its heyday, and its transformation from a strictly music video channel&lt;!-- to a ??? --&gt;. The book relies almost entirely on interviews and anecdotes from the cable channel’s founders and the artists whose videos appeared on the channel. Over 400 artists, directors, and staff of MTV were interviewed by the authors, music journalists [[Craig Marks]] and [[Rob Tannenbaum]]. The book's name is derived from a marketing campaign launched by the channel in 1981 that featured many of the artists appearing on the channel at the time exclaiming “I Want My MTV!”  The primary purpose of the campaign was to encourage cable subscribers to request the channel on their cable TV lineup. The book is published by [[Dutton Penguin]] in the United States.

==The authors==

[[Craig Marks]] has been the editor of three influential publications: ''Spin'', ''Blender'', and ''Billboard''. In addition, he has written for ''Rolling Stone'', ''GQ'', and the ''New York Times''. He is the co-founder of the pop music site ''Popdust''.

[[Rob Tannenbaum]] has written for ''GQ'', ''New York'', the ''New York Times Magazine'', ''Details'', ''Rolling Stone'', ''Spin'', the ''Village Voice'', the ''New York Observer'', ''Harper’s Bazaar'', ''George'', ''Premiere'', and ''Playboy''. He was the music editor of ''Blender''.

==Summary==

"Remember when MTV was just about music videos?" ''I Want My MTV'' chronicles the rise of MTV from its early inception at the beginning of cable television's advance into the suburbs and beyond. As an oral history, the authors interview over 400 artists, music industry, video disc-jockeys or VJs. The book follows the evolution of MTV from the first new wave videos imported from Britain, to the introduction of black artists, including [[Michael Jackson]], and the rise of hair metal bands. The book concludes its history in 1992 when MTV first revealed the groundbreaking reality show ''[[The Real World]]'', grunge music made its debut, and MTV broke away from its all-video format.

The book covers the hiring of the first VJ's based on [[Robert Pittman (media executive)|Bob Pittman]]'s analysis that the video channel needed human beings. The first five VJs were selected to match certain demographics.

The launch of MTV occurred on August 1, 1981 with the classic MTV promo of the [[Apollo 11]] mission footage. The first video was the [[Buggles]] ''Video Killed the Radio Star''. While only a handful of videos were available, and often played several times a day, it was not long before record executives understood the value of producing a video. This created a one-two effect, according to [[Tom Freston]], where exposure on MTV could lead to more radio airplay and consequently record sales. The ability of MTV to influence record sales, combined with the "I Want My MTV" campaign, led to most cable operators picking up the independent network.

Several interviews reveal the artistic side of music video production, the reluctance of some artists to enter the fray, and the artists that ultimately capitalized on the exposure MTV gave them. One example is [[Men at Work]], a band that the record executives had few expectations.  Their videos ultimately placed their album at number one for 16 weeks. Ultimately, the inability to have a video played on MTV could make or break an artist.

The book also chronicles the introduction of metal bands to MTV, the criticism that no African-American artists were featured, and how [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]" turned the video music world on its head.
The book concludes with an exploration of the end of programming focused on videos and the introduction of non-music programming, most notably ''[[The Real World]].''

'''''Inside the Neolithic Mind: Consciousness, Cosmos and the Realm of the Gods''''' is a [[cognitive archaeology|cognitive archaeological]] study of [[Neolithic]] religious beliefs in Europe co-written by the archaeologists [[David Lewis-Williams]] and David Pearce, both of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. It was first published by [[Thames and Hudson]] in 2005. Following on from Lewis-Williams' earlier work, ''[[The Mind in the Cave]]'' (2002), the book discusses the role of human cognition in the development of religion and Neolithic art.

The premise of ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'' is that irrespective of cultural differences, all humans share in the ability to enter into [[altered states of consciousness]], in which they experience [[entoptic phenomenon]], which the authors discern as a three-stage process leading to visionary experiences. Arguing that such altered experiences have provided the background to religious beliefs and some artistic creativity throughout human history, they focus their attention on the Neolithic, or "New Stone Age" period, when across Europe, communities abandoned their nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles and settled to become sedentary agriculturalists.

Adopting case studies from the opposite ends of Neolithic Europe, Lewis-Williams and Pearce discuss the archaeological evidence from both the Near East &amp;ndash; including such sites as [[Nevalı Çori]], [[Göbekli Tepe]] and [[Çatalhöyük]] &amp;ndash; and Atlantic Europe, including the sites of [[Newgrange]], [[Knowth]] and [[Bryn Celli Ddu]]. The authors argue that these monuments illustrate the influence of altered states of consciousness in constructing cosmological views of a tiered universe, in doing so drawing ethnographic parallels with [[shamanism|shamanistic]] cultures in Siberia and Amazonia.

Academic reviews published in such peer-reviewed journals as ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' were mixed. Critics argued that the use of evidence was selective, and that there was insufficient evidence for the authors' three-stage model of entopic phenomenon. Others praised the accessible and engaging writing style.

==Synopsis==
In their preface, Lewis-Williams and Pearce explain their approach, and their reasons for comparing megalithic art and archaeology from the Near East and Atlantic Europe. They express their opinion that such comparisons are made possible &amp;ndash; despite the cultural and geographical differences &amp;ndash; because of the "universal functioning of the human brain" which unites all ''Homo sapiens'' and leads different societies to develop similar religious and cosmological beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 6&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:GobeklitepeHeykel.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Monolith]] with animals in high and low [[relief]] from Göbekli Tepe.]]

Chapter one, "The Revolutionary Neolithic", explores the background to [[Neolithic|this period of time]], in which humans became increasingly sedentary and developed agriculture. Discussing the various different understandings of the Neolithic advocated within archaeology, they propose that it should be seen as a "revolutionary" period than as "a revolution" in itself, in this way challenging the view made famous by [[V. Gordon Childe]]. Moving on to an exploration of why humans adopted agriculture, they proclaim their adherence to [[Jacques Cauvin]]'s concept of the Symbolic Revolution. From there, they discuss the role of religion, suggesting that it should be understood as a tripartite system uniting experience, practice and belief. This leads on to a discussion of some of the earliest archaeological evidence for the Neolithic, at [[Nevalı Çori]] and [[Göbekli Tepe]], both in Southeastern Turkey, referring to the theory that the ritual beliefs practiced here resulted in the development of agriculture. Lewis-Williams and Pearce round off the chapter by quoting [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem "[[Kubla Khan, or A Vision in a Dream. A Fragment|Kubla Khan]]", written after an experience in an [[altered state of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 13&amp;ndash;36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second chapter, "The Consciousness Contract", the authors explore such altered states of consciousness, beginning with a discussion of the life and work of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Listing the symptoms of such altered states, they put forward their three-stage model for how the human brain experiences these states, and then interprets them as recognisable images.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 37&amp;ndash;59.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter three, "Seeing and Building a Cosmos", proceeds to discuss early humanity's conceptions of [[cosmology]], which the authors argue was probably divided into several tiered realms through which shamans were believed to traverse while in an altered state of consciousness. They follow this with a discussion of the shamanic symbolism of the eye, drawing comparisons with the eyes in the clay statues from 'Ain Ghazal and the [[Plastered human skulls|plastered skulls]] from other Near Eastern sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 60&amp;ndash;87.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter four, "Close Encounters with a Built Cosmos", examines two Neolithic settlements in the Near East &amp;ndash; 'Ain Ghazal and [[Çatalhöyük]] &amp;ndash; and argues that their layout and design may have reflected shamanistic conceptions of cosmology. In doing so, the authors draw parallels with the ethnographically-recorded [[Barasana]] people of Amazonia, whose ''maloca'' buildings were understood as cosmological microcosms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 88&amp;ndash;122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fifth chapter, "Domesticating Wild Nature", the authors seek to explore how the people of the Neolithic Near East might have understood the concepts of "death", "birth" and the "wild", drawing on ethnographic examples from various recorded shamanistic societies in order to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 123&amp;ndash;148.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter six, "Treasure the Dream Whatever the Terror", discusses how aspects of consciousness and cosmology can make their way into myth, expanding on the problematic nature of defining "myth". Turning to the [[structuralism|structuralist]] ideas of anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], they discuss Lévi-Strauss's ideas of neurologically based "mythemes" that provided the building blocks for myths; although rejecting his structuralism, they concur that there is a neuropsychological "deep structure" behind mythology, and proceed to compare the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' with a [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] narrative, "The Cave of the Reindeer Woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 149&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Newgrange, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The entrance stone to Newgrange; Lewis-Williams and Pearce argue that these motifs represent entopic phenomenon that have resulted from altered states of consciousness.]]

The seventh chapter, "The Mound in the Dark Grove", turns its attention to Atlantic Europe, on the western end of the continent. Opening with a reference to [[William Blake]], the authors focus their attention on two Early Neolithic tombs on the island of [[Anglesey]] off the Welsh coast: [[Bryn Celli Ddu]] and [[Barclodiad y Gawres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 169&amp;ndash;197.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter eight, "Brú na Bóinne", examines the [[Brú na Bóinne|valley of the same name]] in [[County Meath]], Ireland, the home to a number of Early Neolithic tombs. Lewis-Williams and Pearce turn their attention to the most prominent two, [[Newgrange]] and [[Knowth]], arguing that their architectural designs reflect cosmological views of the world influenced by altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 198&amp;ndash;249.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the penultimate chapter, "Religion de Profunais", the authors examine a number of recurring features in Neolithic Western Europe which they believe can shed light on the religious beliefs of the period. Exploring ritual elements to the act of flint mining at such sites as [[Grimes Graves]], they discuss the potential shamanic symbolism of [[quartz]]. From there, they look at the art motifs found at sites in this part of the continent, highlighting the argument of Dronfield that such motifs were an attempt to depict entopic phenomenon, in doing so drawing ethnographic parallels with the artworks created by shamans among the [[Tukano people]] of Amazonia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 250&amp;ndash;280.&lt;/ref&gt; The concluding chapter, "East is East and West is West", discusses the authors' views on the potential of their theory, making reference to [[Christopher Hawkes|Hawkes' ladder of inference]]{{Failed verification|date=January 2014}} and arguing for the need to consider [[emic and etic|emic]] perspectives when dealing with past societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew05|Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2005]]. pp. 281&amp;ndash;290.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reviews===
Susan A. Johnston of [[George Washington University]] reviewed the book for the ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' journal, in which she noted that many of the authors' analyses were "interesting, and sometimes quite new and innovative." However, she also felt that there was a disconnection between the theoretical underpinnings to the tome and the analyses that followed; noting that while they were trying to avoid the neurological determinism which had been critiqued by [[Paul Bahn]] and Patricia Helvenston in their ''Waking the Trance Fixed'' (2005), she nevertheless thought their approach similar to it. Ultimately acknowledging that the analysis on offer do not require the neurological backing that the authors provide, Johnston suggested that the contemporary preoccupation with rooting archaeological interpretations in "biological reality" was a part of the "21st-century mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh06|Johnston 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' journal published a review of ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'' authored by [[Chris Scarre]] of [[Durham University]], in which he noted the controversial nature of Lewis-Williams' "three stages of trance" model, proclaiming that those already unconvinced by the theory will get little from the new book. Scarre noted that inevitably, there was "much to question and to applaud" in the work, before highlighting that the use of evidence was selective, and that the art on the Breton megaliths was not included.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sca07|Scarre 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Scientist]]'' published a review authored by Brian D. Hayden of [[Simon Fraser University]], in which he described it as a "very enjoyable" book, praising the book's vignettes as making it "eminently readable". Although remarking that the authors' "endorse cognitive interpretations that are quite different from the more economic and practical interpretations that I generally favor", Hayden nevertheless commented that he agreed with their basic premise. He comments that while some of their assertions do seem plausible, others &amp;ndash; for instance their claims that the idea of a tiered cosmos has a neurological basis &amp;ndash; are less so, being the sort of "speculative indulgences" that he believes typify "English archaeology". Moving on to discuss the authors' views on the relationship between altered states of consciousness and power elites, he expresses his disagreement with them, noting that "the issues of domestication and the emergence of socioeconomic complexity are poorly served by cognitively based explanations."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hay06|Hayden 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

David S. Webster of [[Durham University]]'s Archaeological Services reviewed the work for the ''European Journal of Archaeology'' in which he highlighted its "popular tone and style" and use of the "contentious" three mode-model of trance states, a model he dismisses as a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Web05|Webster 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Archaeology'', the publication of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], Michael Balter positively reviewed ''Inside the Neolithic Mind'', praising its "superb writing" and "lavishly illustrated descriptions" of archaeological sites. Although he notes that most archaeologists would concur that Neolithic people probably believed in a spirit world, he expressed his belief that "they may balk at the idea" that the act of climbing down step ladders at Çatalhöyük symbolized the descent into the underworld or that hearths in the floors of 'Ain Ghazal symbolized the transformation of fire, rather than the remnants of cookery. He also noted that archaeologists would be more receptive to their idea that geometric patterns on European megaliths have parallels with similarities in Southern Africa and California. Concluding his review, Balter remarked that the authors "can be assured that their foray into the Neolithic mind will not be ignored."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bal05|Balter 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jongmyo Jerye''' or '''Jongmyo Daeje''' is a [[ancestor worship|rite]] held for worshipping the late [[king]]s and [[queen consort|queens]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Jongmyo|Jongmyo Shrine]], [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. It is held every year on the first Sunday of May. The Jongmyo rite is usually accompanied with the [[Korean court music|court music]] playing (''Jerye-ak'') and [[Korean dance|dance]] called ''Ilmu'' or ''line Dance''. Jongmyo Jerye and Jeryeak were designated as the first of South Korea's [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2001.

==History==
The Jongmyo rites originated from [[Ancient China]]. These rituals were seen as essential to the preservation and continued prosperity of the state and so each dynasty in China and Korea placed a great deal of importance in them which can be seen from Confucian texts and the very mention of 'preserving the Sacred Shrines' whenever there was talk about the state being in peril. The ceremonies reinforce the Confucian link between ancestors and their descendants, parent and child, essentially the family; the act of communing with them is a prayer and invocation for the ancestors for the preservation and good health of the state.

They were practised in Korea for the first time in [[Silla]] era and preserved from the [[Goryeo Dynasty]] to the last Korean Dynasty of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]. Along with the ceremony for praying to the Gods of Earth for bountiful crops, it is considered Korea's highest-ranked rites. These practices have been lost in China due to the abolition of the monarchy but Korea still preserved it well after their own monarchy was abolished.

The current ceremonies are organised and performed by the descendants of the former royal family, the [[Korean Imperial Household]], with assistance from other cultural organisations. The King's role is played by a senior member of the Household, usually the [[Yi Won|Hereditary Prince Imperial of Korea]], who technically would have performed the same rites if Korea was at present a monarchy (the former kings being his actual ancestors).

==Procedures==
The Jerye procedures were divided into three parts. It is regarded as Korea's highest-ranked ritual, so it was held strictly and solemnly. The first part is the procedures to invite and greet the spirits. Most of the rites are held by king, officiants and his family. The first part's procedures are ''jagye'' (purification). ''Chwiwi'' is the part when the king and choheongwan (people who bring the wine for offering rituals) take the position into the chamber of the shrine. Then they wash their hands for greeting the spirits (''gwansewi''). In the ''Cheonghaengrye'' and ''Singwanrye'' rituals, they begin the rite of greeting the gods of Heaven and Earth by offering wine.

The second is rituals for entertaining the spirits. It is started the rites of ''Jinchan'', which serves 63 kinds of foods to the spirits. Then the king begin to serve the first wine offering to the ancestral rites (''Choheonrye'') followed by Aheongwan (Crown Prince) and Jongheongwan (Prime Minister). This ritual is followed by rite of reciting the prayer paper by people called Daechukgwan. ''Aheonrye'' and ''Jongheonrye'' are the rites of the second and third (last) of wine offering.

The third part is the last rites which are held to send off the spirits to heaven. ''Eumbok'' is an occasion of sharing foods and wine to the officiants. The ''Cheonbyeondu'' is the rite of removing all the foods served for the spirits. In ''Songsin'', the Choheongwan and other officiants bows four times to send off the spirits to heaven. ''Mangryorye'' is the last rite held by burning the prayer papers and the king is reported by the Heongwan and Daechukgwan that the rituals and services are completed and all the officiants withdraw.

==Jerye-ak==
[[Image:Jongmyo DSC 6892.jpg|thumb|[[Pyeongyeong]]]]
During the rituals of Jerye, it were held together with the [[Korean court music|court music]] playing (''Jerye-ak'') to bring an enjoyment for the spirits invited into the rites. Jerye-ak compositions played in the rites were [[Botaepyeong]] and [[Jeongdaeeop]]. There were also songs that accompanied the jerye-ak, named Jongmyo Akjang.

An elaborate performance of ancient court music (with accompanying dance) known as ''Jongmyo jeryeak'' (hangul: 종묘제례악; hanja: 宗廟祭禮樂) is performed there each year.  Musicians, dancers, and scholars would perform Confucian rituals, such as the Jongmyo Daeje (Royal Shrine Ritual) in the courtyard five times a year.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517100716/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/77].  Today the rituals have been reconstructed and revived.  The Jongmyo Daeje has been designated as [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property]] No. 56 and is performed every year in May. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517100716/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/77].  The ''Jongmyo Jerye-ak'', the traditional court music of Joseon, is performed by the Royal Court Orchestra and has been designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 1.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060517100716/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/77]. This court music has its origins in Chinese court music that was brought to Korea during the [[Goryeo]] period. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060906125221/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/cgi-bin/pictures.cfm?FileName=perform8].  King Sejong composed new music for the ritual based largely on ''[[hyangak]]'' (with some ''[[dangak]]'') in 1447 and 1462.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060906125221/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/cgi-bin/pictures.cfm?FileName=perform8].

==Dances==
The Jerye's dance is called ''Ilmu'' (line dance). Ilmu divided into Botaepyeong-ji-mu (dance to praise achievements of the former kings), and Jeongdaeeop-ji-mu, (dance to praise the king's military achievements). Ilmu dances are performed by a group of 64 women dancers wearing purpled-clothing dance. They called Palilmu because they dance in 8 lines and rows.

Ilmu divided into two types of dance, ''Munmu'' and ''Mumu''. Munmu means the "civil dance" and is accompanied by Botaepyeong-ji-ak, with Yak (a three-holed bamboo flute) in the left hand and Jeok (a pheasant-feather tasseled wooden bar) in the right hand. Mumu is a military dance. The dancers move quickly by holding wooden swords and the rear four rows wooden spears in the front four rows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2638">The '''Kom''' or '''Kam''' or '''kamboj''' are a [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]] tribe in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. 

Most used alternative names  are '''Kamozi''',  '''Kamoz'''/'''Camoze''', '''Caumojee'''/'''Kaumoji''', and '''Camoje''' (M. Elphinstone, George Robertson, Richard Strand).

==History==
In 1895, following their conquest by [[Emir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]], the Kom Kafir people in [[Afghanistan]] were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. Every former Kafiristan Kafiri were renamed [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]] (''The Enlightened Ones'') respectively [[Nuristan]] (''Land of Light''). In present time there are now known ''Nuristani Kom'' or simply ''Kom''.

At the end of the 19th century, they were living in the lower part of the [[Bashgul Valley]], known as '''Kam''','''Kamboj''' (George Scott Robertson), '''Kamdesh''' in [[Khowar language|Khowar]], and '''Kamoz''' in [[Pashto language|Pashto]], and in the adjacent valleys.

Numerous scholars have connected the names Kom and [[Kata (people)|Kata]] with ancient [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] and identified the [[Hindukush Kafir people|Kafirs]], especially the ''Siah-Posh'' Kafirs, as having descended from ancient Kambojas{{Citation needed|reason=There had been some authors mentioned in the previous version, however without the year of publication or literal sources in the ''list of references''|date=January 2014}}.
Though not a numerous people, the Kom were greatly respected military prowess by neighboring tribes as well as by [[Chitral]]is and the [[Pashtun people]]. The Kom control the destiny of Bashgul valley and were said to be its virtual kings (George Scott Robertson). The Kom were tributary to the [[Mehtar (title)|Mehtar]] of [[Chitral]] until 1895.  

The political headquarters of the Kom of the Siah-Posh Kafir clan were at ''Kombrom''. The country of the Koms is also in present-day Nuristan called ''Komstan''.

'''''L'Age d'Or''''' ({{lang-fr|L'Âge d'Or}}, {{IPA-fr|lɑʒ dɔʁ|pron}}), commonly translated as '''''The Golden Age''''' or '''''Age of Gold''''', is a 1930 French [[Surrealism|surrealist]] satirical comedy film directed by [[Luis Buñuel]] about the insanities of modern life, the hypocrisy of the [[Mores|sexual mores]] of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society and the [[value system]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The screenplay is by [[Salvador Dalí]] and Buñuel.&lt;ref&gt;''Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia'' Third Edition (1987) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Age d'Or'' was one of the first [[sound film]]s made in France, along with ''[[Prix de Beauté]]'' and ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]''.

==Synopsis==
The first scene of the film is a documentary about [[scorpion]]s. After that, the film is a series of vignettes, wherein a couple's attempts at consummating their romantic relationship are continually thwarted by the bourgeois values and sexual mores of family, church, and society.

The couple are first seen creating a disturbance by making love in the mud during a religious ceremony. The man is apprehended and led away by two men who struggle to control their captive's sudden impulses. He momentarily breaks free long enough to kick a small dog. Later he struggles free to aggressively crush a beetle with his shoe. As he is escorted through city streets, he sees an advertisement that inspires him to fantasize a woman's hand rubbing herself, and becomes transfixed by another advertisement showing a woman's legs in silk stockings. He eventually escapes his handlers, inexplicably assaults a blind man standing at a curb, and gets into a taxi.

Meanwhile, the woman is at home, where she tells her mother she hurt her finger, which is wrapped in a bandage that disappears and reappears from scene to scene. The woman and her parents attend a party where the guests seem oblivious to alarming or incongruous events in their midst: a maid screams and falls to the floor after emerging from a doorway where flames are visible; a horse-drawn cart filled with rowdy men drinking from large bottles passes through the elegant company in the ballroom; the father converses with guests while ignoring several flies on his face; a small boy is shot and killed for a minor prank.

The man arrives at the party and sees his lover from across the room. He behaves brusquely toward the other guests while looking ardently in the woman's direction, and she looks longingly at him. The woman's mother hands the man a drink, but spills a drop on his hand. He becomes enraged and slaps her, which seems to excite the daughter. Seeking sexual release and satisfaction, the couple go into the garden and make love next to a marble statue, while the rest of the party guests assemble outdoors for an orchestral performance of ''[[Liebestod]]''. When the man is called away to answer a telephone call, the woman sublimates her sexual passion by [[fellatio|fellating]] the toe of the statue until the man returns.

The ''Liebestod'' music stops abruptly when the conductor, his hands gripping his head, walks away, and wanders into the garden where the couple are. The woman runs to comfort the elderly conductor before finally [[French kissing]] him. The man stands up, bumping his head on a hanging flower pot, and grasps his head in pain as he leaves the garden. He stumbles away to her bedroom where he throws a burning tree, a bishop, a plow, the bishop's staff, a giraffe statue and handfuls of pillow feathers out the window.

The final vignette is an allusion to the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s novel ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]''; the intertitle reads: ''120 Days of Depraved Acts'', about an orgy in a castle, wherein the surviving orgiasts are ready to emerge to the light of mainstream society. From the castle door emerges the bearded and berobed Duc de Blangis (a character from de Sade's novel) who greatly resembles Jesus, the [[Christ]], who comforts a young woman who has run out from the castle, before he takes her back inside. Afterwards, a woman's scream is heard, and only the Duc re-emerges; and he is beardless. The concluding image is a [[Christian cross]] festooned with the scalps of women; to the accompaniment of jovial music, the scalps sway in the wind.

==Production==
{{expand section|date=May 2015}}
''L'Age d'Or'' began as the second artistic collaboration between [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], who had fallen out by the time of the film's production. A neophyte cinéast, Buñuel overcame his ignorance of cinematic production technique by sequentially filming most of the screenplay; the 63-minute movie is composed of almost every meter of film exposed and dramatic sequence photographed.

The production budget was a million [[French franc|francs]], and was financed and produced by the [[Vicomte]] [[Charles de Noailles]] (1891–1981), a [[French nobility|nobleman]] who, beginning in 1928, yearly commissioned a film as a birthday gift to his wife, the Vicomtesse [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]] (1902–1970), who was a renowned [[Patronage|patroness]] of the arts and of artists, such as Dalí and Buñuel, [[Balthus]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Man Ray]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Jean Hugo]], [[Jean-Michel Frank]] and others.&lt;ref name="Movie Diva"&gt;[http://www.moviediva.com/website/MD_root/reviewpages/L'Age%20D'Or.html ''L'Age d'Or''] entry in the Movie Diva website.&lt;/ref&gt;

''L'Age d'Or'' included actors who were famous artists, such as Max Ernst and Josep Llorens Artigas.&lt;ref name=hammond&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Paul|title=Constellations of Miró, Breton|date=2000|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0872863727|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0872863727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}

==Reception==
Upon receiving a cinematic exhibition permit from the Board of Censors, ''L'Age d'Or'' had its premiere presentation at Studio 28, Paris, on 29 November 1930. Later, on 3 December 1930, the great popular success of the film provoked attacks by the [[right-wing]] ''[[Ligue des Patriotes]]'' (League of Patriots), whose angry viewers took umbrage at the visual statements made by Buñuel and Dalí. The [[reactionary]] French ''Patriots'' interrupted the screening by throwing ink at the cinema screen and assaulting viewers who opposed them. They then went to the lobby and destroyed art works by Dalí, [[Joan Miró]], [[Man Ray]], [[Yves Tanguy]], and others. On 10 December 1930, the Prefect of Police of Paris, [[Jean Chiappe]], arranged to have the film banned from further public exhibition after the Board of Censors re-reviewed the film.&lt;ref name="Movie Diva" /&gt;

A contemporary right-wing Spanish newspaper published a condemnation of the film and of Buñuel and Dalí, which described the content of the film as "...the most repulsive corruption of our age ... the new poison which [[Judaism]], [[Freemasonry|Masonry]], and rabid, [[revolution]]ary sectarianism want to use in order to corrupt the people".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, C. B. ''This Loving Darkness: The Cinema and Spanish Writers 1920–1936'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press: 1980), pp. 28–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the de Noailles family withdrew ''L'Age d'Or'' from commercial distribution and public exhibition for more than forty years; nonetheless, three years later, in 1933, the film was privately exhibited at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. Forty-nine years later, from 1–15 November 1979, the film had its legal U.S. premiere at the [[The Roxie|Roxie Cinema]] in San Francisco.

The film critic Robert Short said that the scalp-decorated crucifix and the scenes of socially repressive violence, wherein the love-struck protagonist is manhandled by two men, indicate that the social and [[psychological repression|psychological]] repression of the [[libido]] and of romantic passion and emotion, by the [[Mores|sexual mores]] of [[bourgeois]] society and by the [[value system]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], breed violence in the relations among people, and violence by men against women.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Age d'Or'' commentary by Robert Short, published by British Film Institute (BFI)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Today, ''L'Age d'Or'' is widely regarded as one of the key works of [[surrealist cinema]]. British critic [[Philip French]] noted that the film, alongside Buñuel's ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (1929), featured "bizarre sequences that assault bourgeois values and sexual oppression while making no logical sense, and they were acclaimed by the leading arbiters of surrealism as the first authentic surrealist films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/29/lage-dor-bunuel-chien-andalou-philip-french |title=L'Age d'Or/ Un Chien Andalou |last=French |first=Philip |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=May 28, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Film Institute]]'s 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls, 15 critics and six directors named ''L'Age d'Or'' one of their 10 favorite films in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a5074d0 |title=L'Age d'Or (1930) |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Gonzalez of ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' analyzed the film's [[sound design]] in relation to his argument that Buñuel's overriding message is the ability of love to "conquer all sorts of moral restraints."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/lage-dor |title=L'Age d'Or |last=Gonzalez |first=Ed |publisher=''Slant'' |date=April 17, 2002 |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an average rating of 8.8/10 among 25 critics, with 92% approval overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lage_dor/ |title=L'Age d'Or (Age of Gold) (The Golden Age) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggregation site ''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They'' has since found ''L'Age d'Or'' to be the 120th most acclaimed film ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php |title=1,000 Greatest Films (Full List) |accessdate=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23950">Many authors will use quotations from literature as the [[title (publishing)|title]] for their works.  This may be done as a conscious allusion to the themes of the older work or simply because the phrase seems memorable.  The following is a partial '''list of book titles taken from literature'''.  It does not include phrases altered for parody. (Titles taken from works by [[William Shakespeare]] do not appear here: see [[List of titles of works taken from Shakespeare]].)

*[[Honduras|Honduran]] or big-leaf mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), with a range from Mexico to southern [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonia]] in [[Brazil]], the most widespread species of mahogany and the only true mahogany species commercially grown today.&lt;ref name="Bridgewater"/&gt;Illegal logging of ''S. macrophylla'', and its highly destructive environmental effects,&lt;ref name="Mongillo"&gt;"Mahogany," ''Encyclopedia of Environmental Science'' (University of Rochester Press, 2000, ed. John F. Mongillo), p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; led to the species' placement in 2003 on Appendix II of [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES), the first time that a high-volume, high-value tree was listed on Appendix II.&lt;ref&gt;David Humphreys, ''Logjam: Deforestation and the Crisis of Global Governance'' (Routledge, 2012), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Swietenia humilis]]'', a small and often twisted mahogany tree limited to seasonally [[dry forest]]s in Pacific Central America that is of limited commercial utility.&lt;ref name="Bridgewater"/&gt; Some [[botanist]]s believe that ''S. humilis'' is a mere variant of ''S. macrophylla''.&lt;ref name="Bridgewater"/&gt;

While the three ''Swietenia'' species are classified officially as "genuine mahogany", other Meliaceae species with timber uses are classified as "true mahogany." (Only members of the genus Swietenia can be called "genuine mahogany.") Some may or may not have the word mahogany in their trade or common name. Some of these true mahoganies include the African genera ''[[Khaya]]'' (African mahogany) and ''[[Entandrophragma]]'' (sapele mahogany);&lt;ref name="Bridgewater"/&gt; [[New Zealand]] mahogany or [[kohekohe]] (''Dysoxylum spectabile'');&lt;ref&gt;Julian Matthews, ''Trees in New Zealand'' (Lansdowne Press, 1983), p. 72; Eion Scarrow, ''New Zealand Native Trees and Shrubs'' (TVNZ, 1986), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese mahogany, ''[[Toona sinensis]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Wiart, ''Medicinal Plants of Asia and the Pacific'' (CRC Press, 2006), p. 203; Zhuge Ren &amp; Clem Tisdell, ''China's Economic Growth and Transition: Macroeconomic, Environmental and Social-Regional Dimensions'' (Nova Publishers 1997, eds.

Mahogany is a commercially important lumber prized for its beauty, durability, and color, and used for [[paneling]] and to make [[furniture]], [[boat-building|boats]], [[musical instrument]]s and other items. The leading importer of mahogany is the United States, followed by Britain;&lt;ref name="Bridgewater"/&gt; while the largest exporter today is [[Peru]], which surpassed [[Brazil]] after that country banned mahogany exports in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Liddick, ''Crimes Against Nature: Illegal Industries and the Global Environment'' (ABC-CLIO, 2011), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that some 80 or 90 percent of Peruvian mahogany exported to the United States is [[Illegal logging|illegally harvested]], with the economic cost of illegal logging in Peru placed conservatively at $40–70 million USD annually.&lt;ref name="Kozloff"&gt;Nikolas Kozloff, ''Rain in the Amazon: How South America's Climate Change Affects the Entire Planet'' (Macmillan, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcelo M. Giugale &amp; Vicente Fretes Cibils, ''An Opportunity for a Different Peru: Prosperous, Equitable, and Governable'' (World Bank Publications, 2007), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that in 2000, some 57,000 mahogany trees were harvested to supply the U.S. furniture trade alone.&lt;ref name="Bridgewater"/&gt;

Mahogany is the [[national tree]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cambeira, ''Quisqueya La Bella: The Dominican Republic in Historical and Cultural Perspective'' (M.E. Sharpe, 1997), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Belize]].&lt;ref name="Day Wilson"&gt;Victoria Day-Wilson, ''Living Abroad in Belize'' (Avalon Travel 2012), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; A mahogany tree with two [[Lumberjack|woodcutters]] bearing an [[axe]] and a paddle also appears on the [[Coat of arms of Belize|Belizean national coat of arms]], under the [[List of national mottos|national motto]], ''Sub umbra floreo'', [[Latin]] for "under the shade I flourish."&lt;ref name="Day Wilson"/&gt;

==Overview==

===Distribution===
The natural distribution of these species within the Americas is geographically distinct. ''S. mahagoni'' grows on the West Indian islands as far north as the Bahamas, the Florida Keys and parts of Florida; ''S. humilis'' grows in the dry regions of the Pacific coast of Central America from south-western Mexico to Costa Rica; ''S. macrophylla'' grows in Central America from Yucatan southwards and into South America, extending as far as Peru, Bolivia and extreme western Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia White &amp; Peter Gasson, ''Mahogany'' (2008), pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century various botanists attempted to further define ''S. macrophylla'' in South America as a new species, such as ''S. candollei'' Pittier and ''S. tessmannii'' Harms., but many authorities consider these spurious. According to Record and Hess, all of the mahogany of continental North and South America can be considered as one botanical species, ''Swietenia macrophylla'' King.&lt;ref&gt;Record &amp; Hess, Timbers of the New World (1972), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The name mahogany was initially associated only with those islands in the West Indies under British control (French colonists used the term ''acajou'', while in the Spanish territories it was called ''caoba''). The origin of the name is uncertain, but it could be a corruption of 'm'oganwo', the name used by the Yoruba and Ibo people of West Africa to describe trees of the genus ''[[Khaya]]'', which is closely related to ''Swietenia''. When transported to [[Jamaica]] as slaves, they gave the same name to the similar trees they saw there.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bruce Lamb, 'On Further defining Mahogany', ''Economic Botany'', 17 (1963), pp. 217-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this interpretation has been disputed, no one has suggested a more plausible origin.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp Malone, 'Notes on the Word Mahogany', ''Economic Botany'', 19 (1965), pp. 286-292.&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous [[Arawak]] name for the tree is not known. In 1671 the word mahogany appeared in print for the first time, in [[John Ogilby]]'s ''America''.&lt;ref&gt;John Ogilby, ''America, Being the Latest and Most Accurate Description of the New World'', London (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Among botanists and naturalists, however, the tree was considered a type of cedar, and in 1759 was classified by [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) as ''Cedrela mahagoni''. The following year it was assigned to a new genus by Nicholas Joseph Jacquin (1727–1817), and named ''Swietenia mahagoni''.

Until the 19th century all of the mahogany was regarded as one species, although varying in quality and character according to soil and climate. In 1836 the German botanist [[Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini]] (1797–1848) identified a second species while working on specimens collected on the Pacific coast of Mexico, and named it ''Swietenia humilis''. In 1886 a third species, ''Swietenia macrophylla'', was named by [[Sir George King]] (1840–1909) after studying specimens of Honduras mahogany planted in the Botanic Gardens in Calcutta, India. Today, all species of ''[[Swietenia]]'' grown in their native locations are listed by [[CITES]], and are therefore protected. Both ''Swietenia mahagoni'', and ''Swietenia macrophylla'' were introduced into several Asian countries at the time of the restrictions imposed on American mahogany in the late 1990s and both are now successfully grown and harvested in plantations in those countries. A small percentage of global supply of genuine mahogany comes from these Asian plantations, notably from [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]] and from [[Fiji]], in Oceania. For ''Swietenia macrophylla'', the trees in these plantations are still relatively young compared to the trees being harvested from old growth forests in South America. Thus, the illegal trade of bigleaf mahogany continues apace&lt;ref name="rfrelief"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainforestrelief.org/What_to_Avoid_and_Alternatives/Rainforest_Wood/What_to_Avoid_What_to_Choose/By_Tree_Species/Tropical_Woods/M/Mahogany.html |title=What to Avoid/What to Choose - Mahogany (Sweitenia sp., Khaya sp.) |access-date=2018-11-22 |website=Rainforest Relief}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Species===
Species of ''Swietenia'' cross-fertilise readily when they grow in proximity; the hybrid between ''S. mahagoni'' and ''S. macrophylla'' is widely planted for its timber.

In addition, the U.S. timber trade also markets various other [[Federal Trade Commission]]-defined species as ''mahoganies'' under a variety of different commercial names, most notably ''[[Shorea|Philippine mahogany]]'', which is actually from the genus ''[[Shorea]]'', a [[dipterocarp]]. This wood is also called ''[[Shorea|Lauan]]'' or ''[[Shorea|Meranti]]''.

==History of American mahogany trade==
[[File:Squaring mahogany.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mahogany loggers in Belize, around 1930]]

In the 17th century, the buccaneer [[John Esquemeling]] recorded the use of mahogany or cedrela on [[Hispaniola]] for making canoes: "The Indians make these canoes without the use of any iron instruments, by only burning the trees at the bottom near the root, and afterwards governing the fire with such industry that nothing is burnt more than what they would have..."&lt;ref&gt;John Esquemeling, ''The Buccanneers of America'', translated from the Dutch 1684, reprinted London (1893), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The wood first came to the notice of Europeans with the beginning of Spanish colonisation in the Americas. A cross in the Cathedral at [[Santo Domingo]], bearing the date 1514, is said to be mahogany, and Phillip II of Spain apparently used the wood for the interior joinery of the Escorial Palace, begun in 1584.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Latham, ''Timber, Its Development and Distribution'', London (1957), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''caoba'', as the Spanish called the wood, was principally reserved for ship building, and it was declared a royal monopoly at Havana in 1622. Hence very little of the mahogany growing in Spanish controlled territory found its way to Europe.

After the French established a colony in [[Saint Domingue]] (now [[Haiti]]), some mahogany from that island probably found its way to France, where joiners in the port cities of Saint-Malo, Nantes, La Rochelle and Bordeaux used the wood to a limited extent from about 1700.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Viaux-Locquin, ''Les bois d'ebenisterie dans le mobilier francais'', Paris (1997), pp. 2-10.&lt;/ref&gt; On the English-controlled islands, especially [[Jamaica]] and the [[Bahamas]], mahogany was abundant but not exported in any quantity before 1700.

===18th century===
While the trade in mahogany from the Spanish and French territories in America remained moribund for most of the 18th century, this was not true for those islands under British control. In 1721 the British Parliament removed all import duties from timber imported into Britain from British possessions in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;This was the Act of 8 George I cap. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This immediately stimulated the trade in West Indian timbers including, most importantly,  mahogany. Importations of mahogany into England (and excluding those to Scotland, which were recorded separately) reached 525 tons per annum by 1740, 3,688 tons by 1750, and more than 30,000 tons in 1788, the peak year of the 18th century trade.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Bowett, 'The 1721 Naval Stores Act and the Commercial Introduction of Mahogany', ''Furniture History'', XXX (1994), pp. 42-56; Adam Bowett, ''The English Mahogany Trade 1700-1793'', unpublished PhD thesis, Brunel University (1997); The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the 1721 Act had the effect of substantially increasing exports of mahogany from the West Indies to the British colonies in North America. Although initially regarded as a joinery wood, mahogany rapidly became the timber of choice for makers of high quality furniture in both the British Isles and the 13 colonies of North America.
[[File:Mahagoni Tree.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mahogany tree at Kannavam Forest, [[Kerala]]]]

Until the 1760s over 90 per cent of the mahogany imported into Britain came from Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this was re-exported to continental Europe, but most was used by British furniture makers. Quantities of Jamaican mahogany also went to the North American colonies, but most of the wood used in American furniture came from the [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowett (1997); The National Archives (United Kingdom), Shipping Returns, CO 142 (Jamaica); CO 27 (Bahamas).&lt;/ref&gt; This was sometimes called Providence wood, after the main port of the islands, but more often ''madera'' or ''maderah'', which was the Bahamian name for mahogany.&lt;ref&gt;Brad Rauschenberg, 'Timber Available in Charleston, 1660-1820', ''Journal of the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts'', XX, No. 2; Bowett (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Jamaica and Bahamas, all the British controlled islands exported some mahogany at various times, but the quantities were not large. The most significant third source was Black River and adjacent areas on the [[Mosquito Coast]] (now [[Republic of Honduras]]), from where quantities of mahogany were shipped from the 1740s onwards. This mahogany was known as 'Rattan mahogany', after the island of [[Ruatan]], which was the main offshore [[entrepot]] for the British settlers in the area.

At the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63), the mahogany trade began to change significantly. During the occupation of [[Havana]] by British forces between August 1762 and July 1763, quantities of Cuban or Havanna mahogany were sent to Britain, and after the city was restored to Spain in 1763, Cuba continued to export small quantities, mostly to ports on the north coast of Jamaica, from where it went to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust 3; Shipping returns, CO 142 (Jamaica).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mahogany was regarded as inferior to the Jamaican variety, and the trade remained sporadic until the 19th century.

Another variety new to the market was Hispaniola mahogany, also called 'Spanish' and 'St Domingo' mahogany. This was the result of the 1766 Free Ports Act, which opened Kingston and other designated Jamaican ports to foreign vessels for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;This was the Act of 6 George III cap. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The object was primarily to encourage importations of cotton from French plantations in [[Saint Domingue]], but quantities of high quality mahogany were also shipped. These were then forwarded to Britain, where they entered the market in the late 1760s.

[[File:Toona calantas (Philippine mahogany) seeds - 7.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mahogany fruit and seeds]]
  
In terms of quantity, the most significant new addition to the mahogany trade was Honduras mahogany, also called 'baywood', after the Bay of Honduras. British settlers had been active in southern [[Yucatan]] since the beginning of the 18th century, despite the opposition of the Spanish, who claimed sovereignty over all of Central America.

Their main occupation was cutting [[logwood]], a dyewood in high demand in Europe. The centre of their activity and the primary point of export was [[Belize]]. Under Article XVII of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] (1763), British cutters were for the first time given the right to cut logwood in Yucatan unmolested, within agreed limits. Such was the enthusiasm of the cutters that within a few years the European market was glutted, and the price of logwood collapsed.

However, the price of mahogany was still high after the war, and so the cutters turned to cutting mahogany. The first Honduras mahogany arrived in Kingston, Jamaica, in November 1763, and the first shipments arrived in Britain the following year.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Shipping register, CO 142 (Jamaica); Cust 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1790s most of the viable stocks of mahogany in Jamaica had been cut, and the market was divided between two principal sources or types of mahogany. Honduras mahogany was relatively cheap, plentiful, but rarely of the best quality. Hispaniola (also called Spanish or Santo Domingo) mahogany was the wood of choice for high quality work.

Data are lacking, but it is likely that the newly independent United States now received a good proportion of its mahogany from Cuba. In the last quarter of the 18th century France began to use mahogany more widely;&lt;ref&gt;Viaux-Locquin (1997), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; they had ample supplies of high quality wood from Saint Domingue. The rest of Europe, where the wood was increasingly fashionable, obtained most of their wood from Britain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and the wars that followed radically changed the mahogany trade, primarily due to the progressive collapse of the French and Spanish colonial empires, which allowed British traders into areas previously closed to them. Saint Domingue became the independent republic of Haiti, and from 1808, Spanish controlled Santo Domingo and Cuba were both open to British vessels for the first time.

From the 1820s mahogany from all these areas was imported into Europe and North America, with the lion's share going to Britain. In Central America British loggers moved northwest towards Mexico and south into Guatemala. Other areas of Central America as far south as Panama also began to be exploited.

The most important new development was the beginning of large scale logging in Mexico from the 1860s. Most mahogany was cut in the province of [[Tabasco]] and exported from a number of ports on the [[Gulf of Campeche]], from Vera Cruz eastwards to Campeche and Sisal.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Laslett, Timber and Timber Trees, London (1875), p.178&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century there was scarcely any part of Central America within reach of the coast untouched by logging, and activity also extended into Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Brazil.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Trade in American mahogany probably reached a peak in the last quarter of the 19th century. Figures are not available for all countries, but Britain alone imported more than 80,000 tons in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives (United Kingdom), Cust. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This figure was not matched again. From the 1880s, African mahogany (''[[Khaya]]'' spp.), a related genus, began to be exported in increasing quantities from West Africa, and by the early 20th century it dominated the market.

In 1907 the total of mahogany from all sources imported into Europe was 159,830 tons, of which 121,743 tons were from West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Baterden, ''Timber'', London (1908), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time mahogany from Cuba, Haiti and other West Indian sources had become increasingly difficult to obtain in commercial sizes, and by the late 20th century Central American and even South American mahogany was heading in a similar direction. In 1975 ''S. humilis'' was placed on [[CITES Appendix II]] followed by ''S. mahagoni'' in 1992. The most abundant species, ''S. macrophylla'', was placed on Appendix III in 1995 and moved to Appendix II in 2003.

==Uses==
Mahogany has a straight, fine, and even grain, and is relatively free of voids and pockets. Its reddish-brown color darkens over time, and displays a reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, and is very durable.  Historically, the tree's girth allowed for wide boards from traditional mahogany species.  These properties make it a favorable wood for crafting cabinets and furniture.

Much of the first-quality furniture made in the American colonies from the mid 18th century was made of mahogany, when the wood first became available to American craftsmen. Mahogany is still widely used for fine furniture; however, the rarity of [[Cuba]]n mahogany, the over-harvesting of [[Honduras]] and [[Brazil]]ian mahogany, and the protests by indigenous peoples and environmental organizations from the 1980s into the 2000s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mahogany is Murder: Mahogany Extraction from Indian Reserves in Brazil |author=George Monbiot |year=1992 |publisher=Friends of the Earth |isbn=978-1-8575-0160-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/greenpeace-curbs-mahogany-logging-brazil-1999-2004 |title=Greenpeace Curbs Mahogany Logging in Brazil, 1999-2004 |access-date=2018-11-22 |website=Global Nonviolent Action Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rfrelief" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/wp-content/uploads/legacy/Global/usa/report/2010/2/partners-in-mahogany-crime.pdf |title=Partners in mahogany crime |work=Greenpeace |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;, have diminished their use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6043">'''Model-centered instruction''' is a general theory of [[instructional design]] developed by [[Andrew S Gibbons|Andrew S. Gibbons]].&lt;ref name="Gibbons"&gt;Gibbons, A. S., Model-Centered Instruction. ''Journal of Structural Learning and Intelligent Systems''. 14: 511-540, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory can be used to design individual and group instruction for all kinds of learning in any type of learning environment. In addition, this theory may be used to design instruction with a wide variety of technologies and many media delivery systems. 

==Theory summary==

The theory of model-centered    instruction is based on the assumption that the purpose of instruction is to help learners construct knowledge about objects and events in their environment. In the field of [[cognitive psychology]], theorists assert that knowledge is represented and stored in [[Memory|human memory]] as dynamic, networked structures generally known as [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] or [[mental models]]. This concept of mental models was incorporated by Gibbons into the theory of model-centered instruction. This theory is based on the assumption that learners construct [[mental model]]s as they process information they have acquired through observations of or interactions with objects, events, and environments. Instructional designers can assist learners by (a) helping them focus attention on specific information about an object, event, or environment and (b) initiating events or activities designed to trigger learning processes.

Instructional designers may guide learner attention by introducing learners to carefully selected objects and events that occur in certain environments. In some situations, it is not possible to have learners work with real objects, events, or environments. In these cases, instructional designers may create representations of the objects, events, or environments. These representations are called models. A model is a definition or representation of an object, event, or environment that includes some information regarding their properties, actions, or [[Causality|cause-effect]] relationships. Instructional designers may use a variety of models to help learners construct their own mental models. A model can take various mediated forms, from simple textual descriptions to complex, [[multimedia]] simulations. 

According to the theory of model-centered instruction, there are three types of models: (a) a natural or manufactured cause-effect '''system''', (b) an '''environment''' in which one or more systems operate, or (c) an '''expert performance'''—a set of purposeful, goal-driven actions that causes changes within systems and environments. These three types of models — system, environment, and expert performance - form a comprehensive framework for the representation and communication of subject-matter information in any domain. 

When learners interact with complex objects or models, they sometimes need assistance in discovering and processing information. Instructional designers can guide learners by introducing problems to be solved in a sequence that may be partially or fully determined by the learner. Gibbons defines a '''problem''' as “a request for information about an incompletely known model. A problem is a request for the learner…to supply one or more of the model’s behaviors, elements, or interrelations that are missing”. &lt;ref name="Gibbons"/&gt; Problems act as filters or masks that focus learner attention on specific information about the objects or models. Problems also trigger learning processes used in the construction of mental models. As problems are solved in sequence, learners process more information and construct more comprehensive and useful mental models.

== Principles of Model-Centered Instruction ==
Gibbons has defined seven principles that summarize the general design prescriptions of model-centered instruction. &lt;ref name="Gibbons"/&gt; These principles are related to the overall instructional purposes, subject-matter content, and instructional strategies of model-centered instruction. Key ideas related to designing, selecting, and sequencing problems can also be found in these principles. In addition, these principles provide guidance in how to provide supportive information, physical materials, tools, and personalized assistance to the learner. These principles, as defined by Gibbons, are listed below.

1.      '''Experience''': Learners should be given maximum opportunity to interact for learning purposes with one or more systems or models of systems of three types: environment, system, and/or expert performance. The terms model and simulation are not synonymous; models can be expressed in a variety of computer-based and non-computer-based forms.

2.      '''Problem solving''': Interaction with systems or models should be focused by the solution of one or more carefully selected problems, expressed in terms of the model, with solutions being performed by the learner, by a [[peer group|peer]], or by an expert.

3.      '''Denaturing''': Models are necessarily denatured from the real by the medium in which they are expressed. Designers must select a level of denaturing matching the target learner’s existing knowledge and goals.

4.      '''Sequence''': Problems should be arranged in a carefully constructed sequence for modeled solution or for active learner solution.

5.      '''Goal orientation''': Problems selected should be appropriate for the attainment of specific instructional goals.

6.      '''Resourcing''': The learner should be given [[problem solving]] information resources, materials, and tools within a solution environment (which may exist only in the learner’s mind) commensurate with instructional goals and existing levels of knowledge.

7.      '''Instructional augmentation''': The learner should be given support during solving in the form of dynamic, specialized, designed instructional augmentations.

[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Mezquita]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]]]
'''Moorish architecture''' is the [[articulation (architecture)|articulated]] [[Islamic architecture]] of North Africa and parts of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] ([[Al Andalus]]), where the Andalusians ([[Moors]]) were dominant between 711 and 1492. The best surviving examples are La [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] and the [[Alhambra]] palace in Granada (mainly 1338–1390),&lt;ref name="1curl"&gt;Curl p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Giralda]] in Seville (1184).&lt;ref name="pev1"&gt;Pevsner, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable examples include the ruined palace city of [[Medina Azahara]] (936–1010), the church (former mosque) San [[Cristo de la Luz]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the [[Aljafería]] in [[Saragossa]] and baths at for example [[Ronda]] and [[Alhama de Granada]].

{{expand section|date=December 2016|Article should describe the key features (dates, styles, innovations...) of each of the buildings mentioned, with suitable citations}}

Characteristic elements of Moorish architecture include [[muqarnas]], [[horseshoe arch]]es, [[voussoir]]s, domes, crenellated arches, [[lancet arch]]es, [[ogee arch]]es, courtyards, and decorative tile work known as [[zellij]] in Arabic or [[azulejo]] in Spanish and Portuguese. The architectural tradition is exemplified by [[mosque]]s, fortifications, and other edifices such as the [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] (784–987, in four phases); the [[Alhambra]] (mainly 1338–1390&lt;ref name="curl"&gt;Curl p.502&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Generalife]] (1302–9 and 1313–24) in [[Granada]] and the [[Giralda]] in [[Seville]] in 1184;&lt;ref name="Pev"&gt;Pevsner, Niklaus. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paderne Castle]] in the [[Algarve]], Portugal; the mosque of [[Koutoubia Mosque|Koutoubia]], [[Hassan II Mosque|Hassan Mosque]], [[Andalusian Mosque]], and [[University of Al-Karaouine]] in [[Morocco]]; the [[Great Mosque of Algiers]] and the [[Great Mosque of Tlemcen]] in [[Algeria]]; and the [[Mosque of Uqba]] in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]]. Other notable buildings include the ruined palace city of [[Medina Azahara]] (936-1010), the church (former mosque) San [[Cristo de la Luz]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the [[Aljafería]] in [[Zaragoza]] and baths at for example [[Ronda]] and [[Alhama de Granada]].

The term is sometimes used to include the [[History of Islam in southern Italy|products of the Islamic civilisation]] of [[Southern Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Industrial Geography of Italy'', Russell King, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985, page 81&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] in [[Sicily]] was begun in the 9th century by the [[Emir of Palermo]].

There is archeological evidence of an eighth-century mosque in [[Narbonne]], France.&lt;ref&gt;''Islam Outside the Arab World'', David Westerlund, Ingvar Svanberg, Palgrave Macmillan, 1999, page 342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--so what? could usefully discuss boundaries of Moorish region--&gt;

'''Music therapy''' is the use of [[music]] to improve health or functional outcomes. Music therapy is a [[creative arts therapies|creative arts therapy]], consisting of a process in which a music therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients improve their physical and mental health. Music therapists primarily help clients improve their health in several domains, such as cognitive functioning, [[motor skills]], emotional development, communication, [[sensory perception|sensory]], [[social skills]], and [[quality of life]] by using both active and receptive music experiences such as improvisation, re-creation, composition, and listening and discussion of music to achieve treatment goals. There is a wide qualitative and quantitative research literature base. 
Some commonly found practices include developmental work (communication, motor skills, etc.) with individuals with special needs, [[songwriting]] and listening in reminiscence/orientation work with the elderly, processing and relaxation work, and rhythmic [[brainwave synchronization|entrainment]] for physical rehabilitation in stroke victims. Music therapy is also used in some medical hospitals, cancer centers, schools, alcohol and drug recovery programs, psychiatric hospitals, and correctional facilities &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/11/music.aspx][http://www.musictherapy.org/about/quotes/ "About Music Therapy &amp; AMTA"]. American Music Therapy Association, 2011. November 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

Music has been found to be an effective tool for music therapists through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found that children who listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did not listen to music while having an IV inserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/11/music.aspx|title=Music as medicine|website=apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have been carried out on patients diagnosed different mental disorders such as anxiety, depression and schizophrenia and there has been a visible improvement in their mental health after the therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCaffrey T, Edwards J, Fannon D | date=2011|title=Is there a role for music therapy in the recovery approach in mental health? |journal=The Arts in Psychotherapy|volume=38|issue=3|pages=185–189|doi=10.1016/j.aip.2011.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches used in music therapy that have emerged from the field of music education include [[Orff-Schulwerk]] (Orff), Dalcroze [[eurhythmics]], and [[Kodály method]]. Models that developed directly out of music therapy are [[neurologic music therapy]] (NMT), [[Nordoff-Robbins music therapy]] and the Bonny method of [[guided imagery]] and music.&lt;ref name=Davis2008&gt;{{cite book | first1 = William Barron | last1 = Davis | first2 = Kate E. | last2 = Gfeller | first3 = Michael H. | last3 = Thaut | name-list-format = vanc |year=2008 |title=An introduction to music therapy: theory and practice|edition=Third |at=Part 3: The music therapy treatment process |publisher=American Music Therapy Association |location=Silver Spring, Maryland|OL=15594340W}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ rp|460–468}}

Music therapists may work with individuals who have behavioral-emotional disorders.[http://sophia.stkate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1786&amp;context=msw_papers]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deka|first=Ankur|title=Inner power of music and music therapy|url=http://www.efi-news.com/2012/04/inner-power-of-music-and-music-therapy.html|work=Efi-news.com|access-date=April 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508044032/http://www.efi-news.com/2012/04/inner-power-of-music-and-music-therapy.html|archive-date=May 8, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} To meet the needs of this population, music therapists have taken current psychological theories and used them as a basis for different types of music therapy. Different models include behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.&lt;ref name=Davis2008/&gt;{{rp|469–473}} The therapist has an ongoing responsibility to evaluate the extent to which the client is achieving the goals of therapy and whether the methods of therapy being used are helping or hindering the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defining Music Therapy|last=Bruscia|first=Kenneth|publisher=Barcelona Publishers|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One therapy model based on neuroscience, called "neurologic music therapy" (NMT), is "based on a neuroscience model of music perception and production, and the influence of music on functional changes in non-musical brain and behavior functions".&lt;ref name=Davis2008/&gt;{{rp|475}} In other words, NMT studies how the brain is without music, how the brain is with music, measures the differences, and uses these differences to cause changes in the brain through music that will eventually affect the client non-musically. As Michael Thaut put it: "The brain that engages in music is changed by engaging in music."&lt;ref name=Davis2008/&gt;{{rp|475}} NMT trains motor responses (i.e. tapping foot or fingers, head movement, etc.) to better help clients develop motor skills that help "entrain the timing of muscle activation patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Roth |first=Edward |title=Neurologic music therapy |url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/~eroth/NMT%20Overview.pdf |work=Academy of Neurologic Music Therapists, Western Michigan University |access-date=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The two fundamental types of music therapy==
There are two fundamental types of music therapy: 'receptive music therapy', and 'active music therapy', which is sometimes called 'expressive music therapy'. Active music therapy engages clients or patients in the act of making vocal or instrumental music. Receptive music therapy guides patients or clients in listening to live or recorded music.&lt;ref&gt;Grocke, D., and Wigram, T., Receptive methods in music therapy: Techniques and clinical applications for music therapy clinicians, educators, and students. London, England: Jessica Kingsley, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Receptive music therapy involves listening to recorded or live music selected by a therapist.&lt;ref name="Sys Rev of Older Adults"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=Hui-Chi |last2=Wang |first2=Hsiu-Hung |last3=Chou |first3=Fan-Hao |last4=Chen |first4=Kuei-Min |title=The Effect of Music Therapy on Cognitive Functioning Among Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |journal=Journal of the American Medical Directors Association |date=January 2015 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=71–77 |doi=10.1016/j.jamda.2014.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can improve mood, decrease stress, pain, anxiety level, and enhance relaxation. While it doesn't affect disease, for instance, it can help with coping skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stanczyk |first1=Malgorzata Monika |title=Music therapy in supportive cancer care |journal=Reports of Practical Oncology &amp; Radiotherapy |date=September 2011 |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=170–172 |doi=10.1016/j.rpor.2011.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children ==

=== Nordoff-Robbins ===
{{main|Nordoff-Robbins music therapy}}
[[Paul Nordoff]], a [[Juilliard School]] graduate and Professor of Music, was a pianist and composer who, upon seeing disabled children respond so positively to music, gave up his academic career to further investigate the possibility of music as a means for therapy. [[Clive Robbins]], a special educator, partnered with Nordoff for over 17 years in the exploration and research of music’s effects on disabled children—first in the United Kingdom, and then in the USA in the 1950s and 60s. Their pilot projects included placements at care units for autistic children and child psychiatry departments, where they put programs in place for children with mental disorders, emotional disturbances, developmental delays, and other handicaps. Their success at establishing a means of communication and relationship with autistic children at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] gave rise to the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s first grant given of this nature, and the 5-year study "Music therapy project for psychotic children under seven at the day care unit" involved research, publication, training and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aigen|first1=Kenneth|title=Being in Music: Foundations of Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy|date=2005|publisher=Barcelona Publishers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3BLAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9781891278372}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Several publications, including ''Therapy in Music for Handicapped Children'', ''Creative Music Therapy'', ''Music Therapy in Special Education'', as well as instrumental and song books for children, were released during this time. Nordoff and Robbins's success became known globally in the mental health community, and they were invited to share their findings and offer training on an international tour that lasted several years. Funds were granted to support the founding of the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordoff-robbins.org.uk/ Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; in Great Britain in 1974, where a one-year graduate program for students was implemented. In the early eighties, a center was opened in Australia, and various programs and institutes for music therapy were founded in Germany and other countries. In the United States, the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy was established at New York University in 1989.{{citation needed|reason=nothing questionable, but this is a long string of facts without any source listed. I wouldn't want to see this info deleted, just properly backed.|date=April 2016}}

The Nordoff-Robbins approach, based on the belief that everyone is capable of finding meaning in and benefitting from musical experience, is now practiced by hundreds of therapists internationally. It focuses on treatment through the creation of music by both therapist and client together. Various techniques are used to accommodate all capabilities so that even the most low functioning individuals are able to participate actively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nordoff-Robbins |url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/nordoff |website=NYU Steinhardt |publisher=New York University |access-date=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orff ===
{{see|Orff Schulwerk}}
Developed by Gertrude Orff at the Kindezentrum München, is another approach known as Orff Music Therapy. Both the clinical setting of social pediatrics as well as the [[Orff Schulwerk]] (schoolwork) approach in music education (developed by German composer [[Carl Orff]]) influence this method, which is used with children with developmental problems, delays and disabilities.&lt;ref name="Orff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voigt|first1=Melanie|title=Orff music therapy: an overview |journal=Voices: a world forum for music therapy |date=November 2003|volume=3|issue=3|doi=10.15845/voices.v3i3.134|url=https://voices.no/index.php/voices/article/view/134/110|access-date=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of social pediatrics was developed after the Second World War in Germany by Theodor Hellbrügge, who understood that medicine alone could not meet the complex needs of developmentally disabled children. He consulted psychologists, occupational therapists and other mental healthcare professionals whose knowledge and skills could aid in the diagnostics and treatment of children. Gertrude Orff was asked to develop a form of therapy based on the Orff Schulwerk approach to support the emotional development of patients. Elements found in both the music therapy and education approaches include the understanding of holistic music presentation as involving word, sound and movement; the use of both music and play improvisation as providing a creative stimulus for the child to investigate and explore; Orff instrumentation, including keyboard instruments and percussion instruments as a means of participation and interaction in a therapeutic setting; and lastly, the multisensory aspects of music used by the therapist to meet the particular needs of the child, such as both feeling and hearing sound.&lt;ref name="Orff" /&gt;

Corresponding with the attitudes of [[humanistic psychology]], the developmental potential of the child- as in the acknowledgement of their strengths as well as their handicaps, and the importance of the therapist- child relationship are central factors in Orff music therapy. Theoretical foundations are also influenced by the strong emphasis on social integration and the involvement of parents in the therapeutic process found in social paediatrics. Knowledge of developmental psychology puts into perspective how developmental disabilities influence the child, as do their social and familial environments. The basis for interaction in this method is known as ''responsive interaction'', in which the therapist meets the child at their level and responds according to their initiatives, combining both humanistic and developmental psychology philosophies. Involving the parents in this type of interaction, by having them participate directly or observe the therapist's techniques, equips the parents with ideas of how to interact appropriately with their child, thus fostering a positive parent-child relationship.&lt;ref name="Orff" /&gt;

=== Bonny method of guided imagery in music ===
:''Further information: [[Guided imagery]]''
Music educator and therapist Helen Lindquist Bonny (1921 – May 25, 2010) developed an approach influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychological views, known as the Bonny method of guided imagery in music (GIM). [[Guided imagery]] refers to a technique used in natural and alternative medicine that involves using mental imagery to help with the physiological and psychological ailments of patients.&lt;ref name="voices.no"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonny|first1=Helen L.|title=Music psychotherapy: guided imagery and music |journal=Voices: a world forum for music therapy |date=April 2001 |volume=10 |issue=3 |doi=10.15845/voices.v10i3.568 |url=https://voices.no/index.php/voices/article/view/568/437 |access-date=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioner often suggests a relaxing and focusing image and through the use of imagination and discussion, aims to find constructive solutions to manage their problems. Bonny applied this psychotherapeutic method to the field of music therapy by using music as the means of guiding the patient to a higher state of consciousness where healing and constructive self- awareness can take place. Music is considered a "co-therapist" because of its importance. GIM with children can be used in one-on-one or group settings, and involves relaxation techniques, identification and sharing of personal feeling states, and improvisation to discover the self, and foster growth. The choice of music is carefully selected for the client based on their musical preferences and the goals of the session. Usually a classical piece, it must reflect the age and attentional abilities of the child in length and genre, and a full explanation of the exercises must be offered at their level of understanding.&lt;ref name="voices.no" /&gt;

The use of guided imagery with autistic children has been found to decrease stereotypical behaviours and hyperactivity, increase attention and the ability to follow instructions, as well as increase self-initiated communication, both verbal and non-verbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kenneth E. |last1=Brescia |first2=Denise E. |last2=Grocke | name-list-format = vanc |title=Guided imagery and music: the Bonny method and beyond |date=2002 |publisher=Barcelona Publishers |isbn=9781891278129}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

== Characteristics of Music for Receptive Music Therapy ==
Bonny (Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music) writes a lot about the different features of music types in the classical genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Receptive Methods in Music Therapy : Techniques and Clinical Applications for Music Therapy Clinicians, Educators and Students|last=Grocke|first=Denise|last2=Wigram|first2=Tony|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=45–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical music can be multi-layered; melodic line, harmony structure and base line. All of these aspects work together with other things to create different layers of musical sound. Classical music is written in different forms: ternary form, sonata form, theme and variations, prelude and tone poem.

==== Ternary form ====
It is associated Baroque era. It is for therapy work; it forms a stable and safe musical container, where the repetition of the open section that is recognizable before the period of change.

==== Sonata Form ====
It is associated with the Classical and Romantic era. It is composed of three parts: introduction, exposition, development and recapitulation (which may be in code).

==== Theme and variations ====
It uses different eras of music composition. The melody may be played by different instruments; played in different register (high, medium, low). It might become elongated by making each note twice is original length or shortened by making each note half the length.

==== Prelude ====
It is a short piece for an orchestra that is already completed. The most receptive music therapy is Debussy's Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, also Faure's Pavane for a Dead Princess.

==== Tone poem ====
This one is also from Romantic Era and also in the 20th century. Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life) and Enchanted Lake are great examples of this.

=== New Age Music ===
New Age Music is the type of music that allows relaxation while drawing images like landscapes enhanced by computer generated sounds.  Kobialkais a type of new age music that produces large volume music that has violins playing over the background of synthesizes sounds. It's often very relaxing because the quality is seamless.

=== Celtic Music ===
This is average in character, and sometimes there are vocal selection involved in Celtic music, adding to the appeal of the song choice. An example would be the Watermark by Enya. 12 minutes maybe be able to cause deep relaxation.

=== Meditative Music ===
Meditative music has a diverse range of styles and instrumentation. Most of them have single-line melody of a wooden or pan-flute.

=== Trance Music ===
Trance Music is the type of music that many musical therapists who work with adolescent-aged clients. Trance is a style of electronic dance music that was created in 1990s, and it has a tempo of 130 and 160 bpm. Trance music enhances a feeling of calmness despite the rapid pace.

=== Jazz Music ===
Jazz Music came out in the early part of the twentieth, generally known as the music of black Americans. The blues is a slow kind of jazz music that is used gentle relaxation. Jazz music is a sedative in receptive music therapy methods. Examples would be I Got Rhythm by Louie Armstrong or In a Mellotone by Duke Ellington.

== Approaches used with adolescents ==

Music therapy may be used with adolescent populations to treat disorders usually diagnosed in adolescence, such as mood/anxiety disorders and eating disorders, or inappropriate behaviors, including suicide attempts, withdrawal from family, social isolation from peers, aggression, running away, and substance abuse.&lt;ref name=Yinger&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Olivia |last1=Swedberg Yinger |first2=Lori |last2=Gooding |title=Music Therapy and Music Medicine for Children and Adolescents |journal=Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics |publisher=Elsevier |date=July 2014 |volume=23 |pages=535–553 |doi=10.1016/j.chc.2013.03.003 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056499313000175 |access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keen&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alexander W. |last=Keen MSocSc |title=Using music as a therapy tool to motivate troubled adolescents |journal=Social work in health care |date=March 2005 |volume=39:3–4 |pages=361–373 |doi=10.1300/J010v39n03_09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goals in treating adolescents with music therapy, especially for those at high risk, often include: increased recognition and awareness of emotions and moods, improved decision-making skills, opportunities for creative self expression, decreased anxiety, increased self-confidence, improved self-esteem, and better listening skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Music Therapy with High Risk Adolescents (PDF) |url=https://msu.edu/~msuamtas/scott_handout.pdf |website=American Music Therapy Association, Michigan State University Chapter |publisher=Michigan State University |access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods ====

Two main methods for music therapy in this age group are group meetings and individual sessions. Both methods may include listening to music, discussions concerning moods and emotions in or toward music, analyzing the meanings of specific songs, writing lyrics, composing music, performing music, and musical improvisation.&lt;ref name=Keen/&gt;

Private individual sessions can provide personal attention and are most effective when the music used is preferred by the patient. Using music that an adolescent can relate to or connect with can be successful in helping adolescent patients view the therapist as a safe and trustworthy adult, and to engage in the therapeutic process with less resistance.&lt;ref name=Keen/&gt; Music therapy conducted in groups affords opportunities for an adolescent individual to feel a sense of belonging, to express their opinions, learn how to socialize and verbalize appropriately with peers, improve compromising skills, and develop tolerance and empathy.&lt;ref name=Yinger/&gt;  Group sessions emphasize cooperation and cohesion, and can be quite effective in working with adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bednarz LF, Nikkel B  | year = 1992 | title = The role of music therapy in the treatment of young adults diagnosed with mental illness and substance abuse | url = | journal = Music Therapy Perspectives | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 21–26 | doi=10.1093/mtp/10.1.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessment ===
Assessment includes obtaining a full medical history, musical (ability to duplicate a melody or identify changes in rhythm, etc.) and nonmusical functioning (social, physical/motor, emotional, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowe|first1=Barbara J.|title=Music Therapy for Children, Adolescents and Adults with Mental Disorders|date=2007|publisher=American Music Therapy Association, Inc.|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|isbn=1-884914-18-7|pages=201–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowe|first1=Barbara J.|title=Music Therapy for Children, Adolescents and Adults with Mental Disorders|date=2007|publisher=American Music Therapy Association, Inc.|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|isbn=1-884914-18-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In infants born prematurely ====
[[Preterm birth|Premature infants]] are those born at 37 weeks or less gestational stage. They are subject to numerous health risks, such as abnormal breathing patterns, decreased body fat and muscle tissue, as well as feeding issues. The coordination for sucking and breathing is often not fully developed, making feeding a challenge. The improved developmental activity and behavioural status of premature infants when they are discharged from the NICU, is directly related to the stimulation programs and interventions they benefited from during hospitalization, such as music therapy.

Music is typically conducted by a musical therapist in the [[neonatal intensive care unit]] (NICU), with five main techniques designed to benefit premature infants:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Anthony|title=Developments in Music Therapy Practices: Case Study Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Barcelona Publishers|location=New Hampshire|isbn=978-1-891278-75-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}
# '''Live or recorded music''': Live or recorded music has been effective in promoting respiratory regularity and oxygen saturation levels, as well as decreasing signs of neonatal distress. Since premature infants have sensitive and immature sensory modalities, music is often performed in a gentle and controlled environment, either in the form of audio recordings or live vocalization, although live singing has been shown to have a greater effect. Live music also reduces the physiological responses in parents. Studies have shown that by combining live music, such as harp music, with the [[Kangaroo care|Kangaroo Care]], maternal anxiety is reduced. This allows for parents, especially mothers, to spend important time bonding with their premature infants. Female singing voices are also more effective at soothing premature infants. Despite being born premature, infants show a preference for the sound of a female singing voice, making it more beneficial than instrumental music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schlez A, Litmanovitz I, Bauer S, Dolfin T, Regev R, Arnon S | title = Combining kangaroo care and live harp music therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit setting | journal = The Israel Medical Association Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 354–8 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21809733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Promotion of healthy sucking reflex''': By using a [[Pacifier-activated lullaby|pacifier-activated lullaby device]], music therapists can help promote stronger sucking reflexes, while also reducing pain perception for the infant. The Gato Box is a small rectangular instrument that stimulates a prenatal heartbeat sound in a soft and rhythmic manner that has also been effective in aiding sucking behaviours.&lt;ref name="gato-pbs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loewy|first1=Dr. Joanne|title=Music and Medicine: Music Therapy for Infants|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/musicinstinct/video/music-and-medicine/music-therapy-for-infants/76/|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} The music therapist uses their fingers to tap on the drum, rather than using a mallet. The rhythm supports movement when feeding and promotes healthy sucking patterns. By improving sucking patterns, babies are able to coordinate the important dual mechanisms of breathing, sucking and swallowing needed to feed, thus promoting growth and weight gain. When this treatment proves effective, infants are able to leave the hospital earlier.
# '''Multimodal stimulation and music''': By combining music, such as lullabies, and multimodal stimulation, premature infants were discharged from the NICU sooner, than those infants who did not receive therapy. Multimodal stimulation (MMS) includes the applications of auditory, tactile, vestibular, and visual stimulation that helps aid in premature infant development. The combination of music and MMS helps premature infants sleep and conserve vital energy required to gain weight more rapidly. Studies have shown that girls respond more positively than boys during multimodal stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Standley|first1=JM|title=The effect of music and multimodal stimulation on responses of premature infants in neonatal intensive care|journal=Paediatric Nursing|date=1998|volume=6|issue=24|pages=532–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the voice is a popular choice for parents looking to bond with their premature infants, other effective instruments include the Remo Ocean Disk and the Gato Box. Both are used to stimulate the sounds of the womb. The Remo Ocean Disk, a round musical instrument that mimics the fluid sounds of the womb, has been shown to benefit decreased heart rate after therapeutic uses, as well as promoting healthy sleep patterns, lower respiratory rates and improve sucking behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Florida Hospital Medical Centre|title=Music Therapists|url=https://www.floridahospital.com/children/experience/who-you-meet/music-therapists |publisher=Florida Hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}
# '''Infant stimulation''': This type of intervention uses musical stimulation to compensate for the lack of normal environmental sensory stimulation found in the NICU. The sound environment the NICU provides can be disruptive; however, music therapy can mask unwanted auditory stimuli and promote a calm environment that reduces the complications for high-risk or [[Failure to thrive|failure-to-thrive]] infants. Parent-infant bonding can also be affected by the noise of the NICU, which in turn can delay the interactions between parents and their premature infants. But music therapy creates a relaxed and peaceful environment for parents to speak and spend time with their babies while incubated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krueger C, Horesh E, Crossland BA | title = Safe sound exposure in the fetus and preterm infant | journal = Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–70 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22834845 | pmc = 3665292 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.2012.01342.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Parent-infant bonding''': Therapists work with parents so they may perform infant-directed singing techniques, as well as home care. Singing [[Lullaby|lullabies]] therapeutically can promote relaxation and decrease heart rate in premature infants. By calming premature babies, it allows for them to preserve their energy, which creates a stable environment for growth. Lullabies, such as "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" or other culturally relevant lullabies, have been shown to greatly soothe babies. These techniques can also improve overall sleep quality, caloric intake and feeding behaviours, which aid in development of the baby while they are still in the NICU. Singing has also shown greater results in improving oxygen saturation levels for infants while incubated than has mothers' speech alone. This technique promoted high levels of oxygen for longer periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Standley JM, Moore RS | title = Therapeutic effects of music and mother's voice on premature infants | journal = Pediatric Nursing | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 509–12, 574 | date = 1995 | pmid = 8700604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In children ====

Music therapy has multiple benefits which contribute to the maintenance of health and the drive toward [[physical rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] for children. Advanced technology that can monitor cortical activity offers a look at how music engages and produces changes in the brain during the perception and production of musical stimuli. Music therapy, when used with other rehabilitation methods, has increased the success rate of sensorimotor, cognitive, and communicative rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LaGasse|first1=A. Blythe|last2=Thaut|first2=Michael H. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Music and Rehabilition:Neurological Approaches|journal=Music, health, and wellbeing.|date=April 15, 2012|pages=153–163|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586974.003.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Music therapy intervention programs can include an average of 18 sessions of treatment. The achievement of a physical rehabilitation goal relies on the child's existing motivation and feelings towards music and their commitment to engage in meaningful, rewarding efforts. Regaining full functioning also confides in the prognosis of recovery, the condition of the client, and the environmental resources available.  Both techniques use systematic processes where the therapists assist the client by using musical experiences and connections that collaborate as a dynamic force of change toward rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=Paul|last2=Ramsey|first2=David | name-list-format = vanc | title=Music therapy in physical medicine and rehabilitation.|journal=Australian Occupational Therapy Journal|date= November 15, 2012|pages=111–118|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1630.2000.00215.x|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has many calming and soothing properties that can be used as a sedative in rehabilitation. For example, a patient with chronic pain may decrease the physiological result of stress and draw attention away from the pain by focusing on music.&lt;ref name="Singamore Publishing"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Barksdale|first1 = Alicia L.|title = [[Music Therapy and Leisure for Persons with Disabilities]]|location = United States |publisher = [[Singamore Publishing]]|page = 13 |date = April 16, 2004|isbn = 1-57167-511-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self published inline|date=November 2017}}

Music therapy used in child rehabilitation has had a substantial emphasis on sensorimotor development including; balance and position, locomotion, agility, mobility, range of motion, strength, laterality and directionality.&lt;ref name="Singamore Publishing" /&gt;{{self published inline|date=November 2017}}  Music motivate and can be an element of distraction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;  Rhythmic stimuli has been found to help balance training for those with a brain injury.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Singing is a form of rehabilitation for neurological impairments. Neurological impairments following a brain injury can be in the form of [[apraxia]] – loss to perform purposeful movements, [[dysarthria]], muscle control disturbances (due to damage of the central nervous system), [[aphasia]] (defect in expression causing distorted speech), or language comprehension. Singing training has been found to improve lung, speech clarity, and coordination of speech muscles, thus, accelerating rehabilitation of such neurological impairments. For example, [[melodic intonation therapy]] is the practice of communicating with others by singing to enhance speech or increase speech production by promoting socialization, and emotional expression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Music therapy is thought to be helpful with children with [[autism spectrum]] by providing repetitive stimuli which aim to "teach" the brain other possible ways to respond that might be more useful as they grow older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Music Therapy, Sensory Integration and the Autistic Child | first = Dorita S. | last = Berger | name-list-format = vanc | location=Philadelphia |publisher=Berger |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self published inline|date=November 2017}}

== Older adults ==
== Medical disorders ==

=== Heart disease ===
According to a 2013 Cochrane review, listening to music may improve heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure in those with [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD).&lt;ref name=Bradt2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bradt J, Dileo C, Potvin N | title = Music for stress and anxiety reduction in coronary heart disease patients | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD006577 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24374731 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006577.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dementia ===
{{main|Music therapy for Alzheimer's disease}}
Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia are among the disorders most commonly treated with music therapy. Like many of the other disorders mentioned, some of the most common significant effects are seen in social behaviors, leading to improvements in interaction, conversation, and other such skills. A meta-study of over 330 subjects showed music therapy produces highly significant improvements to social behaviors, overt behaviors like wandering and restlessness, reductions in agitated behaviors, and improvements to cognitive defects, measured with reality orientation and face recognition tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koger SM, Chapin K, Brotons M | title = Is Music Therapy an Effective Intervention for Dementia?A Meta-Analytic Review of Literature | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–15 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10519841 | doi = 10.1093/jmt/36.1.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many studies of MT's effectiveness, these positive effects on Alzheimer's and other dementias are not homogeneous among all studies. The effectiveness of the treatment seems to be strongly dependent on the patient, the quality and length of treatment, and other similar factors.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 2004 3–12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherratt K, Thornton A, Hatton C | title = Music interventions for people with dementia: a review of the literature | journal = Aging &amp; Mental Health | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14690862 | doi = 10.1080/13607860310001613275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meta-study examined the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapy's effects on these patients. Many authors suspect that music has a soothing effect on the patient by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous noise in their environment. Others suggest that music serves as a sort of mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.&lt;ref name="Sherratt 2004 3–12" /&gt;

=== Aphasia ===
{{main|Music therapy for non-fluent aphasia}}
Melodic intonation therapy (MIT) is a method used by music therapists and [[speech-language pathology|speech-language pathologists]] to help people with [[communication disorders]] caused by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain by engaging the singing abilities and possibly engaging language-capable regions in the undamaged right hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Manasco/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Broca’s aphasia, or non-fluent aphasia, is a language disorder caused by damage to Broca’s area and surrounding regions in the left frontal lobe. &lt;ref&gt;Bates, E., Wilson, S. M., Saygin, A. P., Dick, F., Sereno, M. I., Frank, R. T., &amp; Dronkers, N. F. 
(2003). Voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping. Nature Neuroscience,6, 448-450. doi:10.3897/bdj.4.e7720.figure2f
&lt;/ref&gt; Those with non-fluent aphasia are able to understand language fairly well, but they struggle with language production and syntax. &lt;ref&gt;Kolk, H., &amp; Heeschen, C. (1990). Adaptation symptoms and impairment symptoms in Brocas 
aphasia. Aphasiology,4(3), 221-231. doi:10.1080/02687039008249075&lt;/ref&gt; 

While unable to speak fluently, patients with non-fluent aphasia are often able to sing words, phrases, and even sentences they cannot express otherwise. &lt;ref&gt;Van Der Meulen, I., Van De Sandt-Koenderman, M.

Frontiers in human neuroscience, 10, 533. doi:10.3389/fnhum.2016.00533&lt;/ref&gt; MIT harnesses the singing ability of patients with non-fluent aphasia as a means to improve their communication. Although its exact nature depends on the therapist, in general MIT relies on the use of intonation (the rising and falling of the voice) and rhythm (beat/speed) to train patients to produce phrases verbally. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In MIT, common words and phrases are turned into melodic phrases, generally starting with two step sing-song patterns and eventually emulating typical speech intonation and rhythmic patterns.&lt;ref name=Manasco&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manasco |first1=Hunter |title=Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders |date=2013 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |isbn=9780763794170 |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6ev-RBNEHYC&amp;pg=PA93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A therapist will usually begin by introducing an intonation to their patient through humming. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; They will accompany this humming with a rhythm produced by the tapping of the left hand. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the therapist will introduce a visual stimuli of the written phrase to be learned. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The therapist then sings the phrase with the patient, and ideally the patient is eventually able to sing the phrase on their own. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; With much repetition and through a process of “inner-rehearsal” (practicing internally hearing one’s voice singing), a patient may eventually be able to produce the phrase verbally without singing. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the patient advances in therapy, the procedure can be adapted to give them more autonomy and to teach them more complex phrases. &lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of MIT, a non-fluent aphasic patient can be taught numerous phrases which aid them to communicate and function during daily life. 

The mechanisms of this success are yet to be fully understood. It is commonly agreed that while speech is lateralized mostly to the left hemisphere (for right-handed and most left-handed individuals), some speech functionality is also distributed in the right hemisphere. &lt;ref&gt;Dykova, G. M., Glozman, Z. M., Titova, E. Y., Krishev, E. S., &amp; Gamaleya, A. A. (2010). Speech disorders in right-hemisphere stroke. Neuroscience Behavior Physiology, 40(6), 593-602. doi:10.3897/bdj.4.e7720.figure2f&lt;/ref&gt; MIT is thought to stimulate these right language areas through the activation of music processing areas also in the right hemisphere &lt;ref&gt;Zumbansen, A., Peretz, I., &amp; Hébert, S. (2014). Melodic intonation therapy: back to basics for future research. Frontiers in neurology, 5, 7. doi:10.3389/fneur.2014.00007&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the rhythmic tapping of the left hand stimulates the right sensorimotor cortex in order to further engage the right hemisphere in language production. &lt;ref&gt;Zumbansen, A., Peretz, I., &amp; Hébert, S. (2014). Melodic intonation therapy: back to basics for future research. Frontiers in neurology, 5, 7. doi:10.3389/fneur.2014.00007&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, by stimulating the right hemisphere during language tasks, therapists hope to decrease dependence on the left hemisphere for language production.&lt;ref name=Norton2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton A, Zipse L, Marchina S, Schlaug G | title = Melodic intonation therapy: shared insights on how it is done and why it might help | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | pages = 431–6 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19673819 | pmc = 2780359 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04859.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While results are somewhat contradictory, studies have in fact found increased right hemispheric activation in non-fluent aphasic patients after MIT.&lt;ref&gt;Zumbansen, A., Peretz, I., &amp; Hébert, S. (2014). Melodic intonation therapy: back to basics for future research. Frontiers in neurology, 5, 7. doi:10.3389/fneur.2014.00007&lt;/ref&gt; This change in activation has been interpreted as evidence of decreased dependence on the left hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Zumbansen, A., Peretz, I., &amp; Hébert, S. (2014). Melodic intonation therapy: back to basics for future research. Frontiers in neurology, 5, 7. doi:10.3389/fneur.2014.00007&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate, however, if changes in right hemispheric activation are part of the therapeutic process during/after MIT, or are simply a side effect of non-fluent aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;Belin, P., Zilbovicius, M., Remy, P., Francois, C., Guillaume, S., Chain, F., ...Samson, Y. 
(1996). Recovery from nonfluent aphasia after melodic intonation therapy: A PET study. Neurology,47(6), 1504-1511. doi:10.1212/wnl.47.6.1504&lt;/ref&gt; In hopes of making MIT more effective, researchers are continually studying the mechanisms of MIT and non-fluent aphasia.

Neurological researchers Sparks, Helm, and Albert developed MIT in 1973.&lt;ref name=Manasco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albert ML, Sparks RW, Helm NA | title = Melodic intonation therapy for aphasia | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 130–1 | date = August 1973 | pmid = 4717723 | doi = 10.1001/archneur.1973.00490260074018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychiatric disorders ==

A 2016 meta-analysis-analysis on the use of music therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia found that the treatment effect was significantly better in the patients who received adjunct music therapy than in those who did not, in negative symptoms, mood symptoms, and also positive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tseng PT, Chen YW, Lin PY, Tu KY, Wang HY, Cheng YS, Chang YC, Chang CH, Chung W, Wu CK | title = Significant treatment effect of adjunct music therapy to standard treatment on the positive, negative, and mood symptoms of schizophrenic patients: a meta-analysis | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 16 | pages = 16 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26812906 | pmc = 4728768 | doi = 10.1186/s12888-016-0718-8 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-016-0718-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 Cochrane review found that moderate- to low-quality evidence suggests that music therapy as an addition to standard care improves the global state, mental state (including negative and general symptoms), social functioning, and quality of life of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders. However, effects were inconsistent across studies and depended on the number of music therapy sessions as well as the quality of the music therapy provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geretsegger M, Mössler KA, Bieleninik Ł, Chen XJ, Heldal TO, Gold C | title = Music therapy for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | pages = CD004025 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28553702 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004025.pub4 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD004025/SCHIZ_music-therapy-schizophrenia-or-schizophrenia-disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage by region ==

=== Africa ===

In 1999, the first program for music therapy in Africa opened in Pretoria, South Africa. Research has shown that in Tanzania patients can receive palliative care for life-threatening illnesses directly after the diagnosis of these illnesses. This is different from many Western countries, because they reserve palliative care for patients who have an incurable illness. Music is also viewed differently between Africa and Western countries. In Western countries and a majority of other countries throughout the world, music is traditionally seen as entertainment whereas in many African cultures, music is used in recounting stories, celebrating life events, or sending messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Ruth|title=Music in West Africa : Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Australia ===
One of the first groups known to heal with sound were the aboriginal people of Australia. The modern name of their healing tool is the didgeridoo, but it was originally called the yidaki. The yidaki produced sounds that are similar to the sound healing techniques used in modern day. For at least 40,000 years, the healing tool was believed to assist in healing "broken bones, muscle tears and illnesses of every kind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stuart-Reid|first1=Annaliese and John|title=Sound Healing- Ancient Sounds|url=http://www.tokenrock.com/sound_healing/sounds_of_the_ancients.php|website=Token Rock|publisher=TokenRock|access-date=05/08/2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, here are no reliable sources stating the didgeridoo's exact age. Archaeological studies of [[rock art]] in Northern Australia suggest that the people of the [[Kakadu National Park|Kakadu]] region of the [[Northern Territory]] have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls and shelters from this period. A clear rock painting in Ginga Wardelirrhmeng, on the northern edge of the [[Arnhem Land]] plateau, from the freshwater period&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120421050045/http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/kakadu/culture-history/art/styles.html Kakadu National Park – Rock art styles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (that had begun 1500 years ago)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last1= Sayers  |first1= Andrew  |author-link1=  |year= 2001 |origyear= 2001 |title= Australian Art (Oxford History of Art) |type= paperback |series= Oxford History of Art |publisher= Oxford University Press, USA |publication-date= 19 July 2001 |page= 19  |isbn= 978-0192842145}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a didgeridoo player and two songmen participating in an Ubarr Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Chaloupka]], ''Journey in Time'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
Australia in 1949, music therapy (not clinical music therapy as understood today) was started through concerts organized by the Australian Red Cross along with a Red Cross Music Therapy Committee. The key Australian body, the [[Australian Music Therapy Association]] (AMTA), was founded in 1975.

===Canada===
In 1956, Fran Herman, one of Canada's music therapy pioneers, began a 'remedial music' program at the Home For Incurable Children, now known as the [[Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital]], in Toronto. Her group 'The Wheelchair Players' continued until 1964, and is considered to be the first music therapy group project in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voices.no/mainissues/mi40009000311.php Voices: Fran Herman, Music Therapist in Canada for over 50 years]&lt;/ref&gt; Its production "The Emperor's Nightingale" was the subject of a documentary film.

Composer/pianist Alfred Rosé, a professor at the [[University of Western Ontario]], also pioneered the use of music therapy in [[London, Ontario]] at Westminster Hospital in 1952 and at the London Psychiatric Hospital in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alfred-rose-emc/ Canadian Encyclopedia: Alfred Rosé]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other music therapy programs were initiated during the 1950s; one by Norma Sharpe at St. Thomas Psychiatric Hospital in [[St. Thomas, Ontario]], and the other by Thérèse Pageau at the Hôpital St-Jean-de-Dieu (now Hôpital Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine) in [[Montreal]].

A conference in August 1974, organized by Norma Sharpe and six other music therapists, led to the founding of the Canadian Music Therapy Association, which was later renamed the Canadian Association for Music Therapy (CAMT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/music-therapy-emc/ Canadian Encyclopedia: Music Therapy]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the organization had over 500 members.

Canada's first music therapy training program was founded in 1976, at Capilano College (now [[Capilano University]]) in [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]], by Nancy McMaster and Carolyn Kenny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002520 Canadian Encyclopedia: Music Therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway is widely{{peacock term|date=November 2017}} recognised as an important country for music therapy research. Its two major research centres are the Center for Music and Health&lt;ref&gt;http://nmh.no/en/research/centre_for_music_and_health&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Norwegian Academy of Music]] in [[Oslo]], and the [[Grieg Academy]] Centre for Music Therapy (GAMUT),&lt;ref&gt;http://uni.no/nb/uni-helse/gamut/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[University of Bergen]]. The former was mostly developed by professor Even Ruud, while professor Brynjulf Stige is largely responsible for cultivating the latter. The centre in [[Bergen]] has 18 staff, including 2 professors and 4 associate professors, as well as lecturers and PhD students. Two of the field's major international research journals are based in Bergen: ''[[Nordic Journal for Music Therapy]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rnjm20/current&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Voices: A World Forum for Music Therapy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://voices.no/index.php/voices&lt;/ref&gt; Norway's main contribution to the field is mostly in the area of "community music therapy", which tends to be as much oriented toward [[social work]] as individual [[psychotherapy]], and music therapy research from this country uses a wide variety of methods to examine diverse methods across an array of social contexts, including community centres, medical clinics, retirement homes, and prisons.

=== United States ===
Music therapy has existed in its current form in the [[United States]] since 1944 when the first undergraduate degree program in the world was begun at [[Michigan State University]] and the first graduate degree program was established at the [[University of Kansas]]. The American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) was founded in 1998 as a merger between the National Association for Music Therapy (NAMT, founded in 1950) and the American Association for Music Therapy (AAMT, founded in 1971). Numerous other national organizations exist, such as the [[Institute for Music and Neurologic Function]], [[Nordoff-Robbins]] Center For Music Therapy, and the Association for Music and Imagery. Music therapists use ideas from different disciplines such as speech and language, [[physical therapy]], [[medicine]], [[nursing]], and [[education]].

A music therapy degree candidate can earn an undergraduate, master's or doctoral degree in music therapy. Many AMTA approved programs offer equivalency and certificate degrees in music therapy for students that have completed a degree in a related field. Some practicing music therapists have held [[PhD]]s in fields other than, but usually related to, music therapy. Recently, Temple University established a PhD program in music therapy. A music therapist typically incorporates music therapy techniques with broader clinical practices such as psychotherapy, rehabilitation, and other practices depending on client needs. Music therapy services rendered within the context of a social service, educational, or health care agency are often reimbursable by insurance and sources of funding for individuals with certain needs. Music therapy services have been identified as reimbursable under [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], private insurance plans and federal and state government programs.

A degree in music therapy requires proficiency in guitar, piano, voice, music theory, music history, reading music, improvisation, as well as varying levels of skill in assessment, documentation, and other counseling and health care skills depending on the focus of the particular university's program. A music therapist may hold the designations CMT (Certified Music Therapist), ACMT (Advanced Certified Music Therapist), or RMT (Registered Music Therapist) – credentials previously conferred by the former national organizations AAMT and NAMT ; these credentials remain in force through 2020 and have not been available since 1998. The current credential available is MT-BC. To become board certified, a music therapist must complete a music therapy degree from an accredited AMTA program at a college or university, successfully complete a music therapy internship, and pass the Board Certification Examination in Music Therapy, administered through The Certification Board for Music Therapists. To maintain the credential, either 100 units of continuing education must be completed every five years, or the board exam must be retaken near the end of the five-year cycle. The units claimed for credit fall under the purview of the Certification Board for Music Therapists.
North Dakota, Nevada and Georgia have established licenses for music therapists. In the State of New York, the License for Creative Arts Therapies (LCAT) incorporates the music therapy credentials within their licensure.

=== Lebanon ===
In 2006, Hamda Farhat introduced music therapy to Lebanon, developing and inventing therapeutic methods such as [[the triple method]] to treat hyperactivity, depression, anxiety, addiction, and post traumatic stress disorder. She has met with great success in working with many international organizations, and in the training of therapists, educators, and doctors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016|reason=This is important information, and I want to keep it for a global perspective.

=== United Kingdom ===
Live music was used in hospitals after both World Wars as part of the treatment program for recovering soldiers. Clinical music therapy in Britain as it is understood today was pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by French cellist [[Juliette Alvin]] whose influence on the current generation of British music therapy lecturers remains strong. [[Mary Priestley]], one of Juliette Alvin's students, created "analytical music therapy". The [[Nordoff-Robbins]] approach to music therapy developed from the work of [[Paul Nordoff]] and Clive Robbins in the 1950/60s.

Practitioners are registered with the Health Professions Council and, starting from 2007, new registrants must normally hold a master's degree in music therapy. There are master's level programs in music therapy in [[Manchester]], [[Bristol]], [[Cambridge]], [[University of South Wales|South Wales]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[London]], and there are therapists throughout the UK. The professional body in the UK is the British Association for Music Therapy&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bamt.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the World Congress of Music Therapy, coordinated and promoted by the [[World Federation of Music Therapy]], was held in [[Oxford]] on the theme of Dialogue and Debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musictherapyworld.de/modules/wfmt/wfmtoxford2002.htm "Proceedings from the WFMT World Conference in Oxford, UK, 23–28 July 2002"]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Dr. Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues again found that music therapy helped the outcomes of [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Talwar N, Crawford MJ, Maratos A, Nur U, McDermott O, Procter S | title = Music therapy for in-patients with schizophrenia: exploratory randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 189 | issue = 5 | pages = 405–9 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17077429 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.105.015073 | url = http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/189/5/405 | quote = Music therapy may provide a means of improving mental health among people with schizophrenia, but its effects in acute psychoses have not been explored }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/news/p60111_1/ "Music therapy may improve schizophrenia symptoms"], Faculty of Medicine News, Imperial College, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of musical therapy in India, can be traced back to ancient Hindu mythology, Vedic texts, and local folk traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Patricia|last2=Cook|first2=Pat|title=Sacred Music Therapy in North India|date=1997|publisher=VWB|isbn=978-3-86135-704-9|pages=61–83|edition=Vol. 39|jstor=41699130}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very possible that music therapy has been used for hundreds of years in the Indian culture.

The "Indian Association of Music Therapy" was established in 2010 by Dr. Dinesh C. Sharma with a motto "to use pleasant sounds in a specific manner like drug in due course of time as green medicine"&lt;ref name="iamt.net.in"&gt;http://www.iamt.net.in/&lt;/ref&gt; He also publish a journal "International Journal of Music Therapy (ISSN 2249-8664) to popularize and promote music therapy research on international platform&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iamt.net.in/iamt/login.php?urlID=IJMT&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Music]] has been used as a healing implement for centuries.&lt;ref name="Misic, P. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Misic | first1 = P. | last2 = Arandjelovic | first2 = D. | last3 = Stanojkovic | first3 = S. | last4 = Vladejic | first4 = S. | last5 = Mladenovic | first5 = J. | year = 2010 | title = Music Therapy | url = | journal = European Psychiatry | volume = 1 | issue = 25| page = 839 | doi=10.1016/s0924-9338(10)70830-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollo]] is the ancient Greek god of music and of medicine. [[Aesculapius]] was said to cure diseases of the mind by using song and music, and music therapy was used in Egyptian temples. [[Plato]] said that music affected the emotions and could influence the character of an individual. [[Aristotle]] taught that music affects the soul and described music as a force that purified the emotions. [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] advocated the sound of cymbals and running water for the treatment of mental disorders. Music therapy was practiced in the Bible when David played the harp to rid King Saul of a bad spirit (1 Sam 16:23).&lt;ref name="HowellsOsborn1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howells|first1=John G.|last2=Osborn|first2=M.

Early Modern Medical Explanations for Music’s Effects », in Veit Erlmann (dir.), ''Hearing Cultures. Essays on Sound, Listening and Modernity'', Oxford / New York, Berg Publishers, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] wrote in the 17th century in his classic work, ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'', that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10800/10800-8.txt The Anatomy of Melancholy]'', Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3480, "Music a Remedy": "But to leave all declamatory speeches in praise [3481]of divine music, I will confine myself to my proper subject: besides that excellent power it hath to expel many other diseases, it is a sovereign remedy against [3482] despair and melancholy, and will drive away the devil himself. Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, in [3483] Philostratus, when Apollonius was inquisitive to know what he could do with his pipe, told him, 'That he would make a melancholy man merry, and him that was merry much merrier than before, a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.' Ismenias the Theban, [3484] Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now they do those, saith [3485] Bodine, that are troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.mun.ca/munmed/84/crellin.htm "Humanities are the Hormones: A Tarantella Comes to Newfoundland.

The rise of an understanding of the body and mind in terms of the nervous system led to the emergence of a new wave of music therapy in the eighteenth century. Earlier works on the subject, such as [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''Musurgia universalis'' of 1650 and even early eighteenth-century books such as Michael Ernst Ettmüller's 1714 ''Disputatio effectus musicae in hominem'' (Disputation on the Effect of Music on Man) or Friedrich Erhardt Niedten's 1717 ''Veritophili'', still tended to discuss the medical effects of music in terms of bringing the soul and body into harmony. But from the mid-eighteenth century works on the subject such as Richard Brocklesby's 1749 ''Reflections of Antient and Modern Musick'', the 1737 ''Memoires'' of the French Academy of Sciences, or [[Ernst Anton Nicolai]]'s 1745 ''Die Verbindung der Musik mit der Arzneygelahrheit'' (The Connection of Music to Medicine), stressed the power of music over the nerves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hearing Cultures: Essays on Sound, Listening and Modernity|last = Gouk|first = Penelope | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 87–105|editor-last = Erlmann|url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1800 books on music therapy often drew on the [[Brunonian system of medicine]], arguing that the stimulation of the nerves caused by music could directly improve health. For example, Peter Lichtenthal's influential 1807 book ''Der musikalische Arzt'' (The Musical Doctor) was also explicitly Brunonian in its treatment of the effects of music on the body. Lichtenthal, a musician, composer and physician with links to the Mozart family, was mostly positive about music, talking of 'doses of music', which should be determined by someone who knows the "Brunonian scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Der musikalische Arzt|last = Lichtenthal|first = Peter|publisher = |year = 1807|isbn = |location = Vienna|page = 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music therapy as we know it began in the aftermath of World Wars I and II, when, particularly in the United Kingdom, musicians would travel to hospitals and play music for soldiers suffering from war-related emotional and physical trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Degmecic | first1 = Dunja | last2 = Požgain | first2 = Ivan | last3 = Filakovic | first3 = Pavo | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2005 | title = Music as Therapy | url = | journal = International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as recent as 2017, music therapy has shown the ability to provide emotional relief to the members of our society. With Logic's "1-800-273-8255", suicide prevention calls experienced a 33% growth in relation to their number of calls received in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/08/25/health/logic-suicide-hotline-vma-18002738255/index.html|title=Calls to suicide prevention hotline spike after VMA performance|work=CNN|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military ==
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]

=== History ===
Music therapy finds its roots in the military. The [[United States Department of War]] issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which described the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;"Technical Bulletin 187: Music in Reconditioning in American Service Forces Convalescent and General Hospitals". ''War Department Technical Bulletin'' (TB Med) 187 (1945): 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following [[World War II]] and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the [[Surgeon General of the United States]]. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal of the study was to understand whether “music presented according to a specific plan” influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rorke MA | year = 1996 | title = Music and the Wounded of World War II. | url = | journal = Journal of Music Therapy | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 189–207 | doi=10.1093/jmt/33.3.189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.

The first university sponsored music therapy course was taught by Margaret Anderton in 1919 at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, E. J.; I. K. Funk; W.S. Woods; A.S. Draper; and W. J. Funk. "Columbia University to Heal Wounded by Music". ''Literary Digest'' (1919): 59–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderton's clinical specialty was working with wounded Canadian soldiers during World War II, using music-based services to aid in their recovery process.

Today, [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] have both presented an array of injuries; however, the two signature injuries are [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) and [[Traumatic Brain Injury]] (TBI). These two signature injuries are increasingly common among millennial military service members and in music therapy programs.

=== Methods ===
Music therapists work with active duty military personnel, veterans, service members in transition, and their families. Music therapists strive to engage clients in music experiences that foster trust and complete participation over the course of their treatment process. Music therapists use an array of music-centered tools, techniques, and activities when working with military-associated clients, many of which are similar to the techniques used in other music therapy settings. These methods include, but are not limited to: group drumming, listening, singing, and songwriting. Songwriting is a particularly effective tool with military veterans struggling with PTSD and TBI as it creates a safe space to, "... work through traumatic experiences, and transform traumatic memories into healthier associations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amir | first1 = Dorit | year = 2004 | title = Giving Trauma a Voice: The Role of Improvisational Music Therapy in Exposing, Dealing with and Healing a Traumatic Experience of Sexual Abuse | url = | journal = Music Therapy Perspectives | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 96–103 | doi=10.1093/mtp/22.2.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Programs ===
Music therapy in the military is seen in programs on military bases, VA healthcare facilities, military treatment facilities, and military communities. Music therapy programs have a large outreach because they exist for all phases of military life: pre-mobilization, deployment, post-deployment, recovery (in the case of injury), and among families of fallen military service personnel.&lt;ref name="AMTA"&gt;[http://www.musictherapy.org/assets/1/7/MusicTherapyMilitaryPops_2014.pdf "Music Therapy and Military Populations"]. American Music Therapy Association, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Resounding Joy, Inc., a San Diego, California-based music therapy program, is a pioneer for the use of music therapy in the military. Its Semper Sound program specializes in providing music therapy services to active duty military service members and veterans diagnosed with PTSD, TBI, substance abuse, and other trauma-related diagnoses. It features different programs such as The Semper Sound Band, based in San Diego, California, and the GI Jams Band, based in Chelsea, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resoundingjoyinc.org/semper-sound/ "Resounding Joy Inc."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Reed Army Medical Center located in Bethesda, Maryland, is another pioneer for the use of music therapy in the military. All patients at the medical center are eligible to receive music therapy services; therefore, the range of clients is wide: TBI, stroke, psychological diagnoses (anxiety, depression, PTSD), autism spectrum disorder, and more.&lt;ref name="AMTA" /&gt;

The [[Exceptional Family Member Program]] (EFMP) also exists to provide music therapy services to active duty military families who have a family member with a developmental, physical, emotional, or intellectual disorder. Currently, programs at the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Resounding Joy, Inc., and the [[Music Institute of Chicago]] partner with EFMP services to provide music therapy services to eligible military family members.&lt;ref name="AMTA" /&gt;

[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech was one of the 50 recordings added on the first year of existence of the United States National Recording Registry.]]
The '''National Recording Registry''' is a list of sound recordings that "are culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States." The registry was established by the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000,&lt;ref name="NRPB"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-home.html |publisher=[[The Library of Congress]] |title= Current Registry |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created the [[National Recording Preservation Board]], whose members are appointed by the [[Librarian of Congress]]. The recordings preserved in the United States National Recording Registry form a registry of [[Sound recording and reproduction|recording]]s selected yearly by the [[National Recording Preservation Board]] for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-home.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= Current Registry |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislative intent of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000 was to develop a national program to guard America's [[sound recording]] heritage. The Act resulted in the formations of the National Recording Registry, The National Recording Preservation Board and a fund-raising foundation to aid their efforts.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-about.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= Overview |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=February 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act established the Registry specifically for the purpose of maintaining and preserving sound recordings and collections of sound recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&lt;ref name="NRPB"/&gt; Beginning in 2002, the National Recording Preservation Board began selecting nominated recordings each year to be preserved.

The first four yearly lists each included 50 selections. However, since 2006, 25 recordings have been selected annually. Thus, a total of 500 recordings have been preserved in the Registry {{as of|2017|lc=on}}. Each calendar year, public nominations are accepted for inclusion in that year's list of selections to be announced the following spring. Nominations are made in the following categories:

{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Blues
* Broadway/Musical Theatre/Soundtrack
* Cajun/Zydeco/"Swamp"
* Children's recordings
* Choral
* Classical
* Comedy/Novelty
* Country/Bluegrass
* Documentary/Broadcast/Spoken Word
* Environmental
* Field
* Folk/Ethnic
* Gospel/Spiritual
* Heavy metal
* Jazz
* Latin
* Pop (pre-1955)
* Pop (post-1955)
* R&amp;B
* Radio
* Rap/Hip-hop
* Rock
* Technology
{{div col end}}

Each yearly list has often included a few recordings that have also been selected for inclusion in the holdings of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]' audiovisual collection. Those recordings on the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry that are of a political nature will tend to overlap with the audiovisual collection of the National Archives. The list shows overlapping items and whether the National Archives has an original or a copy of the recording.

==Selection criteria==
The criteria for selection are as follows:&lt;ref name="NRRC"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-nrr.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= National Recording Registry Criteria |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recordings selected for the National Recording Registry are those that are culturally, historically or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.
* For the purposes of recording selection, "sound recordings" are defined as works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sound component of a moving image work, unless it is available as an autonomous sound recording or is the only extant component of the work.
* Recordings may be a single item or group of related items; published or unpublished; and may contain music, non-music, spoken word, or broadcast sound.
* Recordings will not be considered for inclusion into the National Recording Registry if no copy of the recording exists.
* No recording should be denied inclusion into the National Recording Registry because that recording has already been preserved.
* No recording is eligible for inclusion into the National Recording Registry until ten years after the recording's creation.

==2002==
On January 27, 2003, the following 50 selections were announced by the National Recording Preservation Board.&lt;ref name="NRR2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2002reg.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |title= The National Recording Registry 2002 |date=December 6, 2006 |accessdate=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
{{As of|2014}}, the oldest recording on the list is [[Edouard-Leon Scott de Martinville]]'s [[Phonautograms]] which date back to 1853. The most recent is ''[[Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman]]'' by [[Joan Tower]], performed by the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Marin Alsop]], which was released in 1999.&lt;ref name="NRPB2"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/nrpb-masterlist.html |publisher=[[The Library of Congress]] |title= Full Registry |date=November 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selections vary widely in duration. Both the early Edison recordings and the instrumental "[[Rumble (instrumental)|Rumble]]" by [[Link Wray]], as well as "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" by [[Bill Haley and His Comets]] clock in at under three minutes; the Edison Talking Doll cylinder is only 17 seconds long and some of Scott de Martinville's Photoautograms are just as brief. Meanwhile, [[Georg Solti]]'s recording of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s complete ''[[Ring Cycle]]'' is approximately 15 hours in duration and [[Alexander Scourby]]'s recitation of the [[King James Bible]] is over 80 hours in length.&lt;ref name="NRPB2"/&gt;

A '''niche''' is a  specialized sector of the property market. Examples include income property, [[garden real estate]], [[Condominium|condo]]s, [[equestrian property]], [[vacation property]],  [[Farm land (real estate niche)|farm property]], [[golf property]], [[golf course redevelopment]], [[shore|waterfront]] homes, [[beach house]]s and [[luxury real estate|luxury homes]]. These are often categories in which potential buyers think about the property they seek. They are also used by [[real estate market]]ing companies to reach these types of buyers{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. In this context a niche describes a specific segment of home buyers and sellers, classified by ethnicity, nationality or socio-economic group (e.g. [[social housing]] or [[luxury real estate]]).

==Types of Niche Real Estate==
===Income Property===
Income properties are bought for the purpose of making an income or profit through renting or leasing. These properties can be commercial or residential. Residential properties are also known as "non-owner occupied" and these types are considered to involve a higher risk, and a mortgage for it may carry a higher interest rate than a mortgage for ’’owner-occupied’’ income property.

===Garden Real Estate===
Garden real estates include a significant garden design that contributes to the overall value of the property. These properties originate in three different ways: gardens that are designed by prominent landscapers, gardens that were designed by architects or professional landscapers, and gardens that were designed by the previous owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Niche Real Estate|url=https://www.villaway.com/magazine/types-of-niche-real-estate-109565|website=Villaway|publisher=Villaway Inc|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Golf Property===
Golf properties include residential properties and communities surrounding golf courses. The value of these properties may increase through being near well established golf courses. 
===Condominiums===
Condominiums are individually-owned single housing units in a multi-unit building. The owner of a unit pays property taxes on his unit and may rent, mortgage, or sell the unit just like any other type of personal property. Condominiums can be residential or commercial, such as office condominiums.
===Equestrian or Farm Properties===
Equestrian properties, also called "horse communities," are facilitated communities where nearby facilities and trails cater to the needs of all types of horses and horse owners. Stables and open areas may be either shared or private with a resident staff. Hangars, fueling stations, and maintenance facilities may also be incorporated into the equestrian community.
Farm property is an area of land that includes arable land used for growing crops together with home and surrounding facilities used for keeping animals and maintenance.

===Vacation and Luxury Property===
Vacation properties can be separated into smaller segments of the market defined by season of occupancy, locale and associated activity. Vacation property can be owned or rented by vacationers through agencies, and it usually includes beachfront condominiums, lakeside fishing retreats, mountain cottages, etc.

Waterfront homes sit near a body of water such as a river, lake, ocean or canal. Water frontage is likely to boost the value of homes and make them worth more than double of the value of homes overall.

Beach house is a property located on a beach or within a mile from a beach. It can be used for either residential or vacation purposes. 
Luxury homes are unique and exclusive properties. There is no exact size, style, and design that embodies a luxury home, but homes with a storied history, extraordinary views, remarkable architecture, or beautiful interior and exterior design can also be included in the category of luxury homes.

Notels have been popular in North Korea since around 2005, significantly facilitating the extension of the "[[Korean Wave]]" (''Hallyu'', the increase of the popularity of South Korean pop culture internationally) into the isolated country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After an earlier crackdown that caused their black market prices to drop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/radios-02282014160921.html |title=North Koreans Tuning Into Miniature Radios Following DVD Crackdown |last=Lipes |first=Joshua |date=2014-02-28 |publisher=[[Radio Free Asia]] |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the devices were legalized in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/north-korea/ |title=The Plot to Free North Korea With Smuggled Episodes of 'Friends' |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |date=March 15, 2015 |work=Wired |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, they are available in some government stores (possession must be registered) as well as selling on the black market for around 300 Chinese yuan (ca. US$50), and are present in up to one in two urban households, according to some estimations.&lt;ref name=Pearson2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pearson1/&gt; In China, Notels are no longer popular as of 2015, but sell well in the provinces that border on North Korea.&lt;ref name=Pearson2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pearson1/&gt;

According to defectors, the Notel's multi-format support is used for evading detection of illegal [[media consumption]]: A North Korean DVD is placed in the device while a South Korean video is played from a USB drive or the SD card, which can be quickly removed in case government inspectors arrive and check the device's temperature to see if it has been recently used, leaving the DVD as an alternative explanation.&lt;ref name=Pearson2/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] provides an overview of and topical guide to entertainment and the entertainment industry:

'''[[Entertainment]]''' is any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to [[amusement|amuse]] themselves in their [[leisure|leisure time]], and may also provide [[fun]], enjoyment, and laughter. People may create their own entertainment, such as when they spontaneously invent a  game; participate actively in an activity they find entertaining, such as when they play [[sport]] as a hobby; or consume an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a performance.

The '''[[Show business|entertainment industry]]''' (informally known as '''show business''' or '''show biz''') is part of the [[tertiary sector of the economy]] and includes a large number of sub-industries devoted to [[entertainment]]. However, the term is often used in the [[mass media]] to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment. In the popular parlance, the term ''show biz'' in particular connotes the commercially popular performing arts, especially [[musical theatre]], [[vaudeville]], [[comedy]], [[film]], and [[music]].  It applies to every aspect of entertainment including [[film|cinema]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[theatre]], and [[music]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5544">'''Pahar''' or '''Prahar''' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]
প্রহর, [[Hindi]]/[[Nepali language|Nepali]]: पहर, {{lang|ur|پہر}}), which is more commonly pronounced ''peher'', is a traditional [[unit of time]] used in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]].  One ''pahar'' nominally equals three [[hour]]s, and there are eight ''pahars'' in a day.&lt;ref name="wadley2005"&gt;{{Citation | title=Essays on North Indian folk traditions | author=Susan Snow Wadley | year=2005 | isbn=81-8028-016-0 | publisher=Orient Blackswan | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XuyTqD0Ybw4C | quote=''... pahar (period of three hours) ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the measure is primarily used in [[North India]] and [[Urdu]] speaking communities throughout the [[Dakhini Muslims|Deccan]] in [[South India|Southern India]].&lt;ref name="khusro1882"&gt;{{Citation | title=Bāgh-o-bahār; or, Tales of the four darweshes | author= [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khusro Dihlavi]], Mir Amman | year=1882 | isbn= | publisher=W.H. Allen | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=va9AAAAAYAAJ | quote=''... pahars, or watches, of which the second terminated at noon; hence, do-pahar-din, mid-day ... do-pahar-rat, midnight ... in the north of India, the pahar must have varied from three and a-half hours about the summer solstice, to two and a-half in winter, the pahars of the night varying inversely ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Pahar''/''pehar''/''peher'' is derived from Sanskrit word [[prahar]] which is an ancient unit of time in India.

The word ''pahar''/''peher'' has the same root as the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''pehra'' (meaning ''to stand guard'') and ''pehredar'' (literally ''guard''/watchman).&lt;ref name="khusro1882"/&gt; It literally means a "watch" (i.e. period of guard-duty).

==Timing==

Traditionally, night and day were each allocated four ''pahars'', or "watches." The first ''pahar'' of the day (or ''din pahar'') was timed to begin at sunrise, and the first ''pahar'' of the night (''raat pahar'') was timed to begin at sunset.&lt;ref name="khusro1882"/&gt;

This meant that in the winter the daytime ''pahars'' were shorter than the nighttime ''pahars,'' and the opposite was true in summer. The ''pahar''s were exactly equal on the [[equinoxes]].&lt;ref name="wilson1883"&gt;{{Citation | title=Final report on the revision of settlement of the Sirsa district in the Punjab | author=J. Wilson (Settlement Officer) | year=1883 | isbn= | publisher= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5oIAAAAQAAJ | quote=''... they vary in length at different times of the year, but at the equinox the pahars of the day and night are equal, each being three hours long. In traditional Hindu society(as in of time when Sanatan Dharma was only major religion in Indian Subcontinent), each prahar was associated with certain task or Karma, which were to be finished in that prahar only. Each varna had specified karma in which at least one prahar(mostly first or last day prahar) was dedicated to sadhna(God worship). Dopahar means midday; pahar din raha=3 PM; pahar rat gai=9 PM; pahar din charha=9 AM ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the length of the traditional ''pahar'' varied from about 2.5 hours to 3.5 hours in the [[Indo-Gangetic plains]].&lt;ref name="khusro1882"/&gt;

Each ''pahar'' of a 24-hour day-night cycle has a specific name and number.&lt;ref name="khusro1882"/&gt; The first ''pahar'' of the day, known as ''pehla pahar'' (Hindustani: ''pehla'', meaning ''first''), corresponds to the early morning.&lt;ref name="kumar2006"&gt;{{Citation | title=अरविंद सहज समांतर कोश: शब्दकोश भी-थिसारस भी (Arvind Basic Dictionary and Thesaurus) | author=Arvind Kumar, Kusum Kumar | year=2006 | isbn=81-267-1103-5 | publisher=Rajkamal Prakashan Pvt Ltd | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMO036cxZPwC | quote=''... पहला पहर = प्रातःकाल ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second ''pahar'' is called ''do-pahar'' (Hindustani: ''do'', meaning ''second''). In the common speech of North India, Pakistan and Nepal, ''dopahar'' (दोपहर or دوپہر) has come to be the generic term for ''afternoon'' or ''midday''.&lt;ref name="wilson1883"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref43jomef"&gt;{{Citation | title=A shorter English-Nepali dictionary | author=T. Warren | publisher=Asian Educational Services, 1988 | isbn=978-81-206-0304-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKLI6V8V9vYC | quote=''... midday dopahar दोपहर् ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third ''pahar'' is called ''seh pahar'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]:''seh'', meaning ''three'') and has generically come to mean evening, though the term is less commonly used than ''shaam''.&lt;ref name="delacy1998"&gt;{{Citation | title=Hindi &amp; Urdu phrasebook | author=Richard Delacy | year=1998 | isbn=0-86442-425-6 | publisher=Lonely Planet | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkJH90HBlekC | quote=''... kal seh pahar ko : yesterday evening ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==

The poet-saint [[Kabir]] mentions ''pahar'' in one of his dohas:

पाँच पहर धंधे गया, तीन पहर गया सोय ।

एक पहर हरि नाम बिन, मुक्ति कैसे होय ॥

[You] went to work for five ''pahar''s, slept for the remaining three ''pahar''s. How will you attain salvation without chanting the names of Lord Hari for at least one ''pahar''?

{{Hermeticism}}
'''Rosicrucianism''' is a [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[cultural movement]] which arose in Europe in the early 17th century after the publication of several texts which purported to announce the existence of a hitherto unknown [[esoteric]] order to the world and made seeking its knowledge attractive to many.&lt;ref name="Yates, Frances A 1972"&gt;[[Frances Yates|Yates, Frances A.]] (1972), ''The Rosicrucian Enlightenment'', London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Frances Yates and the Writing of History|first=Brian|last=Vickers|journal=The Journal of Modern History|volume=51|issue=2, Technology and War|date=June 1979|pages=287–316|doi=10.1086/241901}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mysterious doctrine of the order is allegedly "built on esoteric truths of the ancient past", which "concealed from the average man, provide insight into nature, the [[physical universe]], and the spiritual realm."&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, Carl Edwin, ''{{citation|url=http://users.panola.com/lindgren/rosecross.html|title=The way of the Rose Cross; A Historical Perception, 1614–1620|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108052032/http://users.panola.com/lindgren/rosecross.html|archivedate=8 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}''. Journal of Religion and Psychical Research, Volume 18, Number 3:141–48. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestos do not elaborate extensively on the matter, but clearly combine references to [[Kabbalah]], [[Hermeticism]], [[alchemy]], and [[mystical Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;*Martin, Pierre. ''Lodges, Orders and the Rosicross: Rosicrucianism in Lodges, Orders and Initiating Societies since the early 16th century''. Edition Oriflamme, 2017. {{ISBN 0783952426258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rosicrucian manifestos heralded a "universal reformation of mankind", through a science allegedly kept secret for decades until the intellectual climate might receive it. Controversies have arisen on whether they were a hoax, whether the "Order of the Rosy Cross" existed as described in the manifestos, or whether the whole thing was a [[metaphor]] disguising a movement that really existed, but in a different form. In 1616, [[Johann Valentin Andreae]] famously designated it as a "[[ludibrium]]". Some esoteric scholars suggest that this statement was later made by Andreae in order to shield himself from the wrath of the religious and political institutions of the day, which were intolerant of free speech and the idea of a "universal reformation", which the manifestos called for. 

An example of the rosicrucian, rosy cross symbol predating the early rosicrucian manifestoes is that shown on the central panel of Herbaville Triptych, which is Byzantine and comes from the 10th or 11th century. The symbol is a Calvary cross with a rose in its centre, which is identical with what masonic/rosicrucian scholar, Manly Palmer Hall, claimed to be the original symbol of the rosicrucians.
 
In his work "Silentium Post Clamores" (1617), rosicrucian, Michel Maier (1568–1622), described rosicrucianism as having arisen from a "[[The_Primordial_Tradition|Primordial Tradition]]" in the following statement: "Our origins are Egyptian, Brahmanic, derived from the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, the Magi of Persia, the Pythagoreans, and the Arabs."

By promising a spiritual transformation at a time of great turmoil, the manifestos influenced many figures to seek esoteric knowledge. Seventeenth-century occult philosophers such as [[Michael Maier]], [[Robert Fludd]], and [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] interested themselves in the Rosicrucian world view.&lt;ref name="Yates, Frances A 1972"/&gt; According to historian David Stevenson, it was influential to [[Freemasonry]] as it was emerging in Scotland.&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;{{cite web|jstor=25011641|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|title=The Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 5, No. 2/3 (Jul. - Oct., 1919), pp. 265-270 by Joseph A. Murray; Review of New England and the Bavarian Illuminati by Vernon Stauffer; Vol. LXXXII of Studies in History, Economics and Public Law by The Faculty of Political Science; Columbia University Press (1918)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later centuries, many [[Esotericism|esoteric]] societies have claimed to derive from the original Rosicrucians. Rosicrucianism is symbolized by the [[Rosy Cross]] or Rose Cross. 
The largest and most influential of these societies has been the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], which consisted of several well known members of society. The other is the [[Ancient_Mystical_Order_Rosae_Crucis|Rosicrucian Order, A.M.O.R.C]], an international, initiatic Fraternity, which involves itself in several educational and cultural activities, worldwide.

== Rosicrucian manifestos ==
=== Origins ===
Between 1614 and 1617, three anonymous manifestos were published, first in Germany and later throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Philalethes | first = Eugenius | title = Fame and Confession of the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | location = City | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-56459-257-X | page = 9ff. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the ''[[Fama Fraternitatis|Fama Fraternitatis RC]]'' (''The Fame of the Brotherhood of RC'', 1614), the ''[[Confessio Fraternitatis]]'' (''The Confession of the Brotherhood of RC'', 1615), and the ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosicross a.D. MCCCCLIX]]'' (1617).

The ''[[Fama Fraternitatis]]'' presents the legend of a German doctor and mystic philosopher referred to as "Father Brother C.R.C." (later identified in a third manifesto as [[Christian Rosenkreuz]], or "Rose-cross"). The year 1378 is presented as being the birth year of "our Christian Father", and it is stated that he lived 106 years. After studying in the Middle East under various masters, possibly adhering to [[Sufism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nthposition.com/lususserius.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513044205/http://www.nthposition.com/lususserius.php |archivedate=13 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was unable to spread the knowledge he had acquired to prominent European scientists and philosophers. Instead, he gathered a small circle of friends/disciples and founded the Rosicrucian Order (this can be deduced to have occurred around 1407).

During Rosenkreuz's lifetime, the order was said to comprise no more than eight members, each a doctor and a sworn [[bachelor]]. Each member undertook an oath to heal the sick, but without payment, to maintain a secret fellowship, and to find a replacement for himself before he died. Three such generations had supposedly passed between c. 1500 and c. 1600, a time when scientific, philosophical and religious freedom had grown so that the public might benefit from the Rosicrucians' knowledge, so that they were now seeking good men.&lt;ref&gt;Gorceix, Bernard (1970), ''La Bible des Rose-Croix'', Paris: a work of reference, containing translations of the three Rosicrucian Manifestos, recommended in ''Accès de l'Ésoterisme Occidental'' (1986, 1996) by [[Antoine Faivre]] (École Pratique des Hautes Études, Sorbonne)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception ===
The manifestos were and are not taken literally by many but rather regarded either as [[hoax]]es or as [[allegory|allegorical]] statements. The manifestos directly state: "We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy, and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets."

It is evident that the first Rosicrucian manifesto was influenced by the work of the respected hermetic philosopher [[Heinrich Khunrath]], of [[Hamburg]], author of the ''Amphitheatrum Sapientiae Aeternae'' (1609), who was in turn influenced by [[John Dee]], author of the ''[[Monas Hieroglyphica]]'' (1564). The invitation to the royal wedding in the ''[[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]]'' opens with Dee's philosophical key, the ''Monas Hieroglyphica'' symbol. The writer also claimed the brotherhood possessed a book that resembled the works of [[Paracelsus]]. [[Adam Haslmayr]] a close friend of [[Karl Widemann]] (who collected Paracelsus' work), wrote him a letter about Rosicrucian people who revealed the Theophrastiam, on December 24, 1611.&lt;ref name="Grell"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_m1Mf52bK70C&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;ots=eNsmZIfvcK&amp;dq=Paracelsus%20Widemann&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=Paracelsus%20Widemann&amp;f=false|page=163|title=Paracelsus|year=1998|author=Ole Peter Grell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their literature announced them as moral and religious reformers. They used the techniques of chemistry ([[alchemy]]) and of the sciences generally as media through which to publicize their opinions and beliefs.

In his autobiography, [[Johann Valentin Andreae]] (1586–1654) claimed that the anonymously published ''Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz'' was one of his works, and he subsequently described it as a ''[[ludibrium]]''. In his later works, he makes alchemy an object of ridicule and places it along with music, art, theater and [[astrology]] in the category of less serious sciences. According to some sources, his role in the origin of the Rosicrucian legend is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

In the early 17th century, the manifestos caused excitement throughout Europe by declaring the existence of a secret brotherhood of [[alchemy|alchemists]] and sages who were preparing to transform the arts, sciences, religion, and political and intellectual landscape of Europe. Wars of politics and religion ravaged the continent. The works were re-issued several times, followed by numerous pamphlets, favorable or otherwise. Between 1614 and 1620, about 400 manuscripts and books were published which discussed the Rosicrucian documents.

The peak of the "Rosicrucianism furore" was reached when two mysterious posters appeared on the walls of Paris in 1622 within a few days of each other. The first said "We, the Deputies of the Higher College of the Rose-Croix, do make our stay, visibly and invisibly, in this city (...)", and the second ended with the words "The thoughts attached to the real desire of the seeker will lead us to him and him to us."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Sédir in ''Les Rose-Croix'', Paris (1972), pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

The legendary first manifesto, ''[[Fama Fraternitatis|Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis]]'' (1614), inspired the works of [[Michael Maier]] (1568–1622) of Germany; [[Robert Fludd]] (1574–1637) and [[Elias Ashmole]] (1617–1692) of England; [[Teophilus Schweighardt Constantiens]], [[Gotthardus Arthusius]], [[Julius Sperber]], [[Henricus Madathanus]], [[Gabriel Naudé]], [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Sédir (1972), ''Les Rose-Croix'', Paris, pp. 59–68&lt;/ref&gt;

In Elias Ashmole's ''Theatrum Chimicum britannicum'' (1650) he defends the Rosicrucians. Some later works impacting Rosicrucianism were the ''Opus magocabalisticum et theosophicum'' by [[George von Welling]] (1719)—of [[alchemical]] and [[paracelsian]] inspiration—and the ''Aureum Vellus oder Goldenes Vliess'' by [[Hermann Fictuld]] in 1749.

Michael Maier was appointed ''Pfalzgraf'' ([[Count Palatine (Imperial)|Count Palatine]]) by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Hungary]] and King of [[Bohemia]]. He also was one of the most prominent defenders of the Rosicrucians, clearly transmitting details about the "Brothers of the Rose Cross" in his writings. Maier made the firm statement that the Brothers of R.C. exist to advance inspired arts and sciences, including [[alchemy]]. Researchers of Maier's writings point out that he never claimed to have produced gold, nor did [[Heinrich Khunrath]] or any of the other "Rosicrucianists". Their writings point toward a symbolic and spiritual alchemy, rather than an operative one. In a combination of direct and veiled styles, these writings conveyed the nine stages of the involutive-evolutive transmutation of the ''threefold body'' of the human being, the ''threefold soul'' and the ''threefold spirit'', among other [[esoteric knowledge]] related to the "Path of Initiation".

In his 1618 pamphlet, ''Pia et Utilissima Admonitio de Fratribus Rosae Crucis'', [[Henrichus Neuhusius]] wrote that the Rosicrucians departed for the east due to European instability caused by the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1710, [[Sigmund Richter]], founder of the [[secret society]] of the [[Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross|Golden and Rosy Cross]], also suggested the Rosicrucians had migrated eastward. In the first half of the 20th century, [[René Guénon]], a researcher of the [[occult]], presented this same idea in some of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Guénon, René, ''Simboles de la Science Sacrée'', Paris 1962, pp. 95ff&lt;/ref&gt; An eminent author of the 19th century, [[A. E. Waite|Arthur Edward Waite]], presented arguments contradicting this idea.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Arthur E. (1887), ''The Real History of the Rosicrucians – founded on their own Manifestos, and on facts and documents collected from the writings of Initiated Brethren'', London, p.408&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this fertile field of discourse that many Rosicrucian societies arose. They were based on the occult, inspired by the mystery of this "College of Invisibles".

Some modern scholars, for example [[Adam McLean]] and [[Giordano Berti]], assume that among the first followers of the Rose Cross there was also the German theologian [[Daniel Cramer]], who in 1617 published a bizarre treatise entitled "Societas Jesus et Rosae Crucis Vera" (The True Society of Jesus and the Rosy Cross), containing 40 emblematic figures accompanied by biblical quotations.&lt;ref&gt;See. Adam McLean (editor), ''The Rosicrucian Emblems of Daniel Cramer: The True Society of Jesus and the Rosy Cross'' (Edinburgh, 1991), and Giordano Berti (editor), ''The Sibyl of the Heart'' (Boves, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prosphil.jpg|left|thumb|Frater C.R.C. – [[Christian Rosenkreuz|Christian Rose Cross]] (symbolical representation)]]
The literary works of the 16th and 17th centuries were full of enigmatic passages containing references to the [[Rose Cross]], as in the following (somewhat modernized):

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;For what we do presage is not in grosse,
For we are brethren of the Rosie Crosse;
We have the Mason Word and second sight,
Things for to come we can foretell aright.&lt;/poem&gt;|[[Henry Adamson]]|The Muses' Threnodie (Perth, 1638).}}

The idea of such an order, exemplified by the network of astronomers, professors, mathematicians, and natural philosophers in 16th-century Europe promoted by such men as [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Georg Joachim Rheticus]], [[John Dee]] and [[Tycho Brahe]], gave rise to the [[Invisible College]]. This was the precursor to the [[Royal Society]] founded in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;"The origins of the Royal Society lie in an 'invisible college' of natural philosophers who began meeting in the mid-1640s to discuss the new philosophy of promoting knowledge of the natural world through observation and experiment, which we now call science." http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history accessed 2 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was constituted by a group of scientists who began to hold regular meetings to share and develop knowledge acquired by [[scientific method|experimental investigation]]. Among these were [[Robert Boyle]], who wrote: "the cornerstones of the Invisible (or as they term themselves the Philosophical) College, do now and then honour me with their company...";&lt;ref&gt;Cited by R Lomas (2002) in ''The Invisible College'', London&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wilkins]] and [[John Wallis]], who described those meetings in the following terms: "About the year 1645, while I lived in London (at a time when, by our civil wars, academical studies were much interrupted in both our Universities), ... I had the opportunity of being acquainted with divers worthy persons, inquisitive natural philosophy, and other parts of human learning; and particularly of what hath been called the New Philosophy or Experimental Philosophy. We did by agreements, divers of us, meet weekly in London on a certain day and hour, under a certain penalty, and a weekly contribution for the charge of experiments, with certain rules agreed amongst us, to treat and discourse of such affairs..."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by H. Lyons (1944) in ''The Royal Society 1660–1940'', Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rose-Cross Degrees in Freemasonry ===
[[File:Bijou fm 18eme.jpg|thumb|170px|right|18° ''Knight of the Rose Croix'' jewel (from the Masonic [[Scottish Rite]])]]

According to [[Jean Pierre Bayard]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Bayard, Les Rose-Croix, M. A. Éditions, Paris, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; two Rosicrucian-inspired [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] rites emerged toward the end of 18th century,&lt;!--reference to be added--&gt; the [[Rectified Scottish Rite]], widespread in Central Europe where there was a strong presence of the "Golden and Rosy Cross", and the [[Scottish Rite|Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite]], first practised in France, in which the 18th degree is called ''[[Scottish Rite#The Rose Croix|Knight of the Rose Croix]]''.

The change from "operative" to "speculative" Masonry occurred between the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 18th century. Two of the earliest speculative Masons for whom a record of initiation exists were Sir [[Robert Moray]] and [[Elias Ashmole]]. [[Robert Vanloo]] states that earlier 17th century Rosicrucianism had a considerable influence on Anglo-Saxon Masonry. [[Hans Schick]] sees in the works of [[Jan Amos Komenský|Comenius]] (1592–1670) the ideal of the newly born English Masonry before the foundation of the [[Grand Lodge]] in 1717. Comenius was in England during 1641.

The [[Gold und Rosenkreuzer]] (Golden and Rosy Cross) was founded by the alchemist [[Samuel Richter]] who in 1710 published ''Die warhhaffte und vollkommene Bereitung des Philosophischen Steins der Brüderschaft aus dem Orden des Gülden-und Rosen-Creutzes'' (''The True and Complete Preparation of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] by the Brotherhood from the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross'') in Breslau under the pseudonym Sincerus Renatus&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, [[The Occult Roots of Nazism]], p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Prague]] in the early 18th century as a hierarchical [[secret society]] composed of internal circles, recognition signs and alchemy treatises. Under the leadership of [[Hermann Fictuld]] the group reformed itself extensively in 1767 and again in 1777 because of political pressure. Its members claimed that the leaders of the Rosicrucian Order had invented Freemasonry and only they knew the secret meaning of Masonic symbols. The Rosicrucian Order had been founded by Egyptian "[[Ormusse]]" or "[[Licht-Weise]]" who had emigrated to Scotland with the name "Builders from the East". In 1785 and 1788 the Golden and Rosy Cross group published the ''Geheime Figuren'' or "The Secret Symbols of the 16th and 17th century Rosicrucians".

Led by [[Johann Christoph von Wöllner]] and General Johann Rudolf von Bischoffwerder, the Masonic lodge (later: ''Grand Lodge'') ''Zu den drei Weltkugeln'' (''The Three Globes'') was infiltrated and came under the influence of the Golden and Rosy Cross. Many Freemasons became Rosicrucianists and Rosicrucianism was established in many lodges. In 1782 at the Convent of Wilhelmsbad the ''Alte schottische Loge Friedrich zum goldenen Löwen'' (''Old Scottish Lodge Friedrich at the Golden Lion'') in Berlin strongly requested [[Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] and all other Freemasons to submit to the Golden and Rosy Cross, without success.

After 1782, this highly secretive society added Egyptian, Greek, and Druidic mysteries to its alchemy system.&lt;ref&gt;Bayard, Jean-Pierre, ''Les Rose-Croix'', M.A.Édition, Paris 1986&lt;/ref&gt; A comparative study of what is known about the Gold and Rosenkreuzer appears to reveal, on the one hand, that it has influenced the creation of some modern initiatic groups and, on the other hand, that the Nazis (see ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'') may have been inspired by this German group.

According to the writings of the Masonic historian E.J. Marconis de Negre,&lt;ref&gt;de Negre, E.J. Marconis (1849), ''Brief History of Masonry''&lt;/ref&gt; who together with his father Gabriel M. Marconis is held to be the founder of the "[[Rite of Memphis-Misraim]]" of Freemasonry, based on earlier conjectures (1784) by a Rosicrucian scholar Baron de Westerode&lt;ref&gt;Nesta Webster's, ''[http://ellhn.e-e-e.gr/books/assets/secret_societies.pdf Secret Societies and Subversive Movements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228205819/http://ellhn.e-e-e.gr/books/assets/secret_societies.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }}'', London, 1924, p. 87 and note 37&lt;/ref&gt; and also promulgated by the 18th century secret society called the "[[Rosicrucianism#Gold und Rosenkreuzer|Golden and Rosy Cross]]", the Rosicrucian Order was created in the year 46 when an [[Alexandria]]n [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sage named [[Ormus]] and his six followers were converted by one of Jesus' disciples, [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]]. Their symbol was said to be a red cross surmounted by a rose, thus the designation of [[Rosy Cross]]. From this conversion, Rosicrucianism was supposedly born, by purifying [[Egyptian Mythology|Egyptian]] [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] with the new higher teachings of early Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Further research in ''[http://www.book-of-thoth.com/article1662.html Legend and Mythology: Ormus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113204045/http://book-of-thoth.com/article1662.html |date=13 January 2010 }}'' by Sol, The Book of THoTH, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maurice Magre (1877–1941) in his book ''Magicians, Seers, and Mystics'', Rosenkreutz was the last descendant of the Germelshausen, a German family from the 13th century. Their castle stood in the [[Thuringian Forest]] on the border of [[Hesse]], and they embraced [[Albigensian]] doctrines. The whole family was put to death by [[Konrad von Marburg|Landgrave Conrad]] of [[Thuringia]], except for the youngest son, who was then five years old. He was carried away secretly by a monk, an Albigensian adept from [[Languedoc]], and placed in a monastery under the influence of the Albigenses, where he was educated and met the four Brothers later to be associated with him in the founding of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Magre's account supposedly derives from oral tradition.

Around 1530, more than eighty years before the publication of the first manifesto, the association of cross and rose already existed in Portugal in the [[Convent of the Order of Christ]], home of the [[Knights Templar]], later renamed [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]. Three ''bocetes'' were, and still are, on the ''abóboda'' (vault) of the initiation room. The rose can clearly be seen at the center of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:António de Macedo|Macedo, António de]] (2000), ''Instruções Iniciáticas – Ensaios Espirituais'', 2nd edition, Hughin Editores, Lisbon, {{ISBN|972-8534-00-0}}, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gandra, J. Manuel (1998), ''Portugal Misterioso'' (''Os Templários''), Lisbon, pp. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a minor writing by [[Paracelsus]] called ''Prognosticatio Eximii Doctoris Paracelsi'' (1530), containing 32 [[prophecy|prophecies]] with [[allegory|allegorical]] pictures surrounded by enigmatic texts, makes reference to an image of a double cross over an open rose; this is one of the examples used to prove the "Fraternity of the Rose Cross" existed far earlier than 1614.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanislas de Guaita]] (1886), ''Au seuil du Mystère''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, various groups styled themselves Rosicrucian. The diverse groups who link themselves to a "Rosicrucian Tradition" can be divided into three categories: [[esoteric Christianity|Esoteric Christian]] Rosicrucian groups, which profess Christ; [[Masonic]] Rosicrucian groups such as [[Societas Rosicruciana]]; and initiatory groups such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]] (AMORC).

[[Esoteric Christian]] Rosicrucian schools provide [[esoteric]] knowledge related to the inner teachings of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Skogstrom, Jan (2001), [http://www.spiritunited.com/articles/exotericesoteric.htm Some Comparisons Between Exoteric &amp; Esoteric Christianity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209144259/http://www.spiritunited.com/articles/exotericesoteric.htm |date=9 February 2008 }}, a table comparing [[exoteric]] and [[esoteric]] Christian beliefs&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[The Rosicrucian Fellowship]], 1909 at [[Mount Ecclesia]] (groundbreaking for first building: 1911). Teachings present the ''mysteries'', in the form of [[esoteric knowledge]], of which [[Christ#Esoteric Christian tradition|Christ]] spoke in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:11 and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 8:10. The Fellowship seeks to prepare the individual through harmonious development of mind and heart in a spirit of unselfish service to mankind and an all-embracing [[altruism]]. According to it the Rosicrucian Order was founded in 1313&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen010.htm The Rosicrucian Interpretation of Christianity] by The Rosicrucian Fellowship&lt;/ref&gt; and is composed of twelve exalted Beings gathered around a thirteenth, [[Christian Rosenkreuz]]. These great adepts have already advanced far beyond the cycle of [[reincarnation|rebirth]]. Their mission is to prepare the ''whole wide world'' for a new phase in religion, which includes awareness of the [[plane (cosmology)|inner worlds]] and the [[subtle bodies]], and to provide safe guidance in the gradual awakening of man's latent [[spirituality|spiritual]] faculties during the next six centuries toward the coming [[Age of Aquarius]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng01.htm The Rosicrucian Mysteries]'' by [[Max Heindel]]. Accessed 29 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Masonic writers, the Order of the [[Rose Cross]] is expounded in a major Christian literary work that molded the subsequent spiritual beliefs of western civilization: ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' (ca. 1308–1321) by [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Pike]], ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'', [http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/morals_and_dogma/table_of_contents.htm "XXX: Knight Kadosh"], p. 822, 1872&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[René Guénon]], ''[http://www.thule-italia.net/Sitospagnolo/Guenon/Guenon,%20Rene%20-%20El%20esoterismo%20de%20Dante.pdf El Esoterismo de Dante]'', pp. 5–6, 14, 15–16, 18–23, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Manly Palmer Hall]], ''[http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/secret_teachings_of_all_ages/table_of_contents.htm The Secret Teachings of All Ages]: The Fraternity of The Rose Cross'', p. 139, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

*Societas Rosicruciana in Canadiensis, first mentioned in a declaration dated May 31, 1876, but it was not formally constituted (by a [http://rosicrucians.ca/macleod-moore/ Col. McLeod Moore], through his acquaintance with [[John Yarker]]) until September 19 of that year. Most of the membership came from the town of [[Maitland, Ontario]]. The society constituted a High Council exactly one year later, but the Society went into abeyance at some point after 1889.  In 1936, Ontario College was created via a charter from SRICF. [[Manly Palmer Hall]]'s father, E.H.D. Hall, a member of Canada's first Rosicrucian Society, was voted a charter member of the Ontario College. Due to possible jurisdictional issues, rather than procure a charter from SRIA or SRIS, a Canadian High Council was formed on June 29, 1997, and the SRIC is now an independent body. The Societas in Rosicruciana in Canada has launched a new website: [http://rosicrucians.ca Rosicrucians.ca]

Initiatory groups which follow a degree system of study and initiation include:
* The [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]] (AMORC), incorporated in the U.S. in 1915
* The Order of the Hermetic Gold and Rose + Cross, established in the Philippines in 1930
* The [http://www.rosicrucian-order.com/ Rose Cross Order], reestablished in [[Canary Islands]], Spain in 1988.

Many of these groups generally speak of a lineal descent from earlier branches of the ancient Rosicrucian Order in England, France, Egypt, or other countries. However, some groups speak of a spiritual affiliation with a true and invisible Rosicrucian Order. Note that there are other Rosicrucian groups not listed here.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7252">The '''seclusion of girls at puberty''' has been practised in societies around the world, especially prior to the early 20th century. In such cultures, girls' puberty held more significance than boys' due to [[Culture and menstruation|menstruation]], the girl's potential for giving birth, and widespread ideas of [[ritual purification]] related to the sacred power of blood.&lt;ref name=benedict &gt;{{cite book|author = Benedict, Ruth|year = 2002|title = Cultural Sociology|editor=Spillman, Lyn|chapter= The Diversity of Cultures|page = 22|publisher  = Blackwell Publishers Ltd|isbn= 0-631-21652-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These societies practised various [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], many of which lost their original forms or completely disappeared with the emergence of modern trends such as [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=Broude20051 &gt;{{cite book|author= Broude, Ruth|year = 2005|title= The Birkshire Encyclopedia of World History|editor1-first=W. H.|editor1-last=McNeill|editor2-first=Jerry H.|editor2-last=Bentley|url = http://BerkshireWorldHistory.com|chapter= Initiation and Rites of Passage|publisher = Berkshire Publishing Group|isbn= 0-9743091-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rites==
[[File:Venus figurine cave of Laussel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Venus of Laussel]]]]
Two rules were common in the seclusion of adolescent girls: the girl must neither touch the ground nor see the sun. According to [[Sir James George Frazer]], these rules also applied to [[divine king]]s and priests. These divine kings were carried on shoulders by their underlings who walked upon tapestry or carpet. Scholars have speculated that the [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelureofnoma.com/?p=131|title=Seclusion of Girls – Evidence from Paleolithic Times?|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=May 2012}} are related to such puberty rites as they lack facial features (not seeing the sun), their tapered legs without feet (not touching the ground), and their [[adiposity]] (caused by seclusion).

Among puberty rites which Frazer described, many adhered to the above rules:
* Once a girl from [[Zulu people|Zulu tribes]] in [[South Africa]] showed the first signs of puberty, she had to cover her head with her blanket and hide among the reeds by the river until the sunset. Afterward, she had to stay in a hut for some time before coming back to the society.&lt;ref name=frazer&gt;{{cite book|author= Frazer, James|year = 1993|title = The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|chapter= Between Heaven and Earth|publisher  = Wordsworth Editions Ltd|isbn= 1-85326-310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and in the Kabadi District of [[New Guinea]], pubescent girls were kept indoors in seclusion for several years.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
*In many societies, including [[Brahmin]]s of [[Bengal]], girls undergoing puberty were not allowed to see any males, not even their relatives. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of [[California]] did not allow girls in their first menstruation to "look about". 
*Among the [[Tiyan]]s of [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], such girls were not allowed to catch the sight of a cow or touch "any other person, tree or plant".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
* Among the Tukuna of the Northwest Amazon, the girl at puberty is kept in isolation for about three months while preparation for the ceremony is underway. During this time, she "is believed to be susceptible to all varieties of supernatural power"&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite book|author= Lincoln, Bruce|year = 1981|title = Emerging from the Chrysalis: Studies in Rituals of Women's Initiation|publisher  = Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-24840-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50–52}}
Frazer believed that the Greek myth of [[Danaë]], who was kept by her father in seclusion but was impregnated by [[Zeus]], was related to girls' puberty rites.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;{{rp|602}} Lincoln also finds parallels between the Greek myth about the abduction of Persephone and the seclusion of girls at puberty. According to him, the seclusion of Tukuna girls at puberty may be referred to as "being in the underworld".&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Reasons for the seclusion==

===Preparation for womanhood===
Such seclusion rites are linked to the social preparation of girls for womanhood and their roles as wives and mothers. During their seclusion, girls would be taught by older women about their future roles.&lt;ref name=Broude20051 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker1905 &gt;{{cite book|author= Langloh Parker,  Katherine|authorlink=K. Langloh Parker |year = 1905|title= [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe|The Euahlayi Tribe]]: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia|chapter = [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe/Chapter 7#56|Birth—Betrothal—An Aboriginal Girl From Infancy To Womanhood]]|page=56-58|publisher=Archibald Constable and Company|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstition===
Frazer claims the reason for seclusion practises was the "deeply engrained dread" of "menstruous blood". The first appearance of menstrual blood caused more fear than subsequent menstrual cycles. These fears stemmed more from [[superstition]] related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease.

Among the [[Apache Indians]], "the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing".&lt;ref name=benedict /&gt; A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of "a degree of supernatural power" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the "power of evil".

The [[Bushmen]] of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men "fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|606}}--&gt;

In earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of [[incest|incestuous relationships]] and [[child abuse|abuse]], triggering abnormal behaviours.&lt;ref name=Arachige2009 &gt;{{cite book|author = Arachige, Darshi|year = 2009|title  = The Lure of Noma: On the Elegance of Religion|url = http://www.boomerangbooks.com.au/Lure-of-Noma/Darshi-Arachige/book_9780980631432.htm|chapter= How did religion arise?

[[Image:Gallipoli Italy cross and skull and crossbones.jpg|thumb|200px|right|At [[Gallipoli, Apulia|Gallipoli]], [[Italy]], cross over skull and crossbones in the church Oratorio Confraternale delle Anime del Purgatorio (1660).]]
Actual skulls and bones were long used to mark the entrances to [[Spain|Spanish]] cemeteries (''campo santo''). The practice, dating back many centuries, led to the symbol eventually becoming associated with the concept of [[death]]. Some [[crucifix]]es feature a skull and crossbones beneath the corpus (the depiction of [[Jesus|Jesus']]  body), in reference to a legend that the place of the crucifixion was also the burial place of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] or, more likely, in reference to the [[New Testament]] statement (King James Version: Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22, and John 19:17) that the place of his crucifixion was called "[[Golgotha]]" (tr. "the Place of a Skull").

Today, an example of a real skull and crossbones may be seen in the 1732 [[Our Lady of the Pillar|Nuestra Señora del Pilar]] church overlooking the famous [[La Recoleta Cemetery|Recoleta Cemetery]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. It contains several altars rescued from other early Spanish churches in South America. One of these has twenty rectangular window boxes arrayed behind and above the altar, five wide by four tall. The size of these glass window boxes is such that the femurs of the priests thus interred are a bit too long to lie flat and so must be leaned up in an "X" formation. The other bones fill in the spaces around the femurs with the skull sitting prominently on top of the bone pile centered above the "X".

==Other countries==
The [[Jolly Roger]], and the similar [[Totenkopf]] was a popular symbol of mortality across at this time across Europe and has its origins in the mediaeval [[Danse Macabre]].

Tombstones from the 18th century in Southern Scotland fairly frequently feature skull and crossbones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/0_a_l/0_around_edinburgh_-_leith_north_leith_cemetery_01777+01778_no_name.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of St Nicholas in [[Deptford]] features two [[Totenkopf | Deaths Head]]s on its gateposts dating to the early 18th century.

'''''Sörla saga sterka''''' is a [[legendary saga]] which was written in the 14th or 15th century.

It is a sequel to ''[[Hálfdanar saga Brönufóstra]]'' and like its prequel one of its locales is [[England]], which is a vassal to [[Sweden]]. Sörli the Strong is a son of the king of [[Oppland]], and is at feud with Halfdan Brana's Foster Son (now king of Sweden). After some adventures in [[Africa]], which greatly resemble Halfdan's exploits in [[Helluland]], Sörli encounters Halfdan, kills him, and takes his ship. Halfdan's son Högni (of the [[Hjaðningavíg]]) fights against him but later they become allies. 

Much of the story is presented in a similar form in the midsection of [[Sörla þáttr]].

'''Travel''' is the movement of people between distant geographical [[Location (geography)|location]]s. Travel can be done by [[Pedestrian|foot]], [[bicycle]], [[automobile]], [[train]], [[boat]], [[bus]], [[airplane]], or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/travel "Travel."] (definition). [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/travel "Travel."] (definition). [http://www.merriam-webster.com Merriam-webster.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the [[Old French]] word ''travail'', which means 'work'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=travail&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Entymoligical dictionary] (definition). Retrieved on 10 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word ''travel'' was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English ''travailen'', ''travelen'' (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French ''travailler'' (which means to work strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book ''The Best Travelers' Tales (2004)'', the words "travel" and "travail" both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the ''tripalium'' (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Today, travel may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination you choose (e.g. [[Mt. Everest]], the [[Amazon rainforest]]), how you plan to get there ([[Bus|tour bus]], [[cruise ship]], or [[Bullock cart|oxcart]]), and whether you decide to "rough it" (see [[extreme tourism]] and [[adventure travel]]). "There's a big difference between simply being a tourist and being a true world traveler", notes travel writer Michael Kasum. This is, however, a contested distinction as academic work on the cultures and sociology of travel has noted.&lt;ref&gt;Buzard, J. (1993) The Beaten Track. European Tourism literature, and the Ways to 'Culture' 1800 - 1918. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for traveling include [[recreation]],&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;[http://plaza.ufl.edu/hwinger/byz/purpose.html "The Road to Travel: Purpose of Travel."] [http://www.clas.ufl.edu University of Florida, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences]. (Compilation for History 3931/REL 3938 course.) Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[tourism]]&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; or [[vacation]]ing,&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; [[research]] travel,&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; the gathering of information, visiting people, [[volunteer travel]] for [[charity (practice)|charity]], [[Human migration|migration]] to begin life somewhere else, religious [[pilgrimage]]s&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; and [[mission trip]]s, [[business travel]],&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; [[trade]],&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; [[commuting]], and other reasons, such as to obtain health care&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; or waging or [[Refugee|fleeing war]] or for the enjoyment of traveling. Travellers may use [[human-powered transport]] such as [[walking]] or [[cycling|bicycling]]; or [[vehicle]]s, such as [[public transport]], [[automobile]]s, [[train]]s and [[airplane]]s.

Motives for travel include:

* [[Pleasure]]&lt;ref name="conservancy"&gt;{{cite web|title=So Your Community Wants Travel/Tourism? Guidelines for Attracting and Servicing Visitors|url=https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/178439|website=conservancy.edu|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Discovery (observation)|Discovery]] and [[exploration]]&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt;
* Getting to know other [[culture]]s&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt;
* Taking personal time for building [[interpersonal relationship]]s.

== History of travel ==
Travel dates back to [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Baiae]].&lt;ref name=matador&gt;{{cite web|title=A History Of Why People Travel|url=https://matadornetwork.com/bnt/a-history-of-why-people-travel/|website=Matador Network|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gapyear.com/history-of-travel/ "A Brief Visual History of Travel"]. Accessed May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind has come a long way in transportation since [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century where [[aircraft]] allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.

Travel in the [[Middle Ages]] offered hardships and challenges, however, it was important to the economy and to society. The [[Wholesaling|wholesale sector]] depended (for example) on [[merchants]] dealing with/through [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] or sea-voyagers, end-user [[retailing]] often demanded the services of many itinerant [[peddler]]s wandering from village to hamlet, [[gyrovague]]s (Wandering Monks) and wandering [[friar]]s brought [[theology]] and [[Pastoral care|pastoral support]] to neglected areas, [[travelling minstrel]]s practiced the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.&lt;ref name=matador/&gt;
Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travellers both locally ([[Canterbury Tales]]-style) and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=F. E. |title=The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EK5MqskDYC0C&amp;pg=PA164 |year=1994 |page=164 |isbn=9780691026190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 16th century it became fashionable for young European [[aristocrat]]s and wealthy upper class men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the [[Grand Tour]], it included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence and Rome.
However, The [[French revolution]] brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.&lt;ref name=matador/&gt;

Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of [[railway]]s in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalised on by people like [[Thomas Cook]] selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together.&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite news|title=A brief history of travel: From elite hobby to mass tourism|url=http://www.dw.com/en/a-brief-history-of-travel-from-elite-hobby-to-mass-tourism/a-16996047|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=Deutsche Welle|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Airship]]s and [[airplane]]s took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots.&lt;ref name=matador/&gt;

== Geographic types ==
Travel may be local, regional, national (domestic) or [[international]]. In some countries, non-local internal travel may require an [[internal passport]], while international travel typically requires a [[passport]] and [[Visa (document)|visa]]. A trip may also be part of a round-trip, which is a particular type of travel whereby a person moves from one location to another and returns.&lt;ref&gt;

Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel [[safety]].&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/tips_1232.html "Tips for Traveling Abroad."] [http://travel.state.gov Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State].

Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some safety considerations include being aware of one's surroundings,&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; avoiding being the target of a crime,&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; leaving copies of one's [[passport]] and [[Travel itinerary|itinerary]] information with trusted people,&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; obtaining [[Health insurance|medical insurance]] valid in the country being visited&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; and registering with one's national [[Diplomatic mission|embassy]] when arriving in a foreign country.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries; however most countries accept [[international driving permit]]s.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov.permits"&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/safety/safety_1179.html#permits "Road Safety Overseas."] [http://travel.state.gov Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State]. Accessed July 2011.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vehicle insurance|Automobile insurance]] policies issued in one's own country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often a requirement to obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov.permits"/&gt; It is also advisable to become oriented with the driving-rules and -regulations of destination countries.&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov.permits"/&gt; Wearing a [[seat belt]] is highly advisable for safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating [[Seat belt legislation|seatbelt laws]].&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov.permits"/&gt;

There are three main statistics which may be used to compare the safety of various forms of travel (based on a [[DETR]] survey in October 2000):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/risks_of_travel.htm The risks of travel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010907000000/http://www.numberwatch.co.uk/risks_of_travel.htm |date=2001-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wire Shelving''' is commonly used in industrial and commercial uses, and more recently in residential use. It is also known as '''wire decking''' or '''ventilated shelving'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPImAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=wire+shelving&amp;dq=wire+shelving&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GnXEVI-YC4O4oQTN7oGoAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgo|title = The Atlantic Monthly|last = |first = |date = 1988|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 26 January 2015|volume = 262|page = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Wire decking consists of [[wire mesh]] supported by metal supports and is intended to be load-bearing. The mesh is usually welded to the supports, but may be attached in other ways as well. In commercial and industrial applications, the wire mesh usually has a minimum [[wire gauge]] of 0.105 inches when round wire is used. The most common shelf size is 42 inches deep by 46 inches wide, while two such shelves placed side-by-side can usually be combined to allow for a single shelf of 8 feet wide. The weight capacity of a 42x46 shelf ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 pounds, while the decking itself weighs from 24 to 30 pounds. The finish on the steel may either be painted or sprayed on, or be [[electroplating|electroplated]] with zinc. Electroplating is more common with Chinese manufacturers while painting or spraying is more common with American manufacturers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j9_m8zXxqKUC&amp;pg=SL252-PA1&amp;dq=wire+shelving&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l3XEVMP7AZPioAT_rIKADg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzg8#v=onepage&amp;q=wire%20shelving&amp;f=false Wire Decking from China], Inv. 701-TA-466 and 731-TA-1162, United States International Trade Commission, July 2010

Wire shelving is used in a broad range of commercial and home applications. It is often used in restaurant, food service and retail store applications due to its ability to stay clean and resist [[rust]] and mold. It is also used by retailers, in industrial applications and in home kitchens as well. Wire shelving is excellent in areas where fire prevention is stressed because its open design allows sprinkler systems to function where solid shelving might block water flow.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}

Chrome-plated [[steel]] is much cheaper and much less rust resistant to scratches. Typical colors are [[chrome plating|chrome]], [[white]] and [[black]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}

== Manufacturing ==
Wire shelving for industrial use consists of steel wire, used for the decking, and steel sheets, used for the supports. The wire makes up about 60% of the weight and the sheet steel about 40%.

Coiled steel wire is cut to the correct lengths required using straight-cut machines. Then, these individual wires are fed through a welding machine that joins them, using electric-resistance welding at each junction. The creates a continuous wire mesh, which is then cut to the lengths required.

Manufacturers receive sheets of steel pre-cut for the widths required. The sheets are fed through a roll-forming machine to create a "U" or "V" shape. The roll-forming machine also cuts the supports to the length required.

After welding, the decking is coated with either baked-on enamel or baked-on powder coating. This requires a cleaning process, heat drying, cooling, paint dip, and then final curing. The decking can instead be electroplated with zinc.

Most manufacturers use the same equipment to produce other products. These include concrete reinforcement, mining, containers and other items made from steel mesh&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Market ==
In 2008, eleven firms in the United States produced comprised 99% of that country's industry. Most US manufacturers sell wire decking nationwide. Manufacturers usually sell to distributors rather than directly to customers, with [[Big-box retailer|big-box retail]] being a large buyer. [[Walmart]] was the number one purchaser for several years during the 2000s. Both US and Chinese firms had high levels of excess capacity around 2010, allowing them to quickly respond to potential increases in demand. Manufacturers reported that the product had changed very little in the previous decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is no predictable business cycle in the wire decking industry. Demand closely tracks industrial output and real estate construction, but with a 6 to 9-month delay. As a result, the wire decking industry didn't feel the effects of the [[Great Recession]] until well into 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The industry has developed a quality certification called "R-Mark."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mhi.org/rmi/rmark|title = R-Mark Certification|date = |accessdate = 26 January 2015|website = Rack Manufacturer's Institute|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, US producers accused China of subsidizing wire decking and unfair trade practices. A [[United States International Trade Commission|US Trade Commission]] investigation rejected these allegations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Incompatible Standards and Labeling==
However, not all pole diameters and shelf widths in use are the same. The various plastic connectors are not interchangeable among manufacturers. Many use proprietary designs that do not fit with the systems of other makers. This variance tends to make it difficult to mix and match various brands of shelving.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
