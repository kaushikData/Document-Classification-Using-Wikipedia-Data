An acknowledged pioneer in montage, Child’s early film work addressed the interplay between sound and image through reshaping narrative tropes, prefiguring many concerns of contemporary film and media.

==Academics==
In 1968, Abigail Child graduated from [[Radcliffe College]] in [[Harvard University]] with a degree in history and literature.&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt; She has received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in Film.&lt;ref name="Petrolle"&gt;{{cite book |title=Women and Experimental Filmmaking |last=Petrolle |first=Jean |author2=Wexman, Virginia |year=2005 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |isbn=0-252-03006-0 |pages=20–21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dhrewnXgrcC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Mob+%22Scatter+Matrix%22+%22Abigail+Child%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has taught at several universities, including [[New York University]], [[Massachusetts College of Art]], and [[Hampshire College]].&lt;ref name="Janine"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fluid Screens, Expanded Cinema |last=Marchessault |first=Janine |author2=Lord, Susan |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |isbn=0-8020-9297-7 |pages=341 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lijmSHqczhwC&amp;pg=PA341&amp;dq=%22From+Solids%22+%22Abigail+Child%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been the chair of Film and Animation department at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] since 2000&lt;ref name="Janine"/&gt; and was appointed to a fellowship at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt;  In 2009, she was awarded the [[Rome Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aarome.org/sites/sofa/2009-2010/abigail-child |title=Abigail Child |year=2009 |work=[[American Academy in Rome]] |accessdate=2010-06-09 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qMqTvIGw?url=http://www.aarome.org/sites/sofa/2009-2010/abigail-child |archivedate=2010-06-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in film, writing, and poetry ==
Child began making films in the 1970s, producing seven independent documentaries shot on 16mm.&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt; From the middle of the 70s she turned to experimental montage and in the 80s her work explores gender and strategies for remaking narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmvideo.walkerart.org/detail.wac?id=2682&amp;title=Articles |title=Query: Abigail Child |accessdate=2008-10-20|work=[[Walker Art Center]] |date=February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    ''Is This What You Were Born For?'' is a major, seven-part experimental work from this period, completed over nine years, which included the cult classics ''Mayhem'' and ''Covert Action''.&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Todd|last=Haynes|title=A Queer Kind of Film|url=http://afterimage.carpe-datum.com/afterimage/articles/detail/513537|work=Afterimage|date=Dec 1988}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;{{cite news |title=none|first=Jan |last=Stuart |work=Film Comment |volume=23 |issue=6|date=Nov–Dec 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite book |title=Women Film Directors |last=Foster |first=Gwendolyn Audrey |year=1995 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn=0-313-28972-7 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kJHa7KqnQ4C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=Perils+%22Abigail+Child%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=cjNN_9cYYB&amp;sig=Le4wGaW5lHaW8lL44i4pud59oCQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result}}&lt;/ref&gt;    (see Filmography). In the 90s Child poetically envisioned and interrogated public spaces in such films as ''B/side''(1996), about urban homelessness on the Lower East Side of New York city,  and ''Below the New: A Russian Chronicle'' (1999), filmed in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Skoller |title=Home sweet home.(Abigail Child's 1996 documentary film 'B/side') |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53436065.html |work=Afterimage |date=1998-11-01 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smfa.edu/Programs_Faculty/Faculty/C/Child_Abigail.asp |title=SMFA Boston - Abigail Child |accessdate=2008-10-20 |work=[[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011043201/http://www.smfa.edu/Programs_Faculty/Faculty/C/Child_Abigail.asp |archivedate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etc"&gt;These artworks can be found in {{cite web|title=The repository of the Experimental Television Center|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813.001/8946249a|website=[[Experimental Television Center]]- [[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]]|publisher=[[Cornell University Library]]|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Child’s film and video has explored history, memory, and cultural experiences—the politics of place and identity.  Digital works like ''Cake + Steak'' (2004) and ''The Future Is Behind You'' (2005)&lt;ref name="etc"&gt;These artworks can be found in {{cite web|title=The repository of the Experimental Television Center|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813.001/8946249a|website=[[Experimental Television Center]]- [[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]]|publisher=[[Cornell University Library]]|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigate the awkward drama of the everyday, often utilizing found material to examine the past. ''Mirror World'' (2006) is a multi-screen installation that incorporates parts of Child’s “foreign film” series to explore narrative excess.  Key works include ''Surface Noise'' (2000), ''Dark Dark'' (2001), ''Where The Girls Are'' (2002), ''Cake and Steak'' (2004), ''The Future Is Behind You'' (2004), ''To and No Fro'' (2005), and ''Mirror World'' (2006). Her feature video documentary ''On The Downlow'' (2007)), is an exploration of bisexuality and an intimate look at a little-viewed underground scene.

In 2012, Child completed a feature film, ''Shape of Error,'' an imaginary “home movie”  based on the diaries of Mary Shelley during her marriage with Percy Shelley.

Child is also the author of five books of poetry (published between 1983 and 2012) &lt;ref name="Petrolle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Janine"/&gt; and a book of critical writings: ''This Is Called Moving: A Critical Poetics of Film'' (2005).

A collection of writings by various authors on ''Is This What You Were Born For?'', including a DVD of the film series, was published in 2011.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

Amanda did not appear in the 1991 [[miniseries]] continuation, ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]''.

==Storylines==

===Season five===
Close on the heels of [[Fallon Carrington Colby]]'s disappearance and presumed death in a plane crash, a young woman named Amanda Bedford appears in the penthouse of [[Alexis Colby]], Fallon's mother, in "[[Amanda (Dynasty)|Amanda]]". Raised primarily by Alexis' cousin Rosalind Bedford, she is Alexis' daughter, come to Denver from [[England]] to give her mother support after Alexis' recent arrest and acquittal for the murder of [[Mark Jennings (Dynasty character)|Mark Jennings]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Amanda's arrival is [foreshadowed in the season four episode "[[The Birthday (Dynasty 1984)|The Birthday]]" when Alexis mentions that she has been through four pregnancies. Krystle notes the discrepancy (at this time, Alexis is known to have just three children, Adam, Fallon and Steven), but Alexis explains that one resulted in a miscarriage. Amanda appears 11 episodes later in "[[Amanda (Dynasty)|Amanda]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

As news of Alexis' "new" daughter spreads, ex-husband [[Blake Carrington|Blake]] takes a special interest, soon learning that Alexis had been pregnant when he had exiled her from [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] almost two decades earlier. Though Alexis insists that Amanda's father is a ski instructor with whom she was involved, it is eventually revealed that she is indeed Blake's daughter and that Alexis kept her hidden from him as revenge for being banished years before.

Amanda is attracted to Alexis' fiancé [[Dex Dexter]], and attempts to seduce him. When they find themselves snowed in together in a remote cabin, they give in to their feelings and make love. Immediately afterwards, Dex regrets his actions and announces that he and Alexis will marry.

Sullen and depressed, Amanda is invited by Blake to a conference in [[Acapulco]], where she meets the handsome [[Prince Michael of Moldavia]]. Alexis, who had known Michael's father [[King Galen of Moldavia|King Galen]] years ago, encourages the relationship. Amanda learns that Michael is engaged to Elena, a Moldavian duchess, but he assures Amanda that it had been a loveless match. Michael proposes and Amanda, despite her lingering feelings for Dex, accepts.

During their engagement, Amanda is almost kidnapped by Moldavian rebels but rescued by Dex. In the 15 May 1985 season finale "[[Royal Wedding (Dynasty)|Royal Wedding]]," the rebels undertake a large-scale coup, interrupting the wedding in an attempt to kill Galen. Terrorists spray the chapel with gunfire, leaving the entire wedding party seemingly dead or dying on the floor.

===Season six===
Amanda, Michael and the rest of the [[Carrington family]] survive the attack, though [[Luke Fuller]]—the gay lover of Amanda's brother [[Steven Carrington|Steven]]—and family friend Lady [[Ashley Mitchell (Dynasty character)|Ashley Mitchell]] are killed. Galen is missing and presumed dead, and rightful heir Michael is forced to leave the country.

Exile, however, puts a strain on Amanda and Michael's marriage, as he and Alexis become obsessed with rescuing Galen (who is being held for ransom) and restoring the monarchy. Amanda and Dex are drawn closer as Amanda catches Michael and Elena in a compromising position and Dex catches Alexis with a crown, imagining herself as Queen of Moldavia. Amanda finds a drunken Dex and they make love again—only to be caught in the act by Alexis. Alexis and Dex divorce, as do Amanda and Michael. After Alexis discovers that Galen has in fact been manipulating her, the Moldavian royal family leaves for [[Lisbon]] and is never heard from again.

Amanda is devastated when Dex does not want to pursue a relationship with her. She romances [[Clay Fallmont]], but their family rivalry drives him into the arms of Steven's ex-wife [[Sammy Jo Carrington|Sammy Jo]]. Amanda is involved in a drunk driving accident which is covered up by Blake; estranged from her mother and feeling isolated from her family, Amanda eventually attempts suicide. She survives, and reconciles with a forgiving Alexis. Amanda decides to pursue Clay again. In the 1986 season finale episode "[[The Vendetta (Dynasty)|The Choice (a.k.a.) The Vendetta]]", Sammy Jo catches Amanda and Clay kissing at the La Mirage hotel; the women fight, winding up in the swimming pool in their party dresses. Meanwhile, Amanda's sister-in-law [[Claudia Blaisdel Carrington|Claudia Carrington]] accidentally sets the hotel on fire.

===Season seven===
In the seventh season premiere episode "[[The Victory (Dynasty)|The Victory]]," Amanda &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Starting in "[[The Victory (Dynasty)|The Victory]]" (September 24, 1986), the role of Amanda was played by [[Karen Cellini]]. To facilitate a recap of the previous episode, part of the pool fight scene originally filmed with [[Catherine Oxenberg]] from the previous season's finale episode was re-shot with Cellini.&lt;/ref&gt; is trampled in the chaos surrounding the fire but rescued by a mysterious stranger. He turns out to be [[Michael Culhane]], her father's former chauffeur who had been fired (and beaten up by Blake's thugs) in the first season for having an affair with Fallon.  Now grateful to Michael, Blake offers him his job back, but is no happier than before when Michael and Amanda begin dating. Amanda is warned about Michael by sister Fallon, but refuses to leave him. Eventually, an upset and confused Amanda learns that Michael has become wealthy and is using her to get to Blake, and she is last seen in "[[The Rig (Dynasty)|The Rig]]" on January 7, 1987. In "[[The Portrait (Dynasty)|The Portrait]],"  Blake offhandedly explains to Michael that Amanda has returned to [[England]] "to think."  The character never appears or is mentioned again during the series.

==Reception==
Oxenberg won two [[Soap Opera Digest Awards|''Soap Opera Digest'' Awards]] in 1985, for Outstanding Supporting Actress and Outstanding Female Newcomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebratingthesoaps.net/soap-opera-awards-history.html|title=The ''Soap Opera Digest'' Awards History|work=[[Soap Opera Digest]]|via=Celebratingthesoaps.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415185708/http://www.celebratingthesoaps.net/soap-opera-awards-history.html|archivedate=April 15, 2016|accessdate=October 26, 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bronze baptismal font''' ([[German language|German]]: Bronzetaufe) in the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] is a late [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[baptismal font]] which was probably made in Hildesheim in the first third of the thirteenth century. It is noted for its pictorial decoration which is of the highest quality and for its perfect proportions and is considered among the most outstanding works of its type. For centuries the baptismal font stood in the western part of the nave, until it was moved to the last of the northern side-chapels (George's chapel) in 1653. During the ongoing renovations of the cathedral (2010–2014) it is being displayed in the [[Bode Museum]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.domsanierung.de/de/taufbecken the website of the diocese].&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the renovation work, it will be placed in the centre of the nave under the [[Hezilo chandelier]].
 
== Description ==
The font is made up of a round pot, which widens towards the top, a tapering lid with four allegorical figures and a bauble on top. It has a total height of 1.7 m and a diameter of 96&amp;nbsp;cm.

The lively decorative style foreshadows [[Gothic art]], but also shows a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] influence, especially in the architectural elements. The postures and faces of the figures are especially emotionally expressive.

== Image program ==
The image program, divided into three horizontal bands and four vertical columns, is of great symbolic significance. The imagery can be interpreted on a number of levels and offers an ascetic and biblical understanding of the font overall. The imagers are further explained by [[Latin]] titles and inscriptions.

The lowest band shows four human figures, which support the whole font. These are personifications of the four rivers of the [[Garden of Eden]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Genesis|chapter=2|verse=10|range=–14}}). Each of them pours out the water of life: at baptism what was dried up by sin, begins to flow once more. The four figures are clearly distinct in clothing, posture, and hairstyle and symbolise different classes and phases of life. In a small area above their heads, they are identified with the [[cardinal virtues]]: moderation, valor, justice, and wisdom. In this respect, the armour worn by the figure labelled as valour is particularly notable. The natural virtues were meant to be brought to fulfillment by the act of baptism.

The second level, on the body of the font, shows the most significant aspects of baptism with four scenes from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 03.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Mary with child (donor portrait)&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 04.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Parting the Red Sea&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 05.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Crossing the Jordan&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* The [[baptism of Jesus]] indicates that the experience of the baptised is shared with Christ, as is death and resurrection ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=6|verse=3|range=–8}}). 
* The image of Mary with the baby Jesus on the opposite side places Jesus' mother before the eyes of the baptised; by their baptism she becomes their mother and advocate. She is depicted with the other patrons of the cathedral, [[Epiphanius of Pavia]] and [[Godehard of Hildesheim]], symbolising the [[Communion of saints]] to which the baptised now belonged. This scene is probably also the [[donor portrait]], since a small figure, whose name is given as "Wilbern" kneels at Mary's feet. This is probably [[Wilbrand van Oldenburg]] who was canon of Hildesheim Cathedral at the time the font was made.
* The depiction of the Israelites, indicated by their [[Jewish hat]]s, [[crossing the Red Sea]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Exodus|chapter=14}}) with [[Moses]], connects the immersion and emergence from the baptismal font with the peril, salvation, and freeing of Israel and through that connection declares all the baptised to be members of God's [[chosen people]], on their way to the [[Promised Land]].
* The fourth image shows the return to the Promised Land by fording the [[River Jordan]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Joshua|chapter=3}}). Everyone helps to carry the [[Ark of the Covenant]] which contains the [[Ten commandments]] they received at Sinai. This symbolises the duty of the baptised to the one God and his will, which is contained in the covenant of baptism.

The next layer up is the four scenes on the lid. They present the significance of baptism for the Christian life.
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 07.jpg|&lt;center&gt;The blossoming of Aaron's rod&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 08.jpg|&lt;center&gt;The Massacre of the Innocents&lt;/center&gt;
File:Hildesheim Dom Taufe 09.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Personification of Mercy&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* The image of the [[Anointing of Jesus]] by the prostitute (traditionally equated with [[Mary Magdalene]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=7|verse=36|range=–59}}) demonstrates remorse and repentance, as well as the inexhaustibility of [[Divine Grace|Grace]] and the love originating from it.
* The blossoming of [[Aaron's rod]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Numbers|chapter=17}}) opposite, symbolised Mary's fruitful [[virginity]] and the [[chastity]] of the baptised.
* The [[Massacre of the Innocents]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=2|verse=16|range=–18}}) recalls the fellowship shared by all the baptised with Christ in witnessing their faith ([[Greek language|Greek]] μαρτύριον) and the possibility of the [[Christian martyrs|baptism of blood]].
* The personification of ''Misericordia'' finally, a woman enthroned as a queen, performing [[Works of Mercy]], shows how the grace of baptism concretely effects life.

Vertically, the baptism of Christ correlates with his anointment by the prostitute, the Mother of God with the staff of Aaron, the Exodus with the Massacre of the Innocents and the Ark of the Covenant with the personification of Mercy.

Narrow columns rise up from the personifications of the rivers in between the scenes, which support triple arches above each scene. Their bases name the cardinal virtues and they show further biblical figures in the spaces between scenes above their capitals (sometimes the same figures are repeated), with the animals symbolising each of the evangelists above these spaces on the main body of the font:  
* Moderation - [[Jeremiah]] - [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] - Jeremiah
* Valour - [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] - [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] - King [[David]]
* Justice - [[Ezekiel]] - [[John the Evangelist|John]] - [[Isaiah]]
* Wisdom - Isaiah- [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] - King [[Solomon]].
These arrangements are also significant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3939">'''Blockage discount''' is an art-business-related and legal [[term of art]] for referring to the money [[discounts and allowances|discount]] assigned to a group of artworks by a single artist when that group of works is to be released to market as a group rather than individually. A blockage discount adjusts the [[fair market value]] of the works downward because of the risks of [[depreciation]] when a large volume of art is released into the market all at once.&lt;ref name="inreW"&gt;In re Warhol, No. 824/87, 1994 WL 245246 * 1 (Surr. Ct., N.Y. Co. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grosz"&gt;[http://www.lexisone.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLDisplayLanding&amp;format=FULL&amp;sourceID=bcfbd&amp;searchTerm=eIWY.ggXa.aadj.ecHc&amp;searchFlag=y&amp;l1loc=FCLOW Grosz v. Serge Sabarsky, Inc.], 24 A.D.3d 264, 806 N.Y.S.2d 498, 500 (1st Dep’t 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bresler"&gt;Lerner and Bresler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qSInf61-xaUC&amp;pg=PA1157&amp;vq=blockage+discount&amp;dq=blockage+discount+art&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 Art Law: The Guide for Collectors, Investors, Dealers, and Artists], Practising Law Institute, 1998, p.1157 et seq.. ({{ISBN|978-1402406508}}, 3d edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax issues==
A blockage discount adjusting fair market value also affects the tax consequences of a sale in the U.S., and is frequently a subject of litigation when an artist dies while holding a large collection of her or his own work. For instance, when [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] died she had over 400 of her own works in her estate, and when [[Andy Warhol]] died he had over 90,000 works, including 4,100 paintings, 9,000 drawings, 19,000 prints and 63,000 photographs.&lt;ref name="inde"&gt;Inde, Vilis, Art in the Courtroom, Praeger, 1998, p. 158. {{ISBN|978-0-275-95971-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia O'Keeffe's case, her estate's appraisers established blockage discounts based on solid evidence of market sales, but the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] used its own valuation and the [[United States Tax Court|Tax Court]] assessed a resulting tax of more than the valuation of the collected works at her death.&lt;ref name="establishing"&gt;[http://www.pgdc.com/pgdc/article/2004/05/establishing-value-important Establishing a Value is Important!], Planned Giving Design Center, LLC. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In Andy Warhol's case Surrogate Court of New York rejected the proposed discounts of Christe's, which averaged 60%. Instead, the court applied an average discount of 25%.  The court failed to articulate the specific rationale for its determination, but did state that Warhol was more famous than Smith &amp; O'Keeffe. The court's application of an average discount of 25% has been criticized by attorneys and appraisers because, inter alia, it ignored the necessary time it would take to sell 90,000 pieces of art.&lt;ref name="inde" /&gt; Therefore, accountants and estate planners for artists plan with such eventualities in mind.&lt;ref name="Englebrecht"&gt;Englebrecht, [http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2002/0902/features/f094002.htm Valuation of Art Objects for Estate Tax Purposes], The CPA Journal, 09/02/2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS has stated that [[carrying cost]]s and [[opportunity costs]] are relevant factors for consideration in blockage discounts, along with [[time to market]].&lt;ref&gt;Lerner and Bresler, pp. 1354, 1364.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4391">{{About|the printed books based on blogs|the card game|Bluke|internet books, also sometimes called blooks|Online book}}

A '''blook''' is a printed book that contains or is based on content from a [[blog]].

The first printed blook was User Interface Design for Programmers, by [[Joel Spolsky]], published by Apress on June 26, 2001, based on his blog [[Joel on Software]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} An early blook was written by Tony Pierce in 2002 when he compiled selected posts from his one-year-old blog and turned the collection into a book called "Blook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonypierce.com/blog/2002_11_03_blogarc.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517182557/http://www.tonypierce.com/blog/2002_11_03_blogarc.htm |archivedate=17 May 2008 |title=tonypierce.com + bushblog |website=tony pierce dot com |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name came about when Pierce held a contest, asking his readers to suggest a title for the book. [[Jeff Jarvis]] of BuzzMachine won the contest and subsequently invented the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2002_12_21.html#002759 |title=Posts from December 21, 2002 |date=21 December 2002 |website=BuzzMachine |accessdate=18 January 2014 |first=Jeff |last=Jarvis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce went on to publish two other blooks, How To Blog and Stiff.

[[Print-on-demand]] publisher [[Lulu (publisher)|Lulu]] inaugurated the [[Lulu Blooker Prize]] for blooks, which was first awarded in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/apr/03/news.newmedia1|title=From blog to book: first awards for online writers who became mainstream successes|last=Gibson|first=Owen|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 April 2006|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The printed blook phenomenon is not limited to self-publishing. Several popular bloggers have signed book deals with major publishers to write books based on their blogs. However, some publishers are starting to realize that blog popularity does not translate to sales. Blog to book conversions via traditional publishing houses still happen, but the focus has shifted from blog popularity to content quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-blogbook1211,0,5596105,full.story |title=The sharp rise (and quick fall) of the bloggers' books |date=11 December 2007 |first=Kara |last=Warner |website=am New York |archivedate=11 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511213548/http://www.amny.com/entertainment/am-blogbook1211%2C0%2C5596105%2Cfull.story |accessdate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Blook" was short-listed in 2006 for inclusion in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and was a runner-up for Word of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/10/12/bovvered_wins_word_of_the_year_award.html/ |title='Bovvered' wins Word of the Year award |website=The Guardian |first=Sarah |last=Phillips |date=12 October 2006 |archivedate=10 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610210543/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2006/oct/12/bovveredwinsw1 |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Book of Ballymote''''' ({{Lang-ga|Leabhar Bhaile an Mhóta}}, [[Royal Irish Academy|RIA]] MS 23 P 12, 275 foll.), was written in 1390 or 1391 in or near the town of [[Ballymote]], now in [[County Sligo]], but then in the tuath of [[Corann]].

==Production and history==


This book was compiled towards the end of the 14th century at the castle of Ballymote for Tonnaltagh McDonagh, who was then in occupation of the castle. The chief compiler was Manus O'Duignan, one of a family who were [[Ollam|ollav]]s and [[scribe]]s to the McDonagh and the McDermots. Other scribes of the book were Solomon O'Droma, a member of a famous Co. Fermanagh family, and a Robert McSheedy. The book is a compilation of older works, mostly loose manuscripts and valuable documents handed down from antiquity that came into possession of McDonagh.

The first page of the work contains a drawing of Noah's Ark as conceived by the scribe. The first written page is missing and the second opens with a description of the ages of the world.

The work contains treatises on the history of the Jewish peoples; St. Patrick and his household; Cormac's instructions to a king; and a physical and geological survey of Ireland. Part of the work is devoted to the sagas of [[Fenian Cycle|Finn]] and [[Brian Boru]], and the [[Lebor na Cert]] (Book of Rights). It also contains treatises on metre and the profession of a poet, and on the [[Ogham]] writing and language. The book ends with several translations from the Greek: the destruction of Troy and the wanderings of Ulysses, followed by a resume of Virgil's 'Aeneid', beginning with Nestor's speech to the Greeks.

The Book of Ballymote, like many of its kind, has made history by its wanderings. For over a hundred years it was a treasured possession of the McDonaghs of Corran. About the beginning of the 16th century, it fell into the possession of the O'Donnells with whom it remained until the [[Flight of the Earls]] in 1603. From 1620 until 1767 it was in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. It disappeared from the library and was later found in Burgundy, France. In 1785 it was returned to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] where it remained as one of the Academy's most treasured possessions. The work was photographed by the Academy in 1887 and two hundred copies of it were made. One copy is in the diocesan archives and others in libraries.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">The '''ceasg''' is a [[mermaid]] in [[Scottish folklore]] with the upper body of a beautiful woman merging with the tail of a [[grilse]] (a young salmon).&lt;ref name=Carmichael /&gt;&lt;ref name=MacKenzie /&gt; She is also known in [[Scottish Gaelic]] as '''maighdean na tuinne''' ("maid of the wave") or '''maighdean mhara''' ("maid of the sea").&lt;ref name=MacKenzie /&gt; 

The ceasg lives not only in the sea but also in rivers and streams, and can be made to grant three wishes to anyone who captures her. Marriages sometimes occur between ceasg and humans, and famous [[maritime pilots]] are often reputed to be descended from such unions. Even when these marriages end and the ceasg returns to the sea, they will always take an interest in their human descendants, protecting them in storms or guiding them to the best fishing grounds.&lt;ref name=MacKenzie/&gt;

The ceasg is sometimes imagined as something more monstrous. In some tales she swallows the hero and he remains alive in her stomach. The hero's wife plays a [[harp]] until the mermaid is charmed and the hero escapes. When the wife stops playing the mermaid swallows her, and the hero must consult a [[cunning folk|wizard]] for help. He is told that he must obtain a special egg that contains the mermaid's [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]]. He obtains the egg, rescues his wife, and kills the mermaid by crushing the egg. In these stories the hero had been promised to the mermaid before his birth. His father had been childless and the mermaid promised him sons on condition that the firstborn would be given to her.&lt;ref name=MacKenzie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John Francis (auth.) and Henderson, George (trans.) (1911). ''The Celtic Dragon Myth''. Edinburgh: John Grant. pp. 33–40, 78–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scotland|Scottish]] folklorist Donald MacKenzie suggested that the ceasg may originally have been a [[sea goddess]] to whom human beings were sacrificed.&lt;ref name=MacKenzie/&gt;

The '''Copenhagen Psalter''' ([[National Library of Denmark]], MS. Thott 143 2º) is a 12th-century [[illuminated manuscript]] [[psalter]], made in England. It has 199 leaves, is made of [[parchment]] and measures {{convert|28.6|cm|in}} x {{convert|19.8|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name=natlib&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kb.dk/permalink/2006/manus/242/eng/|title= Thott 143 2º: The Copenhagen Psalter
|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= Center for Manuscripts &amp; Rare Books|publisher= National Library of Denmark|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins with a calendar and a set of full-page miniatures illustrating the life of Christ, and 166 illuminated [[initial]]s.&lt;ref name=natlib/&gt;&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite book |last= Hourihane (ed.)|first= Colum|date= 2012|title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture, Volume 2|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA193|location= |publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 193|isbn= 0195395360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calligraphy and the illuminations are of the very highest quality.

The manuscript was made probably in northern England, perhaps [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]. Because the list of saints in the manuscript does not include [[Thomas Becket]], who was canonized in 1173, it is likely that the manuscript was executed before this year. Several artists seem to have been involved in the making of the manuscript, one of whom has been identified as the so-called [[Simon master]], who also worked for Abbot Simon of [[St Albans]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Much seems to indicate that the book was made for King [[Canute VI of Denmark]], and commissioned by Bishop [[Eskil of Lund]]. The Bishop was in [[France]] between 1158 and 1168, and so was with all probability one of the artists identified as having worked with the Copenhagen Psalter later. When Eskil returned to Denmark in 1168, he was commissioned with preparing celebrations in 1170 which were to take place due to both the upcoming coronation of Canute and to celebrate the canonization of [[Canute Lavard|Saint Canute]]. Perhaps because it was made for a boy king, just seven years old, the Copenhagen Psalter includes an [[alphabet]], and aside from its religious use, could be used to teach the young king to read. Earlier scholars have assumed that the manuscript was made for an English patron.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

An alternative theory has been proposed in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts|last=De Hamel|first=Christopher|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2016|isbn=978 0 241 00304 6|location=London|pages=304-315}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Christopher de Hamel, who proposes as patron King Valdemar the Great, ruler of Denmark, 1157-82. De Hamel also remarks that although the illumination is in the English manner, it could have been executed (perhaps by an English team) either in Paris or even in Denmark. The evidence is inconclusive.

'''Donald Pass''' (9 September 1930 – 3 December 2010) is a British painter whose art has been compared to that of [[William Blake]] by a reviewer in an Oxford newspaper, among others. He is known for work based on a vision he experienced, which has been interpreted as the Resurrection of the Dead. His work is found in museums and private collections in Europe, the United States, and Australia.

== Education ==
 
Donald Pass was educated on Stoke-on-Trent Regional College of Art (1947–1950) and the Royal Academy Schools in London (1951–1954).

== Early Visions ==
 
At a young age, Donald Pass saw an angel with a lion's head at a roadside hedge. Later, while working in London as a painter, he saw through the window "a beautiful face which appeared to be all gold. It seemed to expand through the window and embrace the whole room." &lt;ref&gt;Thorne, Dr. Tony. "Flights of Angels". Raw Vision Magazine, number 38&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Vision of the Resurrection ==

Prior to 1969, Donald Pass worked as a landscape artist. In a churchyard in Cuckfield, Sussex in August of that year, he experienced a vision which has been described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
" It was eleven in the morning on a bright day but suddenly everything darkened, and a strange light appeared with a sound like the rushing of wind. Vast fields stretched before him in which he could see miles into the distance as if it were close by, and the sky was an infinite black space with great lights moving in it. He was standing with a host of figures and gradually, he became aware of angels standing with them and coming towards them the sky. The angels were descending and ascending, coming from all directions and in all sizes. Some had their faces obscured, some had very compassionate and beautiful faces, others had faces of lions like the angel he saw in the hedge when he was a child.

In the middle, an enormous angel descended with outstretched arms and a face which Donald Pass says he can not describe. His descent was accompanied by a tremendous chorus of sound. Higher and at a distance was a beautiful and strange face in profile that had long hair yet was neither male nor female. It seemed unaware of the figures below. All the light stemmed from that extraordinary head and from the angels. It was a strange light and unlike sunlight, it spread in such a way that all the figures were illuminated.

On the ground, figures lay still with forms rising out of them as if something was emerging from a chrysalis. Donald Pass remembers that it looked "almost like a transfiguration, a rebirth" of the soul from the body. There were figures standing, and others going in three directions: one towards very dark angels who stood near the horizon and others upward in great columns into the sky where angels gathered them in. The dark angels stood very still a long way away, but those closer seemed to gather figures towards them. There were gangs of angels standing together, figures grouping together, and figures which Donald Pass say he can't describe standing together. There seemed at one point to be hands rising from the ground."  &lt;ref&gt;McCloud, Iliana. July–August 2009. "The Vision of the Resurrection". New York Arts Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His subsequent work has been based on the vision.

'''Dušan Jevtović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Душан Јевтовић}}); village Gornja Trnava nearby [[Prokuplje]], August, 9th 1906 – [[Belgrade]], October, 6th 2011), [[Serbians|Serbian]] [[naive art]] [[painter]].
He is considered to be one of the foremost contributors to the [[naive art]] genre, with a worldwide reputation.

== Biography ==

'''Dušan Jevtović''' was born in Gornja Tranava, a village near Prokuplje in 1925. He began painting in 1956. He died in Belgrade in 2011.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;М. Бошковић; М. Маширевић,''Самоуки ликовни уметници у Србији'', Торино, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic Style ==
National customs, church festivals, celebrations, natural disasters, misfortunes, human existence in general represented by interwoven friezes of people with exaggerated gestures, are all metaphors of collective consciousness, of total power of human multitude in good and evil. Horses, white, yellow, red rising on hind legs against the ruby-red sky and symbolizing life power, or a dragon representing the evil, all dwell in Jevtovic's rosy heaven like an eternal counterpoint: the fight between the real and imagined, good and bad… Dozens of portraits of human groups are connected by various incidents. The artist's sense of movement and crowd arrangement shows his innate feeling of composition. Gestures, clothes, and habits display features typical of the area and the people in ecstatic mood. The artist wishes to connect them with a ritual and therefore applies a pictorial structure resulting in perfect and imaginative observations. Thus, his paintings are raised from more description to the heights of distinctive painting formulae.&lt;ref&gt;Н. Крстић, ''Наивна уметност Србије'', САНУ, МНМУ,Јагодина, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions and awards ==
Dušan Jevtović participated in representative exhibitions in the country and abroad, such as ''Salons and Biennials of Naïve art in Jagodina'', [[Munich]] (1968), [[Rome]] and [[Tokyo]] (1971), [[Paris]], [[Belgrade]] (2003), [[Sofia]] (2007), [[Budapest]] (2008), and in significant international exhibitions: [[Lugano]] (1969), Naivi (1979, 1973, 1977).
He was awarded numerous recognition for his work, among which the most important are the ''Award for Entire Artistic Work'' (1987) and ''Grand Prix at the Ninth and Twelfth Biennial'' (1999, 2005) of [http://www.mnmu.rs Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art], [[Jagodina]].&lt;ref name="s"/&gt;

'''Formalism''' is a school of [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] having mainly to do with structural purposes of a particular text. It is the study of a text without taking into account any outside influence. Formalism rejects or sometimes simply "brackets" (''i.e.'', ignores for the purpose of analysis) notions of culture or societal influence, authorship, and content, and instead focuses on modes, genres, discourse, and forms.

==In literary theory==
In [[literary theory]], formalism refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret, or evaluate the inherent features of a text. These features include not only [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] but also literary devices such as meter and [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]. The formalistic approach reduces the importance of a text’s historical, biographical, and cultural context.

Formalism rose to prominence in the early twentieth century as a reaction against [[Romanticist]] theories of literature, which centered on the artist and individual creative genius, and instead placed the text itself back into the spotlight to show how the text was indebted to forms and other works that had preceded it. Two schools of formalist literary criticism developed, [[Russian formalism]], and soon after Anglo-American [[New Criticism]]. Formalism was the dominant mode of academic literary study in the US at least from the end of the Second World War through the 1970s, especially as embodied in [[René Wellek]] and [[Austin Warren]]'s ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1948, 1955, 1962).

Beginning in the late 1970s, formalism was substantially displaced by various approaches (often with political aims or assumptions) that were suspicious of the idea that a literary work could be separated from its origins or uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The term has often had a pejorative cast and has been used by opponents to indicate either aridity or ideological deviance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some recent trends in academic literary criticism suggest that formalism may be making a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;“Formalism and its Malcontents: Benjamin and de Man on the Function of Allegory”, Jim Hansen, New Literary History, 2004, Vol. 35, No. 4, 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
William H Thelin criticizes Maxine Hairston’s approach to teaching composition from a current-traditional standpoint, which she then mixes with the political. He claims that “No matter how sound the politics … the student would have no choice but to regurgitate that dogma in the clearest terms possible and to shift concentration onto matters of structure and correctness”.&lt;ref&gt;Thelin, WIlliam H. "Advocating Language: An Ethical Approach to Politics in the Classroom". ''The Ethics of Writing Instruction''. Michael Pemberton, ed. Stamford: Ablex Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Ann Cain writes that “formalism asserts that the text stands on its own as a complete entity, apart from the writer who produced it”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"&gt;Cain, Mary Ann. "Problematizing Formalism: A Double-Cross of Genre Boundaries." ''College Composition and Communication''. 51:1 Sept 1999. 89-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Cain says that “one can regard textual products as teachable and still maintain that being a writer is a "natural" act, one not subject to instruction.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Composition, like creative writing, has flourished under the assumption that students are already writers, or have the capacity to learn-and that everyone should be writers. Yet the questions composition tends to pose within this assumption are not so much about which aspects of writing can or cannot be taught, but how writing can be taught and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;
In regards to formalist composition, one must ask, “to what extent is this ‘need’ for ‘academic discourse’ real – any more than the need for more ‘imaginative writing’ is real-except to perform some function, to get something done?”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;

==Research==
Formalism research involves studying the ways in which students present their writing.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Some ways formalism research is conducted involves allowing the text to speak to the readers versus cutting out unintended meaning in a written piece. Respectively, these two methods deal with language as the “master” writer versus a teacher as the “master” writer.

===Russian formalism===
{{Main|Russian formalism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Russian Formalism refers to the work of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language (OPOYAZ) founded in 1916 in St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) by [[Boris Eichenbaum]], [[Viktor Shklovsky]] and [[Yury Tynyanov]], and secondarily to the Moscow Linguistic Circle founded in 1914 by [[Roman Jakobson]]. (The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] is also often associated with the movement.) Eichenbaum's 1926 essay "The Theory of the 'Formal Method'" (translated in Lemon and Reis) provides an economical overview of the approach the Formalists advocated, which included the following basic ideas:
*The aim is to produce "a science of literature that would be both independent and factual," which is sometimes designated by the term ''[[poetics]].''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
*Since literature is made of language, linguistics will be a foundational element of the science of literature.
*Literature is autonomous from external conditions in the sense that literary language is distinct from ordinary uses of language, not least because it is not (entirely) communicative.
*Literature has its own history, a history of innovation in formal structures, and is not determined (as some crude versions of Marxism have it) by external, material history.
*What a work of literature says cannot be separated from ''how'' the literary work says it, and therefore the form and  of a work, far from being merely the decorative wrapping of an isolable content, is in fact part of the content of the work.

According to Eichenbaum, Shklovsky was the lead critic of the group, and Shklovsky contributed two of their most well-known concepts: defamiliarization (''ostraneniye,'' more literally, 'estrangement') and the plot/story distinction (''[[syuzhet]]/fabula''). "Defamiliarization" is one of the crucial ways in which literary language distinguishes itself from ordinary, communicative language, and is a feature of how art in general works, namely by presenting the world in a strange and new way that allows us to see things differently. Innovation in literary history is, according to Shklovsky, partly a matter of finding new techniques of defamiliarization. The plot/story distinction separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the story) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the plot). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the significance of the form of a literary work in order to define its "literariness." For the Russian Formalists as a whole, form is what makes something art to begin with, so in order to understand a work of art as a work of art (rather than as an ornamented communicative act) one must focus on its form.

This emphasis on form, seemingly at the expense of thematic content, was not well-received after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. One of the most sophisticated critiques of the Formalist project was [[Leon Trotsky]]'s ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'' (1924).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Trotsky does not wholly dismiss the Formalist approach, but insists that "the methods of formal analysis are necessary, but insufficient" because they neglect the social world with which the human beings who write and read literature are bound up: "The form of art is, to a certain and very large degree, independent, but the artist who creates this form, and the spectator who is enjoying it, are not empty machines, one for creating form and the other for appreciating it. They are living people, with a crystallized psychology representing a certain unity, even if not entirely harmonious. This psychology is the result of social conditions" (180, 171). The Formalists were thus accused of being politically reactionary because of such unpatriotic remarks as Shklovsky's (quoted by Trotsky) that "Art was always free of life, and its color never reflected the color of the flag which waved over the fortress of the City"(source?)(164). The leaders of the movement suffered political persecution beginning in the 1920s, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power, which largely put an end to their inquiries. But their ideas continued to influence subsequent thinkers, partly due to Tzvetan Todorov's translations of their works in the 1960s and 1970s, including Todorov himself, Barthes, Genette and Jauss.

==The Prague Circle and structuralism==
{{Main|Prague linguistic circle}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
The Moscow Linguistic Circle founded by Jakobson was more directly concerned with recent developments in linguistics than Eichenbaum's group. Jakobson left Moscow for Prague in 1920 and in 1926 co-founded the Prague Linguistic Circle, which embodied similar interests, especially in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

A '''gaffer''' in the [[motion picture industry]] and on a [[television crew]] is the head [[electrician]], responsible for the execution (and sometimes the design) of the [[lighting]] plan for a production. The term gaffer originally related to the moving of overhead equipment to control lighting levels using a [[wiktionary:gaff|gaff]].   The gaffer's assistant is the [[best boy]].&lt;ref name="Taub153"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gaffers, Grips, and Best Boys |last=Taub |first=Eric |year=1994 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-11276-9 |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the gaffer is credited as [[Lighting technician|Chief Lighting Technician]] (CLT).

The term has been used for the chief electrician in films since the 1930s.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has a citation from 1936;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] accessed 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a 1929 book on motion picture production also uses the term.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Eunice McCarthy, The Hands of Hollywood, 1929: 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gaffer is responsible for managing lighting, including associated resources such as labour, lighting instruments and electrical equipment under the direction of the [[Director of Photography]] (the DP or DOP) or, in television, the Lighting Director (LD).

The DP/LD is responsible for the overall lighting design, but delegates the implementation of the design to the gaffer and the [[key grip]]. The key grip is the head [[Grip (job)|grip]], in charge of the labour and non-electrical equipment used to support and modify the lighting. Grip equipment includes stands, [[Flag (lighting)|flags]] and [[Gobo (lighting)|gobos]]. The gaffer will usually have an assistant called a [[best boy]] and, depending on the size of the job, crew members who are called "set lighting technicians" or "[[lighting technician|electricians]]", although not all of them are trained as [[electrician]]s in the usual sense of the term.

Although  [[gaffer tape]] is used within the film/TV Industry as a strong cloth-backed adhesive tape, many other types of tape are also used, such as paper tape, [[pressure-sensitive tape]] (A.K.A. snot tape), [[electrical tape]], J-LAR, and cloth tape. Gaffer tape is typically utilized by set lighting technicians under the supervision of, and not directly by, a gaffer.

The '''Hudson, New York, Sesquicentennial half dollar''', sometimes called the '''Hudson Sesquicentennial  half dollar''', is a [[Early United States commemorative coins|commemorative]] [[Half dollar (United States coin)|fifty-cent piece]] struck by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] in 1935. The coin was designed by [[Chester Beach]]. Its [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', flagship of [[Henry Hudson]], after whom the city of [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]] is named. In addition to showing the ship, the coin displays a version of the Hudson city seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] riding a whale, a design that has drawn commentary over the years.

Although the city of Hudson was a relatively small municipality, legislation to issue a coin in honor of its 150th anniversary went through Congress without opposition and was signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], becoming the Act of May 2, 1935. In June 1935, 10,000 Hudson half dollars were distributed to civic authorities for sale to the public.

Most of the coins were likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the time of issue. This caused anger among coin collectors, but did not lower the coin's value, which has continued to increase in the 80-plus years since it was struck.

== Background and legislation ==

[[Hudson, New York]], the seat of [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], lies on the east bank of the [[Hudson River]], south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. It was founded in 1662 under the name Claverack Landing.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=103}} Originally a trading post for the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaer family]], it saw considerable expansion in the early 1780s, and was incorporated under the name Hudson in 1785. During the 1930s, it had about 14,000 residents.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=293–294}}

In 1935, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=3–5}} In the case of the Hudson half dollar, the responsible official or group was to be designated by the Mayor of Hudson.{{sfn|Flynn|p=352}}

A bill for a half dollar to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Hudson was introduced in the House of Representatives by New York Congressman [[Philip A. Goodwin]] on April 6, 1935, and provided for 6,000 pieces. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures.&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=PL74-48&amp;type=LEG_HIST|title=Hudson, New York and Providence Rhode Island Anniversary Commemorative 50-Cent Pieces)|publisher=ProQuest Congressional|accessdate=August 8, 2017|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin was the longtime president of the [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]] Historical Society, and introduced the bill as a favor for friends in nearby Hudson.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=102}} A report was issued by Missouri's [[John J. Cochran]], acting chairman of the committee, on April 2, 1935, recommending that the bill pass with an amendment increasing the mintage to 10,000, and noting that Goodwin had appeared before the committee to pledge that the entire quantity struck would be taken up by the city authorities, and thus there would be no coins left on the Mint's hands.{{sfn|House report|pp=1–2}} On April 3, immediately after the House passed a bill for the [[Old Spanish Trail half dollar]], it passed the bill for the Hudson piece on Cochran's motion, without debate or opposition. The Missouri congressman also included his report in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|4951–4952|date=April 3, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill thus passed to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 11, 1935, New York Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] issued a report, recommending that the bill pass unamended.{{sfn|Senate report|p=1–2}} When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Rhode Island's [[Jesse H. Metcalf]] moved to amend it so that the bill would also provide for the issuance of a [[Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar]]. There was no objection or debate concerning either the amendment or the bill as a whole, and it passed the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|5643–5644|date=April 15, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the two chambers of Congress had passed different versions of the bill, it returned to the House of Representatives. There, on April 18, on motion of Cochran, the House agreed to the Senate amendments,&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|5995|date=April 18, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was enacted on May 2 by the signature of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=249}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their 1988 volume on commemoratives, suggested that the bill passed because of "probably the usual 'you vote for my bill and I'll vote for yours' arrangement".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=101–102}}

== Preparation ==

On the day Roosevelt signed the legislation, Congressman Goodwin wrote to [[Charles Moore (city planner)|Charles Moore]], chairman of the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], requesting the names of suitable artists to design the coin. The commission was charged by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins.  Moore suggested [[Laura Gardin Fraser]] as standing in the first rank of medallists, with other possibilities to include Mint Chief Engraver [[John R. Sinnock]], [[Paul Manship]], [[Francis H. Packer]] and [[Chester Beach]]. Mayor Frank Wise of Hudson asked if [[John Flanagan (sculptor)|John Flanagan]], who had recently designed the [[Washington quarter]], would do; Moore agreed by telegram. However, the commission went to Beach for $1,000; the sculptor also agreed to guide the city through the coin approval process.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v–vi, 161}}

Wise and his officials had tentatively decided to have a head of [[Henry Hudson]] on one side of the coin, with the city seal on the other.  Beach quickly prepared sketches and met with Wise on May 13, but convinced the mayor that instead of the explorer (no actual portrait of him is known) his ship, the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', would be a better choice. Working at speed unusual for a commemorative coin of that era, Beach completed plaster models in one week, adding a crescent moon to the left of the ship. The models were converted to coinage dies by the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, who could accomplish the task faster than the [[Philadelphia Mint]]. Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that [[Lee Lawrie]], the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] a week later.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=161–166}}

== Design ==

The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the coin shows the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]'s rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded with two rings of lettering, the inner reading "[[In God We Trust|{{small|IN GOD WE TRUST}}]]" and {{small|HUDSON}}, and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, {{small|CB}}, may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin. The reverse is a rendition of the city of Hudson's seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] holding a trident, riding backward on a whale. A mermaid or [[Triton (mythology)|triton]] in the background blows into a conch shell.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=249–250}} The seal design reflects Hudson's heritage as a whaling port, although it is some distance up the [[Hudson River]] from the ocean.{{sfn|Taxay|p=166}} The motto {{small|ED DECUS ET PRETIUM RECTI}} (''Both the honor and the reward of the righteous'') is copied from the city seal; the name of the city and the anniversary dates surround the seal, with [[E pluribus unum|{{small|E PLURIBUS UNUM}}]] above the dates.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}}

[[Don Taxay]], in his book on commemorative coins, described the seal as "a rather whimsical composition";{{sfn|Taxay|p=161}} Beach had deemed it "rather amusing" and had hoped the new coins "will be a little more interesting than the others I have done".{{sfn|Taxay|p=165}} Swiatek and Breen referenced "the quaint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be. Neptune is briefly clad in a wisp of cloth 'blowing in the wind'."{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=101}} They suggested that the position of the moon meant, if it was waxing, that the ship was sailing west toward America, but if waning, was sailing east to Europe.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=101}}

Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, considered the ship on the obverse "straightforward fare for commemorative half-dollars", though he found the name "{{small|HUDSON}}"  beneath the waves unneeded given the legend on the reverse.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=189}} The reverse based on the city seal was to him "a harming throwback to colonial days, and in American numismatics to the quasi–federal and state issues of the period 1780 to 1792".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=189}} Vermeule noted "the baroque motto above Neptune and his group [that] makes it evident that this subject, appealing and amusing in itself, appears here because it is the singular characteristic of the City of Hudson on the river of the same name".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=190}}

On June 12, 1935, John Evans, vice president of the First National Bank of Hudson, wrote to [[Mary M. O'Reilly]], the acting Director of the Mint, asking on behalf of Mayor Wise that only 6,000 coins be struck at that time, with the remainder to be coined later if demand justified it.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=282–283}} But the Mint delivered the entire authorization of 10,000 on June 28. Reservations for coins had been taken since early May (at $1 per coin, plus postage of $.03 per two coins and [[registered mail]] fee of $.18 per order), and on July 2, Evans, who was in charge of distribution, began informing what Swiatek called "[i]nfuriated collectors" that the coins were sold out.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}} Coin dealer Julius Gruttag, of New York City's Gruttag Brothers, is believed to have bought 7,500 coins at $.95 each, with Hubert W. Carcaba, of Saint Augustine, Florida, believed to have bought 1,000.{{sfn|Bowers|p=295}} In addition to the 10,000 pieces distributed, eight coins were struck at Philadelphia and retained there to be available for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=249}}

The uproar in the coin-collecting community resulted in bad publicity for the city of Hudson. Although the specifics of how the coins came to be so quickly sold out were not immediately known, collectors intuited a trick, especially when coins proved plentiful on the market at between $5 and $7 each. Many of these sold, helping set off a commemorative coin boom that would continue later in 1935 when low-mintage varieties of the [[Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar]] came on the market after a similar immediate sellout. But collectors wrote angry letters to numismatic societies and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those that future [[American Numismatic Association]] president L. W. Hoffecker complained about to Congress when he testified in March 1936. By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $5.50, but thereafter rose steadily and reached $1,700 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=295–299}} The 2017 edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'' lists the coin for between $700 and $1,500, depending on condition.{{sfn|Yeoman 2017|p=305}} A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $15,275.{{sfn|Yeoman 2015|p=1147}}

[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' is a complex work whose iconography remains the subject of debate.]]

'''Iconography''', as a branch of [[art history]], studies the identification, description, and the interpretation of the content of images: the subjects depicted, the particular compositions and details used to do so, and other elements that are distinct from [[artistic style]]. The word ''iconography'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|εἰκών}} ("image") and {{lang|grc|γράφειν}} ("to write").

A secondary meaning (based on a non-standard translation of the Greek and Russian equivalent terms) is the production of religious images, called "icons", in the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Churches|Orthodox Christian]] tradition (see [[Icon]]).

In [[art history]], "an iconography" may also mean a particular depiction of a subject in terms of the content of the image, such as the number of figures used, their placing and gestures.  The term is also used in many academic fields other than art history, for example [[semiotics]] and [[media studies]], and in general usage, for the content of images, the typical depiction in images of a subject, and related senses.  Sometimes distinctions have been made between ''[[iconology]]'' and ''iconography'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0161.xml Oxford Bibliographies: Paul Taylor, "Iconology and Iconography"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tems.umn.edu/pdf/Panofsky_iconology2.pdf Erwin Panofsky, ''Studies in Iconology: Humanistic Themes in the Art of the Renaissance''. Oxford 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt; although the definitions, and so the distinction made, varies. 
When referring to movies, genres are immediately recognizable through their iconography, motifs that become associated with a specific genre through repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Giannetti|first= Louis|title= Understanding Movies|year= 2008|publisher= Person Prentice Hall|location= Toronto|page= 52}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2015}}

==Iconography as a field of study==

=== Foundations of iconography ===
Early Western writers who took special note of the content of images include [[Giorgio Vasari]], whose ''Ragionamenti'', interpreting the paintings in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]], reassuringly demonstrates that such works were difficult to understand even for well-informed contemporaries.  [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], a 17th-century biographer of artists of his own time, describes and analyses, not always correctly, many works. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s study (1796) of the classical figure [[Cupid|Amor]] with an inverted torch was an early attempt to use a study of a type of image to explain the culture it originated in, rather than the other way round.&lt;ref name="Białostocki:535"&gt;Białostocki:535&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Hans Memling 056.jpg|thumb|A painting with complex iconography: [[Hans Memling]]'s so-called [[Seven Joys of the Virgin]] – in fact this is a later title for a ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' cycle on a single panel.  Altogether 25 scenes, not all involving the Virgin, are depicted. 1480, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, Munich; (Summary Catalogue – various authors), pp. 348-51, 1986, Edition Lipp, {{ISBN|3-87490-701-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Iconography as an academic art historical discipline developed in the nineteenth-century in the works of scholars such as [[Adolphe Napoleon Didron]] (1806–1867), [[Anton Heinrich Springer]] (1825–1891), and [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954)&lt;ref name="kleinbauer"&gt;W. Eugene Kleinbauer and Thomas P. Slavens, ''Research Guide to the History of Western Art'', Sources of information in the humanities, no. 2. Chicago: [[American Library Association]] (1982): 60-72.&lt;/ref&gt; all specialists in Christian religious art, which was the main focus of study in this period, in which French scholars were especially prominent.&lt;ref name="Białostocki:535"/&gt;  They looked back to earlier attempts to classify and organise subjects encyclopedically like [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia overo Descrittione Dell’imagini Universali cavate dall’Antichità et da altri luoghi '' and [[Anne Claude Philippe de Tubieres de Grimoard de Pestels de Levis, Comte de Caylus|Anne Claude Philippe de Caylus]]'s ''Recueil d'antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grècques, romaines et gauloises'' as guides to understanding works of art, both religious and profane, in a more scientific manner than the popular [[aesthetic]] approach of the time.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; These early contributions paved the way for [[encyclopedia]]s, manuals, and other publications useful in identifying the content of art.  Mâle's  ''l'Art religieux du XIIIe siècle en France'' (originally 1899, with revised editions) translated into English as ''The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'' has remained continuously in print.

=== Twentieth-century iconography ===
In the early-twentieth century [[Germany]], [[Aby Warburg]] (1866–1929) and his followers [[Fritz Saxl]] (1890–1948) and [[Erwin Panofsky]] (1892–1968) elaborated the practice of identification and classification of motifs in images to using iconography as a means to understanding meaning.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; Panofsky codified an influential approach to iconography in his 1939 ''Studies in Iconology'', where he defined it as "the branch of the history of art which concerns itself with the subject matter or meaning of works of art, as opposed to form,"&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt; although the distinction he and other scholars drew between particular definitions of "iconography" (put simply, the identification of visual content) and "iconology" (the analysis of the meaning of that content), has not been generally accepted, though it is still used by some writers.&lt;ref&gt;For example by [[Anne D'Alleva]] in her ''Methods and Theories of Art History'', pp. 20-28, 2005, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85669-417-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], to which Panofsky immigrated in 1931, students such as [[Frederick Hartt]], and [[Meyer Schapiro]] continued under his influence in the discipline.&lt;ref name="kleinbauer" /&gt;  In an influential article of 1942, ''Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture"'',&lt;ref&gt;Richard Krautheimer,Introduction to an "Iconography of Mediaeval Architecture", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 5. (1942), pp. 1-33.[http://aar.iec.cat/institucio/societats/AmicsArtRomanic/activitats/textosesp/espanol04.pdf Online text] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408194332/http://aar.iec.cat/institucio/societats/AmicsArtRomanic/activitats/textosesp/espanol04.pdf |date=April 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Krautheimer]], a specialist on early medieval churches and another German émigré, extended iconographical analysis to [[architecture|architectural forms]].

The period from 1940 can be seen as one where iconography was especially prominent in art history.&lt;ref&gt;Białostocki:537&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas most icongraphical scholarship remains highly dense and specialized, some analyses began to attract a much wider audience, for example [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky]]'s theory (now generally out of favour with specialists) that the writing on the rear wall in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]] turned the painting into the record of a marriage contract.  [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' has been the subject of books for a general market with new theories as to its iconography,&lt;ref&gt;Most recently: North, John (September, 2004). The Ambassador's Secret: Holbein and the World of the Renaissance. Orion Books&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[best-seller]]s of [[Dan Brown]] include theories, disowned by most art historians, on the iconography of works by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

Technological advances allowed the building-up of huge collections of photographs, with an iconographic arrangement or index, which include those of the [[Warburg Institute]] and the ''Index of Christian Art'' at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (which has made a specialism of iconography since its early days in America).&lt;ref&gt;Białostocki:538-39&lt;/ref&gt; These are now being digitised and made available online, usually on a restricted basis.
 
With the arrival of computing, the [[Iconclass]] system, a highly complex way of classifying the content of images, with 28,000 classification types, and 14,000 keywords, was developed in the Netherlands as a standard classification for recording collections, with the idea of assembling huge databases that will allow the retrieval of images featuring particular details, subjects or other common factors.  For example, the Iconclass code "71H7131" is for the subject of "[[Bathsheba]] (alone) with David's letter", whereas "71" is the whole "[[Old Testament]]" and "71H" the "story of [[David]]".   A number of collections of different types have been classified using Iconclass, notably many types of [[old master print]], the collections of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] and the German [[Marburger Index]].  These are available, usually on-line or on [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconclass.nl/ |title=Iconclass website |publisher=Iconclass.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.nl/manuscripts/browser/index.html Illuminated manuscripts from the Dutch royal Library, browsable by ICONCLASS classification] and [http://www.rosspub.com/iconclass.htm Ross Publishing - examples of databases for sale] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220200839/http://www.kb.nl/manuscripts/browser/index.html |date=February 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system can also be used outside pure art history, for example on sites like [[Flickr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iconclass.org/flickr website Iconclass for Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconography in religious art ===
[[Religious images]] are used to some extent by all major religions, including both [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] faiths, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition.

=== Iconography in Indian religious art ===
Central to the iconography and [[hagiography]] of [[Indian religions]] are [[mudra]] or gestures with specific meanings.  Other features include the [[aureola]] and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], also found in Christian and Islamic art, and divine qualities and attributes represented by [[asana]] and ritual tools such as the [[dharmachakra]], [[vajra]], [[dadar]], [[chhatra]], [[sauwastika]], [[phurba]] and [[danda]].  The symbolic use of colour to denote the [[Classical Elements]] or [[Mahabhuta]] and letters and [[Bīja|bija]] syllables from sacred alphabetic scripts are other features.  Under the influence of [[tantra]] art developed esoteric meanings, accessible only to initiates; this is an especially strong feature of [[Tibetan art]]. The art of Indian Religions esp. Hindus in its numerous sectoral divisions is governed by sacred texts called the [[Aagama]] which describes the ratio and proportion of the icon, called ''taalmaana'' as well as mood of the central figure in a context. For example, [[Narasimha]] an incarnation of [[Vishnu]] though considered a wrathful deity but in few contexts is depicted in pacified mood.

Although iconic depictions of, or concentrating on, a single figure are the dominant type of [[Buddhist]] image, large stone [[bas-relief|relief]] or [[fresco]] narrative cycles of the ''Life of the Buddha'', or tales of his previous lives, are found at major sites like [[Sarnath]], [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], and [[Borobudor]], especially in earlier periods.  Conversely, in [[Hindu]] art, narrative scenes have become rather more common in recent centuries, especially in [[Indian miniature painting|miniature paintings]] of the lives of [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]].

=== Christian iconography ===
{{further|Christian art| Eastern Orthodox iconography|Marian art in the Catholic Church}}
After an early period when [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconism was strong]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Kitzinger|Kitzinger, Ernst]], "The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', Vol. 8, (1954), pp.&amp;nbsp;83–150, Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291064 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; surviving [[Early Christian art]] began, about two centuries after Christ, with small images in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] that show [[orans]] figures, portraits of Christ and some saints, and a limited number of "abbreviated representations" of biblical episodes emphasizing deliverance.  From the Constantinian period monumental art borrowed motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art – the motif of [[Christ in Majesty]] owes something to both Imperial portraits and depictions of [[Zeus]].  In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]].  Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].
[[File:Tikhvinskaya.jpg|thumb|The Theotokos of [[Tikhvin]] of ca. 1300, an example of the [[Hodegetria]] type of [[Madonna and Child]].]]
After the [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|period of Byzantine iconoclasm]] iconographical innovation was regarded as unhealthy, if not heretical, in the Eastern Church, though it still continued at a glacial pace.  More than in the West, traditional depictions were often considered to have authentic or [[Acheiropoieta|miraculous origins]], and the job of the artist was to copy them with as little deviation as possible. The Eastern church also never accepted the use of monumental [[high relief]] or free-standing sculpture, which it found too reminiscent of paganism.  Most modern [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s are very close to their predecessors of a thousand years ago, though development, and some shifts in meaning, have occurred – for example the old man wearing a fleece in conversation with [[Saint Joseph]] usually seen in Orthodox Nativities seems to have begun as one of the shepherds, or the prophet [[Isaiah]], but is now usually understood as the "Tempter" ([[Satan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:66&lt;/ref&gt;

In both East and West, numerous iconic types of [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.  Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and  [[Panagia]] types.  Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s.  Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

From the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period sculpture on churches became increasingly important in Western art, and probably partly because of the lack of Byzantine models, became the location of much iconographic innovation, along with the [[illuminated manuscript]], which had already taken a decisively different direction from Byzantine equivalents, under the influence of [[Insular art]] and other factors.  Developments in theology and devotional practice produced innovations like the subject of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] and the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], both associated with the [[Franciscan]]s, as were many other developments. Most painters remained content to copy and slightly modify the works of others, and it is clear that the clergy, by whom or for whose churches most art was commissioned, often specified what they wanted shown in great detail.

The theory of [[Typology (theology)|typology]], by which the meaning of most events of the [[Old Testament]] was understood as a "type" or pre-figuring of an event in the life of, or aspect of, Christ or Mary was often reflected in art, and in the later [[Middle Ages]] came to dominate the choice of Old Testament scenes in Western Christian art.
[[File:Robert Campin - L' Annonciation - 1425.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Campin]]'s [[Mérode Altarpiece]] of 1425-28 has a highly complex iconography that is still debated.  Is [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] making a mousetrap, reflecting a remark of Saint [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] that Christ's Incarnation was a trap to catch men's souls?]] 
Whereas in the Romanesque and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods the great majority of religious art was intended to convey often complex religious messages as clearly as possible, with the arrival of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] iconography became highly sophisticated, and in many cases appears to be deliberately enigmatic, even for a well-educated contemporary. The subtle layers of meaning uncovered by modern iconographical research in works of [[Robert Campin]] such as the [[Mérode Altarpiece]], and of Jan van Eyck such as the [[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]] and the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Washington Annunciation]] lie in small details of what are on first viewing very conventional representations.  When Italian painting developed a taste for enigma, considerably later, it most often showed in secular compositions influenced by [[Platonism in the Renaissance|Renaissance Neo-Platonism]].

From the 15th century religious painting gradually freed itself from the habit of following earlier compositional models, and by the 16th century ambitious artists were expected to find novel compositions for each subject, and direct borrowings from earlier artists are more often of the poses of individual figures than of whole compositions.  The [[The Reformation and art|Reformation]] soon restricted most [[Protestant]] religious painting to Biblical scenes conceived along the lines of [[history painting]], and after some decades the Catholic [[Council of Trent]] reined in somewhat the freedom of Catholic artists.

=== Secular Western painting ===
Secular painting became far more common from the Renaissance, and developed its own traditions and conventions of iconography, in [[history painting]], which includes [[mythology|mythologies]], [[portrait painting|portraits]], [[genre painting|genre scenes]], and even [[landscape painting|landscapes]], not to mention modern media and genres like [[photography]], [[Film|cinema]], [[political cartoon]]s, [[comic book]]s and [[anime]].

Renaissance mythological painting was in theory reviving the iconography of the ancient world, but in practice themes like [[Leda and the Swan]] developed on largely original lines, and for different purposes.  Personal iconographies, where works appear to have significant meanings individual to, and perhaps only accessible by, the artist, go back at least as far as [[Hieronymous Bosch]], but have become increasingly significant with artists like [[Goya]], [[William Blake]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], [[Picasso]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Joseph Beuys]].

== Iconography in disciplines other than art history{{anchor|iconography and popular culture}} ==
Iconography, often of aspects of [[popular culture]], is a concern of other [[academic disciplines]] including [[Semiotics]], [[Anthropology]], [[Sociology]], [[Media Studies]] and [[Cultural Studies]].  These analyses in turn have affected conventional art history, especially concepts such as [[sign (semiotics)|signs in semiotics]].  Discussing imagery as iconography in this way implies a critical "reading" of imagery that often attempts to explore social and cultural values. Iconography is also used within [[Film theory|film studies]] to describe the [[visual language]] of cinema, particularly within the field of [[Film genre|genre criticism]].&lt;ref name="film"&gt;Cook and Bernink (1999, 138-140).&lt;/ref&gt; In the age of Internet, the new global history of the visual production of Humanity (Histiconologia &lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, {{ISBN|978-2-84736-185-8}}.

'''''If These Walls Could Talk''''' is a 1996 [[made for television movie|made-for-cable film]], broadcast on [[HBO]]. It follows the plights of three different women and their experiences with [[abortion]]. Each of the three stories takes place in the same house, 22 years apart: 1952, 1974, and 1996. All three segments were co-written by [[Nancy Savoca]]. Savoca directed the first and second segment while [[Cher]] directed the third. The women's experiences in each vignette are designed to demonstrate the popular views of society on the issue in each of the given decades.

Debuting at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], ''If These Walls Could Talk'' became a surprise success and was the highest-rated movie in HBO history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= HBO's 'Walls' Tell Eye-Opening Stories

==Plot==

===1952===
The 1952 segment deals with Claire Donnelly ([[Demi Moore]]), a widowed nurse living in suburban [[Chicago]], who becomes pregnant by her brother-in-law ([[Jason London]]) and decides to undergo abortion in order not to hurt her late husband's family. However, abortion at the time is strictly illegal. Claire eventually finds another nurse ([[C. C. H. Pounder]]) who provides her the phone number of a woman who can find her someone to perform the abortion. The woman on the phone tells Claire that the only trustworthy abortionist she knows is located in [[Puerto Rico]], and Claire cannot afford the travel costs--with air fare and hotel costs, the total trip would cost about $1000, which is about $9500 in 2018. After a failed attempt to end her pregnancy with a [[knitting needle]], Claire eventually contacts a man who comes to her home and performs a clandestine procedure on her while she lies on top of a kitchen table. Claire finally manages to abort, but dies shortly afterwards due to hemorrhage.

===1974===
The 1974 segment deals with Barbara Barrows ([[Sissy Spacek]]), a struggling and aging mother with four children and a policeman husband who works the night shift, who discovers she must welcome another addition to the family, despite having recently gone back to college. She considers abortion with the support of her teenage daughter ([[Hedy Burress]]) but ultimately chooses to keep the child.

===1996===
The 1996 segment deals with Christine Cullen ([[Anne Heche]]), a college student who got pregnant by a married professor, decides on an abortion when he breaks up with her and only offers her money. After consulting with her roommate ([[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]]), she makes an appointment with Dr. Beth Thompson ([[Cher]]). However, the abortion takes place during a violent protest, and an anti-abortion protester ([[Matthew Lillard]]) walks in on the operation and shoots Dr. Thompson.

This is a list of notable '''[[Chic (style)|chics]]'''.
{{wiktionary|chic}}
{{TOC right}}

==Chics==


===Ashcan chic===
Term used in the United States c. 2005 for a "homeless" style, similar to '''[[boho-chic]]''', that was initially popularised in [[Greenwich Village]]. Its main features were floppy hats, sunglasses and "dust-catcher" skirts. '''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bobo]]''' (''i.e.'' ''[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''-Bohemian) '''chic''' was used in a similar sense.

===Beach chic===
"Beach chic" was the title of an article in 2006 by the ''Times'' fashion editor [[Lisa Armstrong]] about shopping for accessories to accompany a [[bikini]].&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 22 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These included a "cover-up" (''e.g.'' a [[kaftan]]), flat sandals, a hat, a [[sunless tanning|fake tan]] and - with the comforting footnote, "No, you will not look like a [[WAGs|WAG]] [wife or girlfriend of a footballer]" - denture cleaner to whiten finger-nails. The ''Sunday Times'' referred to the Moroccan resort of [[Essaouira]] as the "[[boho-chic#Morocco|boho]]/'''barefoot-chic''' beach" (the latter possibly a play on the term, "bare-faced cheek").&lt;ref name="Style, 18 June 2006"&gt;''Style'', 18 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
''See also [[List of chics#Seaside chic|Seaside chic]]''.

===Boho-chic===
{{main|Boho-chic}}
Trend of fashion in the early 2000s (decade) which drew on earlier [[Bohemian style|Bohemian]] and [[hippie]] styles. It was associated in particular with actress [[Sienna Miller]] and model [[Kate Moss]]. [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]] have both become icons for this style.

===Bon chic bon genre===
:''See [[Parisian chic]]''

===Camilla chic===
Emulating the style, of which [[Burberry]] was a feature, of [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], who married Charles, Prince of Wales in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Dent (2005) ''Fanboys and Overdogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casual chic===
"Casual chic" (or "chic casual") is a difficult term to define, but can perhaps best be described as "dressing down" in a stylish way. In 2007, the clothing retailer [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] suggested that some of the elements of "chic casual" were [[slim-fit pants|skinny jeans]], "longline, clingy jerseys", "statement" bags and chunky jewellery, slouchy sweaters and hoodies with comfortable flats. Singer [[Victoria Beckham]] was identified as epitomising this style.&lt;ref name="Your M&amp;S, Spring 2007"&gt;''Your M&amp;S'', Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt; '''Easy chic''' ("breezy blouses, slouchy knits and sexy [[denim]]"&lt;ref name="Your M&amp;S, Spring 2007"/&gt;) has similar connotations.

===Chav chic===
:''See [[List of chics#Council house chic|council house chic]]''

===Checkout chic===
Referring to fashion ranges promoted by major [[supermarket]]s: "[[Tesco]] has stepped up its '[[Point of sale|checkout]] chic' war with [[Asda]] by launching a design-led range of clothes to tempt female shoppers".&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; '''Cheap chic''' was used in a similar sense, though more in terms of the comparison between prices at supermarkets and those of leading fashion houses: "You can achieve this season's look just by visiting your local supermarket".&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 31 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea chic===
Used by the ''Sunday Times'' ("The Sloane gets a sexy revamp"&lt;ref name="Style, 18 June 2006"/&gt;) for fashionable trends among well-heeled "[[Sloane Ranger]]s" (a ''[[portmanteau]]'' term coined in 1975 by [[Peter York]], style editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harpers &amp; Queen]]'', from [[Sloane Square]] and the 1950s TV series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''&lt;ref&gt;See ''Oxford Dictionary of New Words'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] area of south west London.

===Council house chic===
"Council house chic"&lt;ref&gt;Susie Dent (2004) ''Larpers and Shroomers''&lt;/ref&gt; or '''chav chic''' ("Chav Chic might have sunk the house of Burberry"&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Magazine'', 26 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) referred to the fashions of working class "[[chav]]s" who shared [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], Duchess of Cornwall's taste for Burberry check. ''See also [[List of chics#Camilla chic|Camilla chic]]''.

===Cycle chic===
{{main|Cycle chic}}
To be well dressed and smart in everyday clothes whilst cycling for ordinary journeys.&lt;ref&gt;Cycle Chic Manifesto, http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/2008/04/cycle-chic-manifesto.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eco Chic===
Eco Chic means the use of eco-friendly textiles, such as [[organic cotton]], [[silk]] and [[hemp]], and also [[reconstructed clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetark.org/wen/51195 |title=World Environment News - A model displays an outfit during the EcoChic Shanghai fashion show |publisher=Planet Ark |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geek chic===
{{main|Geek chic}}
"The look of a computer nerd".&lt;ref&gt;Dent (2003) ''The Language Report''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goth chic===
Title of a "connoisseur's guide" by Gavin Baddeley (2002) to dark or Gothic culture. Among those associated with the "[[Gothic fashion|goth]] look" were the late 1970s [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], American punk cabaret duo [[The Dresden Dolls]], formed in 2000, and [[Megan Burns|Betty Curse]], described by ''[[The Times]]'' in 2006 as the "princess of Goth pop".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Knowledge'', 3 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroin chic===
{{main|Heroin chic}}
[[Heroin chic]] was a look popularized in mid-1990s fashion and characterized by pale skin, dark circles underneath the eyes and angular bone structure. The look, characterised by emaciated features and androgyny, was a reaction against the healthy and vibrant look of models such as [[Cindy Crawford]] and [[Claudia Schiffer]]. A 1996 article in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' opened that the fashion industry had "a nihilistic vision of beauty" that was reflective of drug addiction, while ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' called the movement a "cynical trend".

===Hick chic===
[[wiktionary:hick|Hick]] chic" was the subject of an article in ''Country Life'' in 2006 by Carla Carlisle, American-born wife of former British Member of Parliament, Sir [[Kenneth Carlisle]]. Lady Carlisle cited a friend's description of the term: "it's [[farmers' market]]s, [[four-wheel drive]] cars, [[Labrador Retriever|labradors]], [[Harris Tweed]], [[Shakers|Shaker]] furniture, [[Emma Bridgewater]] [tableware] ...".&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 23 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "Hick" derives from "Old Hickory", a nickname for [[Andrew Jackson]], US President 1829-37, a [[frontier]]sman who, like [[hickory]] wood, was known for his toughness.

===High Street chic===
Applied to the sort of "everyday" sense of style that might be spotted in any metropolitan or provincial setting; most likely to be associated with prevailing "shop window" fashions. In 2004 the ''Observer'' wrote of the singer [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] that "she drifts on stage dressed in [[High Street|high-street]] chic: faded [[denim]] and a [[tracksuit]] top, which she slips off to reveal a pink [[camisole]] vest".&lt;ref&gt;''Observer", 1 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samantha Cameron]], wife of British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader and future Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] was described in 2006 as "spurn[ing] the designers ... for high street chic".&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Hippie chic}} Hippie chic===
:Also known as ''Art-school chic'' and ''[[Talitha Getty]] chic''
Broadly similar to [[boho-chic]] (see ''e.g.'' London ''Evening Standard Magazine'', 11 March 2005), the [[Hippie chic]] was associated in the mid-1990s with [[Tom Ford]]’s collections for the Italian house of [[Gucci]] and, indeed, various aspects of hippie fashion re-appeared periodically after the "[[Summer of Love]]" of 1967 when hippiedom and [[psychedelia]] were at their peak. '''Art-school chic'''&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 1 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; had roughly similar connotations. '''[[Talitha Getty]] chic''' was applied by Hedley Freeman in the ''Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;''Guardian'', 24 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to the hippie style associated in the late 1960s (and since) with the actress wife (died 1971) of [[Paul Getty|John Paul Getty]]. Talitha Getty is said to have inspired Ford's hippie-style creations.

=== Marzahn chic ===

:Also known as ''[[Lichtenberg]] chic''
Refers to the clothing style seen in some eastern and northern parts of Germany. It is composed of sweatpants or tracksuits, ''[[baseball cap|Basecaps]]'' and running shoes, commonly in bright colors like neon pink or yellow.
The name originates from the locality [[Berlin-Marzahn]] where this style can frequently be seen. It also refers to the clothing style of ''Cindy aus Marzahn'', a fictional character played by German comedian [[Ilka Bessin]].

===Military chic===
:Also known as ''Soldier chic''
Adoption of [[military]] gear such as camouflage patterned clothing, war medals, military insignia, surplus clothing or [[dog tag (identifier)|dog tag necklaces]] (adopted in the [[American Civil War]]) into fashion. The term and the similar '''soldier chic''' were widely applied ''c.''2003-5, although in fact military apparel, such as the flight jackets worn by pilots during the Second World War, had frequently influenced fashion and paradoxically was often in vogue at times of anti-war feeling, such as in the late 1960s when protests against the [[Vietnam War]] were at their height (as, indeed, after the [[Iraq War]] of 2003): "One would have thought, given the unpopularity of armed forces activity in some quarters, that 'military chic' would not be, well, chic".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Kessler, ''The Times'', 17 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi chic===
{{main|Nazi chic}}
[[Nazi chic]] is the incorporation of Nazi style clothing and culture, often used for shock value, as a form of rebellion against the status quo, although it is sometimes accompanied by a genuine sympathy for or adherence to the ideology of National Socialism.

===Northern chic===
Occasionally applied retrospectively&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The 60s: the Beatles' Decade'', UKtv 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to aspects of the musical and cultural boom generated by the rock group, [[the Beatles]], and other artists such as [[Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers]] and [[Billy J. Kramer|Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas]] in 1962-4 (the "[[Beat music|Mersey Sound]]"). "Northern" is a reference both to Northern England (as also with "[[Northern soul]]") and [[Northern Songs]], which published compositions by the Beatles' [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]].

===Parisian chic===
:Also known as ''Bon chic bon genre''
Frequently applied to anything stylish connected with the French capital [[Paris]] or to the style of French celebrities (''e.g.'' actress [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;London ''Evening Standard magazine'', 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or others living in Paris, such as the English actress [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;). Variants included '''"[[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]'''" or '''"[[Rive Droite|Right Bank]]'''" '''chic''' (or even "Left Bank chic versus Right Bank polish").&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Gainsbourg's mother, the British-born actress [[Jane Birkin]], remarked that she would choose "English eccentricity over Parisian chic every time", adding, "chic you can learn - it's just a form of grooming".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''bon chic bon genre''''' or '''''[[Max Azria|BCBG]]''''' ["good style, good class"] was applied in the early 1980s to the French equivalent of British "[[Chelsea chic|Sloane Rangers]]", their typical "uniform" including a [[mackintosh]], [[ballet shoes]], trousers, a [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] sweater, and accessories such as a "[[Birkin bag]]" and a [[Pierre Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] Tank Française wrist-[[watch]].&lt;ref&gt;Carola Long in ''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  To a large extent, it refers to upper-class, or upper-middle-class, young men and women who are well-bred, or appear so, with good bones, slim bodies, and a sophisticated, but restrained and elegant, sense of style. In the U.S., the [[Ralph Lauren]] sense of style would be the equivalent.

===Porn chic===
{{main|Porno chic}}
"Porn chic" was first applied to films such as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) and ''[[Emmanuelle]]'' (1974) which were commercially successful and thus tended to bring "soft" [[pornography]] into the mainstream. Subsequently it has been used to refer more generally to pornography in popular culture.

===Prairie chic===
Flat caps and floral dresses or aprons over jeans.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Daily Telegraph'', 16 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radical chic===
{{main|Radical chic}}
:Also known as ''Terrorist chic''
First coined by journalist [[Tom Wolfe]] in 1970, '''radical chic''' has since entered broad usage as a derogatory term for the pretentious adoption of [[Political radicalism|radical]] causes by [[Celebrity|celebrities]], [[socialite]]s, and [[Upper class|high society]].

===Rich-girl chic===
Said to be "oozed" by a New York socialite in Plum Sykes' ''The Debutante Divorcée'' (2006).

===Rock-girl chic===
"Rock-girl chic" has meant different things during differing periods of music and fashion, but was often associated with a hippie image and was similar enough as a phrase to the slightly patronising "rock chick" to convey a sense of being a "[[groupie]]". This and similar terms, such as "[[boho-chic#Boho-rock|boho-rock]]" (2006), were often applied to model [[Kate Moss]], about whom Rebecca Ley from Times Online wrote that "Kate veers effortlessly between rock-girl chic and dripping-in-diamonds elegance".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article687726.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Moss's relationship in 2005–7 with [[Pete Doherty]] of the group [[Babyshambles]] tended to emphasise the tag.

===Rural chic===
Applied by the ''Sunday Times'' to a fashion collection designed and modelled by [[Savannah Miller]], [[Cotswolds|Cotswold]]-based sister of actress and 2000s (decade) "[[boho-chic|boho]]-queen" [[Sienna Miller]], for the [[Hong Kong]] based label, [[Shanghai Tang]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shabby chic===
{{main|Shabby chic}}
The deliberate use of worn and shabby materials in interior design or fashion. The effect of [[Whitewash|limewashing]] timber-framed buildings has been described as "shabby chic".&lt;ref&gt;James Boutwood, letter, ''Country Life'', 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soldier chic===
:''See [[Military chic]]''

===Talitha Getty===
:''See [[List of chics#Hippie chic|Hippie chic]]''

===Terrorist chic===
:''See [[List of chics#Radical chic|Radical chic]]''

===Tropical Chic===
Tropical and Beach themed home accents that are influenced by island styles and tropical designs. Tropical Chic style includes modern appointments, yet casual island style living.&lt;ref&gt;''Tropical Chic Style, Home Decorating News'', 2 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waif Chic===
Characterized by crochet-knit tops, over-sized sweaters that hang loosely off a thin frame, flats, and circle-frame glasses that accentuate a doe-eyed appearance.  Waif chic first came to prominence in Cambridge, MA and is a popular look among college students and young professionals in the area.

===Wilderness chic===
{{main|Wilderness chic}}
Fashion trend inspired by clothing typical of [[hikers]], [[climbing|climbers]], and [[mountaineers]].

The '''Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain''' (''LTG'') is an [[Umbrella organisation]] promoting and supporting independent amateur [[theatre]] companies which have control over their own premises and produce drama of a high quality for the benefit of their communities. It has been credited with being pivotal in securing recognition for the theatrical contribution of little theatres in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Gunn"&gt;John Gunn, ''Acting for You'', page 119 (john gunn), 2006, {{ISBN|0-9775899-3-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9775899-3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Little Theatre Guild, was founded in 1946 to represent the views of Amateur theatres across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littletheatreguild.org Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; Its original membership was nine&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Hartnoll, ''Performing Arts'', page 310, Omega Books, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; with groups such as The Crescent Theatre, Highbury Little Theatre and The Questors taking a leading part in its foundation.&lt;ref name="Gunn"/&gt; By 1988 this had increased to 30 and by 2010 to 103 theatre companies, some of which are outside of the UK. The major restriction for membership is that it is open only to those amateur theatres that own or lease the theatre premises upon which productions are mounted. 

Similar to the [[National Drama Festivals Association]], the LTG organises festivals of amateur drama across the United Kingdom.

(Pan Macmillan), 2003, {{ISBN|1-4050-0098-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4050-0098-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding Members==
The original co-founder members included; Bradford Civic Playhouse, [[Crescent Theatre]], Great Hucklow Players, [[Highbury Theatre]] (formerly  Highbury Little Theatre), Leicester Drama Society, Norwich Players, People's Theatre, [[The Questors Theatre]] and the Un-named Society. Some of these theatres have undergone name changes since they were formed and some have sadly been dissolved.

==Aims of the Guild==
The aims of the Guild are: 

* To extend close co-operation between members in all areas of theatre; to organise national and regional [[meeting|conferences]] and [[seminars]].
* To run regular courses to improve standards and theatrical knowledge.
* To act as the co-ordinating body for the development of little theatres, and to lobby on their behalf on matters of national interest, such as [[Taxation]], [[Charitable organisation|Charity]] status, [[licensing]], [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]], [[insurance]] and [[royalties]].
* To help and improve relationships with [[local authorities]] and [[regional arts associations]].
* To provide a forum for the exchange of ideas [[regionally]], [[nationally]] and [[internationally]].
* To ensure that the voice of the little theatre movement is heard strongly within national and [[international bodies]], including the [[Central Council for Amateur Theatre]] (CCAT) and the [[International Theatre Exchange]] (ITE).

The Guild holds two National Conferences each year and is organised on a regional basis for the arrangement of additional conferences, seminars and [[training]] events.

'''Lucy Kirkwood''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRSL}} (born in [[Leytonstone]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/lucy-kirkwood-britains-brightest-young-stage-writer-1809848.html Profile in the ''Independent'', 27 October 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; 1984) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] playwright and screenwriter. She is writer in residence at [[Clean Break (theatre company)|Clean Break]]. 
In June 2018 Kirkwood was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in its "40 Under 40" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/28/royal-society-of-literature-40-under-40-fellows|title=Royal Society of Literature admits 40 new fellows to address historical biases|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2018-06-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early Life==
Kirkwood was raised in east London and has a degree in English Literature from the [[University of Edinburgh]] where she performed as part of improvisational comedy troupe, the [[Improverts]] and wrote for the [[Edinburgh University Theatre Company]].

In 2005, she wrote and starred in her first play, ''Grady Hot Potato'', at the [[Bedlam Theatre]]. It was also selected for the [[National Student Drama Festival]].
==Career==
===Plays===
The following year she took two productions of her second play, ''Geronimo'' to the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]], under the title ''The Umbilical Project''. The two plays, ''Cut'' and ''Uncut'', were an experiment in cutting the cord between writer and production. ''Uncut'' was directed by Kirkwood herself and ''Cut'' by a completely separate company under the direction of Matt Addicott. No contact was made between the two companies during the rehearsal period, prompting the tag line "Two casts, two crews, two directors, two venues, one new play... no communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Smith | first =Rebecca | coauthors =| title =The Umbilical Project: Cut &amp; Uncut Reviews| work =| pages =| language =| publisher =The Edinburgh Guide| date =2007-08-07| url =http://www.edinburghguide.com/festival/2006/fringe/review_theatre.php?page=u| accessdate =2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her third play ''Guns or Butter'', about soldiers being overcome by the horror of war, was written for the Terror 2007 Festival at the [[Union Theatre (London)|Union Theatre]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Smith | first =Alistair | coauthors =| title =Terror 2007| work =| pages =| language =| publisher =The Stage| date =2007-10-22| url =http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/18590/terror-2007| accessdate =2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tinderbox'', a dark comedy set in a fictional 21st Century [[England]], premiered at the [[Bush Theatre]] in 2008. It starred [[Jamie Foreman]] and [[Sheridan Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title =Tinderbox| work =| pages =| language =| publisher =The Bush Theatre| date =2008-04-23| url =http://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/productions/tinderbox.html#reviews| accessdate =2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year she also contributed to the Bush's ''50 Ways To Leave Your Lover''. Her version of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'', titled ''Hedda'', premiered at London's [[Gate Theatre (London)|Gate Theatre]] in 2008 to favourable reviews.

Kirkwood's promenade play about sex trafficking, ''It Felt Empty When The Heart Went At First But It Is Alright Now'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcolatheatre.com/?action=showtemplate&amp;sid=367]&lt;/ref&gt; was produced by Clean Break Theatre at the [[Arcola Theatre]]. Her short horror piece ''Psychogeography'' premiered at the Bush in 2008 and was revived at [[Southwark Playhouse]]. She is under commission to the Manhattan Theatre Club to write a science play.

Her play ''NSFW'' premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], starring [[Janie Dee]] and [[Julian Barrett]] and directed by [[Simon Godwin]], in October 2012.

Her play ''[[Chimerica (play)|Chimerica]]'' examines the relationship between the US and China since the  [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] through the eyes of a former activist, and features over forty scene changes and British-Chinese actors. The play opened at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in May 2013 and transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]] in August 2013. The play's title echoes the portmanteau word '[[Chimerica]]', invented by economists to define the intertwined economies of the US and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Chimerica| work =Time Out Film, London| pages =| publisher =Time Out, London| date =7 November 2012| url =http://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/chimerica| accessdate =28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play won 2014 [[Olivier Awards]] for best new play, best director (Lyndsey Turner), best lighting (Tim Lutkin and Finn Ross), best sound (Carolyn Downing) and best set design (Es Devlin).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Mark.

Kirkwood's play ''[[The Children (play)|The Children]]'' opened at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in November 2016, directed by James Macdonald and starring [[Ron Cook]], [[Francesca Annis]] and [[Deborah Findlay]], receiving positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/the-children/] royalcourttheatre.com&lt;/ref&gt; The production transferred to the [[Samuel J.

'''Marius Alexander Jacques Bauer''' (25 January 1867 &amp;ndash; 18 July 1932) was a Dutch painter, etcher and lithographer, best known for his  [[Orientalism|Oriental]] scenes. His style was largely [[Impressionistic]], although it also derived to some extent from the [[Hague School]]. Many of his works were based on photographs he bought during his travels, some of which were by famous photographers such as [[Félix Bonfils]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[The Hague]]. His father was a stage painter who encouraged his son's early interest in drawing. From 1878 to 1885, he studied at the [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague|Royal Academy of Art]], under the direction of [[Jan Philip Koelman]], but thought his approach was too conservative and left without graduating.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Biography and timeline @ the Marius Bauer website (see external links).&lt;/ref&gt; While there, his works were awarded several medals and he received a stipend from King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]], which enabled him to study independently.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://www.schilderijen-site.nl/woordenboek/marius-bauer/ Brief biography] @ Schilderijen Site.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bauer-Prayer.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Adhan|Call to Prayer]]]]
In 1888, he made a study trip to [[Istanbul]], financed by the art dealership, Van Wisselingh &amp; Co., and decided to make Orientalism his principal subject.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Later, he made numerous trips to Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, India, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies, sketching and collecting items for Van Wisselingh. He also worked as an illustrator for the short-lived literary journal, ''{{ill|De Kroniek|nl}}'', attending the coronation of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on its  behalf.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

In 1894, he won a first-class medal at the [[Exposition Internationale d'Anvers (1894)|Exposition Internationale d'Anvers]]. Two years later, he was awarded the [[Willink van Collenprijs]]. He received the Grand Prix at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]]. In 1902 he married the painter [[Jo Bauer-Stumpff|Jo Stumpff]], one of the [[Amsterdamse Joffers]].&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; This was followed by a successful showing at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]. He would continue to exhibit regularly throughout Europe and North America.

In 1900, he was named a [[Ridder (title)|Ridder]] in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]]. Six years later, he was upgraded to an Officer for his contributions to the [[Rembrandt]] Tri-centennial.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; In 1911, King [[Albert I of Belgium]] awarded him the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] and, in 1927, he became a Ridder in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]]. He was a long-standing member of the [[Pulchri Studio]] and [[Arti et Amicitiae]]. In 1930, he became an honorary member of the [[Senefelder Club]].&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;  Two years later, he died of a stroke. A street is named after him in the neighborhood of streets dedicated to 19th- and 20th-century Dutch painters in [[Overtoomse Veld]], Amsterdam.

In 1996, the "Bauer Documentatie Stichting" (BDS) was established. Its goal is to raise awareness of his works and do more research on the sources of his paintings.

'''''Men at Birth''''' is an award-winning book from [[Australian]] writer [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]].

The book is an edited [[anthology]] of [[childbirth|birth]] experiences, written by men.  The experiences described are diverse, ranging from [[caesarean]] births and [[Vaginal Birth After Caesarean|VBAC]] births, to births that take place at [[homebirth|home]] and in a [[birth centre]] or [[labour ward]].

[[Steve Biddulph]] stated:

:: ''On a big journey into the unknown, you need people who have been there, who know the practicalities, as well as the emotions, new and strange, that go with it.  This book of men telling the stories of their children's births is a gift; an unbelievable resource with more trust, honesty and helpful information than you might find in a hundred years of conversations.''

The book has caused some controversy with its view that men who are poorly prepared for birth should not attend the birth of their child, as it may make the birth more difficult for the woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Dads at Delivery'', in "Pregnancy and Birth", July/Aug 2007, p33, E-Map Publishing, Sydney, Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.women24.com/Fairlady/Display/FLYArticleTease/0,,806_18735,00.html ''Should Dads be in the Delivery Room?'' in ''Fairlady'' May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/stories/s2299142.htm ''Unleashed - Men at Birth'' - ABC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2007 ''Men at Birth'' was the winner of the [[ACT Writing and Publishing Awards]] for Best Non-fiction Book of the Year. The award was made by [[Jon Stanhope]].&lt;ref&gt;''Canberra Times'', 14 Dec 2007, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhlenberg Greene Architects, Ltd.''' is a full-service architecture firm, in continuous operation since 1920, and was one of the predominant architecture/engineering firms in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], during the first half of the 20th century.

Muhlenberg Greene Architects  was originally established in 1920 as '''Frederick A. Muhlenberg, Registered Architect'''.  Since its founding, Muhlenberg Greene Architects lists over 3,500 commissions to its credit,&lt;ref&gt;Muhlenberg Greene Architects. [http://mg-architects.com/history "History"], ''Muhlenberg Greene Architects'', Retrieved on 13 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; including many landmarks in the city of [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], such as [[Shillington, Pennsylvania|Berks Heim]], the [[Medical Arts Building (Reading, Pennsylvania)|Reading Medical Arts Building]], and [[George Baer Hiester|Stokesay Castle]].

== Founder ==

The original founder of Muhlenberg Greene Architects, [[Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg]] II, [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects|FAIA]] was renowned for his endeavors in [[architecture]], politics, community, social services, and the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=F.A.

Frequently confused with the [[Muhlenberg Brothers]], an architecture/engineering firm also operating in Reading, Pennsylvania during the first half of the 20th century, Muhlenberg Greene Architects was never affiliated with Muhlenberg Brothers’ firm, although [[Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg|Frederick Muhlenberg]] does have familial ties with the Brothers.

Officially retiring from the firm in 1977,&lt;ref name=retire&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Heather|title=Architect Redesigns Work|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pN0hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=raAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=stokesay%20muhlenberg-greene&amp;pg=5479%2C6543649|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=30 Oct 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;  one week after his 90th birthday, Mr. Muhlenberg still came to the office daily until physical limitations prevented him from doing so about a year later.  [[Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg|Fred Muhlenberg]] died on January 19, 1980, at 92 years of age.

== Present organization ==

Following Mr. Muhlenberg's retirement in 1977, the Firm became the sole proprietorship of Lawrence A. Greene, Jr, (who had, at that time, been a partner of the firm for 25 years)&lt;ref name=retire /&gt; until January 1, 1980 when the present corporation, Muhlenberg Greene Architects, Ltd., was established.  The original principals/stockholders were Lawrence (Larry) A. Greene, Howard Quaintance, and James (Jim) E. Dockey.  In 1983, Dennis W. Rex was added as a principal/stockholder of the Firm.  In 1998, John R. Hill became a principal/stockholder.  The current principals are Larry Greene, Howard Quaintance, Dennis W. Rex, and John R. Hill.  Muhlenberg Greene Architects, Ltd. is a member of the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[U.S. Green Building Council]],&lt;ref name=LEED&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory: Muhlenberg Greene Architects, Ltd.|url=http://www.usgbc.org/organizations/muhlenberg-greene-architects-ltd|publisher=USGBC|accessdate=10 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and many of the staff are [[LEED Professional Exams|LEED Accredited Professionals]].

A '''music video director''' is the head of [[music video]] production. The [[theatre director|director]] conceives of videos' [[art]]istic and [[drama]]tic aspects while instructing the musical act, [[film crew|technical crew]], [[actor]]s, [[model (profession)|models]], and [[dancer]]s. They may or may not be in collaboration with the musical act.

On November 8, 1992, [[MTV]] began listing directors with the artist,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} song, and record company credits, because music videos had increasingly become an [[auteur]]'s medium. "The case for the director as music video author is strong. It is the music video director who has principal control of everything that is added to the pre-existing recorded sound text."&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Thompson and Gary Burns, eds. (1990). ''Making Television: Authorship and the Production Process'', p.177. {{ISBN|9780275927462}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Directors, including [[Michel Gondry]], [[Spike Jonze]], and [[F. Gary Gray]], have gone on to direct feature films, continuing a trend that had begun earlier with directors such as [[Lasse Hallström]] and [[David Fincher]]. The most expensive video of all time was directed by [[Mark Romanek]]: [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] and [[Janet Jackson]]'s "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]" (1995), which cost $7 million to produce.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 2003, Spike Jonze, [[Chris Cunningham]], and Michel Gondry founded the [[Directors Label]].

'''''Nihonga''''' ({{lang|ja|日本画}}, "[[Japan]]ese-style paintings") are [[Japanese painting]]s from about 1900 onwards that have been made in accordance with traditional Japanese artistic conventions, techniques and materials. While based on traditions over a thousand years old, the term was coined in the [[Meiji period]] of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]], to distinguish such works from Western-style paintings, or ''[[Yōga]]'' ({{lang|ja|洋画}}).

== History ==
The impetus for reinvigorating traditional painting by developing a more modern Japanese style came largely from many artist/educators, which included; [[Shiokawa Bunrin]], [[Kōno Bairei]], [[Tomioka Tessai]], and [[art critic]]s [[Okakura Tenshin]] and [[Ernest Fenollosa]] who attempted to combat [[Meiji period|Meiji Japan's]] infatuation with Western culture by emphasizing to the Japanese the importance and beauty of native Japanese traditional arts. These two men played important roles in developing the curricula at major art schools, and actively encouraged and patronized artists.

''Nihonga'' was not simply a continuation of older painting traditions. In comparison with ''[[Yamato-e]]'' the range of subjects was broadened. Moreover, stylistic and technical elements from several traditional schools, such as the ''[[Kanō school|Kanō-ha]],'' ''[[Rinpa school|Rinpa]]'' and ''[[Maruyama Ōkyo]]'' were blended together. The distinctions that had existed among schools in the [[Edo period]] were minimized.

However, in many cases ''Nihonga'' artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although ''Nihonga'' form a distinct category within the Japanese annual [[Japan Art Academy|Nitten]] exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between ''Nihonga'' and ''Yōga''.

The artist [[Tenmyouya Hisashi]] has (b. 1966) developed a new art concept in 2001 called "Neo-Nihonga".

=== Development outside Japan ===
''Nihonga'' has a following around the world; notable ''Nihonga'' artists who are not based in Japan are [[Hiroshi Senju]], , [[United States|American]] artists [[Makoto Fujimura]] and Judith Kruger, and [[Miyuki Tanobe]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judithkruger.com/|title=SELECTED WORK|publisher=Judith Kruger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Indian artist Madhu Jain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madhujain.com|title=Madhu Jain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwanese artist Yiching Chen teaches workshops in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yiching.free.fr/|title=NIHONGA - Peinture japonaise YICHINGCHEN|first=|last=YICHINGCHEN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Judith Kruger initiated and taught the course "Nihonga: Then and Now" at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Savannah, Georgia Department of Cultural Affairs.

Contemporary Nihonga has been the mainstay of New York's Dillon Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dillongallery.com|title=EXHIBITIONS|publisher=Dillon + Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key artists from the "golden age of post war Nihonga" from 1985 to 1993 based at Tokyo University of the Arts have produced global artists whose training in Nihonga has served as a foundation. [[Takashi Murakami]], [[Hiroshi Senju]], Norihiko Saito, Chen Wenguang, Keizaburo Okamura and [[Makoto Fujimura]] are the leading artists exhibiting globally, all coming out of the distinguished Doctorate level curriculum at Tokyo University of the Arts. Most of these artists are represented by Dillon Gallery.

== Materials ==
''Nihonga'' are typically executed on ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper) or ''eginu'' ([[silk]]), using brushes. The paintings can be either monochrome or polychrome. If monochrome, typically ''[[Inkstick|sumi]]'' (Chinese ink) made from [[soot]] mixed with a glue from fishbone or animal hide is used. If polychrome, the [[pigment]]s are derived from natural ingredients: [[mineral]]s, shells, [[coral]]s, and even [[Gemstone|semi-precious stone]]s like [[malachite]], [[azurite]] and [[cinnabar]]. The raw materials are powdered into 16 gradations from fine to sandy grain textures. A [[Animal glue#Hide glue|hide glue]] solution, called ''nikawa'', is used as a binder for these powdered pigments. In both cases, water is used; hence ''nihonga'' is actually a [[Watercolor painting|water-based medium]]. ''Gofun'' (powdered [[calcium carbonate]] that is made from cured [[oyster]], [[clam]] or [[scallop]] shells) is an important material used in ''nihonga''. Different kinds of ''gofun'' are utilized as a ground, for under-painting, and as a fine white top color.

Initially, ''nihonga'' were produced for hanging scrolls (''[[kakemono]]''), hand scrolls (''[[emakimono]]''), sliding doors (''[[fusuma]]'') or folding screens (''[[byōbu]]''). However, most are now produced on paper stretched onto wood panels, suitable for framing. Nihonga paintings do not need to be put under glass. They are archival for thousands of years.

== Techniques ==
In monochrome ''Nihonga'', the technique depends on the modulation of ink tones from darker through lighter to obtain a variety of shadings from near white, through grey tones to black and occasionally into greenish tones to represent trees, water, mountains or foliage. In polychrome ''Nihonga'', great emphasis is placed on the presence or absence of outlines; typically outlines are not used for depictions of birds or plants. Occasionally, [[wash (visual arts)|washes]] and layering of pigments are used to provide contrasting effects, and even more occasionally, [[gold]] or [[silver]] leaf may also be incorporated into the painting.

The screenplay by [[Elaine May]] was [[film adaptation|adapted]] from the novel [[Primary Colors (novel)|''Primary Colors: A Novel of Politics'']], a ''[[roman à clef]]'' about [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign in 1992]], which was originally published anonymously, but in 1996 was revealed to have been written by journalist [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]], who had been covering Clinton's campaign for ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref name="what the"&gt;{{cite news|title= What the Movie Gets —and What It Doesn't |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=David Lauter|date=March 15, 1998|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/15/entertainment/ca-28949|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="just what"&gt;{{cite news|title= Just What He Didn't Need Right Now; Movies: Will 'Primary Colors,' a thinly veiled slice of presidential life, hurt or help Bill Clinton? |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author=Faye Fiore|date=March 2, 1998|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/02/entertainment/ca-24508|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E6DB1F39F93BA25754C0A960958260 Columnist's Mea Culpa: I'm Anonymous], Doreen Carvajal, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The film starred [[John Travolta]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Maura Tierney]], [[Larry Hagman]] and [[Adrian Lester]]. 

It was critically acclaimed but was a [[box office bomb]], earning $52 million from a $65 million budget. Bates was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance, and May was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].

==Plot==
Young political idealist and grandson of a civil rights leader Henry Burton ([[Adrian Lester]]) is recruited to join the campaign of Jack Stanton ([[John Travolta]]), a charismatic Southern governor who is trying to win the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for [[President of the United States]]. Henry is impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton ([[Emma Thompson]]); ruthless political strategist Richard Jemmons ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]); intelligent and attractive spokeswoman Daisy Green ([[Maura Tierney]]); and sly political operator Howard Ferguson ([[Paul Guilfoyle]]) as they journey to [[New Hampshire]], the first state to hold a [[New Hampshire primary|presidential primary]].  
  
After Stanton completes an impressive debate performance against his Democratic rivals, Henry’s ex-girlfriend shows up to question Stanton about his arrest for an anti-war protest during the [[1968 Democratic Convention]] in Chicago. In addition it's revealed that Stanton called a U.S. senator to help him get released then Stanton persuaded the mayor of Chicago to have his police record expunged. The team becomes worried that Stanton’s past indiscretions may be used against him by the press and his political opponents. They hire Jack and Susan's old friend, tough but unbalanced Libby Holden ([[Kathy Bates]]), to investigate allegations that could be used by Stanton's political opponents to undermine his candidacy such as Stanton's notorious womanizing. One of Stanton's mistresses and Susan's hairdresser, Cashmere McLeod ([[Gia Carides]]), produces secret taped conversations between them to prove they had an affair. Henry discovers that the tapes have been doctored, so Libby tracks down the man responsible for the tapes and forces him at gunpoint to confess his guilt in a signed letter to the American public.

The campaign is then rocked by a fresh allegation when Stanton's old friend, "Big Willie" McCollister ([[Tommy Hollis]]) approaches Henry to tell him that his 17-year-old daughter Loretta (who worked for the Stantons as a babysitter) is pregnant and that Stanton is the father. Henry and Howard tell Willie he must allow his daughter to undergo an [[amniocentesis]] to determine paternity. Although they convince Willie to remain silent on the issue, Henry is nonetheless sickened and disillusioned with the experience.

Realizing the campaign is falling behind in the polls, Stanton's team adopt a new strategy. Stanton begins going on the offensive by attacking his nearest rival, Senator Lawrence Harris ([[Kevin Cooney]]) for casting anti-[[Israel]] votes and favoring cuts in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Harris confronts Stanton during a radio talk show in Florida but suffers two heart attacks after the encounter. He suffers a medical setback, subsequently withdraws from the race, and is replaced by his friend, former Florida governor Fred Picker ([[Larry Hagman]]). Picker's wholesome, straight-talking image proves an immediate threat to the Stanton campaign.  
 
Jack and Susan send Henry and Libby on an [[opposition research]] mission on Picker's past. They discover from his ex-brother-in-law, Eduardo Reyes ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), that Picker had a [[cocaine]] addiction as governor, which led to the disintegration of his first marriage. They also meet with Picker's cocaine supplier Lorenzo Delgado ([[John Vargas]]), with whom Picker had a [[homosexual]] affair. Not expecting the information to ever be used, Libby and Henry share their findings with Jack and Susan, but are dismayed when they both decide to leak the information to the press. Libby says that if Jack does so, she will reveal that he tampered with the results of the paternity test, proving that he slept with Willie's daughter. Libby commits suicide after she realizes she spent her life idealizing Jack and Susan only to learn how flawed they truly are. Racked with guilt over Libby's death, Stanton takes the incriminating information to Picker, and apologizes for seeking it out. Picker admits to his past indiscretions, and agrees to withdraw from the race and to endorse Stanton. Henry intends to quit the campaign, admitting he has become deeply disillusioned with the whole political process. Stanton begs Henry to reconsider, persuading him that the two of them can make history.

Months later, President Stanton is dancing at the Inaugural Ball with [[First Lady]], Susan. He shakes the hands of all his campaign staff, the last of whom is Henry.

==Production==

Following the publication of the book in 1996, director Mike Nichols paid more than $1 million for the screen rights.&lt;ref name="contemporary"/&gt; The film was scripted by Elaine May, who had collaborated with Nichols in a [[Nichols and May|comedy double-act]] in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref name="Nichols &amp; May"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kashner|first1=Sam|title=Who’s Afraid Of Nichols &amp; May?|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/01/nichols-and-may-reunion-exclusive|website=Vanity Fair|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Cannes Festival]], Thompson said she did not base her performance on [[Hillary Clinton]], while Travolta said he based his on several presidents, but mostly on [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="travolta reveals"/&gt;

Nichols was criticized for cutting an interracial love scene from the final version of the film. He responded that he had removed the scene because of unfavorable reactions from a preview audience.&lt;ref name="travolta reveals"/&gt;

The film also generated controversy for its depiction of a Clinton-like character as it was also released close to the [[Lewinsky scandal]].&lt;ref name="what the"/&gt;&lt;ref name="american themes"&gt;{{cite news|title= With Its American Themes, Can 'Primary Colors' Cash In Abroad? |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 16, 1998|author=Mark Saylor|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/16/entertainment/ca-50153|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="they all"&gt;{{cite news|title= They All Have a Secret |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 15, 1998|author=Patrick Goldstein|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/15/entertainment/ca-28947|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cinema"&gt;{{cite news|title= Cinema: True Colors|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Richard Corliss and Jeffrey Ressner|date=March 16, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tale of"&gt;{{cite news|title= Cinema: Tale Of Two Bills|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Eric Pooley|date=March 16, 1998|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987986,00.html|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received a positive reception from critics. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety']]''s reviewer called it a "[[film à clef]]" and said that the American public was likely to accept it as a factual account because it so closely mirrored real life characters and events.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave high marks to the movie, noting Travolta's close mirroring of [[Bill Clinton]], but describing Thompson's character as actually not based on [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref name= "inspired insinuation"/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called Travolta "Clintonian".&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' gave accolades to the character portrayals of Bill and Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name="landslide"/&gt; Syndicated reviewer [[Roger Ebert]] said the movie was "insightful and very wise about the realities of political life"&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; and ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' said the film was a "nuanced dissection of how real American politics work".&lt;ref name="landslide"/&gt;

In a negative review, Jeff Vice of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' wrote that the last half of the movie dragged, Travolta's performance seemed more like an impersonation than actual acting, the movie lacked subtlety or depth, and it was loaded with cheap and obvious jokes. Nevertheless, Vice wrote that "solid support is provided by Maura Tierney, Larry Hagman, and Stacy Edwards".&lt;ref name="deseret"/&gt;

''Primary Colors'' currently holds an 80% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 75 reviews.

===Box office===
The film earned a disappointing box office gross,&lt;ref name="grease beats"&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Grease' Beats 'Primary' but Doesn't Rock the Boat; Box office: Revived musical enjoys a $13-million opening, but Oscar-winner 'Titanic' is No. 1 for the 15th straight weekend. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 30, 1998|author=Robin Rauzi|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/30/entertainment/ca-34154|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tail titanic"&gt;{{cite news|title= Travolta Films Tail 'Titanic' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 31, 1998|author=Robert W.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack album, featuring music by and produced by [[Ry Cooder]], was released in March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard - 28 Mar 1998 - Page 55 "VARIOUS ARTISTS Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack Primary Colors; Music By Ry Cooder"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holger Petersen - Talking Music - 2011 -Page 296 "Movie soundtracks, however, kept him creative, at home, and paying the bills. ... That led to Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas; Buena Vista Social Club), Louis Malle (Alamo Bay), and Mike Nichols (Primary Colors) asking him to soundtrack their films"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rock the Vote''' is a [[non-profit organization]], progressive-aligned group in the [[United States]] whose stated mission is "to engage and build the political power of young people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.rockthevote.com/about-us/|publisher=Rock The Vote|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was founded in 1990 by Virgin Records America Co-Chairman Jeff Ayeroff,  to encourage young people to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Contrera|first1=Jessica|title=Lil Jon and Lena Dunham team up to take on what Madonna and Chuck D pioneered|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/10/07/lil-jon-and-lena-dunham-team-up-to-take-on-what-madonna-and-chuck-d-pioneered/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is geared toward increasing voter turnout among voters ages 18 to 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lurie|first1=Stephen|title=Millennial turnout is crucial.

==History==
Rock the Vote was founded in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff with Virgin America co Chair Jordan Harris and Virgin Executive Beverly Lund.  Later they hired Jodi Uttal and then  [[Steve Barr (educational innovator)|Steve Barr]], a campaign worker and political fundraiser, who became "co-founders" for their contribution to Rock the Vote.
Rock the Vote supported the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]], commonly referred to as the "motor voter" bill, which expanded access to voter registration. It was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]]. The law requires state governments to offer voter registration opportunities to any eligible person who applies for or renews a driver's license or public assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cloward|first1=Richard|last2=Pivin|first2=Frances Scott|title=Why Americans Still Don't Vote: And why Politicians Want it that Way|date=2000|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807004494|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Rock the Vote created the first telephone voter registration system, 1-800-REGISTER, followed by the first online voter-registration system, NetVote, later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flanagin|first1=Jake|title=Here’s Why You Should Turn Out and Rock the Vote|url=http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/heres-why-you-should-turn-out-and-rock-the-vote/?_r=0|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We supported Rock the Vote," said [[Radiohead]]'s [[Thom Yorke]], "but – because of the way the whole political system works – it does seem rather odd to be choosing between one unworkable, outdated system and another. We need to go beyond that – because, at the moment, it's just [[Cowboys and Indians (disambiguation)|Cowboys and Indians]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Caitlin |last= [[Caitlin Moran|Moran]] |title= Everything was just fear. |magazine= ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' |date= July 1997 |page= 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[CNN]], Rock the Vote organized "America Rocks the Vote," a 2003 Democratic presidential candidates forum at [[Faneuil Hall]] in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNN, Rock the Vote to co-sponsor Democratic candidate forum|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/01/elec04.prez.rock.vote/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=CNN|date=October 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock the Vote has expressed support for a [[public health insurance option]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattera|first1=Jason|title=Obama Zombies: How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed My Generation|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781439172094|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; It signed on to [[Health Care for America NOW!]], a progressive political coalition that supported passage of the [[Affordable Care Act]]. In 2009, Rock the Vote ran a campaign encouraging people to refuse to have sex with those who opposed what they regarded as a reform of American health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock the Vote Asks Supporters to Withhold Sex to Pass Health Care Reform|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/21/rock-vote-asks-supporters-withhold-sex-pass-health-care-reform/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Fox News|date=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Rock the Vote drew criticism from [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] officials such as [[Republican National Committee]] chairman [[Ed Gillespie]] for sending a mock [[military draft|draft]] notice to over 600,000 e-mail addresses. The message included the words "[[Selective Service System]]" and read "You are hereby ordered for induction into the Armed Forces of the United States, and to report to a polling place near you" on November 2, ([[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]). The Rock the Vote logo and a facsimile of [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s signature appeared at the bottom of the message. In addition, Rock the Vote created [[public service announcement]]s featuring the subject of the draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rock The Vote, MTV Irk GOP|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65818/rock-the-vote-mtv-irk-gop|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Billboard Magazine|date=November 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisto|first1=Christine|title=Rock the Democratic Vote|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/389978/rock-democratic-vote-christine-sisto|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=National Review|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides making the PSAs available to large cable systems, they also paid to run them on a random sample of small cable systems where they could measure the effects. Turnout was three percentage points higher among 18-19-year olds in these sample areas than in the control group covered by other similar small cable systems; there was less effect above age 22.&lt;ref name="vavreck"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Green |first=Donald P. |last2=Vavreck |first2=Lynn |date=2008 |title=Analysis of Cluster-Randomized Experiments: A Comparison of Alternative Estimation Approaches |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Green4/publication/31382310_Analysis_of_Cluster-Randomized_Experiments_A_Comparison_of_Alternative_Estimation_Approaches/links/00b4951f9a12acc282000000.pdf |journal=Political Analysis |language=en |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=138–152 |doi=10.1093/pan/mpm025 |issn=1047-1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Rock the Vote experienced financial problems in the aftermath of the 2004 election. It emerged from the election $700,000 in debt, and its president resigned in the summer of 2005 "amid disagreements about the organization's direction."&lt;ref name=hard/&gt;

In 2008, Rock the Vote ran the largest non-partisan youth voter registration drive in the nation's history by getting 2.6 million young voters registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGuirt|first1=Mary|title=Young Black Turnout a Record in 2008 Election|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=8140030|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=ABC News|date=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 and 2013 Rock the Vote experimented with Facebook ads to encourage voter turnout by telling people the number of days remaining until the election and which of their friends "liked" the countdown. The ads were shown to over 400,000 adults, randomly selected from a base over 800,000. Rock the Vote had helped many of them register. The ads did not increase turnout in the experimental group, compared to the control group who did not get the ads.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922072845 |title=Get out the vote : how to increase voter turnout |last=Green |first=Donald P. |isbn=081572568X |edition= Third |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=97–98, 101, 120–121 |oclc=922072845}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 they also experimented with text message reminders to 180,000 people who had provided their mobile numbers. Texts the day before the election raised turnout six tenths of a percentage point, while texts on election day lowered turnout.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

In advance of the 2014 elections, Rock the Vote released a video titled "Turn Out For What." It was a parody of [[Lil Jon]] and [[DJ Snake]]'s song "[[Turn Down for What]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Lena Dunham, Lil Jon Team for Rock the Vote's 'Turn Out for What' Video|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/lena-dunham-lil-jon-team-for-rock-the-votes-turn-out-for-what-video-20141007|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video sought to encourage youth voter turnout and featured [[reproductive rights]], [[marijuana legalization]], [[global warming]], [[LGBT rights]], student debt, [[gun control]] and [[deforestation]] as reasons why young people might want to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peligri|first1=Justin|title=Lil Jon and Lena Dunham 'Turn Out' in new Rock The Vote video|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/politics/new-rock-the-vote-video/|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=CNN|date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was criticized by some Republicans who said it had a disproportionate representation of liberal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Rock the Vote' celebrities called out for not voting in last mid-term election|url=http://abc7.com/politics/rock-the-vote-celebrities-called-out-for-not-voting/380155/|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=ABC News|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was also criticized because several of the celebrities who appeared in it, including [[Lena Dunham]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Natasha Lyonne]] and [[Darren Criss]], had not voted in the previous midterm election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lombardi|first1=Ken|title=Some Rock The Vote midterm PSA stars didn't vote in last midterm|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rock-the-vote-midterm-psa-celebrities-didnt-vote-in-last-midterm/|accessdate=24 April 2015|publisher=CBS News|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]], Rock the Vote President and Executive Director Carolyn DeWitt issued a statement on behalf of the organization expressing disappointment with the election of [[Donald Trump]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] congressional victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@RockTheVote/rock-the-vote-responds-to-2016-presidential-election-results-fac7a420c815|title=Rock the Vote Responds to 2016 Presidential Election Results|first=Rock the|last=Vote|date=9 November 2016|publisher=Medium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signatories to the original corporation papers (Sculptors Guild, Inc.) were Sonia Gordon Brown, [[Berta Margoulies]], Aaron J. Goodelman, [[Chaim Gross]] (who became the first President), Minna Harkavy, [[Milton Horn]], [[Concetta Scaravaglione]], Warren Wheelock, and [[William Zorach]]. The inaugural exhibit of the Guild was held April 12 - May 31, 1938, on a vacant lot at Park Avenue and 39th St. This outdoor exhibit, the first of its kind in New York City, hosted 40,000 visitors paying an admission price of ten cents to view the work. Owing to the tremendous success of this first exhibit, the Brooklyn Museum held an exhibit of contemporary American sculpture by Guild members, October 21- November 27, 1938.

The Sculptors Guild continues today as an advocacy organization with a diverse membership. Activities have expanded to include the annual “dressing” of the windows of Saks 5th Avenue, NYC, and participation in exhibitions abroad, such as the 1993 exhibition in Kyoto, Japan, and the 2008 international art fairs at Art Cologne and Supermarket Stockholm. The Sculptors Guild has a presence on New York’s historic Governors Island, with annual indoor and outdoor exhibitions, carving workshops and gallery talks. In 2010 the Sculptors Guild opened a gallery space and office on the second floor in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]]. In September 2016, they moved into an office space on the second floor at the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation, in [[Greenwich Village]] at 256 LaGuardia Place, NY, NY 10012 and continue to have summer exhibitions on Governors Island. 

2017 will be the Sculptor Guild's 80th year, and will be celebrated with a momentous member exhibition curated by [[John Yau]] at the historic [[Westbeth Gallery]] for the month of February. This exhibition will include past and current members highlighting the vast forms of sculpture members have explored over past 80 years. 

Membership is by invitation and/or submission to the Admissions Committee.

'''''Sleeping Beauty''''' is a 1959 American animated [[musical film|musical]] [[fantasy film]] produced by [[Walt Disney]] based on ''[[Sleeping Beauty|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' by [[Charles Perrault]]. The 16th [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated feature film]], it was released to theaters on January 29, 1959, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. This was the last Disney adaptation of a fairy tale for some years because of its initial mixed critical reception and underperformance at the box office; the studio did not return to the genre until 30 years later, after Walt Disney died in 1966, with the release of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989).

It features the voices of [[Mary Costa]], [[Eleanor Audley]], [[Verna Felton]], [[Barbara Luddy]], [[Barbara Jo Allen]], [[Bill Shirley]], [[Taylor Holmes]], and [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]].

The film was directed by [[Les Clark]], [[Eric Larson]], and [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], under the supervision of [[Clyde Geronimi]], with additional story work by Joe Rinaldi, [[Winston Hibler]], [[Bill Peet]], [[Ted Sears]], [[Ralph Wright]], and Milt Banta. The film's musical score and songs, featuring the work of the [[Munich Symphony Orchestra|Graunke Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[George Bruns]], are arrangements or adaptations of numbers from the 1890 [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|''Sleeping Beauty'' ballet]] by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. However, unlike the previous feature-films, this was the first Disney feature-film that did not have the same background animation material, but instead with new background animation material.

''Sleeping Beauty'' was the first animated film to be photographed in the [[Super Technirama 70]] [[widescreen]] process, as well as the second full-length animated feature film to be filmed in anamorphic widescreen, following Disney's own ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' four years earlier. The film was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in first-run engagements.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
After many childless years, King Stefan and Queen Leah happily welcome the birth of their daughter, the Princess [[Aurora (Disney)|Aurora]]. They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess and at the gathering for her [[Baptism|christening]] she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the young son of King Stefan's best friend King Hubert, so that their kingdoms will be forever [[Jure uxoris|united]].

Among the guests are the three [[Fairy|good fairies]], [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]], who have come to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. But before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil witch [[Maleficent]] appears, only to be told that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil witch [[curse]]s the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] of a [[spinning wheel]] and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to undo the curse. Unfortunately, they are not powerful enough to do so, but Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by [[Romantic love|true love]]'s first kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels throughout the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that it will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so, with the reluctant acceptance of King Stefan and Queen Leah, they bring her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.

Years later, Aurora, renamed Briar Rose, has grown into a beautiful young woman. On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the three fairies ask her to gather berries in the forest so they can prepare a surprise party for her. Aurora befriends the animals of the forest and sings them a song, ''[[Once Upon a Dream (Sleeping Beauty song)|Once Upon a Dream]]''. While singing in the forest, Aurora attracts the attention of Phillip, now a handsome young man. He races to find the origin of the beautiful voice and is instantly struck by Aurora's grace and beauty. Aurora at first is frightened at his sudden appearance, as she is not allowed to talk to strangers, but Phillip soon puts her at ease. They instantly fall in love, unaware of being promised in marriage sixteen years ago. Aurora asks Phillip to come to her cottage that evening and meet her family.

Meanwhile, Flora and Merryweather argue over the color of Aurora's ball gown, which attracts the attention of Maleficent's raven, revealing the location of Aurora. Back at home, Aurora is thrilled to tell her guardians that she met a man and fell in love with him. The fairies finally tell Aurora the truth about her royal heritage, that she is a princess and already betrothed at birth to a prince, and tell her she must never see the man she met again. Heartbroken, she cries in her room. Meanwhile, Phillip tells his father of a peasant girl he met and wishes to marry in spite of his prearranged marriage to Aurora. King Hubert fails to convince his son otherwise, leaving him in equal disappointment.

Later that night, the fairies take Aurora back to the castle and leave her alone in a room to wait for her birthday celebrations where she will finally get to see her parents. Maleficent then appears and magically lures Aurora into a dark tower room away from the fairies and tricks the princess into touching the spindle of a cursed spinning wheel. Aurora pricks her finger, fulfilling the curse. The three fairies place Aurora on a bed in the highest tower and place a powerful spell on all the people in the kingdom, causing them to fall asleep until the spell on their princess is broken. While doing so, they overhear a sleepy conversation between the two kings. From King Hubert's conversation with King Stefan, the fairies realize that Phillip is the man with whom Aurora has fallen in love. They rush to find him, but he is abducted by Maleficent who is waiting for him at the cottage in the forest. She shows Phillip the peasant girl he fell in love with is the now-sleeping princess. She tells him she plans to keep him locked away for a century until he's an old man on the verge of death, then release him to meet his love, who will not have even aged a single day.

The fairies find and release Phillip, arming him with the magical Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue. An enraged Maleficent tries to stop Phillip by surrounding Stefan's castle with thorns, but fails. She then teleports herself in front of him and transforms into a gigantic dragon. Eventually, Phillip throws the sword, blessed by the fairies' magic, directly into Maleficent's heart, causing her to fall to her death.

Phillip awakens Aurora with a kiss, breaking the spell and thereby waking everyone in the castle. The royal couple descends to the ballroom, where Aurora is happily reunited with her parents, while King Hubert is confused of how the two young royals met. Flora and Merryweather resume their petty argument over the color of Aurora's ball gown, magically changing it from blue to pink while the happy couple waltzes. The last color to appear is pink. The scene then fades to Aurora and Phillip dancing then kissing on a cloud. They all live happily ever after.

[[Eric Larson]] did not animate any of the characters for the film; instead, he directed the entire "Forest" sequence which stretches from Briar Rose (a.k.a. Aurora) wandering through the forest with her animal friends all the way to Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose running back home, promising Phillip they will meet again later in the evening. This was the only time Larson directed a sequence or a film during his tenure at [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]].

==Production==

===Story development===
Following the critical and commercial success of ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', writing for ''Sleeping Beauty'' began in early 1951. Partial story elements originated from discarded ideas for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' including Maleficent's capture of Prince Philip and his dramatic escape from her fortress and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' where a fantasy sequence featured the leading protagonists dancing on a cloud which was developed, but eventually dropped from the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian|title=A Brief History of Walt Disney|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mscBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50&amp;lpg=PT50&amp;dq=sleeping+beauty+snow+white+dancing+on+a+cloud&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BnX8TcwlwM&amp;sig=7tVg0Qw5VEiPgEIUvEern9k9yOs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwC2oVChMI1bKMqLmuyAIVQvKACh0nwA2v#v=onepage&amp;q=sleeping%20beauty%20snow%20white%20dancing%20on%20a%20cloud&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0762454754|publisher=Running Press|date=December 9, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of 1953, director [[Wilfred Jackson]] had recorded the dialogue, assembled a story reel, and was to commence for preliminary animation work where Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip were to meet in the forest and dance, though Walt Disney decided to throw out the sequence delaying the film from its initial 1955 release date.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}} For a number of months, Jackson, [[Ted Sears]], and two story writers underwent a rewrite of the story, which received a lukewarm response from Disney. During the story rewriting process, the story writers felt the original fairy tale's second act felt bizarre and with the wake-up kiss serving as a climactic moment, they decided to concentrate on the first half finding strength in the romance. However, they felt little romance was developed between the strange prince and the princess that the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which the king organized a treasure hunt. The idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline. Instead, it was written that Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora would meet in the forest by random chance while Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose was conversing with the forest animals. Additionally, because the original Perrault tale had the curse last one hundred years, the writers decided to shorten it a few hours with the time spent for Prince Phillip to battle the goons, overcome several obstacles, and fight off against Maleficent transformed into a dragon.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=104}}

The name given to the princess by her royal birth parents is "Aurora" ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "dawn"), as it was in the original Tchaikovsky ballet. This name occurred in [[Charles Perrault]]'s version as well, not as the princess's name, but as her daughter's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anne Heiner|first=Heidi|url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/notes.html#FORTY4|title=Annotations for Sleeping Beauty|publisher=SurLaLune Fairy Tales|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hiding, she is called Briar Rose, the name of the princess in the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s version variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#grimm|last=Ashliman|first=D.L.|authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|title=Little Brier-Rose|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prince was given the princely name most familiar to Americans in the 1950s: Prince Phillip. Named after [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], the character has the distinction of being the first Disney prince to have a name as the two princes in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' ([[Prince Charming|The Prince]]) and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' ([[Prince Charming]]) are never named.

In December 1953, Jackson suffered a heart attack, as a result of which directing animator [[Eric Larson]] of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] took over as director. By April 1954, ''Sleeping Beauty'' was scheduled for a February 1957 release.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}} With Larson as the director, Disney instructed Larson, whose unit would animate the forest sequence,&lt;ref name="Geronimi-interview"&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Geronimi/Geronimi.html|title=Gerry Geronimi - An Interview by Michael Barrier and Milton Gray|publisher=MichaelBarrier.com|subject=[[Clyde Geronimi]]|interviewer=Michael Barrier and Milton Gray|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the picture was to be a "moving illustration, the ultimate in animation" and added that he did not care how long it would take. Because of the delays, the release date was again pushed back from Christmas 1957 to Christmas 1958. Fellow Nine Old Men [[Milt Kahl]] would blame Walt for the numerous release delays because "he wouldn’t have story meetings. He wouldn't get the damn thing moving."{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=558–9}} Relatively late in production, Disney removed Larson as the supervising director and replaced him with [[Clyde Geronimi]].{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}}{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=560}} Directing animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] would join Geronimi as sequence director over the climactic dragon battle sequence commenting that "We took the approach that we were going to kill that damned prince!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Folkart|first=Burt|title=Wolfgang Reitherman, 75 : Disney Animator Dies in Car Crash|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-24/news/mn-17061_1_wolfgang-reitherman|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 24, 1985|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Les Clark]], another member of the Nine Old Men, would serve as the sequence director of the elaborate opening scene where crowds of the citizens in the kingdom arrive at the palace for the presentation of Princess Aurora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deja|first=Andreas|author-link=Andreas Deja|url= http://andreasdeja.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-art-of-sleeping-beauty.html|title=The Art of Sleeping Beauty|work=Deja View|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=January 3, 2013|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art direction===
The animation style moved away from the [[Rococo]] of ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' and also does not simply draw on fashion and female beauty standards of the time and draws upon distinctive visual combination of [[Medieval art]] imagery and [[Art Deco]] design which makes for a lush and nuanced visual experience.
Kay Neilsen–whose sketches were the basis for ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)#Program|Night on Bald Mountain]]'' in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''–was the first to produce styling sketches for the film in 1952.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=555}} The artistic style originated when [[John Hench]] observed the famed unicorn tapestries at [[the Cloisters]] located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in [[New York City]]. When Hench returned to the Disney studios, he brought reproductions of the tapestries and showed them to Walt Disney, who replied, "Yeah, we could use that style for ''Sleeping Beauty''."{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=104–5}}

[[Eyvind Earle]] joined Walt Disney Productions in 1951 first employed as an assistant background painter for ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' before being promoted as a full-fledged background painter in the [[Goofy]] cartoon, "For Whom the Bulls Toil" and the color stylist of the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award-winning]] short, ''[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom]]''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/25/local/me-58783|title=Eyvind Earle; Artist and Disney Painter|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 25, 2000|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Sleeping Beauty'', Earle said he "felt totally free to put my own style" into the paintings he based on Hench's drawings stating "Where his trees might have curved, I straightened them out…. I took a Hench and took the same subject, and the composition he had, and just turned in into my style."{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=557}} Furthermore, Earle found inspiration in [[Italian Renaissance]] utilizing works from [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Nicolaas van Eyck]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], as well as [[Iranian art|Persian art]] and Japanese prints.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=105}} When Geronimi became the supervising director, Earle and Geronimi entered furious creative differences. Geronimi commented that he felt Earle's paintings "lacked the mood in a lot of things. All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's all well and good, but who the hell's going to look at that?  The backgrounds became more important than the animation. He'd made them more like [[Christmas card]]s."&lt;ref name="Geronimi-interview" /&gt; Earle left the Disney studios in March 1958, before ''Sleeping Beauty'' was completed, to take a job at [[John Sutherland (producer)|John Sutherland Productions]]. As a result, Geronimi had Earle's background paintings softened and diluted from their distinctive medieval texture.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=558}}

===Animation===

====Live-action reference footage====
Before the animation process began, a live-action reference version was filmed with live actors in costume serving as models for the animators in which Walt Disney insisted on because he wanted the characters to appear "as real as possible, near flesh-and-blood." However, Milt Kahl objected to this method, calling it "a crutch, a stifling of the creative effort. Anyone worth his salt in this business ought to ''know'' how people move."{{sfn|Maltin|1987|p=74}} [[Helene Stanley]] was the live action reference for Princess Aurora.&lt;ref name="disneyfamilyalbum"&gt;{{cite video |people= |date2= |month2= |year2= |title= Disney Family Album: Marc Davis|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81orlAreTvM|medium= |publisher=YouTube|accessdate= 2013-08-04|time= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only known surviving footage of Stanley as Aurora's live-action reference is a clip from the television program ''[[Disneyland (TV series)|Disneyland]]'', which consists of the artists sketching her dancing with the woodland animals. Stanley previously provided live-action references for ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|work=Disney Archives |title=Cinderella Character History |url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/cinderella/cinderella.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68f7VbYEA?url=http://disney.go.com/disneyinsider/history/movies/cinderella |archivedate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maltin156" /&gt; and later for Anita from ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]'',&lt;ref name="archive1" /&gt; and portrayed Polly Crockett for the TV series ''[[Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier]]''.

The role of Prince Phillip was modeled by [[Ed Kemmer]],&lt;ref name="Maltin156"&gt;{{cite book|author= Leonard Maltin|title= The Disney Films: 3rd Edition|page= 156|isbn=0-7868-8137-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had played Commander Buzz Corry on television's ''[[Space Patrol (1950 TV series)|Space Patrol]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=0447220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvfacts"&gt;{{cite web|author=Animation |url=http://tv-facts.net/movie-review/sleeping-beauty/ |title=Sleeping Beauty |publisher=Tv Facts |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; five years before ''Sleeping Beauty'' was released. For the final battle sequence, Kemmer was photographed on a wooden buck. The live-action model for Maleficent was [[Eleanor Audley]], who also voiced the villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andreas Deja |url=http://andreasdeja.blogspot.ru/2011/08/miss-audley.html |title=Deja View: Miss Audley |publisher=Andreasdeja.blogspot.ru |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancer Jane Fowler also was a live-action reference for Maleficent.&lt;ref name="Maltin156" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas S. Hischak|title= Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary |page=13 | isbn = 9780786462711}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andreas Deja |url=http://andreasdeja.blogspot.ru/2013/03/moments-with-marc.html |title=Deja View: Moments with Marc |publisher=Andreasdeja.blogspot.ru |date=2013-03-29 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the actresses who performed in reference footage for this film were [[Spring Byington]] and [[Frances Bavier]].

====Character animation====
Because of the artistic depth of Earle's backgrounds, it was decided for the characters to be stylized so they could appropriately match the backgrounds.&lt;ref name="making-of"&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Picture Perfect: The Making of ''Sleeping Beauty'' |type=Documentary film |publisher=[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] |id= |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the layout artists and animators were impressed with Earles's paintings, they eventually grew depressed at working with a style that many of them regarded as too cold, too flat, and too modernist for a fairy tale. Nevertheless, Walt insisted on the visual design claiming that the inspirational art he commissioned in the past had homogenized the animators.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=558}} [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] would complain to Ken Peterson, head of the animation department, of Earles's "very rigid design" because of the inhibiting effect on the animators that was less problematic than working with [[Mary Blair]]'s designs, in which Peterson would respond that the design style was Walt's decision, and that, like it or not, they had to use it.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=557}} Because of this, Thomas developed a red blotch on his face and had to visit the doctor each week to have it attended to. Production designer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] also complained: "I had to fight myself to make myself draw that way." Another character animator on Aurora claimed their unit was so cautious about the drawings that the clean-up animators produced one drawing a day, which translated into one second of screen time per month.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=558–60}}

Meanwhile, Tom Oreb was tasked as character stylist that would not only inhabit the style of the backgrounds, but also fit with the contemporary [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] style. Likewise with Earle's background styling, the animators complained that the character designs were too rigid to animate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/w/blogs/alex-movie-blog/2014/10/06/from-the-vault-the-history-of-sleeping-beauty/|title=From the Vault: The History of "Sleeping Beauty"|last=Reif|first=Alex|publisher=The Laughing Place|date=October 6, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Maleficent, [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]] drew from Czechoslovakian religious paintings and used "the red and black drapery in the back that looked like flames that I thought would be great to use. I took the idea of the collar partly from a bat, and the horns looked like a devil." However, in an act of artistic compromise, Earle, with final approval on the character designs, requested the change to lavender as red would come off too strong, in which Davis agreed to.&lt;ref name="artistic-compromise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waltdisney.org/blog/marc-davis-style-compromise-sleeping-beauty#sthash.EBkAU8E7.dpuf|title=Marc Davis: Style &amp; Compromise on Sleeping Beauty|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Family Museum]]|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Davis served as directing animator over the title character with the character's figure and features based on those of [[Audrey Hepburn]] as well as her voice actress, Mary Costa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Das|first=Lina|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1094028/Disneys-Dames-As-Sleeping-Beauty-turns-50-reveal-stories-Walts-heroines-.html#ixzz3pk2NkDMi|title=Disney's Dames: As Sleeping Beauty turns 50, we reveal the stories behind Walt's heroines...|newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran animators Frank Thomas and [[Ollie Johnston]] were assigned as directing animators over the three good fairies: Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Walt Disney urged for the fairies to be more homogeneous, which Thomas and Johnston objected to, with Thomas stating they "thought 'that's not going to be any fun'. So we started figuring the other way and worked on how we could develop them into special personalities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korkis|first=Jim|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/in-his-own-words-frank-thomas-on-the-sleeping-beauty-fairies/|title=In His Own Words: Frank Thomas on the "Sleeping Beauty" Fairies|publisher=Cartoon Research|date=June 20, 2015|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lounsbery]] would animate the "Skumps" sequence between Kings Hubert and Stefan.&lt;ref name="making-of" /&gt; [[Chuck Jones]], known for his work as an animation director with [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]], was employed on the film for four months during its early conceptual stages when Warner Bros. Cartoons was closed when it was anticipated that [[3-D film]] would replace animation as a box office draw. Following the failure of 3-D, and the reversal of Warner's decision, Jones returned to the other studio. His work on ''Sleeping Beauty'', which he spent four months on, remained uncredited. Ironically, during his early years at Warner Bros., Jones was a heavy user of Disney-style animation until [[Tex Avery]] got Warner out of the Disney style. Another notable animator who worked on the film for part of its production was [[Don Bluth]], who worked as an assistant animator to John Lounsberry, Bluth would leave after two years but eventually came back in the 1970s.

===Casting===
In 1952, Mary Costa was invited to a dinner party where she sang "[[When I Fall in Love]]" at the then-named [[California Institute of the Arts|Los Angeles Conservatory of Music]]. Following the performance, she was approached by [[Walter Schumann]] who told her, "I don't want to shock you, but I've been looking (for Aurora) for three years, and I want to set up an audition. Would you do it?" Costa accepted the offer, and at her audition in the recording booth with George Bruns, she was asked to sing and do a bird call, which she did initially in her Southern accent until she was advised to do an English accent. The next day, she was informed by Walt Disney that she landed the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://animatedviews.com/2008/once-upon-a-dream-mary-costa-as-sleeping-beautys-princess-aurora/|last=Noyer|first=Jérémie|interviewer=Mary Costa|title=Once Upon A Dream: Mary Costa as Sleeping Beauty‘s Princess Aurora|publisher=Animated Views|date=October 7, 2008|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Mary-Costa-voice-of-Sleeping-Beauty-3188190.php|title=Mary Costa, voice of Sleeping Beauty|last=Clark|first=John|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 26, 2008|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleanor Audley]] initially turned down the choice role of Maleficent as she was battling tuberculosis at the time, but reconsidered.&lt;ref name="dvdaudiocommentary"&gt;{{cite DVD notes|others=[[John Lasseter]], [[Andreas Deja]], [[John Canemaker]]|title=''Sleeping Beauty'' Platinum Edition|type=Audio commentary|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
In April 1952, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that [[Jack Lawrence]] and [[Sammy Fain]] had signed to compose the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gB4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=sammy+fain+sleeping+beauty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgUahUKEwjpo9HJ5eHIAhVD5GMKHfioCJU#v=onepage&amp;q=sammy%20fain%20sleeping%20beauty&amp;f=false|title=Lawrence, Fain to Score "Beauty"|work=Billboard|publisher=[[Google Books]]|date=April 19, 1952|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Schumann was originally slated to be the film composer, but left the project because of creative differences with Walt Disney. [[George Bruns]] was recommended to replace Schumannn by animator [[Ward Kimball]]. Because of a musicians' strike in 1957, the musical score was recorded in [[Berlin, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giez|first=Didier|title=Walt's People: Talking Disney with the Artists who Knew Him, Volume 11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3YmdyNAmh8YC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=george+bruns+sleeping+beauty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIhNmMuZ7fyAIVhG0mCh0B9Amq#v=onepage&amp;q=george%20bruns%20sleeping%20beauty&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1465368409|publisher=[[Xlibris]]|pages=306–11|date=September 30, 2011|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

In anticipation of the 2014 film ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'', a cover version sung by [[Lana Del Rey]] was released by Disney on January 26. The song is considerably darker and more dramatic than the 1959 version, given the new film's focus on the villain Maleficent.

The [[Super Technirama 70]] prints were equipped with six-track stereophonic sound; some [[CinemaScope]]-compatible 35mm Technirama prints were released in four-track stereo, and others had monaural soundtracks. On the initial run, ''Sleeping Beauty'' was paired with the short musical/documentary film ''[[Grand Canyon (1958 film)|Grand Canyon]]'' which won an [[Academy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19590106&amp;id=J5ouAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SEgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5790,786051&amp;hl=en|title=Disney Readies Film About Grand Canyon|newspaper=''[[Deseret News]]''|date=January 6, 1959|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original release in January 1959, ''Sleeping Beauty'' grossed approximately $5.3 million in [[gross rental|theater rentals]] (the distributor's share of the [[box office]] gross).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schickel|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Schickel|year=1968|title=[[The Disney Version: The Life, Times, Art and Commerce of Walt Disney]]|location=Chicago|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|page=299|isbn=1-5666-3158-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sleeping Beauty's'' production costs, which totaled $6 million,{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=294–5}} made it the most expensive Disney film up to that point, and over twice as expensive as each of the preceding three Disney animated features: ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', and ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pages=554–59}} The high production costs of ''Sleeping Beauty'', coupled with the underperformance of much of the rest of Disney's 1959–1960 release slate, resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for fiscal year 1960,{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=294–5}} and there were massive lay-offs throughout the animation department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Norman | first = Floyd | authorlink =Floyd Norman| title = Toon Tuesday: Here's to the real survivors  | date = August 18, 2008 |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/floyd_norman/archive/2008/08/18/toon-tuesday-here-s-to-the-real-survivors.aspx | publisher = Jim Hill Media | accessdate = February 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-releases===
Like ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), which was not initially successful either, ''Sleeping Beauty'' was never re-released theatrically in Walt Disney's lifetime. However, it had many re-releases in theaters over the decades. The film was re-released theatrically in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&amp;dat=19700710&amp;id=W49aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TkoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6264,708159&amp;hl=en|title=Cinema Scene|newspaper=''[[Ludington Daily News]]''|date=July 10, 1979|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was released on standard 35mm film.

From July 9 to August 13, 2012, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] organized "The Last 70MM Film Festival" at the [[Samuel Goldwyn Theater]], where the Academy, its members, and the Hollywood industry acknowledged the importance, beauty, and majesty of the [[70mm]] film format and how its image and quality is superior to that of [[digital film]]. The Academy selected the following films, which were shot on 70mm, to be screened to make a statement about it, as well as to gain a new appreciation for familiar films in a way it hadn't before: ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', ''Sleeping Beauty'', ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', along with other short subject films on the 70mm format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/events-exhibitions/events/2012/07/70mm.html|title=The Last 70MM Film Festival|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening of the final remaining 70mm print of this film was included in the 70mm &amp; Widescreen Film Festival at the Somerville Theatre, September 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://somervilletheatre.com/70-mm-presentations/ |title=70 mm Presentations |website=Somerville Theatre|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Upon its initial release, ''Sleeping Beauty'' received mixed to positive reviews from film critics. [[Bosley Crowther]], writing in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', complimented that "the colors are rich, the sounds are luscious and magic sparkles spurt charmingly from wands", but criticized its familiarity with ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''. He further wrote that "the princess looks so much like [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] they could be a couple of [[Rheingold Beer#Miss Rheingold Girls 1940-1965|Miss Rheingolds]] separated by three or four years. And she has the same magical rapport with the little creatures of the woods. The witch is the same slant-eyed [[Circe]] who worked her evil on Snow White. And the three good fairies could be maiden sisters of the misogynistic seven dwarfs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE1DB1338EF3BBC4052DFB4668382649EDE|title=Screen: 'Sleeping Beauty'|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1959|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the singing voices of Mary Costa and Bill Shirley and noted that "some of the best parts of the picture are those dealing with the three good fairies, spoken and sung by Verna Felton, Barbara Jo Allen and Barbara Luddy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety213-1959-01#page/n391/mode/2up/search/sleeping+beauty|title='Sleeping Beauty' Top-notch Disney cartoon job|publisher=''Variety''|page=6|via=[[Internet Archive]]|date=January 21, 1959|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Daily News]]'' described the film as "enchanting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/sleeping-beauty-enchanting-classic-1959-review-article-1.2512390|title=‘Sleeping Beauty’ is an enchanting classic: 1959 review|newspaper=The New York Daily News|date=January 28, 2016|accessdate=June 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the film has sustained a strong following and is today hailed as one of the best animated films ever made, thanks to its stylized designs by painter [[Eyvind Earle]] who also was the art director for the film, its lush music score, the character of [[Maleficent]] (whose popularity led her to be the flagship villain for the [[Disney Villains]] franchise), and its large-format [[70mm]] [[widescreen]] and stereophonic sound presentation. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that the film received an 91% approval rating with an average rating of 8.2/10 based on 38 reviews. Its consensus states that "This Disney dreamscape contains moments of grandeur, with its lush colors, magical air, one of the most menacing villains in the Disney canon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1019187-sleeping_beauty/ |title=Sleeping Beauty Movie Reviews, Pictures |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]  |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrie R.

The 1997 VHS edition also came with a special [[:wikt:commemorative|commemorative]] booklet included, with brief facts on the making of the movie.

In 2003, the restored ''Sleeping Beauty'' was released to DVD in a 2-disc "Special Edition" which included both a widescreen version (formatted at 2.35:1) and a [[pan and scan]] version as well. Its DVD supplements included the making-of featurette from the 1997 VHS, ''Grand Canyon'', the ''Life of Tchaikovsky'' segment of ''The Peter Tchaikovsky Story'' from the [[Walt Disney anthology television series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Germain|first=David|title=Disney's grand 1959 animated 'Sleeping Beauty' released on DVD|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=20030913&amp;id=vkxWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8esDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6716,2812142&amp;hl=en|work=Associated Press|publisher=''[[The Register Guard|Eugene Register-Guard]]''|date=September 13, 2003|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a virtual gallery of concept art, layout and background designs, three trailers, and audio commentary from Mary Costa, Eyvind Earle, and Ollie Johnston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Susan|title=Disney dusts off 'Sleeping Beauty'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/13/entertainment/et-king13|newspaper=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=September 13, 2003|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions|Platinum Edition]] release of ''Sleeping Beauty'', as a 2-disc DVD and [[Blu-ray]], was released on October 7, 2008 in the US, making ''Sleeping Beauty'' the first entry in the Platinum Edition line to be released in [[high definition video]].

==Legacy==

===Video games===
Aurora is one of the seven [[Princesses of Heart]] in the popular [[Square Enix]] game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' (although her appearances are brief), and Maleficent is a villain in all three [[Kingdom Hearts (series)|''Kingdom Hearts'' games]], and as a brief ally at the third game's climax. The good fairies appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', giving [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] new clothes. Diablo appears in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' to resurrect his defeated mistress. The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] game ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' features a world based on the movie, Enchanted Dominion, and characters who appear are Princess Aurora/Briar Rose, Maleficent, Maleficent's goons, the three faires and Prince Phillip, the latter serving as temporary party member for Aqua during her battle against Maleficent and her henchmen. Maleficent will return in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.

Aurora is also a playable character in the game ''[[Disney Princess (video game)|Disney Princess]]''.

===Board game===
''Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty Game'' (1958) is a [[Parker Brothers]] children's [[board game]] for two to four players based upon ''Sleeping Beauty''. The object of the game is to be the first player holding three different picture cards to reach the castle and the space marked "The End".&lt;ref name="Chertoff"&gt;Chertoff, Nina, and Susan Kahn. ''Celebrating Board Games''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Disney film retains the basics of [[Charles Perrault]]'s 17th-century fairy tale about a princess cursed to sleep one hundred years, but adds three elderly fairies who protect the princess, a prince armed with a magic sword and shield, and other details. The Disney twists on the tale are incorporated into the game, and Disney's "stunning graphics"&lt;ref name="Chertoff" /&gt; illustrate the game board. In addition to the board game, the film generated books, toys, and other juvenile merchandise.

The equipment consists of a center-seamed game board, four tokens in various colors, four spinners, four magic wands, and a deck of picture cards.

The first player moves the number of spaces along the track according to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instruction. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand at any time during the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.

===Theme parks===
''Sleeping Beauty'' was made while [[Walt Disney]] was building [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] (hence the six-year production time). To help promote the film, [[Disney Imagineer|Imagineer]]s named the park's icon "[[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]" (it was originally to be Snow White's).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} An indoor walk-through exhibit was added to the empty castle interior in 1957, where guests could walk through the castle, up and over the castle entrance, viewing "Story Moment" dioramas of scenes from the film, which were improved with animated figurines in 1977. It closed shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], supposedly because the dark, unmonitored corridors were a risk.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} After being closed for seven years, the exhibit space underwent extensive refurbishment to restore the original 1957 displays, and reopened to guests on November 27, 2008. Accommodations were also made on the ground floor with a "virtual" version for disabled guests unable to navigate stairs. [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] opened in 2005, also with a Sleeping Beauty Castle, nearly replicating Disneyland's original design.

''[[Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant]]'' at [[Disneyland Paris]] is a variant of Sleeping Beauty Castle. The version found at Disneyland Paris is much more reminiscent of the film's artistic direction. The ''Château'' features an animatronic dragon, imagineered to look like Maleficent's dragon form, is found in the lower level dungeon&amp;nbsp;– ''La Tanière du Dragon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlpguide.com/guidebook/disneyland-park/fantasyland/la-taniere-du-dragon/|title=La Tanière du Dragon, Disneyland Paris|website=DLP Guide |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building also contains ''[[La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant]]'', a gallery of displays which illustrate the story of Sleeping Beauty in tapestries, stained glass windows and figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlpguide.com/guidebook/disneyland-park/fantasyland/la-galerie-de-la-belle-au-bois-dormant/ |title=La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant, Disneyland Paris |website=DLP Guide |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princess Aurora (and, to a lesser extent, Prince Phillip, Fauna, Flora and Merryweather, Maleficent and her goons) makes regular appearances in the parks and parades.

Maleficent is featured as one of the villains in the nighttime show ''[[Fantasmic!]]'' at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].

===Other appearances===
* Maleficent's goons appear in the Maroon Cartoon studio lot in the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The Bluebirds from the film also appear as "tweeting birds" that fly around [[Roger Rabbit]]'s or [[Eddie Valiant]]'s heads in two scenes, after a refrigerator fell on top of Roger's head and while Eddie Valiant is in Toontown, the birds are seen again flying around his head until he shoos them away.

* Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather were featured as guests in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' and Maleficent was one of the villains in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''. The first all-new story featuring the characters from the movie (sans Maleficent) appeared in ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', the first volume of collection of the [[Disney Princess]]es. It was released on September 4, 2007. [[Mary Costa]], the original voice of Princess Aurora, was not fond of this story and felt that it did not work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdizzy.com/sleepingbeauty-interview2.html Mary Costa Interview - Page 2]. Retrieved November 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the American fantasy drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', a live-action version of Maleficent appeared in the second episode and the [[Once Upon a Time (season 1)|Season 1]] finale, as she is an adversary of the Evil Queen, and is also sinister. She appears more prominently in the show's fourth season. Her role is played by ''[[True Blood]]'' actress [[Kristin Bauer]]. In [[Once Upon a Time (season 2)|Season 2]], [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|Season 3]], and [[Once Upon a Time (season 4)|Season 4]] live-action incarnations of Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, and King Stefan are portrayed by [[Sarah Bolger]], [[Julian Morris (actor)|Julian Morris]], and [[Sebastian Roché]] respectively.

* Flora, Fauna and Merryweather appear in Disney Channel/Disney Junior's series ''[[Sofia the First]]'' as the teaching faculty of Royal Prep, the school for the various kingdom's princes and princesses. Princess Aurora also makes a guest appearance in the episode, "Holiday in Enchancia".

* Aurora and the other [[Disney Princess]]es are all set as [[guest appearance]]s in the upcoming 2018 film ''[[Ralph Breaks the Internet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/14/wreck-it-ralph-sequel-star-wars-disney-princesses/|title=Wreck-It Ralph sequel will unite the Disney princesses — and Star Wars!|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Star Theatre Arnab Dutta.jpg|thumb|Star Theatre, Kolkata]]
[[File:Star theatre.JPG|thumb|Facade of the Star Theatre]]
The '''Star Theatre''' is a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] in [[Kolkata]], built in 1883. Initially situated in Beadon Street, the theatre later moved to Cornwallis Street - now called [[Bidhan Sarani]]. The Star, along with the [[Minerva Theatre, Kolkata|Minerva Theatre]], was one of the first institutions of commercial Bengali theatre. The Star, along with Minerva and The Classic Theatre, were also one of the places where the [[Cinema of West Bengal|first motion pictures]] in Bengal, made by [[Hira Lala Sen]], were screened. This is a heritage site of Calcutta (Kolkata) that was destroyed in a fire and thereafter restored by the local municipal corporation. The restored Star Theatre maintains the heritage facade; the interiors are contemporary. The property is maintained by a private company. At present, it is primarily a cinema hall; plays are staged on about two days per month. However, during winter (December and January) plays are staged here much more frequently, of the order of ten days per month. The auditorium has excellent acoustics. Star Theatre is close to the junction of Grey Street (Aurobindo Saranee) and Cornwallis Street (Bidhan Saranee); the area near this junction is called Hatibagan (Elephant Park). The theatre is a 10-minute walk from the Shobhabazar-Sutanuti station of the underground railway. Star Theatre has an underground car park with a nominal parking fee of Rs 10/- per hour (minimum three hours). Tramcar tracks, and services, on Grey Street and Cornwallis Street enhance the heritage ambience.

[[Girish Chandra Ghosh]] was one of the first to produce plays at the Star Theatre, in the 1880s.

In 2012, the Star Theatre was to be returned to civic ownership, "to stop commercialization of the historic building that was once visited by Bengali luminaries such as [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar|Vidyasagar]], [[Ramakrishna Paramhansa]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (28 March 2012).

'''Teatro Morlacchi''', formerly '''Teatro del Verzaro''', is the largest theater of [[Perugia]]. It is named after the musician [[Francesco Morlacchi]].

== History ==
In 1777 the local middle class decided to build a new theater in response to the nobles who had built the Teatro del Pavone;  ninety families then formed the "Society for the construction of a new theater", which bought an old convent and commissioned the project to architect Alessio Lorenzini.&lt;ref name="frr" /&gt; Lorenzini gave the hall the classic shape of a [[horseshoe]] and facing with the problem of limited space, having to reserve a box for each client family, he decided to set up the entire structure diagonally and to reduce the [[Lobby (room)|entrance hall]].&lt;ref name="frr" /&gt; 

The works began in June 1778, and ended in April 1780. The inauguration was held on August 15, 1781, and the theater could seat 1,200 people at the time.&lt;ref name="frr"&gt;Margherita Maria Rosa Ventura (cured by). ''Teatro Francesco Morlacchi. Archivio storico''.  Perugia: Regione dell'Umbria, Editrice Umbra Cooperativa, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AA. VV. ''Umbria''. Milan: Touring Club Italiano, 1999-2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 it was restructured and modified by Guglielmo Calderini, who gave the theater its current structure; simultaneously it was redecorated by artists like Francesco Moretti and Mariano Piervittori, who worked on the curtain of the ceiling. At the new inauguration of the theater it was named after the Perugia-born musician Francesco Morlacchi.&lt;ref name="frr" /&gt;

The activities of the theater continued until the early twentieth century, but declined during the years of [[Fascism]] until it was requisitioned by the Germans during the occupation of the city and allocated to shows for their soldiers.&lt;ref name="frr" /&gt; After the war, the theater was seriously damaged and the City between 1951 and 1953 financed the restoration work, which included a re-roofing and the modification of stage, orchestra pit and marble floors.&lt;ref name="frr" /&gt;

Currently the theater has 785 seats. The stage is {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|10.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} deep. The proscenium is also {{convert|10.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide.

'''The White Stag Group''' was a group of artists centred on the painters [[Basil Rakoczi]] and [[Kenneth Hall (artist)|Kenneth Hall]].

Founded in London in 1935, the group moved to Ireland in 1939 and stayed until after the [[Second World War]] where they gained Irish members like Thurloe Conolly, Paul Egestorff, Stephen Gilbert and Patrick Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antiquesandartireland.com/2011/10/art-ireland-white-stag/|title=WHITE STAG GROUP EXHIBITION AT ADAM’S, CLANDEBOYE «  antiquesandartireland.com|website=antiquesandartireland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their group philosophy, which they called ''Subjectivist Art'', was not associated with any particular style or set belief. Instead, it encouraged an exploration of [[psychology]] and of [[modernism|modernist]] ideas. They also believed in aesthetic experimentation and [[aesthetics]] as an objective in art. Although formed in London and guided by two British born artists (Hall and Rakozci) the group has been described as "an Irish phenomenon" by the Irish art expert Dr. S.B. Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernart.ie/en/downloads/whitestagbk.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203750/http://www.modernart.ie/en/downloads/whitestagbk.doc |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was at the vanguard of modern artistic ideas in Ireland, were involved in the [[Irish Exhibition of Living Art]] and influenced [[Patrick Scott (artist)|Patrick Scott]], [[Gerald Dillon]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]]. The Irish composer [[Brian Boydell]], at that time a visual artist, was also a member of the group. The [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] put on a White Stag retrospective during the summer of 2005.

The '''Théâtre des Funambules''' ('The Theatre of the Tightrope-Walkers') was a former theater located on the [[boulevard du Temple]] in Paris, sometimes called the [[Boulevard du Crime]]. It was located between the prominent [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]], and the much smaller [[Théâtre des Délassements-Comiques]].

Originally an informal venue for acrobatics and pantomime a theatre was eventually built in 1816. Originally seating 500, it was later enlarged to accommodate 773. The Funambules became celebrated for the performances of the '[[Pierrot]]' mime [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]], between around 1819 and 1846, and also the early career of the great classical actor [[Frédérick Lemaître]].

The theatre was demolished in 1862, along with other neighboring venues such as [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]], during [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]].

==''Les Enfants du Paradis''==
[[Marcel Carné]] set his 1945 film ''[[Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' in the Théâtre des Funambules to evoke the atmosphere of the [[July Monarchy]] (1830–48), including the figures of Deburau and Lemaître among the main roles.

'''Treasure of Lima: A Buried Exhibition''' is an art project curated by Nadim Samman for Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary Academy, taking place on a remote, protected island in the [[Pacific Ocean]] off the coast of [[Costa Rica]]. Works by forty artists were placed inside a chest and then buried in a secret location on [[Cocos Island]], the place whose pirate history inspired Robert Louis Stevenson’s [[Treasure Island]].

== Background ==
Isla del Coco (Cocos Island) is the historical source of many foundational legends relating to [[buried treasure]]. The best known of the treasure legends tied to the island is that of the [[Treasure of Lima]]: In 1820, with the army of [[José de San Martín]] approaching [[Lima]], Viceroy José de la Serna entrusted the treasure from the city to British trader Captain William Thompson for safekeeping until the Spaniards could secure the country. Instead of waiting in the harbour as they were instructed, Thompson and his crew killed the Viceroy’s men and sailed to Cocos, where they buried the treasure. Shortly afterwards, they were apprehended by a Spanish warship. Thompson and his first mate said they would show the Spaniards where they had hidden the treasure in return for their lives, but after landing on Cocos they escaped into the forest. A large number of attempts have been made to find the treasure, but none has succeeded.

==The project==
The art project consists of a vacuum sealed container containing artworks by forty artists, buried at a secret location. The contents of the container include works on paper, sculpture, vinyl LPs, digital video and audio files. The container is a [[truncated tetrahedron]] made of stainless steel that opens to reveal a second spherical container made of glass. Within this vacuum-sealed sphere there are a series of aluminium boxes housing the artworks.

Artists represented in the project include [[Marina Abramovic]], [[Doug Aitken]], [[Darren Almond]], [[Angela Bulloch]], [[Los Carpinteros]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Constant Dullaart]], [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Carl Michael von Hausswolff]],  [[Pierre Huyghe]],  [[Sharon Lockhart]], [[Carsten Nicolai]], [[Raymond Pettibon]], [[Lari Pittman]], [[Jon Rafman]],  [[Matthew Ritchie]], [[Ed Ruscha]], [[Chicks on Speed]],  [[Ryan Trecartin]], [[Chris Watson (musician)|Chris Watson]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]].

The container was buried on Cocos Island in May, 2014, by an expedition led by art collector and patron [[Francesca von Habsburg]].

The [[GPS coordinates]] of the exhibition location were given to the Dutch artist Constant Dullaart, who worked with a [[cryptographer]] to encode them. The resulting string of code was then made physical, as a 3D printed steel cylinder. This physical ‘map’ will be sold at auction{{when|date=October 2017}}, encased within a second edition of the treasure chest, with proceeds donated to the marine protection of Cocos Island under the auspices of the Area de Conservation Marina Isla Del Coco.

'''Wednesday Addams''' is a fictional character created by American cartoonist [[Charles Addams]] in his comic strip ''[[The Addams Family]]''. The character has also appeared in television and film, in both the live action and animated formats.

==Wednesday==
In Addams' cartoons, which first appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Wednesday and other members of the family had no names. When the characters were adapted to the 1964 [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|television series]], Charles Addams gave her the name "Wednesday", based on the [[Monday's Child|well-known nursery rhyme]] line, "Wednesday's child is full of woe." The idea for the name was supplied by the actress and poet Joan Blake, an acquaintance of Addams.&lt;ref&gt;Addams Family Values, Letters, ''The New Yorker'', July 30 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the sister of [[Pugsley Addams]] (and, in the movie ''[[Addams Family Values]]'', also the sister of Pubert Addams), and she is the only daughter of [[Gomez Addams|Gomez]] and [[Morticia Addams]].

==Appearance and personality==
Wednesday's most notable features are her pale skin and long, dark twin braids. She seldom shows emotion and is generally bitter. Wednesday usually wears a black dress with a white collar, black stockings and black shoes.

In the 1960s series, she is significantly more sweet-natured, although her favorite hobby is raising [[spiders]]; she is also a [[ballerina]]. Wednesday's favorite toy is her [[Marie Antoinette]] doll, which her brother [[guillotine]]s (at her request). She is stated to be six years old in the television series' [[pilot episode]]. In one episode, she is shown to have several other headless dolls as well. She also paints pictures (including a picture of trees with human heads) and writes a poem dedicated to her favorite pet spider, Homer. Wednesday is deceptively strong; she is able to bring her father down with a [[judo]] hold.

In the 1991 film, she is depicted closer to the original cartoons. She shows sadistic tendencies and a dark personality, and is revealed to have a deep interest in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] and an admiration for an ancestor (Great Aunt Calpurnia Addams) who was burned as a witch in 1706. In the 1993 sequel, she was even darker: she buried a live cat, tried to kill her baby brother Pubert, set fire to Camp Chippewa and (possibly) scared fellow camper Joel to death.

Wednesday has a close kinship with the family's giant butler [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]. In the TV series, her middle name is "Friday".&lt;ref&gt;"Wednesday Leaves Home" (20 November 1964) Season 1, Episode 10, at 06:30&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Spain|Spanish]] version, her name is Miércoles (Wednesday in Spanish); in [[Latin America]] she is Merlina; in the [[Brazil]]ian version she is Wandinha (little Wanda in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]); in France her name is Mercredi (Wednesday in French) and in [[Italy]] her name is Mercoledì (Wednesday in Italian).

In the animated series and Canadian TV series ''[[The New Addams Family]]'' from the 1990s, Wednesday retains her appearance and her taste for darkness and torture.

In the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Addams Family: A New Musical]]'', she is 18 years old and has short hair rather than the long braids in her other appearances. Her darkness and sociopathic traits have been toned down, and she is in love with (and revealed to be engaged to) Lucas Beineke. In the musical Wednesday is older than Pugsley. 

In the parody web series ''[[Adult Wednesday Addams]]'', Wednesday, as played by Melissa Hunter, recovers her dark, sociopathic and sadistic nature and her long braids, connecting with the events and the depiction of the movies and the original comic-book. This Wednesday deals with being an adult after moving out of her family home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carrie|first1=Stephanie|title=A Christina Ricci Doppelganger Creates a Series About Wednesday Addams As an Adult|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/a-christina-ricci-doppelg-nger-creates-a-series-about-wednesday-addams-as-an-adult-5420282|publisher=[[LA Weekly]]|accessdate=March 16, 2015|date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The web series gained media attention with the third episode of Season 2 in which Wednesday punished a pair of catcallers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/13/wednesday-addams-reacts-to-catcalling_n_6677674.html |title=How Wednesday Addams Would React To Catcalling |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-02-13 |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tee &amp; Charles Addams Foundation, copyright owners of The Addams Family, flagged the series for copyright violation resulting in the series being pulled from YouTube. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/adult-wednesday-addams-copyright-claim/&lt;/ref&gt;

Wednesday's personality is severe, with a deadpan wit and a morbid interest in trying to inflict harm upon her brothers, first [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] and later Pubert. In both films, she is played by [[Christina Ricci]]. In the movie ''[[Addams Family Values]]'' (1993), Wednesday is sent to a [[summer camp]] for "privileged young adults" called Camp Chippewa, where Joel Glicker (played by [[David Krumholtz]]) takes a liking to Wednesday. She refuses to participate in Gary Granger's play, a musical production of the first Thanksgiving. She, Pugsley, and Joel are locked in the "Harmony Hut" and forced to watch upbeat family films to curb their antisocial behavior. On emerging from the hut, Wednesday feigns perkiness and agrees to play the role of [[Pocahontas]]. However, during the play, she leads the other social outcasts—who have all been cast as Native Americans—in a revolt, capturing Gary, Becky, and Amanda and leaving the camp in chaos. Before she leaves, Wednesday and Joel kiss. Joel is a neurotic, allergy-ridden boy with an overbearing mother. In one scene in the film, she smiles, which ends up scaring the campers, as well as her blonde nemesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjoy-your-style.com/wednesday-addams.html |title=Wednesday Addams |publisher=Enjoy-your-style.com |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the film, it is suggested that Wednesday, though she obviously likes Joel, purposely tries to scare him to death after he brings up the subject of marriages.
* In the 1977 television holiday-themed special, ''[[Halloween with the New Addams Family]]'', [[Lisa Loring]] plays a grown-up Wednesday, who mostly entertains their party guests with her flute, and can hear and understand coded help messages by bound-up members of the family, and dispatch help to free them. In the time interval between the original TV series and this television movie, her parents had two more children who look just like the original Pugsley and Wednesday.
* Wednesday is portrayed by [[Nicole Fugere]] in the straight-to-video movie ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'' and [[Television networks preceding ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]]'s television series ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', which were both produced in 1998.
* In April 2010, ''[[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family: A New Musical]]'' debuted on Broadway. [[Krysta Rodriguez]] played Wednesday. The character is now 18 years old, has "become a woman", and to that effect no longer sports her signature pigtails. The musical is based on the characters as created by [[Charles Addams]]. In March 2011, Krysta Rodriguez was replaced with [[Rachel Potter]] as Wednesday in the Broadway cast. Starting in September 2011, the production begins its First National Tour. Cortney Wolfson has been cast in the Wednesday Addams role. In the Broadway production, she was the understudy for Wednesday and performed as the Dead Bride/Ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cortneywolfson.com |title=Cortney Wolfson |publisher=Cortneywolfson.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Will Kemp Elizabethan Clown Jig.jpg|250px|thumb|right|William Kempe (right) from ''Nine Days Wonder'' (1600)]]
'''William Kempe''' (died 1603), commonly referred to as '''Will Kemp''', was an English actor and dancer specialising in comic roles and best known for having been one of the original players in early dramas by [[William Shakespeare]]. Roles associated with his name may include the great comic creation, [[Falstaff]], and his contemporaries considered him the successor to the great [[Jester|clown]] of the previous generation, [[Richard Tarlton]].

Kempe's success and influence was such that in December 1598 he was one of a core of five actor-shareholders in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] alongside Shakespeare and [[Richard Burbage]], but in a short time (possibly after a disagreement among the members of the troupe) he parted company with the group. Despite his fame as a performer and subsequent intent to continue his career, he appears to have died unregarded and in poverty circa 1603.

==Life==
In a 1615 lawsuit brought by Thomasina (née Heminges) Ostler, widow of [[William Ostler]], against her father, [[John Heminges]], the recently deceased actor William Kempe was referred to as a gentleman (''Willelmo Kempe nuper de Londonia generoso defuncto''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|1909|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that he was a member of the Kempe family of [[Olantigh]], a property {{convert|1|mi|km}} north of [[Wye, Kent|Wye]] in [[Kent]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kemp's parentage is unknown, though it has been conjectured that, despite his plebeian performance persona, he was linked in some way to the Kempes of Ollantighe, near Ashford in Kent, who were a wealthy Catholic dynasty. Sir Thomas Kempe (1517–1591) did indeed have a son named William;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richardson III|2011|p=276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the claim that this William Kempe was the actor cannot be correct, since he was buried at Wye church on 27 March 1597 (Honneyman, 125–9; Bannerman, 3; private information, A. Findlay) . Nonetheless, this putative connection might help explain the otherwise surprising story—dramatized in the play The Travailes of the Three English Brothers (1607) by Day, Rowley, and Wilkins—that when William Kemp the actor was in Italy in 1601 he had an encounter with the celebrated traveller Sir Anthony Shirley: for Sir Anthony and his two equally famous brothers were related to the Ollantighe Kempes through their mother, who was Sir Thomas Kempe's daughter. Possibly, then, the actor had some tie of kinship to Ollantighe, at an outlying point on the family tree; or perhaps in recommending himself to Shirley he was just opportunistically taking advantage of the name he shared with Shirley's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Butler|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kempe first enters the historical record as a performer with [[Leicester's Men]] at [[Essex House (London)|Leicester House]] in May 1585&lt;ref&gt;The Earl made a special payment of ten [[shilling]]s for this performance.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in this service after [[Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester|Leicester]]'s departure for the [[Low Countries]] to take part in the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Leicester's nephew, [[Philip Sidney]], sent letters home by way of a man he called "Will, my Lord of Lester's jesting player" and it is now generally accepted this was Kempe. Sidney complained in a letter to [[Francis Walsingham]] that "Will" had delivered the letters to [[Lettice Knollys|Lady Leicester]] rather than Sidney's wife, [[Frances Walsingham]]. After a brief return to England, Kempe accompanied two other future Lord Chamberlain's Men, [[George Bryan (16th-century actor)|George Bryan]] and [[Thomas Pope (16th-century actor)|Thomas Pope]], to [[Elsinore]] where he entertained [[Frederick II of Denmark]].

Kempe's whereabouts in the later 1580s are not known, but that his fame as a performer was growing during this period is indicated by [[Thomas Nashe]]'s ''An Almond for a Parrot'' (1590). Nashe dedicated this work to Kempe, calling him "vicegerent general to the ghost of Dick Tarlton."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the title-page of the [[book size|quarto]] of ''A Knack to Know a Knave'' advertises Kempe's "merriments". (Because title-pages were a means to draw attention to a book, the mention of Kempe suggests that he had become an attraction in his own right.) Critics have generally viewed the scene in which Kempe performs as rather flat (Collier, 97) and it is assumed that the scene provided a framework within which Kempe could [[improvise]]. Entries in the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Register]] indicate that three jigs (short comic plays) perhaps written by Kempe were published between 1591 and 1595. Two of these have survived.

By 1592 Kempe was one of [[Lord Strange's Men]], listed in the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] authorisation for that troupe to play seven miles out of London. In 1594, upon the dissolution of Strange's Men, Kempe, along with Burbage and Shakespeare, joined the Lord Chamberlain's Men and remained with that company until early 1599, when a still-unclear sequence of events removed him from the company. Although he had been a sharer in the plans to construct the [[Globe Theatre]], he appeared in no productions in the new theatre, which was open by mid-1599, and evidence from Shakespeare's ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', in which there is no promised continued role for Falstaff, and ''[[Hamlet]]'', containing its famous complaint at improvisational clowning (Act 3, Scene 2), indicates some of the circumstances in which Kempe may have been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;James Shapiro, (2005). ''1599, A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare''. Faber and Faber, London. pp.42–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Kemp played his last role for Shakespeare in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hornback ''The English Clown Tradition from the Middle Ages to Shakespeare'' 1843843560 - 2013 "nd of the stupid puritan stereotype generally, that Shakespeare wrote his own strict, stupid puritan clown for Kemp — for whatever reason, Kemp's last Shakespearean role — in 1598. Like the “foolish Mayre or foolish justice” ...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
[[File:Kemp's Men, Chapelfield Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 167501.jpg|thumb|left| [[Wood carving]] of Kempe in Chapelfield Gardens, [[Norwich]]]]
After his departure from the Chamberlain's Men in early 1599, Kempe continued to pursue his career as a performer. In February and March 1600, he undertook what he would later call his "Nine Days Wonder", in which he [[morris dance]]d from London to [[Norwich]] (a distance of over a hundred miles) in a journey which took him nine days spread over several weeks, often amid cheering crowds. Later that year he published a description of the event to prove to doubters that it was true.&lt;ref&gt;The year Kempe gives was 1599 [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], which has caused some later confusion. That Kempe's jig took place in 1600 (New Style) is established by a record of the payment of his prize money by the Norwich City Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his activities after this famous stunt are as obscure as his origins. On evidence from ''[[The Travels of the Three English Brothers]]'', he is assumed to have made another European tour, perhaps reaching Italy, but by 1601 he was borrowing money from [[Philip Henslowe]] and had joined [[Worcester's Men]]. The last undoubted mention of him occurs in Henslowe's diary in late 1602.

Parish records record the death of "Kempe, a man" in ''[[Southwark St Saviour|St. Saviour]]'', [[Southwark]], late in 1603. While this is not necessarily the comedian, the record fits his departure from the documentary record.

==Performance style==
In his time, Kempe was as famous for his [[Jig (theatre)|stage jig]]s as for his acting in regular drama. The jig, a kind of rustic cousin to [[commedia dell'arte]], featured as many as five performers in a partially improvised song-and-dance routine. Jigs had plots, often bawdy, but the emphasis was on dancing and physical comedy. Two of Kempe's jigs survive in English, and two more in German. Examples of the jigs may be seen in the manuscript collection of [[John Dowland]] (now in the [[Cambridge University Library]]). A famous 17th century jig called [[Kemp's Jig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mathew Holmes lute books: Kemp's jig|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-DD-00002-00011/194|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was named after Will Kempe and was published in the first book of [[John Playford]]'s ''[[The English Dancing Master]]'' of 1651. The tune has received a number of modern renditions, including those by [[Profile (Jan Akkerman album)|Jan Akkerman]] and [[Gryphon (album)|Gryphon]].

As an actor, Kempe is certainly associated with two roles: [[Dogberry]] in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and Peter in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. (In the quarto text of the latter, and in both quarto and [[First Folio]] text of the former, he is identified in speech prefixes and stage directions.) From these hints, a list of Kempe's parts has been deduced which, if conjectural, is not improbable: Costard in ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'', [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Lancelot Gobbo in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', and Cob in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''. [[Falstaff]] is a more ambiguous case. Though Falstaff presents some features of an Elizabethan dramatic clown, his character is higher in class and more complex than the other roles with which Kempe is associated.

==In period fiction==
*Kempe appears as a character in ''[[Parnassus plays|The Return from Parnassus, or The Scourge of Simony]]'', possibly written during his lifetime or very shortly after his death. In it he praises Shakespeare for outdoing university-educated playwrights.

==In modern fiction==

===Film and TV===
*In the 1978 TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Will Shakespeare]]'' Kempe is portrayed by [[Derek Royle]] as an oafish alcoholic. He is ousted from the troupe and replaced by [[Robert Armin]] when they think he has betrayed their involvement in the [[Essex Rebellion]]. In fact Armin is the informer, who has framed Kempe to replace him.
*In the 1998 [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', he is played by veteran [[character actor]] [[Patrick Barlow]].
*In 2005's TV-film ''[[A Waste of Shame]]'' he is portrayed by [[John Voce]].
*In the 2007 [[Doctor Who]] episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]", Kempe is played by [[David Westhead]].
*In the 2016 [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', Kempe is played by [[Spencer Jones (actor)|Spencer Jones]] as a parody of modern comedian [[Ricky Gervais]].

===Literature===
*Kempe is a key character in [[Kevin Sylvester]]'s 2015 novel for young adults ''Neil Flambé and the Bard's Banquet'', published by Simon &amp; Schuster Books
*Kempe appears in Ann Young's 2002 novel for young adults ''The Nine Days Wonder'', published by East Hall Press.
*In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s 1991 graphic novel [[The Sandman: Dream Country]], Kempe is depicted in the issue ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' a short story about Shakespeare's first performance of the play.
*Kempe also appears in ''[[King of Shadows]]'', a 1999 children's fiction book which shows Kempe as a clown dancing a Nine Days' Morris.
*In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[alternate history]] 2002 novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' Kempe is one of the main characters. His off-stage personality is indistinguishable from the characters he plays on stage, and his antics provide much of the humour in the novel, which is set during a time of grim peril.
*In J. B. Cheaney's 2004 novel ''The True Prince'' along with more of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]].
*''Kempe's Jig'' is referenced in [[Geoffrey Hill]]'s poem "After Reading ''Children of Albion'' (1969)" from his ''A Treatise of Civil Power'', published in 2007.

===Stage===
*Kempe was the title character in Dan Roentsch's play ''Will Kemp''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=zuYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22dan+roentsch%22+%22will+kemp%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q-qTsDS5Mt&amp;sig=14WNgEIw-OijU_2GKCyLscghp94&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FkidUa-NOaXY0gGC3ICQAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q="dan roentsch" "will kemp"&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]] depicts Kempe as a moody tragedian in his 1968 play ''[[A Cry of Players]]'', a significant departure from Kempe's actual performance style.

In 2008, comedian [[Tim FitzHigham]] re-enacted Kemp's Nine Day's Wonder by Morris dancing from London to Norwich, forming the basis of his play The Bard's Fool, performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tim Fitzhigham The Bard's Fool | work=Chortle  | url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/edinburgh_fringe_2008/t/16406/tim_fitzhigham%3A_the_bards_fool |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Women Speak''''' is a 1988 Chinese article written by [[Beijing]]-based Xiang Ya (向娅) about [[sexual revolution]] in the country as it "[[Chinese economic reform|opened up]]". The piece includes supposedly "tape-recorded" interviews of 10 anonymous urban women in their 30s and 40s, who discussed their highly private love/sex lives and thoughts. It was translated to English by Diana B. Kingsbury in her 1994 translated anthology ''I Wish I Were a Wolf''.

''Women Speak'' was adapted into a 1989 film ''[[Golden Fingernails]]'' directed by Bao Zhifang.

==Author==
Zhao Shaoling (赵绍玲), who used the [[pen name]] Xiang Ya, was born in 1951 in [[Lingshou County]], [[Hebei]]. In 1969, as part of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]] she was "[[sent-down youth|sent-down]]" to [[Inner Mongolia]] where she worked for 3 years in a rural army unit. In 1974, she was transferred to an electrical equipment plant in [[Beijing]], after which she found employment with the [[National Library of China]]. She attended night school and graduated with a degree in Chinese literature in 1985. She published her first article in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Wish I Were a Wolf: The New Voice in Chinese Women's Literature|last=Kingsbury|first=Diana B.|publisher=[[New World Press]]|year=1994|isbn=7-80005-124-2|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The interviews==
Each interview reads like a long monologue, with the interviewer barely present. No names are mentioned. Like the author, all interviewees in the 30s were "sent-down" to work in the countryside during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

*Woman '''A''' ("'''Her husband had a lover, but it worked out in the end'''"), a 36-year-old physician who graduated from medical school in 1983 along with her husband, with whom she has a loving relationship and great sex life. When she discovered her husband's affair 8 years into the marriage, she was not hurt, instead she felt calm and confident. She gently talked to him, said she understood and asked for only honesty. Her magnanimity greatly relieved him, who gratefully returned her trust. She also talked to and comforted his lover. Three years later the younger woman married well, and she is very happy for both marriages.
*Woman '''B''' ("'''Her husband's rising fame fed her fear'''"), a 35-year-old factory worker from a peasant background. Before their marriage, she persistently and unabashedly courted his love. The years right after the wedding were blissful, but recently she has become paranoid about his possible infidelity. Afraid of the attention he gets, she doesn't want him to write or dress up. She stalks him, opens his mail, confronts women around him, and visits his boss, but still feels anxious. He no longer makes love to her, but she'd rather have that than discover his affair. She has access to poison and is ready to kill him if he cheats. 
*Woman '''C''' ("'''She said, 'We are two independent planets, both free to come and go''''"), a 39-year-old company assistant manager. Her first marriage fell apart quickly. Her husband cheated on her, so she did the same to him. Two years later she fell in love with someone and filed for divorce. Her husband refused. Crying and begging, he even surprised her and her lover at night, but she protected her lover from his beating. On the wedding of her second marriage, she pronounced that if one "wants a divorce, the other must not refuse". She believes this made her new hubby value their relationship. They are very happy.
*Woman '''D''' ("'''Conventional love for her is not enough'''"), a 46-year-old department vice-director in a publishing house. She has no problems with her husband—except for sex. As he isn't able to satisfy her, she starts a clandestine affair with a married man who is good in bed. She also has no desire to divorce her husband, a point she made very clear to her lover. Actually, she believes the affair helps her marriage, as she can now vent her sexual frustration periodically without getting angry at her husband. She also believes adulterous lovemaking more exciting and satisfying, another reason she's maintaining the status quo.
*Woman '''E''' ("'''She fell in love with a married man'''"), a 38-year-old middle-school teacher. Her sex life during marriage was terrible, but she took a long time to leave him. After the divorce, she fell in love with a man already separated from his wife for 3 years. Still, she was called a homewrecker and received a disciplinary warning from her job. Without a marriage license, they are also turned away by most hotels. But she believes she did nothing wrong and continues to love him. When he was falsely diagnosed with cancer, she stayed in the hospital with him for 21 days. Eventually people around her became more understanding.
*Woman '''F''' ("'''A woman set on conquering men'''"), a 34-year-old charity organizer. Extremely ugly, she was abused by her parents and brother growing up. She craves for love, but no man paid her attention. Finally she swore vengeance. In 1981, she began the first non-governmental charity organization, and quickly achieved fame and success. During a TV interview, she was overcome with emotions and fainted. She began to have handsome suitors, but her "desire for revenge subsumed any sexual feeling". She repeated rejected two charming men. Now she has a stable plain-looking male partner, but doesn't want to marry.
*Woman '''G''' ("'''Love and sex are two different things'''"), a 38-year-old actress-turned-film director. Because she lost her virginity before marriage, her ex-husband treated her poorly, often beating her up during sex. Initially submissive, she became more confident and developed feminist ideas after working as an actress. After the divorce her career took off, and she started dating again with the intention of remarrying, but only met frivolous men. Disgusted, she has decided that she will never remarry, but she will not give up sex. She despises men, but still leads an active sex life without any commitment.
*Woman '''H''' ("'''Without love, she had to turn him down'''"), a 43-year-old teacher who lost her husband in a terrible accident 5 years ago. Though she has missed him, she is ready to remarry. Two years ago, a good male friend made advances towards her in his apartment, but she rejected him. Although he was still married, he had been separated for years from his wife who had gone abroad. So they were both independent, sexually experienced and very lonely, but it still didn't "feel right", as if something was missing. She has come to realize how important love is to her, and she "can't have sex without love".
*Woman '''I''' ("'''She wants a child but doesn't want to get married'''"), a 34-year-old lower-level cadre in an office. She is not interested in men and has no desire to marry, but wants to have a child. The family planning official finds her unbelievable, but she cites the marriage law as granting equal civil rights for children out of wedlock. She is also frustrated that the government has not allocated a large apartment for her only because she is single. "Why not judge us based on what we've done for society rather than on our marital status?... Why can't I be accorded my proper rights?" She asks angrily.
*Woman '''J''' ("'''A woman preoccupied with proving her virginity'''"), a 37-year-old company section chief. During middle school she accidentally broke her hymen riding a bike. At age 17, she was "sent-down" to rural [[Shaanxi]], where she witnessed the tradition of new brides holding high blood-stained cloth the morning after their weddings to prove that they had been virgins. Since then, she has been terrified she won't bleed if she has sex, and this anxiety effectively keeps her a virgin. Gradually all men lose interest in her, and she has stubbornly vowed to remain a virgin for the rest of her life, having learned to masturbate.

==Reception==
Li Xiaojiang wrote that ''Women Speak'' "did not incite a whirlwind when it appeared in 1988 because, for most intellectual and career women, a base of social equality and group consciousness had already been laid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li Xiaojiang|chapter=Resisting While Holding the Tradition—Claims for Right Raised in Literature by Chinese Women Writers in the New Period|pages=109–16|editor-last=Chen|editor-first=Peng-hsiang|editor2-last=Crothers Dilley|editor2-first=Whitney|title=Feminism/Femininity in Chinese Literature|publisher=[[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]]|isbn=90-420-0727-3|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation==
In ''[[Golden Fingernails]]'', the experiences of four of these women (A, C, E, and F) are interwoven into one story.

Women have made significant contributions to [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], a genre which predates Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in Latin America in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. The earliest musicians were [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent, whose lyrics "reflect conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all [[human experience]]." Indigenous communities reserved [[women in music|music for women]], who were given equal opportunities with men to teach, perform, sing, and dance. [[Ethnomusicologist]]s have measured ceramic, animal-bone, and cane [[flute]]s from the [[Inca Empire]] which indicate a preference for women with a high [[vocal range]]. Women had equal [[social status]], were trained, and received the same opportunities in music as men in indigenous communities until the arrival of Columbus in the late 15th century. European settlers brought patriarchal, [[machismo]] ideologies to the continent, replacing the idea of equality between men and women. They equated [[Native American music|native music]] with "savagery" and European music with "civilization". Female musicians tended to be darker-skinned as a result of the [[slave trade]] (which increased the population of [[African slaves]]), and contemporary society denigrated music as a profession. Latin music became Africanized, with [[syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]]; European settlement introduced [[harmony]] and the Spanish [[décima]] song form.

Since the [[history of sound recording|pre-recording era of music]], Latin music was male-dominated, and there are relatively few examples of female [[songwriter]]s, [[music producer]]s, [[record executive]]s, and [[music promoter|promoters]]. Women lacked access to musical training; music programs were nonexistent, and cultural norms discouraged female participation. Latin music had a primarily male presence; men discriminated against women, limiting them to singing or dancing and discouraging them from becoming [[instrumentalist]]s, writers, [[List of women composers|composers]], [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives. Women artists in the sub-genres of Latin music, such as [[Selena]], [[Jenni Rivera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Ivy Queen]], [[Julieta Venegas]], and [[Ely Guerra]]. have been credited with enhancing the genres' female presence; they have broken through barriers, reshaping Latin music and public perceptions of [[female sexuality]], gender, and [[femininity]]. Women in [[salsa music]] are significantly underrepresented in the industry as very few women, with the exception of [[Celia Cruz]], have been associated with the emergence of the genre; for example, in the British documentary ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cites'' (1985), Cruz is one of the only female singers who is mentioned.

Women Latin singers have a significant demographic imbalance on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[music charts]] compared with their male counterparts. As radio formats explore genres popularized and led by men, such as [[reggaeton]] and [[regional Mexican music]], women on the ''Billboard'' Latin music charts are periodically absent. The last female singer with a number-one single was [[Sofia Reyes]], whose collaborative "[[Solo Yo]]" ended a five-year drought on the [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart in 2016. A year earlier, on the 50-position [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart, 22 weeks passed without a song by a women. Reyes has expressed concern about the disparity between male and female performances at Latin music award shows, noting that 90 percent of the performers are male. Other female singers, such as [[Chiquis Rivera]], have attributed the decline in visibility of women in Latin music to  [[sexist]] radio programmers. Latin music executive Alexandra Lioutikoff believes that the decline is due to a lack of female collaboration. Latin music remains male-dominated, and the [[music industry]] has "prejudiced practice" limiting female recording artists.

== Characteristics ==
Latin American music is varied; it includes thirty countries, influenced by [[European music|European]], [[African American music|African]], and [[Native American music|Amerindian]] cultures.{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Latin music uses two European languages: [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], though modern-day widely distinguishes the genre as primarily sung or recorded in Spanish and to a lesser extent [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].{{sfn|Roberts|1999|p=3}} Although heterogeneous, Latin music commonly includes the Spanish [[décima]] song form, African [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[rhythm (music)|rhythms]] and [[call-and-response]], and European [[harmony (music)|harmony]].{{sfn|Miller|2008|p=254}}

== History ==
=== Pre-Columbian Latin America ===
[[File:Peru Tembladera Figure flute player DMA 1971-19.jpg|thumb|alt=Squat, reddish ceramic figurine of a person holding a flute|Pre-Columbian ceramic figurine of a Peruvian flute player]]
Pre-modern Latin music refers to music made by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]],{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} hundreds of [[ethnic group]]s across the continent.{{sfn|Navarro|Sánchez|Ali|1999|p=5}} The first inhabitants of Latin America settled 30,000 years before the arrival of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] at the peak of native cultural diversification into simple and complex societies.{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} These societies included sedentary agricultural tribes and [[hunter gatherers]],{{sfn|Preston|2014|p=11}} who sang [[prayer]]s to a deity asking for prosperity{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=1}} with lyrics of "conflict, beauty, pain, and loss that mark all human experience" and music reflecting their understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} They had "intricate ways of explaining the relationships between the sound, social organization, time, and the sacred",{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=5}} and their rituals included dramatized performances of mythology vocalizing their view of [[creationism|creation]].{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}} The creation myth of the [[Keres people]] of [[Laguna Pueblo]] (present west-central [[New Mexico]]) describes "the unformed cosmos as the domain of [[Tse che nako]] (Thought Woman or Spider Woman) who [[chant]]s life into two sacred bundles that become the sisters [[Keres (mythology)|Uretsete and Naosete]] (She Who Matters and She Who Remembers)."{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=8}}

Indigenous communities predating Columbus' arrival reserved [[women in music|music for women]], although men were equally involved in dance.{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=170}} During the [[Inca Empire]] in the mid-14th century, women from royal families and selected ''acallas'' (chosen ones) were taught science, art, poetry, and music from "wise elders".{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The "chosen ones" were selected for their beauty and "quality of their voices."{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} There were six houses, one of which was called the ''taquiaclla'' (''taqui'' means "song"),&lt;!-- In what language? --&gt; which housed girls aged nine to fifteen with "gifted" singing voices.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} The [[Andean civilizations|Andeans]] preferred young women with a high [[vocal range]].{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Although no scripts or musical notation survive, archaeologists have uncovered a variety of ceramic, animal bone, and cane [[flute]]s.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} [[Ethnomusicologist]]s who have measured the flutes have found their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] compatible with a high vocal range.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=442}} Women in these communities were well-treated,{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} with equal opportunities to teach, perform, sing, and dance (as soloists, with other women, or in pairs with men).{{sfn|Kuss|2004|p=139}} Female singers had a social status equal to men, receiving musical training and opportunities with their male counterparts.{{sfn|Sturman|2015}}

[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Europeans and natives meeting, with ships and a missionary cross in the background|Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Americas and Spanish colonization brought patriarchy and machismo to Latin music.]]
Columbus' arrival in 1492 and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] brought [[patriarchy]] and [[machismo]] to the continent, overriding sexual equality.{{sfn|Tompkins|Foster|2001|p=34}} Early [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]] described women as "property and mistrusted [by men]."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} In a song, "Delgadina", women are servants who must please their men "no matter the cost."{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} According to author Janet Sturman, the Iberian idea of machismo (in which a strong man is superior to others, including women) was held by the [[conquistadors]].{{sfn|Sturman|2015}} Europeans who settled in the [[New World]] associated native music with "savagery" and European music with "civilization".{{sfn|Berglund|Johnson|Lee|2016|p=17}} During the [[slave trade]], musicians in Latin America primarily had a dark complexion.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} This was due to an increased population of African slaves and contemporary society's view of music as a profession.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Most slaves arriving in Brazil were "bi-musical",&lt;!-- "Bi-musical" needs explanation. --&gt; and introduced their music to [[Music of Brazil|the country]].{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=154}} Rural [[Quechua language|Quechua]]-speaking [[Bolivia]]n farmers sang about European resistance in songs with Native American and European influences.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}} [[Dark skin|Black]] Bolivians sang songs with lyrics reflecting a European influence, performed as Africanized European music.{{sfn|Pendle|2001|p=439}}

In colonial Latin America, [[nun]]s wrote, directed, and performed music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} They played a variety of instruments, including the [[clavichord]], [[harp]], [[flageolet]], and flute.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} The nuns played in front of spectators, choirs, and high-ranking government officials.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Musically-adept, underprivileged women were allowed to perform during the nuns' [[Christmas]] recital.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} Performances were often "feminine acts", such as sewing, embroidery, bakery, and selling "special confections."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=102}} For two hundred years in Latin America, the "elite woman" was educated in the arts; "the rest" were consigned to cooking, sewing, spinning, weaving, embroidery, and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=167}} In 17th- and 18th-century [[Mexico City]], music was often heard by visitors.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} The music emanated from cathedral choirs, indigenous dancers, or black musicians organized in the city.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} During the 17th century, Europeans and their descendants wrote and performed music at cathedrals in Mexico's cities which was repeated in song by [[black people|blacks]], [[mulatto]]s, indigenous Mexicans, [[Asian people|Asians]], and ethnicities.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=49}} In 1690, Mexican author [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] wrote secular and religious poetry, plays, philosophy, and theology.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} She often discussed topics ranging from mathematics to music with visitors, had no interest in marriage and wanted to pursue "a life of the mind."{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}} Although her views were suppressed, de la Cruz defended [[women's rights]] in education.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=103}}

At a 1691 celebration, European traveler Juan de Galde described his participation in dancing and singing and placing a [[scapular]] on two young women in Mexico.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} A Mexican singer named Reina performed for six hours, which made "the event more enjoyable".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|pp=50-51}} The "wild" celebration banned [[Jamaicans]] from entry.{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=51}} In 1697, Neapolitan chronicler Gemelli Carreri wrote during his trip off the coast of the [[Dominican Republic]] that he saw a canoe of musicians trying to outdo each other in singing and drawing attention to their "perfection".{{sfn|Baker|Knighton|2011|p=50}} In 1799 [[Buenos Aires]], privileged women were encouraged to educate themselves in the arts.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}} The government required that women be taught to read and write, in addition to physical education and music.{{sfn|Socolow|2000|p=170}}

Since the arrival of European settlers, Latin music has been male-dominated.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Musical training was nonexistent for women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Male predominance in the genre left "power imbalances that acted as barriers to women's participation in Latin music."{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Despite this barrier, women have become successful.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Under the authority of men, they were limited to roles as [[vocalist]]s or dancers rather than [[instrumentalists]], writers, composers, [[music arranger|arrangers]], and executives.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} According to musicologist [[Ilan Stavans]], female roles were related to traditional norms; "decent women" cared for their children and remained at home, cleaning and cooking.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Women's dance routines were a growing concern among female fans and performers.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=267}} Female dancers, more closely scrutinized than males, were expected to follow "normative gender expectations" and exhibit "appropriate behavior".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} Although male dancers typically performed suggestively, women who danced similarly were accused of being "loose" or "slack".{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}}

[[File:Celia Cruz 1.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of Celia Cruz onstage in a fluffy gown|[[Celia Cruz]], who broke barriers against women in [[salsa music]], was instrumental in popularizing the genre.]]
According to author Lise Waxer, Cuban [[trova]] singer [[María Teresa Vera]] is the "great-grandmother of all Latin women singers".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} "Arroz Con Leche" ("Rice Pudding"), which advises the listener to find a spouse who will take care of them, was criticized by [[feminist]] groups.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=37}} [[Bolero]] lyrics have a central theme of women as the object of male desire, [[unrequited love]], and abandonment, portraying women as "physical absence and emotional distance, as ungrateful beings" unequipped to love a man.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cuban singer [[La Lupe]] "pushed the boundaries" of bolero music, and was called the queen of [[Latin soul]] music.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} She toured the U.S. with bandleader [[Tito Puente]], and was one of the most popular Latin performers of the 1960s.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} In her youth she dominated local singing competitions, which inspired her to pursue a career in music despite her parents' desire for her to become a teacher.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} After divorcing her first husband, La Lupe began a solo career and performed in [[Havana]] nightclubs.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her popularity grew, and she owned and operated a nightclub in Cuba which was seized by the [[Cuba under Fidel Castro|Castro government]].{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe emigrated to the United States, settled in New York in 1962 and began touring the country with other bolero and salsa performers.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She released several salsa albums with "devotional lyrics."{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Her concert requests began diminishing at the turn of the 1970s as her savings drained because of her second husband's failing health.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} She ended her professional career in a wheelchair at a final, 1985 concert with Puente to help pay her medical expenses.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} La Lupe, who devoted her remaining years to [[Christian music]] in [[the Bronx]], died of [[cardiac arrest]] in February 1992.{{sfn|Pareles|1992}} Cuban singers [[Rita Montaner]] and [[Celeste Mendoza]] were involved in the "appropriation and rearticulation of [[rhumba|rumba]]", a genre popular before salsa.{{sfn|Poey|2014}}
 
As [[salsa music]] grew in popularity, [[Celia Cruz]] emerged during the 1950s and was known as the queen of the genre.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Although Cruz was instrumental in popularizing and developing male-dominated salsa,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} few other women are associated with it.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} She was the only female singer featured in the British documentary, ''Salsa: Latin Pop Music in the Cities'' (1985), which noted the absence of women in the industry.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} According to the documentary, women were "not trained in popular music and that women dared not improvise—''sonear'' (closeness)—on stage".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}} Cruz crossed boundaries set by public expectations for music performed at nightclubs, but she was the exception who proved the rule.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} Opportunities for all-female salsa bands were nonexistent; gender discrimination flourished in the market, and women were seen as "less competent than their male counterparts."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In 1977 Cruz recorded "Usted Abusó", which gave a voice to [[violence against women|battered women]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=268}} The 1980s saw the emergence of [[salsa romántica]], which was "deemed as homogenized, depoliticized, and ultimately, feminized."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=137}}
 
[[File:Gloriaestefan ahoy.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gloria Estefan onstage, singing and holding flowers|In 1993, [[Gloria Estefan]] was the first musician to debut an album atop the ''Billboard'' [[Top Latin Albums]] chart.]]
During the 1990s women began playing a larger role in salsa music,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} increasing the genre's popularity,{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} and female salsa singers broke "the sexist boundaries of the [Latin] music industry".{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=147}} Although women singers were becoming more popular, images of men were emphasized to the public more than those of women.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=14}} [[La India]], Corinne, [[Brenda K. Starr]], [[Lissette Melendez]], and Yolanda la Duke were instrumental in refining salsa in that decade, although all were managed by men.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} Their new salsa sound was influenced by African American music ([[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[jazz music|jazz]], and [[soul music|soul]]), which revolutionized traditional 1970s salsa.{{sfn|Waxer|2002|p=136}} According to author Lise Waxer, a "careful and attentive listening" of their recordings indicated the "female authority and influence—a female genealogy—of salsa music."{{sfn|Waxer|2002|pp=136, 147}} Salsa's leading female singer was [[La India]],{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=412}} who developed salsa romantica music during the 1990s and whose lyrics "turn the tables" on the male salsa narrative of women as objects of desire, "cruel and evil or idealized and unattainable."{{sfn|Poey|2014}} In her most-popular song, "[[Ese Hombre (Rocío Jurado song)|Ese Hombre]]" (originally recorded by [[Rocío Jurado]]), La India contradicts male stereotypes.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} The song's lyrics describe a man who is "a fool/stupid and conceited/selfish and capricious", reversing male "discursive terrorism" toward their female partners.{{sfn|Poey|2014}} La India has been compared to Celia Cruz as leaders in their respective eras,{{sfn|Candelaria|2004|p=413}} and to La Lupe in musical style: "nasal style of singing, growls, and screams that evoke an androgynous style rather than a soft melodious tone."{{sfn|Poey|2014}}

In her Spanish-language debut, [[Gloria Estefan]] released ''[[Mi Tierra]]'' (1993). It was a commercial success, debuting atop the new US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Latin Albums]] chart. Estefan has been described by her [[Latin pop]] contemporaries as performing [[pop ballad]]s and [[soft rock]].{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=113}} She has also ventured into salsa and [[merengue music]], using salsa in her English-language compositions; "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" brought her to European clubs.{{sfn|Broughton|Ellingham|Trillo|1999|p=499}} The rural Cuban genre [[guajira (music)|guajira]] offered a musical identity to [[Afro-Cuban]]s;{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=305}} [[Albita Rodriguez]] became popular, and was named one of the top 100 personalities of the 20th century by ''[[Newsweek (magazine)|Newsweek]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Novas|2007|p=323}} Most of her repertoire are love songs with "openly erotic lyrics" with hetero- and homosexual themes.{{sfn|Aparicio|2010|p=243}}

The duo of [[Monchy y Alexandra]] "established [[bachata (music)|bachata]] as a [[easy listening|'nice']] music that could be listened to in the home by women and children."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} Women "embraced [the] clean-up"; the romantic bachata style, with emotive lyrics, expressed longing for a lost lover.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=91}} In 1950s bachata music, women were accused of "treachery or promiscuity or, in more humorous moments, referring to [[women sexuality|their sexuality]] and sexual organs with thinly veiled double entendres."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}} The lyrics were rooted in an era where [[women in the workplace]] became more common, displacing men as [[breadwinner]]s.{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=89}}

In 19th-century merengue music, a man "won the love of woman" by dancing.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=34}} Modern merengue (a [[club music|party]] genre) lyrics explored the "vicissitudes of urban life [and] employed skillful wordplay and humorous double entendres about women and sex."{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} Because of the genre's "air of male-dominated sexuality", [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] men believed that making merengue music is "no fitting occupation for women."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} According to [[Santo Domingo|Santo Domingans]], listening to merengue music "is only for men" and a woman who enjoys the music is considered "a crazy girl [and] a bad girl."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} During the 1970s, attitudes toward women and merengue music changed with the changing roles of women in Dominican society.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} All-female merengue bands emerged in the 1980s, beginning with [[Las Chicas Del Can]] in 1984.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}} Participation in merengue increased in 1990, with women playing [[percussion]] and [[brass]] instruments formerly considered too difficult for women.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=116}}

Female merengue bands were often formed by successful male merengue musicians, who "often referred to them as the property of the [male musicians who formed them]."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The mainly-female merengue band [[Milly y los Vecinos|Milly, Jocelyn y Los Vecinos]] formed after Las Chicas del Can.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} The group became popular, despite not setting out to challenge existing gender roles.{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=117}} Feminists have noted the "limited values" in merengue recordings by women, since most of their songs are written by men who "do not resolutely challenge patriarchal attitudes."{{sfn|Austerlitz|1997|p=118}} [[Olga Tañón]] was the most successful female merengue artist in the 1990s,{{sfn|Hernandez|2010|p=88}} and has been called the queen of merengue music.{{sfn|Steingress|2002|p=13}} Tañón has been credited with popularizing merengue in [[Music of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], a salsa-dominated market.{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}} Her 1994 album, ''Siente el Amor'', outsold her previous recordings: ''[[Mujer de Fuego]]'' (1993) and her platinum-certified debut studio album, ''[[Sola]]'' (1992).{{sfn|Morales|2003|p=248}}

Since the [[history of radio|beginning of radio]] women have been accepted as [[mariachi]] singers, often performing duets with men.{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} The Mexican quintet Las Coronelas, formed by María Carlota Noriega during the 1940s, was the first mariachi [[all-female band]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=467}} The first all-female [[ranchera]] band, Las Generales (formed by Elena Muñoz), consisted of wives and mothers of male professional mariachi musicians.{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} The group was criticized by the public for playing in ''[[cantina]]s'' ([[bar]]s),{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} and their partners destroyed their instruments.{{sfn|Greathouse|2009|p=112}} Other all-female bands tried unsuccessfully to be pioneers.

At the turn of the decade, Tejano music was the fastest-growing music genre in the United States.{{sfn|Anon.|1996|p=10}} The American singer [[Selena]] dominated Tejano music, bringing it [[mainstream]] success.{{sfn|Lomelí|Ikas|2000|p=58}}{{sfn|Stavans|1998|p=5}} During her early career, she was often turned down by music venues because of her age and her fronting of [[Selena y Los Dinos|a Tejano band]].{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=112}} Selena's father, [[Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.]] was told that she would not be successful because she was a woman.{{sfn|Patoski|1996|p=112}} She was the first female Tejano singer to receive gold and platinum certifications,{{sfn|Roterman|1995}}{{sfn|Richmond|1995|p=48}} the first female Tejano singer to receive a [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Grammy Award for Best Mexican American Album]],{{sfn|Stacy|2002|p=746}} the first Tejano singer to top the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Top Latin Albums]] chart,{{sfn|Lannert|1994 (a)|p=34, 103}} and the first female to outsell male Tejano singers.{{sfn|Patoski|2000}}{{sfn|Acosta|2006}} After Selena's 1995 [[Murder of Selena|murder]], Tejano music waned in popularity.{{sfn|Paredez|2009|p=21}} Selena's popularity increased after her death, and she is the only Tejano singer with constant appearances on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=498}} Her posthumously-released album, ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' (1995), was the first recording by a Hispanic singer to debut atop the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.{{sfn|Marrero|2003|p=172}}{{sfn|Burr|2005|p=56}} Selena's music explored love, pain, strength and passion,{{sfn|Stavans|2009|p=725}} and ''Billboard'' called her the best-selling Latin artist of the 1990s.{{sfn|Mayfield|1999|p=YE-16-18}} Latin music entered the mainstream market in the late 1990s, believed by music critics to be due to the death of Selena and the emergence of [[Ricky Martin]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Marc Anthony]],{{sfn|Márquez|2001}}{{sfn|Brill|2010}} with greater commercial success and worldwide recognition than ever before.{{sfn|Rivera-Servera|2012|p=10}}

In July 2017, Spanish writer Daniela Bose noted the absence of women in Spanish music charts in comparison with those of [[Music of France|France]] and [[Music of Italy|Italy]]; culturally similar to Spain, women were more successful in the latter countries.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose analyzed the [[Spanish Albums Chart|Spanish Albums]] and [[Spanish Singles Chart|Singles Charts]], finding that the only Spanish singers who placed in the top 50 were [[Malú]], [[Vanesa Martin]], Sweet California, [[India Martinez]], and the [[Spanish folk music]] singers [[Mónica Naranjo]] and [[Isabel Pantoja]].{{sfn|Bose|2017}} When Bose expanded her search to the next 50 positions, she found only non-Spanish singers.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She concluded that listeners had replaced Spanish and [[Latin pop]] music with reggaeton and [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]], genres performed by men with lyrics belittling women "as meat".{{sfn|Bose|2017}} Bose found a [[subtext]] in the songs encouraging female [[infidelity]] for sexual reasons, alluding to a non-committed relationship.{{sfn|Bose|2017}} According to Bose, music "is not one of those 'secure' professions [for those who] seek stability"; she found women absent from prominent positions held by men, such as heading a record label, producing concerts, and [[audio engineer]]ing; in these fields, with higher pay and power, women lack "decision-making process[es] that set the path for [the Latin music] industry."{{sfn|Bose|2017}} She ended her report by urging the music industry to avoid gender imbalances in their markets: "What dazzles is the beauty of the final work, regardless of who creates it."{{sfn|Bose|2017}}

The '''Woodwrae Stone''' (alternatively the '''Woodwray Stone''') is a Class II [[Pictish Stones|Pictish Stone]] (c. 8th or 9th century) that was found in 1819 when the foundations of the old castle at Woodwrae, [[Angus, Scotland]] were cleared.&lt;ref name="jervise"&gt;{{citation

The reverse face has suffered considerable mutilation. It is divided into three sections.
