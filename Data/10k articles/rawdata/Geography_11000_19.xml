      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4264">'''Adam Tickell''' [[FAcSS]] (born 1965) is a British economic geographer, whose work explores finance, English local governance, and the politics of ideas. He is currently the Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acss.org.uk/fellow/professor-adam-tickell-facss/|title=Professor Adam Tickell FAcSS -|website=www.acss.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Adam Tickell is descended from the [[Huxley family]]. He obtained a first-class degree in Geography in 1987 from the [[University of Manchester]] and a PhD from the same institution on the social regulation of banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2010/11/25Nov2010Tickell.aspx|title=Birmingham appoints Tickell to management team|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tickell moved jobs frequently, holding positions and professorships at the universities of Bristol, Leeds, Southampton, Birmingham and Royal Holloway, University of London.

At the [[University of Bristol]], from 2000, he became research director of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Law. Simultaneously, he was the Vice Chair of the Research Grants Board of the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).

He later joined [[Royal Holloway]], becoming Dean and Vice-Principal. He joined the [[University of Birmingham]] in 2011, becoming  Provost and Vice-Principal. He became the vice chancellor of the [[University of Sussex]] in 2016.

He is the current Chair of [[Universities UK]] Open Access Implementation Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/adam-tickell&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
Tickell is one a number of geographers active since the 1980s studying the spatial and economic expression of capital, finance, and global markets. Others with whom he has coauthored work include [[Eric Sheppard]], [[Nigel Thrift]] and [[Jamie Peck]]. In particular, he has explored the nature of [[post-Fordism]] and regional decentralisation in the UK.

Tickell's most cited work is "Neoliberalizing space", an article with [[Jamie Peck]] in ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]]'' journal, published in 2002 and cited 4,600 times by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=3EtouHEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en|title=Adam Tickell - Google Scholar Citations|website=scholar.google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was editor of [[Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers]] in the mid 2000s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/about/who/leadership/vice-chancellor|title=Professor Adam Tickell: Vice-Chancellor and President : Our leadership : ...  : About us : University of Sussex|website=www.sussex.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a Fellow of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]].

==Controversy==
In 2018 Tickell attracted hostility from academics and students who felt his academic critiques of neoliberalism were at odds with the stance he took as a Vice Chancellor during the [[2018 USS pension dispute]] over threats to academic pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histhum.com/?p=497|title=#notallgeographers|date=6 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posters appeared saying "Critiques neoliberalism in academic articles, but privatises the university for cash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetab.com/uk/sussex/2018/03/24/adam-tickell-memes-appear-on-london-bus-stop-26933|title=Adam Tickell memes appear on London bus stops|date=24 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told ''[[The_Badger_(newspaper)|The Badger]]'' that the UCU strikes would achieve nothing, even though he was once a UCU member and rep; this proved incorrect. In December 2017 ''The Sun'' reported Tickell was paid £267,000 for the period of September 2016 to July 2017, plus £17,000 relocation costs and £9,000 in pension contributions.

'''Alexander Keith Johnston''' (November 11, 1844 in Edinburgh{{snd}}June 28, 1879 in [[Tanzania]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]], [[cartographer]] and [[geographer]].

He was the son of published [[geographer]] [[Alexander Keith Johnston (1804-1871)|Alexander Keith Johnston]] (1804–1871) and Mary Grey.

From 1873 to 1875 he was geographer to a commission for the survey of [[Paraguay]]. He led a [[Royal Geographical Society]] expedition to [[Lake Nyasa]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]]. After only six weeks of the expedition Johnston died from malaria and dysentry in the village of Beho Beho in what is now the [[Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania]] .&lt;ref name=Hiccups&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Karl|title=Curing hiccups with small fires : a delightful miscellany of Great British eccentrics|date=2010|publisher=Pan|location=London|isbn=978-0-330-51292-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was accompanied by fellow Scot [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)]] who successfully completed the expedition.

Several expeditions were conducted by * [https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/staff/mikeshand/#/publications,articles,researchinterests Mike Shand] (University of Glasgow) to find the grave of Keith Johnston at Behobeho between 2001 and 2004.  The grave searches have been documented in a chapter of the book  *[http://www.wildlife-baldus.com/selous_book.html Wild Heart of Africa - The Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania], edited by Rolf Baldus and published by Rowland Ward in 2009.

He died at Beho Beho in South Africa&lt;ref&gt;Grave of A K Johnston, Grange Cemetery&lt;/ref&gt; and is memorialised on his father's grave in [[Grange, Edinburgh|Grange Cemetery]] in [[Edinburgh]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5459">{{Byzantine Military}}
The '''''bandon''''' ({{lang-el|βάνδον}}) was the basic military unit and administrative [[territorial entity]] of the middle [[Byzantine Empire]]. Its name, like the [[Latin]] ''bandus'' and ''bandum'' ("ensign, [[banner]]"), had a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] origin.{{sfn|Bali|2013|p=462}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=250}} It derived from the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''bandwō'',{{sfn|Bali|2013|p=462}} which is the witness of foreign influence in the army at the time this type of unit evolved.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=4}} 

==Origin==
The term was used already in the 6th century, mentioned by [[Procopius]],{{sfn|Bali|2013|p=462}} as a term for a battle standard, and soon came to be applied to the unit bearing such a standard itself.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=250}} From the reign of [[Nikephoros I]] (802–811) it was the name for a subdistrict of the Byzantine ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]''.{{sfn|Bali|2013|p=462}}

==Organization==
In the [[Byzantine army]] of the 8th–11th centuries, the ''bandon'' formed the basic unit, with five to seven ''banda'' forming a ''[[tourma]]'', the major subdivision of a ''thema'', a combined military-civilian province.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=250}} Each ''bandon'' was commanded by a ''komes'' ("count"), with infantry ''banda'' 200–400 strong and cavalry ''banda'' 50–100 strong.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=250}}{{sfn|Heath|1995|p=13}} It is considered that the ''bandon'' in the ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'' (9th century) previously in the ''[[Strategikon of Maurice|Strategikon]]'' (6th century) was alternatively written as ''tagma'' or ''arithmos''.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=4}}

Infantry ''banda'' was formed by sixteen ''lochaghiai'', each with sixteen man, commanded by an officer ''lochaghos'' (file leader), which was assisted by ''[[Decanus|dekarchos]]'' (leader of ten), ''pentarchos'' (leader of five), ''tetrarchos'' (leader of four), and ''ouraghos'' (file closer).{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=4}} Each four ''lochaghiai'' formed an ''[[Allagion|allaghion]]'' (winglet), and around three-quarters of the men were spearmen ''skutaoi'' and one-quarter were archers.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=4}} At the time the ''Strategikon'' was written, the cavalry ''banda'' was subdivied into three ''hekatontarchia'', each commaned by a ''hekatontarchos'' with a senior second-in-command ''illarches''.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=4}}

By the reign of [[Leo VI the Wise]] (886–912), the ''hekatontarchia'' disappeared and the ''bandon'' was divided into six ''allaghia'' (probably commanded by ''pentekontarchai''), and each pair was still commanded by a ''hekatontarchos'' or ''kentarchos''.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=5}} Each of six ''allaghia'' had fifty men, organized in five ''dekarchiai'' of ten men each.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=5}} All four officers (''dekarchos'', ''pentarchos'', ''tetrarchos'', ''ouraghos'') were [[lancer]]s.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=5}}

==Late empire==
At the beginning of the 10th century the infantry unit consisted of 256 men (16x16), and cavalry unit of 300 men (6x50), but the manuals indicate that the unit strength in fact varied between 200 and 400 men.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=5}} The work ''[[Praecepta Militaria]]'' by [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (963–969) indicates that the cavalry ''bandon'' was only 50 strong.{{sfn|Heath|1979|p=5}} Unlike other middle Byzantine administrative and military terms, the ''bandon'' survived well into the late Byzantine period, and remained the basic territorial unit of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] until its fall.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=250}}

In [[geology]], a '''claypan''' is a dense, compact, slowly permeable layer in the [[subsoil]] having a much higher [[clay]] content than the overlying material, from which it is separated by a sharply defined boundary. Claypans are usually hard when dry, and plastic and sticky when wet. They limit or slow the downward movement of [[water]] through the [[soil]]. 

== Animal Habitats ==
Claypans provide homes to a variety of flora and fauna. One such species is the [[Amegilla dawsoni|Dawson's Burrowing Bee]], located in Australia. This species uses claypans as the sites for their underground nests, where individuals will they lay their broods post-mating.

[[File:Makkahi mukarramah.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Cumulus humilis cloud]] over Mecca city]]
[[Mecca]] features a [[hot desert climate]]. Mecca retains its hot temperature in winter, which can range from {{convert|18|C|F}} at night to {{convert|30|C|F}} in the day. Summer temperatures are extremely hot, often being over {{convert|40|C|F}} during the day, dropping to {{convert|30|C|F}} at night.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://thebahrainpropertysite.com/mecca-weather.html MECCA WEATHER AND TEMPERATURE actual five ten fifteen day ecast&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rain usually falls in Mecca in small amounts between November and January. The [[rain]]fall, as scant as it is, also presents the threat of flooding and has been a danger since the earliest times. According to Al-Kurdī, there had been 89 historic [[flood]]s by 1965, including several in the period. In the last century the most severe one occurred in 1942. Since then, [[dam]]s have been constructed to ameliorate the problem.

==Factors==
Mecca is at an elevation of 277&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, and approximately 80&amp;nbsp;km inland from the Red Sea.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Flash floods are common during winter season even though the amount of precipitation is low. Since Mecca is located in a desert, dust storms are common in the city.

*'''Shamal winds''' occur in Mecca mostly during summer months, these Shamal winds are very dusty and remain at peak in the morning but decreases at night. These winds also occur in winter but not often.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2cmmgwUJH98C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;vq=shamal&amp;dq=The+Gulf+War+and+the+Environment&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 The Gulf War and the environment - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Sandstorms''' and '''Dust storms''' both affect Mecca almost every month but especially during summer months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eosnap.com/?s=dust+storm+n+peninsula+march Earth Snapshot • dust storm n peninsula march&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Westerly winds''' bring thunderstorms to Mecca during winter and [[hail|hailstorms]] sometimes also occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=/middleeast/2010/November/middleeast_November367.xml&amp;section=middleeast Pilgrims rush as hail storm hits Mina valley&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme weather events==
Since [[Mecca]] is located in a low-lying region, it is threatened by seasonal flash floods despite the low amount of annual precipitation. There are less than {{convert|110|mm|in}} of rainfall during the year, mainly falling in the winter months. Temperatures are high throughout the year and in summer it may reach {{convert|45|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/371782/Mecca/37822/Climate Mecca ( ) :: Climate - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The following are extreme weather events in Mecca and the surrounding area.

*In November 2009, [[Makkah Province]] was badly affected when [[2009 Jeddah floods|record-breaking rainfall]] of {{convert|90|mm|in}} hit the province causing flash floods all over the province. It was the worst flood in 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentID=2009112655554  Gazette - Flooding kills 12 in Jeddah, Thousands of pilgrims stranded on highway&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In November 2010, a thunderstorm killed 3 people in Makkah city following heavy rainfall.

'''Historic garden conservation''' is a specialised type of [[historic preservation]] and [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation or restoration]] concerned with historical and landmark [[garden]]s and [[designed landscape]]s.

==Profession==
Practitioners predominantly come from backgrounds in [[horticulture]], [[garden design]], [[landscape design]], and [[landscape architecture]]. To prepare a management plan for a historic garden, such experts require knowledge and skills in [[environmental design]], horticulture, [[landscape history]], [[History of architecture|architectural history]], and management. Specialist educational programs are available (see section below).

[[File:Lancelot ('Capability') Brown by Nathaniel Dance, (later Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland, Bt) cropped.jpg|thumb|right|One of most famous historical landscape architects, Lancelot "Capability" Brown (1716 - 1783).]]
Historic garden restoration is the professional task of restoring historic gardens to the character they had at a previous point in history. Since the use of old gardens is in flux, this normally involves a consideration of current and future use. The job of researching historic gardens and preparing a policy for their conservation involves [[landscape archaeology]], historic knowledge, design judgment and technical skill in horticulture and construction.

==Education==
===United Kingdom===
Several universities and colleges in England run undergraduate and postgraduate courses related to historic garden conservation.

*[http://www.history.ac.uk/study/ma-garden-history Institute of Historical Research] - MA in garden and landscape history, [[Institute of Historical Research]] ([[University of London|London]])
*[http://www2.gre.ac.uk/study/courses/ug/land/d4k3 University of Greenwich] - BSc landscape management course, [[University of Greenwich]]

*MA historic designed landscapes, Writtle College
*The [[University of Bath]] ran a specialist MSc / PGDip course in the conservation of historic gardens and cultural landscapes, until the 2014-15 academic year.

=== France ===

* The [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains [[Curator|curators]] specialized in « scientific, technical and natural heritage ». 

==Public protection==
===United Kingdom===
Statutory protection exists for registered parks, gardens and designed landscapes. There are separate heritage registers maintained for each of the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]]:

* The [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England]] is maintatined by [[English Heritage]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/registered-parks-and-gardens/ |title=Historic Parks and Gardens |publisher=English Heritage |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the [[Australian Garden History Society]] is a similar organization to the UK's Garden History Society.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Powis castle terraces.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Baroque]] terraced garden at [[Powis Castle]] in Wales, restored in the early 20th century and now cared for by the National Trust.]]
In [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and likewise in [[Scotland]] the [[National Trust for Scotland]], own or manage many [[English country house|country houses]] and/or the gardens and parkland attached to them, as well as other treasured gardens, parks and landscapes, on behalf of the nation.

The [[Garden History Society]] is the oldest such society in the world, forming in 1966. It became [[The Gardens Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegardenstrust.org The Gardens Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015, having merged with the Association of Gardens Trusts. Its aims are to study garden history and conserve historic gardens. Since 1995 it is a statutory consultee on proposals affecting registered parks, gardens and landscapes in England. It has about 1,500 members and publishes the ''Garden History'' journal twice-yearly, as well as a regular members' newsletter. The society has an active group for Scotland, with its own regular newsletter and conservation officer.

The [[Welsh Historic Gardens Trust]] is a similar society specifically for gardens, parks and landscapes in Wales. Most of the counties of England also have their own trust, which were represented by the Association of Gardens Trusts, which since 2015 forms part of The Gardens Trust.

In London there is the [[Garden Museum]], covering all aspects of gardening history and with a large and growing collection of historic objects such as old tools and plans.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], [[The Garden Conservancy]] actively assists in the preservation of notable gardens and designed landscapes in the country.

There is also the [http://cglhs.org/ California Garden and Landscape History Society] for events and education in [[California]] specifically.

The Garden Club of Virginia has restored many of the most notable historic gardens in [[Virginia]] since its founding around 1913. A [[Historic Garden Week]] is run, in part to raise money for restorations.

==Examples of restoration==
===United Kingdom===
[[File:Wrest Park Apprentice Gardeners Creating a Parterre.jpg|thumb|right|Restoration work at Wrest Park.]]
Recent and ongoing examples of garden conservation and restoration in England include [[Lowther Castle]] in [[Cumbria]], [[Rivington#Lever Park|Lever Park]] in [[Lancashire]], [[Biddulph Grange]] in [[Staffordshire]], [[Croome Court]] and [[Witley Court#Restoration|Witley Court]] in [[Worcestershire]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-29490769 BBC News] Croome parkland restored by National Trust (4 October 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wrest Park]] in [[Bedfordshire]], and the [[Lost Gardens of Heligan]] in [[Cornwall]].

In [[ecology]], a '''disturbance''' is a temporary change in environmental conditions that causes a pronounced change in an [[ecosystem]]. Disturbances often act quickly and with great effect, to alter the physical structure or arrangement of biotic and [[abiotic]] elements. Disturbance can also occur over a long period of time and can impact the [[biodiversity]] within an ecosystem. Major ecological disturbances may include [[fires]], [[flooding]], [[windstorm]]s, [[insect]] [[outbreaks]] and [[trampling]]. [[Earthquake]]s, various [[types of volcanic eruptions]], [[tsunami]], [[firestorm]]s, [[impact events]], [[climate change]], and the devastating effects of [[human impact on the environment]] ([[anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] disturbances) such as [[clearcutting]], [[deforestation|forest clearing]] and the introduction of [[invasive species]]&lt;ref name="bioscience"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dale, V.|author2=Joyce, L.|author3=McNulty, S.|author4=Neilson, R.|author5=Ayres, M.|author6=Flannigan, M.|author7=Hanson, P.|author8=Irland, L.|author9=Lugo, A.|author10=Peterson, C.|author11=Simberloff, D.|author12=Swanson, F.|author13=Stocks, B.|author14=Wotton, B.|date=September 2001|title=Climate Change and Forest Disturbances|journal=[[BioScience]]|volume=51|issue=9|pages=723–734|doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0723:CCAFD]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered major disturbances. Not only invasive species can have a profound effect on an ecosystem, but also naturally occurring species can cause disturbance by their behavior.  Disturbance forces can have profound immediate effects on ecosystems and can, accordingly, greatly alter the [[biocoenosis|natural community]]. Because of these and the impacts on populations, disturbance determines the future shifts in dominance, various species successively becoming dominant as their life history characteristics, and associated life-forms, are exhibited over time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Use of Vital Attributes to Predict Successional Changes in Plant Communities Subject to Recurrent Disturbances|last=Nobel|first=I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==

Conditions under which natural disturbances occur are influenced mainly by [[climate]], weather, and location.&lt;ref name="bioscience" /&gt;Natural fire disturbances for example occur more often in areas with a higher incidence of lightning and flammable biomass, such as [[Longleaf pine ecosystem|longleaf pine ecosystems]] in the southeastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1035947633|title=Fire ecology of Florida and the southeastern coastal plain|last=F.,|first=Noss, Reed|isbn=9780813052199|location=Gainesville|oclc=1035947633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions often occur as part of a cycle and disturbances may be periodic. Other disturbances, such as those caused by humans, invasive species or impact events, can occur anywhere and are not necessarily cyclic. [[extinction vortex|Extinction vortices]] may result in multiple disturbances or a greater frequency of a single disturbance. Immediately after a disturbance there is a pulse of recruitment or regrowth under conditions of little [[Competition (biology)|competition]] for space or other resources. After the initial pulse, recruitment slows since once an individual plant is established it is very difficult to displace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the varying forms of disturbance this directly impacts the organisms which will exploit the disturbance and create diversity within an ecosystem.

== Cyclic disturbance ==
[[File:Kyrill-Schäden-04.JPG|thumb|Damages of storm [[Kyrill (storm)|Kyrill]] in Wittgenstein, [[Germany]].]]

Often, when disturbances occur naturally, they provide conditions that favor the success of different species over pre-disturbance organisms. This can be attributed to physical changes in the biotic and abiotic conditions of an ecosystem. Because of this, a disturbance force can change an ecosystem for significantly longer than the period over which the immediate effects persist. With the passage of time following a disturbance, shifts in dominance may occur with ephemeral herbaceous life-forms progressively becoming over topped by taller perennials herbs, shrubs and trees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in the absence of further disturbance forces, many ecosystems trend back toward pre-disturbance conditions. Long lived species and those that can regenerate in the presence of their own adults finally become dominant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such alteration, accompanied by changes in the [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] of different species over time, is called [[ecological succession]]. Succession often leads to conditions that will once again predispose an ecosystem to disturbance.

Pine forests in the western North America provide a good example of such a cycle involving insect outbreaks. The [[mountain pine beetle]] (''Dendroctonus ponderosae'') play an important role in limiting pine trees like [[lodgepole pine]] in forests of western North America. In 2004 the beetles affected more than 90,000 square kilometres. The beetles exist in [[endemic]] and [[epidemic]] phases. During epidemic phases swarms of beetles kill large numbers of old pines. This mortality creates openings in the forest for new vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mock | first1 = K.E. | last2 = Bentz | first2 = B.J. | last3 = O'Neill | first3 = E.M. | last4 = Chong | first4 = J.P. | last5 = Orwin | first5 = J. | last6 = Pfrender | first6 = M.E. | year = 2007 | title = Landscape-scale genetic variation in a forest outbreak species, the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) | url = | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 553–568 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03158.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spruce, fir, and younger pines, which are unaffected by the beetles, thrive in canopy openings. Eventually pines grow into the canopy and replace those lost. Younger pines are often able to ward off beetle attacks but, as they grow older, pines become less vigorous and more susceptible to infestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ham | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Hertel | first2 = G.D. | year = 1984 | title = Integrated Pest Management of the Southern Pine Beetle in the Urban Setting | url = | journal = Journal of Arboriculture | volume = 10 | issue = 10| pages = 279–282 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle of death and re-growth creates a temporal mosaic of pines in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;Forest Practices Board. 2007. Lodgepole Pine Stand Structure 25 Years after Mountain Pine Beetle Attack. {{cite web|url=http://www.fpb.gov.bc.ca/special/reports/SR32/Lodgepole_Pine_Stand_Structure_25_Years_after_Mountain_Pine_Beetle_Attack.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029182506/http://www.fpb.gov.bc.ca/special/reports/SR32/Lodgepole_Pine_Stand_Structure_25_Years_after_Mountain_Pine_Beetle_Attack.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar cycles occur in association with other disturbances such as fire and windstorms.

When multiple disturbance events affect the same location in quick succession, this often results in a "compound disturbance," an event which, due to the combination of forces, creates a new situation which is more than the sum of its parts.  For example, windstorms followed by fire can create fire temperatures and durations that are not expected in even severe wildfires, and may have surprising effects on post-fire succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1890/ES11-00038.1|title=Disturbance interactions can impact resilience mechanisms of forests|journal=Ecosphere|volume=2|issue=5|pages=art64|year=2011|last1=Buma|first1=B.|last2=Wessman|first2=C. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental stresses can be described as pressure on the environment, with compounding variables such as extreme temperature or precipitation changes—which all play a role in the diversity and succession of an ecosystem. With environmental moderation, diversity increases because of the intermediate- disturbance effect, decreases because of the competitive-exclusion effect, increases because of the prevention of competitive exclusion by moderate predation, and decreases because of the local extinction of prey by severe predation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menge|first=A|year=1987|title=Community Regulation: Variation in Disturbance, Competition, and Predation in Relation to Environmental Stress and Recruitment|jstor=2461716|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=130|doi=10.1086/284741}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction in recruitment density reduces the importance of competition for a given level of environmental stress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Species adapted to disturbance ==

[[Image:Greece Forest Fire July 25 2007.jpg|thumb|Forest fire burns on the island of [[Zakynthos]] in [[Greece]] on July 25th, 2007.]]

A disturbance may change a forest significantly. Afterwards, the forest floor is often littered with dead material. This decaying matter and abundant sunlight promote an abundance of new growth. In the case of forest fires a portion of the [[nutrient]]s previously held in plant biomass is returned quickly to the soil as biomass burns. Many plants and animals benefit from disturbance conditions.&lt;ref name="pringle"&gt;Pringle, L. 1979. Natural Fire: Its Ecology in Forests. William Morrow and Company, New York. 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some species are particularly suited for exploiting recently disturbed sites. Vegetation with the potential for rapid growth can quickly take advantage of the lack of competition. In the northeastern United States, [[shade-intolerant]] trees like pin cherry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = P.L. | year = 1974 | title = The Role of Pin Cherry (Prunus pensylvanica) in the Maintenance of Stability in Northern Hardwood Ecosystems | url = | journal = Ecological Monographs | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 73–88 | doi=10.2307/1942319}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aspen]] quickly fill in forest gaps created by fire or windstorm (or human disturbance). Silver maple and eastern sycamore are similarly well adapted to floodplains. They are highly tolerant of standing water and will frequently dominate floodplains where other species are periodically wiped out.

When a tree is blown over, gaps typically are filled with small herbaceous [[seedling]]s but, this is not always the case; shoots from the fallen tree can develop and take over the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=J|year=2001|title=Ecology of sprouting in woody plants: the persistence niche|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=16|pages=45–51|via=|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)02033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sprouting ability can have major impacts on the plant population, plant populations that typically would have exploited the tree fall gap get over run and can not compete against the shoots of the fallen tree. Species adaptation to disturbances is species specific but how each organism adapts effects all the species around them.

Another species well adapted to a particular disturbance is the [[Jack Pine]] in boreal forests exposed to crown fires. They, as well as some other pine species, have specialized [[serotinous]] cones that only open and disperse seeds with sufficient heat generated by fire. As a result, this species often dominates in areas where competition has been reduced by fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwilk | first1 = D. | last2 = Ackerly | first2 = D. | year = 2001 | title = Flammability and serotiny as strategies: correlated evolution in pines | url = | journal = Oikos | volume = 94 | issue = | pages = 326–336 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.940213.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species that are well adapted for exploiting disturbance sites are referred to as pioneers or early successional species. These [[shade-intolerant species]] are able to photosynthesize at high rates and as a result grow quickly. Their fast growth is usually balanced by short life spans. Furthermore, although these species often dominate immediately following a disturbance, they are unable to compete with shade-tolerant species later on and replaced by these species through succession. However these shifts may not reflect the progressive entry to the community of the taller long-lived forms, but instead, the gradual emergence and dominance of species that may have been present, but inconspicuous directly after the disturbance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While plants must deal directly with disturbances, many animals are not as immediately affected by them. Most can successfully evade fires, and many thrive afterwards on abundant new growth on the forest floor. New conditions support a wider variety of plants, often rich in nutrients compared to pre-disturbance vegetation. The plants in turn support a variety of wildlife, temporarily increasing biological diversity in the forest.&lt;ref name="pringle" /&gt;

== Importance ==

[[Biological diversity]] is dependent on natural disturbance. The success of a wide range of species from all taxonomic groups is closely tied to natural disturbance events such as fire, flooding, and windstorm. As an example, many shade-intolerant plant species rely on disturbances for successful establishment and to limit competition. Without this perpetual thinning, diversity of forest flora can decline, affecting animals dependent on those plants as well.

A good example of this role of disturbance is in [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') forests in the western United States, where surface fires frequently thin existing vegetation allowing for new growth. If fire is suppressed, [[douglas fir]] (''Pesudotsuga menziesii''), a shade tolerant species, eventually replaces the pines. Douglas firs, having dense crowns, severely limit the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor. Without sufficient light new growth is severely limited. As the diversity of surface plants decreases, animal species that rely on them diminish as well. Fire, in this case, is important not only to the species directly affected but also to many other organisms whose survival depends on those key plants.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, L. 1979. Natural Fire: Its Ecology in Forests. William Morrow and Company, New York. 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversity is low in harsh environments because of the intolerance of all but opportunistic and highly resistant species to such conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The interplay between disturbance and these biological processes seems to account for a major portion of the organization and spatial patterning of natural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=W|year=1984|title=The Role of Disturbance in Natural Communities|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.002033|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=15|pages=353–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disturbance variability and species diversity are heavily linked, and as a result require adaptations that help increase plant fitness necessary for survival.

The '''[[Eiffel Tower]]''' has appeared frequently in works of fiction because of its iconic nature. Movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] has noted in his online column that no matter where in Paris a film scene is set the Eiffel Tower will be visible in the background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com "40 Things That Only Happen in the Movies"] Ebert's comment was meant in jest, but scenes in movies such as ''The Longest Day'' with gratuitous use of the Tower in the background lend credence to the joke. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517110210/http://www.rogerebert.com |date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major plot element==
In some cases the tower is the key plot element or a significant plot element.
* '''1949''' In ''[[The Man on the Eiffel Tower]]'', the tower plays a central role, and the climax involves a climbing chase that predates the Mount Rushmore scene in ''[[North by Northwest]]''.
* '''1951''' In ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'', models of the tower are central to the plot, and the climax takes place on the real tower.
* '''1960''' In ''[[Zazie dans le Métro]]'' a chase scene takes place on the stairs and crossbars of the tower.
* '''1980''' John Denis' novel ''The Hostage Tower'' (based on an idea by [[Alistair Maclean]]) features an audacious scheme to capture the tower and use the threat of its destruction to extort millions from the French government. The story was adapted into a [[telemovie]] of the [[The Hostage Tower|same name]].
* '''1985''' The [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' contains a scene in the tower, including scenes in the ''Jules Verne'' restaurant there (filmed elsewhere), a fight on the stairway, and a [[BASE jump]] off the top of the tower as Bond (played for the last time by [[Roger Moore]]) chased a masked assassin who had just killed the French detective that Bond was meeting with (the killer was later revealed as [[May Day]], played by [[Grace Jones]]). The video for the [[A View to a Kill (song)|title song]] feature the members of [[Duran Duran]] as assassins and spies in or around the tower. [http://www.007.info/FactfileAVTAK.asp]
* '''1987''' An episode of ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' entitled "The Ghostbusters in Paris" had the tower become haunted, causing a French government official to go to New York and enlist the help of the Ghostbusters. They later realize that Eiffel developed the tower to trap ghosts, making the Eiffel Tower the world's largest "ghost containment unit". By story's end, the ghosts were transmitted to the Ghostbuster's Primary Containment Unit back in New York, essentially de-haunting the Tower.
* '''1991''' In ''[[Company Business]]'', the climatic showdown between the two protagonists and a group of murderous C.I.A. and KGB agents occurred in and out of the tower's elevators.
* '''1995''' In the third-season finale of ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', "[[Episodes of Highlander (season 3)#Finale Part 2|Finale part 2]]", [[Duncan MacLeod]] defeats the Immortal Kalas atop the tower.
* '''2003''' In ''[[Le Divorce]]'' the tower's elevators, stairways and various levels are seen extensively as one character pursues another near the end of the film. The tower is featured on the movie promo poster and is also mentioned in a purported tour guide for the tower audible in the soundtrack.
* '''2003''' The song is featured in Britney Spears song [[Toxic]]
* '''2007''' Featured in ''[[Rush Hour 3]]'' as the climax battle. Portions of the fight was actual footage of the famous landmark, whilst other sequences were replicated built sets.
* '''2007''' The plot of the mystery ''Murder on the Eiffel Tower: A Victor Legris Mystery'' by [[Claude Izner]] involves a murder on the tower, during the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exposition of 1889]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Izner | first = Claude | title = Murder on the Eiffel Tower: a Victor Legris Mystery | publisher = Gallic Books | location = City | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-906040-01-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2013''' The Eiffel Tower is featured and parodied in the Kickstarter-funded low-budget animated feature film, ''[[Dick Figures: The Movie]]'', based on and apart of the animated web series, ''[[Dick Figures]]''. The very top of the tower is where the second piece of the ancient sword the main characters set out to retrieve is.
* '''2013''' [[BioShock Infinite]] [[Elizabeth (BioShock)|Elizabeth]]'s, dream was to go to Paris. many shots of the tower were used in the game. And its sequel Burial at Sea Episode Two.
*'''2013''' In ''[[Paris (novel)|Paris]]'', the construction of the Eiffel Tower plays a significant role.
*'''2015''' In ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'', the protagonists travel to the tower to access an inter-dimensional travel capsule.

===Destruction of the tower===
In a notable subtype, the action of all or part of the work centers around the real or threatened destruction of the tower.
* '''1965''' In ''[[The Great Race]]'' [[Jack Lemmon]]'s character Professor Fate misfires a cannon, which causes the tower's collapse at the end of the film.
* '''1981''' In the original version of ''[[The Man Who Saw Tomorrow]]'', a prediction of [[World War III]] includes the tower collapsing when Paris is destroyed.
* '''1986''' In the ''[[Rambo and the Forces of Freedom]]'' episode, "Exercise in Terror" General Warhawk has Sergeant Havoc and Nomad threaten to blow up the Eiffel Tower.
* '''1992''' In the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' episode ""[[Tower of Power (TMNT 1987 episode)|Tower of Power]]", [[Krang]] has a giant [[electromagnet]], and wants to use it to pull the Technodrome from its [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]] [[asteroid]] location by using the Eiffel Tower as an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The Eiffel Tower begins to be pulled loose from its foundations and towards the dimensional portal. At the last minute, [[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]] destroys the generator and the Eiffel Tower falls down to the ground undamaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/tower-of-power-73558/|title=Tower of Power|publisher=TV.Com|language=|date=18 September 1993|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1992''' In the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' episode "[[Rust Never Sleeps (TMNT 1987 episode)|Rust Never Sleeps]]", [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] blast metals with [[Krang]]s "oxidizer rocket". The "oxidizer rocket" was originally planned by Krang to use to send the [[Technodrome]] to Earth, and when it failed, Krang thinks that it can be used by threatening to rust metal if the people don't surrender to Krang and Shredder. Even the Eiffel Tower gets blasted, and begins to collapse from rust. In the end, [[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]] reverses Krang's device to turn the metals back to normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/rust-never-sleeps-73559/|title=Rust Never Sleeps|publisher=TV.Com|language=|date=18 September 1993|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2008''' The History Channel's ''[[Life After People]]'' features the collapse of the tower around 200 years after the disappearance of humans, due to corrosion.
* '''2008''' In [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic's]] ''[[Aftermath: Population Zero]]'', the tower collapses in a similar matter to Life After People, but at a slightly slower rate of 230 years rather than 200. With corrosion from rainwater, ice and lightning strikes completely ravaging the upper half of the tower, and the iron is rusted through and teetering. A strong wind eventually collapses it, and falls into the new marsh on the River [[Seine]] that has flooded the remnants of Paris. After 1000 years, only its four legs remain standing while the collapsed portions have been covered in soil and vegetation.
* '''2008''' In ''[[Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon]]'', the tower (named the "Belleville Tower") is the site of a massive battle against [[oceanographer]] Henri Crosteau, who is in a giant squid-shaped robot and nearly destroys it in the process.

*'''2011''' In [[Metal Tornado]], The [[tornado]] destroys part of the tower and flies into it.

===Destruction of the city, or the world===
In another notable sub-type, the tower and its destruction is used as a symbol of the real or threatened destruction of the city, or the world.
* '''1953''' In ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'', most (if not all) of Paris is destroyed by the Martian attack. The tower can be seen in ruin at the end of the film depicting the death of the Martians.

* '''1996''' In ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', the tower is melted/destroyed by Martians.
* '''1996''' In ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert]]'', if the player fails to stop a series of nuclear missiles from reaching Europe during the Allied campaign, a cutscene will play, showing a missile landing in Paris with the Eiffel Tower in the foreground and detonating, creating an enormous mushroom cloud, and the Eiffel Tower can be seen melting before the heat of the blast.
* '''1997''' In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]", the tower was used in the segment "The HΩmega Man" by the French government as a nuclear launch site to detonate a missile on Springfield.

'''Filefjell''' is a mountainous area between [[Lærdal]] and [[Valdres]] in [[Norway]].

It is the historical, as well as modern, main route, linking [[West Norway|Vestlandet]] and [[Østlandet]].

==Etymology==
Filefjell or sometimes Fillefjell, might be a double-name as "file" is thought to be derived from [[Old Norse]] Fjáll, the same root that evolved into the modern word Fjell. Thus Filefjell in English would be "Mountain-Mountain".

==Geography==
Filefjell is at the eastern part of the [[Sogn og Fjordane]], borders to Valdres, Vang Kommune in the [[Oppland]]. In the north, it borders the western part of [[Jotunheimen]] mountain range. To the south, it meets with the [[Buskerud]] border.
The [[European route E16]] crosses the mountain and reaches its highest point at Varden (1013 meters).
The road follows a valley through the mountainous area, and because of this is somewhat protected from the fierce weather of the Norwegian winter. The road is rarely closed due to wind or snow, making it the most reliable of the mountain passes in Norway.

On both sides of the valley the terrain climbs steeply up to plateaus, with rolling hills and numerous lakes at about 1300 meters. The highest peak of the range is [[Sulefjellet]] at 1812 meters.

==Biology==
The biology of Filefjell is the same as to most Norwegian mountainous areas. In the main valley [[birch]] and species of [[salicaceae]] grows up to about 1200 meters. Higher up the landscape can be described as a [[tundra]] and [[moss]] and different forms of [[ericaceae]] dominates.

[[willow grouse|Grouse]], [[mountain hare|hare]], [[red fox|fox]] and the occasional [[wolverine]] and [[moose|elk]] are found. Filefjell also has numerous wild [[reindeer]]. In the 1990s one attempted to start [[reindeer herding]] in Filefjell, the project was later abandoned, but some of the reindeer herd, which was moved down from [[Trøndelag]], was left to mix with the native reindeer.
The lakes are populated by [[brown trout|trout]].

==History==
People have used Filefjell since the [[Stone Age]]. Reindeer hunters dug systems of pits to catch their pray and these can still be seen. Arrow heads from the same period have also been found.

Smedalen is the main valley. The name means ''The Smith Valley'' and evidence of [[Iron]] production in the [[Iron Age]]. [[Burial Mounds]] from the same period are also found here.

The [[Filefjell Kongevegen]] (The Kings Road) is the name of the old trail over Filefjell. Due to the sometimes wet and marshy land in the valley bottom, the old trail runs farther up in the hill than the modern asphalt-road does today, and is still used for [[hiking]]. It has its name after king [[Sverre I]] of Norway who traveled here with his army. The road got official status as main road in the year 1791.

Maristova (built on [[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margrete's]] command around 1390) and Nystuen in [[Vang, Oppland|Vang]] (first mentioned in 1627 but believed to be much older) guesthouses provide for travelers along the road. The hosts of the shelters were compensated by the king to aid travelers and provide shelters for those who used the road. This lasted until 1830.

In Smedalen there has been, and still is, [[dairy farming]] in the summer. [[Goat]]s, [[cow]]s and [[sheep]] are herded in the rich mountain pastures and [[brown cheese|goat cheese]] is still sold in some places.

In the middle of Smedalen, at Kyrkjestølen, [[St.Thomas Church, Filefjell|St. Thomas Church]] stands. It is believed to have been built on a [[Paganism|pagan]] [[temple]]. This site was the meeting place for people from [[Sogn]], [[Valdres]] and [[Hallingdal]], who met to perform midsummer [[blót]] and trade.
When Christianity came the [[Temple (Germanic paganism)|hov]] was transformed into a church but the traditions remained mostly unchanged. Little is known of this until the 17th century when the church was upgraded.

People started to believe that the church had healing power, and that sinners had a better chance of getting [[absolution]] here. People started to come here in great numbers for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on July 2. But the main attraction was the market, where [[herring]] and other sea products were traded for inland products like [[fur]]. Horse trading were also part of the market. Drinking, fighting, gambling, rape and murder were not uncommon in these markets. It is said that when the wives packed for their husbands going to the market, they also packed their funeral-shirts. In 1808 the priests were so angry with the ungodly activities that they demanded the church to be torn down and the market was banned. A modern church were built at the site in 1971.

==Tourism==
Filefjell is nowadays used mostly in recreational activities. [[Fishing]], [[hunting]], [[hiking]] and [[skiing]] are popular. Many cottages have been built the last 30 years. Several hotels are used by tourists who come to ski in the mountain or in the [[downhill skiing]] park.

A '''forest steppe''' is a temperate-climate [[ecotone]] and [[habitat]] type composed of [[grassland]] interspersed with areas of [[woodland]] or [[forest]].

==Locations==
Forest steppe primarily occurs in a [[forest steppe belt|belt of forest steppes]] across northern [[Eurasia]] from the eastern European [[Ural Mountains]] to eastern [[Siberia]] in [[northeast Asia]]. It forms transition ecoregions between the [[temperate grasslands]] and [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[biome]]s. 

In upper North America another example of the forest steppe ecotone is the [[aspen parkland]], in the central [[Prairie Provinces]], northeastern [[British Columbia]], and [[North Dakota]]. It is the transition ecoregion from the [[Great Plains]] [[prairie]] and [[steppe]] temperate grasslands to the [[Taiga]] biome forests in the north.

In central Asia the forest steppe ecotone is found in ecoregions in the mountains of the [[Iranian Plateau]], in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Balochistan]].

==Forest steppe ecoregions==
* [[East European forest steppe]] forms a transition between the [[Central European mixed forests|Central European]] and [[Sarmatic mixed forests]] to the north and the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] to the south. It extends from [[Romania]] in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east.
* The [[Kazakh forest steppe]] lies east of the Urals, between the [[West Siberian broadleaf and mixed forests]] and the [[Kazakh steppe]].
* [[Altai montane forest and forest steppe]]
* The [[Southern Siberian rainforest]] includes forest-steppe areas.

The '''French Institute of Urbanism''' (''Institut Français d'Urbanisme'', IFU) was a French scientific research institute that provided post-graduate training in the fields of [[urban planning]] and spatial planning. It was hosted by the [[University of Marne-la-Vallée]], and located on the campus Descartes, Champs-sur-Marne. Founded as the Department of Planning in the [[Paris 8 University|University Experimental Center of Vincennes]] in the middle of the year 1968-1969, it became an autonomous institute il 1976 as the ''Institut d'Urbanisme de l'Académie de Paris'' (IUAP), and took the name ''Institut Français d'Urbanisme'' in 1985.

In 2015 IFU linked with the Institut d'Urbanisme de Paris at [[Paris 12 Val de Marne University]] to form the Ecole d'urbanisme de Paris.&lt;ref&gt;http://94.citoyens.com/2015/upec-upem-lecole-durbanisme-de-paris-inauguree,19-03-2015.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Qatar 31 January 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Qatar in January, 2003]]

'''[[Qatar]]''' is a [[peninsula]] in the east of [[Arabia]], bordering the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], in a strategic location near major [[petroleum]] deposits. Qatar occupies {{convert|11,437|km2|abbr=on}} on a peninsula that extends approximately to {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}} north into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula.

Varying in width between {{convert|55|and|90|km|abbr=on}}, the land is mainly flat (the highest point is {{convert|103|m|abbr=on}}) and rocky. Notable features include coastal salt pans, elevated limestone formations (the Dukhan anticline) along the west coast under which lies the Dukhan oil field, and massive sand dunes surrounding [[Khawr al Udayd]], an inlet of the Persian Gulf in the southeast known to local English speakers as the Inland Sea.

==General topography==
The peninsula of Qatar is low-lying. Its shape the surface expression of the Qatar Arch, one of the largest structural characteristics of the [[Arabian Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qscience.com/doi/pdf/10.5339/qfarf.2012.EEP4|title=What's up with Qatar? How eustasy and neotectonics influenced the late Pleistocene and Holocene sea-level history of Qatar|publisher=ExxonMobil Research Qatar|authors=Jeremy Jameson, Christian Strohmenger|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is enveloped by loose sand and pebbles broken off the outcropping [[limestone]]. Smooth plains are found in the east, where the surface is covered by fine-grained dust. The south and south-west portion of the peninsula mainly comprises sand dunes and salt flats.&lt;ref name="nayeem1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdul Nayeem|first=Muhammad|title=Qatar Prehistory and Protohistory from the Most Ancient Times (Ca. 1,000,000 to End of B.C. Era)|publisher=Hyderabad Publishers|page=2|year=1998|isbn=9788185492049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coastline is emergent and gently slopes toward the sea. Many flat, low-lying offshore islands are located near the coast and are accompanied by [[coral reefs]]. As a result of salt water coming into contact with the low-lying land, many [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] have formed near the coast.&lt;ref name="nayeem1"/&gt;

==Climate==
The long summer (May through September) is characterized by intense heat and alternating dryness and humidity, with temperatures reaching {{convert|50|°C}}. Temperatures are moderate from November to April, ranging from as high as {{convert|39|°C}} in April to as low as {{convert|7|°C}} in January.&lt;ref&gt;Casey &amp; Vine (1991), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Rainfall is negligible, averaging {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year, confined to the winter months, and falling in brief, sometimes heavy storms that often flood the small ravines and the usually dry wadis.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt;

Sudden, violent dust storms occasionally descend on the peninsula, blotting out the sun, causing wind damage, and temporarily disrupting transport and other services.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt;

The scarcity of rainfall and the limited underground water, most of which has such a high mineral content that it is unsuitable for drinking or irrigation, restricted the population and the extent of agricultural and industrial development the country could support until desalination projects began. Although water continues to be provided from underground sources, most is obtained by desalination of seawater.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt;

===Vegetation zones===
Although most of the country consists of [[sand]] [[desert]]s, a small part of the country houses different [[vegetation]] zones, where trees, reeds and shrubs like [[tamarind]], [[phragmites]], and [[Mace (spice)|mace]] can grow. These regions are mostly to the east, near the coast.

==Area and land boundaries==
[[Image:Qatar Topography.png|thumb|210px|Topography of Qatar]]
Qatar has one land border. The country borders [[Saudi Arabia]] to the south. The boundary with Saudi Arabia was settled in 1965 but never demarcated. Qatar's northwest coast is fewer than {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} from the main islands of Bahrain, while the small Hawar Islands of Bahrain are only 1.4&amp;nbsp;km (0.8&amp;nbsp;mi) off that coast.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/69.htm|title=Geography|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=17 July 2015}} {{loc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peninsula's northernmost point is [[Ras Rakan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfo5TPb7SDsC&amp;pg=PA1038|publisher=Springer|year=2010|page=1038|isbn=978-1402086380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maritime claims===
''contiguous zone:''
{{convert|24|nmi|km mi|abbr=on|1|lk=in}}
&lt;br&gt;''exclusive economic zone:''
as determined by bilateral agreements, or the median line
&lt;br&gt;''territorial sea:''
{{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}

===Islands===
Of the islands belonging to Qatar, [[Halul Island|Halul]] is the most important. Lying about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Doha]], it serves as a storage area and loading terminal for oil from the surrounding offshore fields. [[Hawar Islands|Hawar and the adjacent islands]] immediately off the west coast are the subject of a territorial dispute between Qatar and [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt;

==Resources and land use==
Based on estimates in 2011 estimates, 5.6% of the land is agricultural. Arable land comprises 1.1%, permanent crops 0.2% and permanent pasture 4.6%. 94.4% of the land was used for other uses.&lt;ref name="factbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/qa.html|title=Geography|publisher=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=17 July 2015}} {{CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, {{convert|129.4|km2|abbr=on}} of land was irrigated.&lt;ref name="factbook"/&gt;

Most  of Qatar's surface lies on [[Cenozoic]] [[stratum|strata]]. These strata have an abundance of mineral resources, most of which have not yet been exploited, such as [[limestone]] and [[clay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Kubaisi|first=Mohammed Ali M.|title=Industrial development in Qatar: a geographical assessment|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7144/1/7144_4326.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|publisher=Durham E-Theses, Durham University|year=1984|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Upper Dammam Formation in the [[Eocene|Middle Eocene]] period is the most predominant surface layer.

==Political and human geography==
[[Image:Qatar sandstorm.JPG|thumb|right|240px|A massive sandstorm sweeping over the Persian Gulf state of Qatar as it races southward toward southeastern Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on February 15, 2004]]
The capital, Doha, is located on the central east coast on a sweeping (if shallow) harbor. Other ports include [[Umm Said]], [[Al Khor|Al Khawr]], and [[Al Wakrah]]. Only Doha and Umm Said are capable of handling commercial shipping, although a large port and a terminal for loading natural gas are planned at [[Ras Laffan Industrial City]], north of Al Khawr. Coral reefs and shallow coastal waters make navigation difficult in areas where channels have not been dredged.&lt;ref name="countrystudies"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14145">The '''geography of food''' is a field of [[human geography]]. It focuses on patterns of [[food production]] and [[food consumption|consumption]] on the local to global scale. Tracing these complex patterns helps geographers understand the unequal relationships between developed and [[developing countries]] in relation to the innovation, production, transportation, retail and consumption of food. It is also a topic that is becoming increasingly charged in the public eye. The movement to reconnect the 'space' and 'place' in the food system is growing, spearheaded by the research of geographers.

==History==
Spatial variations in food production and consumption practices have been noted for thousands of years. In fact, [[Plato]] commented on the [[environmental impact of agriculture|destructive nature of agriculture]] when he referred to the [[soil erosion]] from the mountainsides surrounding Athens, stating "[In previous years] Athens yielded far more abundant produce. In comparison of what then was, there are remaining only the bones of the wasted body; all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of the land being left". Societies beyond those of ancient Greece have struggled under the pressure to feed expanding populations. The people of [[Easter Island]], the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] of [[Central America]] and most recently the inhabitants of [[Montana]] have been experiencing similar difficulties in production due to several interconnecting factors related to [[land management|land]] and [[resource management]]. These events have been extensively studied by geographers and other interested parties (the study of food has not been confined to a single discipline, and has received attention from a huge range of diverse sources).

Modern [[geographers]] initially focused on food as an economic activity, especially in terms of agricultural geography. It was not until recently that geographers have turned their attention to food in a wider sense: "The emergence of an agro-food geography that seeks to examine issues along the [[food chain]] or within systems of [[food provision]] derives, in part, from the strengthening of [[political economy]] approaches in the 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, P. and Bowler, I. 2001 ''Food in Society: Economy, Culture, Geography'' {{ISBN|978-0-340-72004-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlapping areas of study==
Food has received attention from both the [[physical sciences]] and the [[social sciences]] because it is a bridge between the natural and social worlds. Some of the earliest numerical data about food production come from bureaucratic sources linked to the ancient civilizations of Ancient Egypt and the Roman Empire. Traders have also been influential in documenting food networks. Early Indian merchants and traders mapped the location of trading posts associated with food production nodes.

[[Thomas Malthus]] famously stated that food output could only expand arithmetically (in proportion with the extension of farmland) while population could increase geometrically, leading to a 'population bomb' or a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. His theory was also given a spatial element when he predicted the [[Irish potato famine]] — a situation in which there was enough food within Ireland to feed the entire population, but access to food was limited.

==Food production==
Food production was the first element of food to receive extensive attention from geographers in the field of [[cultural geography]], particularly in [[agricultural geography]].

Globally, the production of food is unequal. This is because there are two main components involved in sustenance production that are also distributed irregularly. These components are the [[environmental capacity]] of the area, and the human capacity. Environmental capacity is its ability ‘to accommodate a particular activity or rate of an activity without unacceptable impact’.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection 1986. Environmental Capacity. An approach to marine pollution prevention.  Rep.Stud.GESAMP, (30):49p.&lt;/ref&gt; The climate, soil types, and availability of water affect it. Human capacity, in relation to food production, is the size of the population and the amount of agricultural skill within that population. When these two are at ideal levels and partnered with financial capital, the creation of intense agricultural infrastructure is possible, as the [[Green Revolution]] clearly portrays.

Simultaneously, the ability of a country to produce food is being severely impacted by a plethora of other factors:

[[Pest (organism)|Pests]] are becoming resistant to [[pesticides]], or pesticides may be killing off the useful and necessary insects.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, J. Food Security and Sustainability – Can we avert a food crisis? University of Sheffield. 29 June 2009. Keynote Address.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this happening occur around the globe. Tanzania experienced a particularly horrible infection of [[african armyworm|armyworms]] in 2005. At the infections peak, there were over 1000 larva per square meter. In 2009, Liberia experienced a state of emergency when invading [[African armyworm]] caterpillars began what became a regional [[food crisis]]. The caterpillars traveled through 65 towns and 20 000 people were forced to leave their homes, markets, and farms.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, J. Food Security and Sustainabliity – Can we avert a food crisis? University of Sheffield. 29 June 2009. Keynote Address.&lt;/ref&gt; Losses like this can cost millions to billions, depending on size and duration, and have severe effects on food security. The [[FAO]] has created an international team, the Plant Production and Protection Division, which is attempting to ‘reduce reliance on pesticides’ and ‘demonstrate that pesticide use often can be reduced considerably without affecting yields or farmer profits'&lt;ref&gt;FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). 2013. Pest and Pesticide Management. http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/core-themes/theme/pests/en/&lt;/ref&gt; in these, and other hard-struck areas.
[[File:Haboob2.jpg|thumb|Aeolian wind erosion in Phoenix, Arizona, USA on 22 August 2003.]]
[[Water stress]], [[desertification]], and erosion are leading to loss of [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). 2005. Irrigation in Africa in Figures: AQUASAT Survey – 2005. FAO Water Report No. 29. Rome, FAO ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/aglw/docs/wr29_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural practices use the bulk of the Earth’s fresh water – up to 70 percent – and those numbers are predicted to rise by 50-100 percent by 2025’.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (World Health Organization)/UN-Water. 2010. UN-Water Global Annual Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water: Targeting Resources for Better Results. Geneva, WHO/UN-Water.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries are being forced to divert more water than ever before to irrigate their land. Hydroelectric dams and mega-canal projects are becoming the new standard for countries like [[Egypt]] that can no longer depend on rainfall or natural flood cycles. These water shortages are also causing a source of conflict between neighboring nations as they live with increasingly high levels of [[water scarcity]]. Policy responses to these events could be implemented in order to strengthen the socio-economic growth, human health statuses, and environmental sustainability of these areas. Combining current limitations with water and transitions from practices such as agroforestry and shifting cultivation makes land susceptible to [[aeolian erosion]] by weakening soil composition and exposing larger areas of land to destructive wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley|first=William|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=9781405189316|location=United Kingdom|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeolian erosion largely effects deserted areas, reducing air quality, polluting water sources, and limiting fertility of nearby land.

[[Climate change]] is creating more extreme weather patterns, and agricultural practices are estimated to cause from 10 to 12 percent of greenhouses gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;The Strategy Unit. Food Matters: Towards a Strategy for the 21st Century. July 2008. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Warming will increase the previously mentioned rates of desertification and insect activity and agricultural zones near the equator may be lost. However, due to the uneven warming that will probably occur, higher latitudes are expected to warm up at faster rates than other areas of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, 1897, "A group of hypothesis bearing on climatic change" J. Geology 5:563–568.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are now presenting the idea that areas in Canada and Siberia may become suitable for farming at the industrial scale, and that those areas will be able to account for any farmland that is lost at the equator. Conservative estimates place the shift of traditional crops (maize, grain, potatoes) northward at 50 to 70 kilometers a decade. It is also believed that non-traditional crops (berries, sunflowers, melons) could be established on the southern sides of these countries.&lt;ref&gt;Tchebakova, N. (2012). Insight: Siberian agriculture could benefit from climate change. Krasnoyarsk: Sukachev Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in climate may force humans to adapt, adopt new practices, and alter old habits to promote success in the uncertain age of climate change ahead.

==Food consumption==
Criticisms of the [[food industry|industrialized food system]] regarding its inability to provide nutritious, ecologically sound, equitable food for the world's population has increased in recent history. Systems that are currently in place focus on providing relatively [[cheap food]] to millions, but often cost the Earth in terms of [[water pollution|water]] and [[soil degradation]], local [[food insecurity]], [[animal welfare]], rising [[obesity]] and health-related problems, and declining rural communities. Variations in diet and consumption practices on global and regional scales became the focus of geographers and economists with the vastly expanding population and widely publicized famines of the 1960s, and the food riots of 2007-2008 in 60 different countries. Due in part to these events, differences in the caloric intake of food and the composition of an average diet have been estimated and mapped for many countries since the 1960s.

Canada, USA, and Europe consume the highest amount of calories with an average [[per capita consumption]] of around 3400 calories daily.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, B., Heasman, M., &amp; Wright, J. Consumption in the Age of Affluence: The World of Food. Canada: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The recommended daily caloric intake for men and women living in these areas is 2500 and 2000 respectively. Studies focused on consumption patterns in these areas lay the blame for increased caloric intake on soft drink and fast food consumption, and decreased physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;St-Onge, M.P., Keller, K. L. &amp; Heymsfield, S. B. 2003. “Changes in childhood food consumption patterns: a cause for concern in light of increasing body weights” American Society for Clinical Nutrition. 78(6): 1068-1073.&lt;/ref&gt; Many developing countries are beginning to follow the leaders in rising caloric intake as they develop further due to increased availability of these high-impact items. Ballooning weight and associated health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart problems, and diabetes are being recorded in skyrocketing numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, B., Heasman, M., &amp; Wright, J. Consumption in the Age of Affluence: The World of Food. Canada: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, consumption is still extremely uneven, with areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa still having some of the lowest rates of caloric intake per capita, often falling below the recommended levels. Much of this is due to lack of access of particular foods, which is a leading factor as to why much of the undernourished population is located in this region. In the world today, there are over 800 million people that are undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/resources/infographics/infographics-details/en/c/238873/|title=Understanding hunger and malnutrition|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] holds the lowest average, at 1800 calories daily; however, averages do not represent the range of inequality between the best and worst fed people within a region.&lt;ref&gt;Coons, K. A. &amp; Rogers, B. L. 2001. “Relationships Between Use of Television During Meals and Children’s Food Consumption Patterns.” Pediatrics. 107(1): 7-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, steps are being made to reduce caloric inequality. In parts of South Africa, the government has implemented a widespread electrification system featuring a free electricity allowance due to a study was conducted from 1991 to 2002 that found a positive increase in consumption habits within villages if given access to electricity. Access to electricity allowed for less time to be spent on menial tasks such as gathering firewood, and more time working on higher-level tasks that could increase income. In fact, villages often exceeded their electrical allowances.&lt;ref&gt;Madubanski, M. &amp; Shackleton, C. M. 2006. “Changing energy profiles and consumption patterns following electrification in five rural villages, South Africa.” Energy Policy. 34(18): 4081-4092.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS&lt;ref&gt;The abbreviation "HMS" would not have been applied to ''Roebuck'' at the time, as this was not formally adopted until 1789. It is used here only to indicate ship's official status.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Roebuck''''' was a fifth-rate warship in the [[Royal Navy]] which, under the command of [[William Dampier]], carried the first English scientific expedition to Australia in 1699. The wreck of the ship has since been located by a team from the [[Western Australian Maritime Museum]] at a site on the coast of [[Ascension Island]] where it foundered more than 300 years ago.

==Construction and early service==
''Roebuck'' was built by Snellgrove at [[Wapping]], [[East End of London|East London]], and launched on 17 April 1690 during the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] as one of 12 purpose-built [[fireships]]. It carried 8 guns, was 292 tons ([[builder's measure]]), {{convert|96|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|25.5|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide. In June 1690 ''Roebuck'' was present at the [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)|Battle of Beachy Head]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy |first=Michael |title=Report No.&amp;nbsp;159: His Majesty’s Ship Roebuck (1690-1701) |url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/No.%20159%20HMS%20Roebuck.pdf |year=2002 |publisher=Western Australian Maritime Museum |location=Fremantle, W.A. |pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1695 the ship was upgraded and listed as a 26-gun [[fifth-rate]]. Though plans and models of similar ships survive, being a relatively lowly vessel at its time of construction, no contemporary plans of ''Roebuck'' itself have been found. This lack of detail has resulted in considerable disagreement until recently about the vessel's appearance.&lt;ref name="sexton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sexton |first=Robert |year=2011 |title=Dampier’s Roebuck |journal=Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=28–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, only notional images have appeared in artwork and on postage stamps.

==Voyage of discovery==
[[File:Dampier-portrait.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Oil on canvas portrait of Dampier holding a copy of his book|William Dampier, ''Roebuck''{{'}}s captain, tasked with surveying the coast of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]]]
After a period of relative obscurity, ''Roebuck'' was placed under the command of [[William Dampier]] in July 1698. This anomalous appointment of a former [[buccaneer]] to the command of one of King [[William III of England|William]]'s ships is explained by Dampier’s growing reputation as he travelled widely and exhibited the famous tattooed Prince Jeoly and his mother. Purchased during his first [[circumnavigation]], they had been described in a broadsheet from 1691–1692 as a "just wonder of the age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Masefield |editor-first=John |title=Dampier’s Voyages: Consisting of a New Voyage Round the World, a Supplement to the Voyage Round the World, Two Voyages to Campeachy, a Discourse of Winds, a Voyage to New Holland, and a Vindication in Answer to the Chimerical Relation of William Funnell |volume=1 |year=1906 |publisher=E. Grant Richards |location=London |page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity translated into greater recognition among academics, seafarers, politicians and royalty following publication of his remarkable travelogue, ''A New Voyage Round the World'', in 1697.

His acquaintance with influential men such as the recently retired naval administrator [[Samuel Pepys]] is evident from the following entry of the diarist [[John Evelyn]] on 16 August 1698: "I dined with Mr Pepys, where was Captain Dampier, who had been a famous buccaneer, had brought hither the painted prince Job [Jeoly], and printed a relation of his very strange adventure. ... He was now going abroad again by the king’s encouragement, who furnished a ship of 290 tons. He seemed a more modest man than one would imagine by relation of the crew he had associated with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George |first=Alexander S. |year=1999 |title=William Dampier in New Holland: Australia's First Natural Historian |location=Hawthorn, Vic. |publisher=Bloomings Books |pages=135–136 |isbn=978-187-64-7312-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Roebuck'', the naval ship referred to here, was a replacement for ''Jolly Prize'' which Dampier found totally unsuited for his plans to search for [[Terra Australis]] and to examine the then uncharted eastern coast of [[New Holland (Australia)]] via [[Cape Horn]], a notoriously difficult and dangerous route.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outbound to Terra Australis===

Having made ''Roebuck'' ready too late in the season to take his preferred route via Cape Horn, Dampier sailed from England on 14 January 1699 for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Trouble, centring on acrimony between Dampier and his [[First lieutenant#Royal Navy|first lieutenant]], George Fisher, divided the ship. They were apparently "behaving equally as boors without a spark of dignity or self-respect ... alternately drinking together, back-biting one another to their confidants, and breaking into personal abuse and even fisticuffs in presence of the crew".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Williamson |editor-first=James A. |title=William Dampier: A Voyage to New Holland |year=1939 |publisher=The Argonaut Press |location=London |page=xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of indiscipline ensued, and en route Fisher was caned by Dampier, clapped in irons and confined to his quarters. The crew was divided on the matter and, concerned at the possibility of mutiny, Dampier had Fisher sent ashore at [[Bahia]] in Brazil, where he was imprisoned for a time before making his way home.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Cape of Good Hope, Dampier found the variation in [[compass]] readings there anomalous, stating in his journal "These things, I confess, did puzzle me—indeed were most shocking to me." Admiral [[William Henry Smyth]], subsequently made the comment that, "though the local magnetic attraction in ships had fallen under the notice of seamen, he [Dampier] was among the first to lead the way to its investigation, since the facts that 'stumbled' him at the Cape of Good Hope, respecting the variations of the compass, excited the mind of [[Matthew Flinders|[Matthew] Flinders]], his ardent admirer, to study the anomaly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson |first=Clennell |title=William Dampier |year=1929 |publisher=The Bodley Head |location=London |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing on after leaving the Cape of Good Hope, Dampier first made landfall in August 1699 on the Australian continent at the place he subsequently named [[Shark Bay]] in [[Western Australia]]. There and at places further north such as [[Lagrange Bay]], just south of what is now known as [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] in [[Roebuck Bay]], he described and collected many specimens, including shells, subsequently earning the title "Australia's first natural historian".&lt;ref&gt;George (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; After calling in to [[Timor]] in November, Dampier sailed to the north-west cape of [[New Guinea]] in the vicinity of present-day Selat Dampier, [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. There he sent his men ashore at a "small woody island" he called Cockle Island. His men brought back many giant clam shells. They then sailed around the northern part of New Guinea, naming [[New Britain|Nova Britannia]]. The passage between those two islands, [[Dampier Strait (Papua New Guinea)|Dampier Strait]], was subsequently named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Callander |first=John |title=Terra Australis Cognita or Voyages to the Terra Australis |volume=3 |year=1768 |publisher=The Bodley Head |location=London |pages=113–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return voyage and shipwreck===
[[File:Ascension Island1.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Image of Ascension Island seen from a distance, partly hidden in clouds|[[Ascension Island]], as Dampier would have seen it, approaching from the south in ''Roebuck'']]
Concerned at the condition of his vessel, which was being eaten away by [[shipworm]]s, Dampier abandoned his plan to proceed further south to explore the eastern Australian coast in March 1700, leaving its exploration to Lieutenant [[James Cook]] over half a century later. After sailing back into the Indian Ocean, Dampier headed off south in search of the elusive [[Tryal Rocks]], scene of the loss of the English [[East India Company]] ship ''[[Tryall]]'' in 1622, the first known European ship to be lost on the Australian coast. Leaking badly and unable to continue in the search, ''Roebuck'' headed to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], the headquarters of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the centre of a vast trading network with China, Japan, India and Europe. After effecting some repairs, they left Batavia, arriving back at the Cape of Good Hope by the end of December.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-January 1701 they left, and after staying at [[St Helena]] until 13 February, they proceeded to [[Ascension Island]], which they sighted on 21 February. While there, the ship sprang a very serious leak in the fourth row of planking from the [[keel]], which proved impossible to stem. When a [[sea breeze]] began to blow, they ran in toward the shore but were forced to anchor in 7 fathoms or {{convert|42|ft|0|abbr=on}} when the breeze died. After carrying a small anchor ashore on the night of 23 February, the crew [[warping (sailing)|warped]] the vessel in until it grounded in 3.5 fathoms or {{convert|21|ft|0|abbr=on}} of water. The crew then left the ship after saving some items, including Dampier’s journals and various specimens. After finding a spring of fresh water inland, they remained alive, though suffering many privations.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April four East India Company ships entered the bay in which ''Roebuck'' was lost and took them on board. One of the vessels, ''Hastings'', elected to recover an anchor and cable, apparently the one used to warp ''Roebuck'' ashore. This proved successful, but a [[Anchor#Grapnel anchor|grappling anchor]] was lost. The ships then transported Dampier and his crew home, where he published an account of the voyage in 1703 entitled ''A Voyage to New Holland''—again to great acclaim. Though this further cemented his reputation as an explorer, at the court martial into the loss of his ship Dampier was roundly criticised for his treatment of Fisher, destroying any further attempt at official patronage. He later gave the plant collections he saved from the wreck to the [[Royal Society]], and they eventually found their way to the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search for the wreck==
Though made famous by its association with Dampier, the position of the wreck became lost over time, in part because early documents provided conflicting evidence as to its whereabouts. Dampier himself added to the confusion when he wrote to the [[Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke|Earl of Pembroke]], [[Lord President of the Council]], indicating that his ship may have drifted back out to sea: "The world is apt to judge of every thing by the success; and whoever has ill fortune will hardly be allowed a good name. This, my Lord, was my unhappiness in my late expedition in ''Roebuck'', which foundered through perfect age near the island of Ascension".&lt;ref&gt;Williamson (1939), p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; Many expeditions went in search of the wreck after the advent of [[SCUBA diving]], but all proved unsuccessful.

===Wreck site located===
[[File:Ascension Island Black igneous rocks.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Image of black igneous rocks on the coast of Ascension Island|[[Clarence Bay]], Ascension Island, where the wreck of ''Roebuck'' was discovered in 2001]]
In 2000 the [[Western Australian Maritime Museum]] in [[Fremantle]] commissioned a search of the primary sources in England. The many sources located and copied for the museum suggested that the wreck of ''Roebuck'' lay in the shallows of [[Clarence Bay]] on the north-west coast of Ascension Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarthy |first1=Michael |last2=Godard |first2=Philippe |lastauthoramp = y |title=Report No. 155: HM Ship Roebuck—Clues to Its Location and Subsequent Identification |url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/No.%20155%20HMS%20Roebuck.pdf |year=2001 |publisher=Western Australian Maritime Museum |location=Fremantle, W.A. |pages=2–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others had already searched in that location but had been stymied by the size of the bay and an extensive cover of sand.

By March 2001, based on their extensive study, the museum team believed they had a fair idea of ''Roebuck''{{'}}s position in February 1701 when the ship sank.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at the island, and anchoring over the approximate position in the bay where they believed the grounding site to be, they experienced the same unusually sustained sea breeze that Dampier had described some 300 years earlier. When they examined the seabed, they discovered that a large and very recent movement of sand from the bay had exposed rock and other formations not seen by local divers in the 40 years since diving first began on the island.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), pp. 34–35, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conducting a search from the beach out to the 3.5 fathoms of water described by Dampier, divers soon located an exposed bell. They then located a large clam shell in a cleft in the reef on the seabed south of the bell, and a heavily concreted grapnel anchor in shallower water about {{convert|328|ft|0|abbr=on}} south of the bell and {{convert|26|ft|0|abbr=on}} from shore. In a very turbulent location, two slightly tapering iron objects very similar to the remains of heavily eroded cannon were seen. These lay in the wave line, and were firmly wedged amongst the rocks. All were left ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), pp. 38, 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Being loose and potentially endangered objects, the island's administrator subsequently requested that the museum team remove the clam and the bell in association with the Ascension Island and [[Royal Air Force]] dive clubs. On retrieval, the bell was found to carry a [[broad arrow]], confirming its [[Royal Navy]] origin. Of all the naval vessels lost on the Island, only ''Roebuck'' had not been found up to that time. Sent to the Mary Rose Laboratories in [[Portsmouth]] for treatment and replication, the original objects were returned to the island for exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), pp. 46, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The replicas were made for display at the Western Australian Maritime Museum.

===Finds analyzed===
[[File:Tridacna.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Image of man holding a dead giant clam shell in his arms|Giant clam shell of the same genus native to the [[Indo-Pacific]] found by divers at the ''Roebuck'' wreck site]]
Soon after the bell and clam were found, a long-time island resident and diver showed the Australian museum team an ornate blue-and-white ceramic lid and an intact brown earthenware pot that he had found several weeks earlier projecting from the seabed.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; These have since proved consistent with ''Roebuck''{{’s}} time and travels, with the jar probably produced at [[kiln]]s in [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], China. The blue-and-white jar lid and the shards are products of the [[Jingdezhen]] kilns, [[Jiangxi|Jiangxi Province]], China, with [[Jakarta Old Town|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]) being the most likely trade source. The clam was of the genus ''[[Tridacna]]'' and possibly the species ''[[Tridacna squamosa]]'' from the [[tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] waters of the [[Indo-Pacific]] as far south as Shark Bay. A few weeks after the team left, Clarence Bay began to return to its normal configuration, and within a few months the site was again totally covered by sand.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2002), pp. 56–58, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

A maritime historian assisted the museum in producing a detailed analysis of ''Roebuck'', including line drawings and descriptions. Crucial to this process was the location of the long-lost contract for the building of the ship at [[the National Archives (United Kingdom)]].&lt;ref name="sexton"/&gt; Based on that study, an experienced model-maker constructed a 1:24 scale model, which was donated to the museum and put on display in Fremantle with a backdrop of the vessel’s [[sail-plan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/maritime-archaeology/treasures-from-the-deep/dampier/wreck-searches "Model of Dampier's Roebuck Now on Exhibition"], Western Australian Maritime Museum (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abroad===
In addition to the domestic bases, the BBC has numerous bases overseas to monitor the global news organisations and to gather news stories. The BBC itself does not publish the exact location of each of their news bureau in case of attack or harassment of staff because of their employment by the broadcaster, which aims to be politically neutral.

====International (Region 2)====
In the United Kingdom, Disney released one Region 2 volume in 2007, titled ''Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers First Collection''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chip-Dale-Rescue-Rangers-Collection/dp/B000M2E7GE|title=Chip N Dale - Rescue Rangers - First Collection - 3 Disc Set DVD: Amazon.co.uk: Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers: Film &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the set being similar to the US version, the DVD contained only 20 episodes, while having 6 language tracks: English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish and Italian. Several other similar releases were then made to other countries, but only going up to episode #20. On December 5, 2012, a second DVD set of the series was released in the UK, but as a Region 2 version of Volume 2, titled ''Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers Season 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chip-Dale-Rescue-Rangers-Season/dp/B009KYYARQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352747954&amp;sr=8-2 |title=Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers Season 2 [DVD] |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the first DVD, this 3-disc set includes a Fastplay mode and only two language tracks: English and German, but subtitles have not been added. As of yet, there are no plans to release the rest of the series, or the seven episodes missing between the first two sets.

==Maritimes regional senators==
Senators listed were appointed to represent the Maritimes under section 26 of the Constitution Act. This clause has only been used once before to appoint two extra senators to represent four regional Senate divisions: Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes and the Western Provinces.

As vacancies open up among the normal members of the Senate, they are automatically filled by the regional senators. Regional senators may also designate themselves to a senate division in any province of their choosing in their region.

This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in the Pitcairn Islands'''. The avifauna of the [[Pitcairn Islands]] include a total of 43 species, of which five are [[Endemism in birds|endemic]].

This list's [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of ''[[The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World]]'', 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.

==Albatrosses==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Diomedeidae]]

The albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus ''Diomedea'' have the largest wingspans of any extant birds.

*[[Wandering albatross]], ''Diomedea exulans''
*[[Black-browed albatross]], ''Thalassarche melanophris''
*[[Buller's albatross]], ''Thalassarche bulleri''

==Shearwaters and petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Procellariidae]]

The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized "true petrels", characterised by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary.

*[[Antarctic giant petrel]], ''Macronectes giganteus''
*[[Cape petrel]], ''Daption capense''
*[[Great-winged petrel]], ''Pterodroma macroptera''
*[[White-headed petrel]], ''Pterodroma lessonii''
*[[Phoenix petrel]], ''Pterodroma alba''
*[[Murphy's petrel]], ''Pterodroma ultima''
*[[Kermadec petrel]], ''Pterodroma neglecta''
*[[Herald petrel]], ''Pterodroma heraldica''
*[[Henderson petrel]], ''Pterodroma atrata''
*[[White-chinned petrel]], ''Procellaria aequinoctialis''
*[[Wedge-tailed shearwater]], ''Ardenna pacificus''
*[[Christmas shearwater]], ''Puffinus nativitatis''

==Austral storm petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Oceanitidae]]

The [[austral storm petrel]]s are relatives of the [[petrel]]s and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on [[plankton]]ic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes [[bat]]-like.

*[[White-faced storm petrel]], ''Pelagodroma marina''

==Tropicbirds==
'''Order''': [[Phaethontiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phaethontidae]]

[[Tropicbird]]s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.

*[[Red-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon rubricauda''
*[[White-tailed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon lepturus''

==Boobies and gannets==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Sulidae]]

The sulids comprise the [[gannet]]s and [[Booby|boobies]]. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.

*[[Masked booby]], ''Sula dactylatra''
*[[Red-footed booby]], ''Sula sula''
*[[Brown booby]], ''Sula leucogaster''

==Frigatebirds==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Fregatidae]]

[[Frigatebird]]s are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have coloured inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week.

*[[Great frigatebird]], ''Fregata minor''
*[[Lesser frigatebird]], ''Fregata ariel''

==Bitterns, herons and egrets==
'''Order''': [[Pelecaniformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Ardeidae]]

The family Ardeidae contains the [[bittern]]s, [[heron]]s and [[egret]]s. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills.

*[[Pacific reef heron]], ''Egretta sacra''

==Rails, crakes, gallinules and coots==
'''Order''': [[Gruiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Rallidae]]

Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the [[Rail (bird)|rails]], [[crake]]s, [[coot]]s and [[gallinule]]s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.

*[[Spotless crake]], ''Porzana tabuensis''
*[[Henderson crake]], ''Porzana atra'' (E)

==Plovers and lapwings==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Charadriidae]]

The family Charadriidae includes the [[plover]]s, [[dotterel]]s and [[lapwing]]s. They are small to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short, thick necks and long, usually pointed, wings. They are found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water.

*[[Pacific golden plover]], ''Pluvialis fulva''

==Sandpipers and allies==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Scolopacidae]]

Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the [[sandpiper]]s, [[curlew]]s, [[godwit]]s, [[Tringa|shanks]], [[tattler (bird)|tattler]]s, [[woodcock]]s, [[snipe]]s, [[dowitcher]]s and [[phalarope]]s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

*[[Bristle-thighed curlew]], ''Numenius tahitiensis''
*[[Wandering tattler]], ''Tringa incana''
*[[Sanderling]], ''Calidris alba''

==Gulls, terns, and skimmers==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Laridae]]

Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s, and [[skimmer]]s. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years.
*[[Laughing gull]], ''Leucophaeus atricilla''
*[[Spectacled tern]], ''Onychoprion lunatus''
*[[Sooty tern]], ''Onychoprion fuscatus''
*[[Black noddy]], ''Anous minutus''
*[[Brown noddy]], ''Anous stolidus''
*[[Blue noddy]], ''Anous cerulea''
*[[Grey noddy]], ''Anous albivitta''
*[[White tern]], ''Gygis alba''

==Pigeons and doves==
'''Order''': [[Columbiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Columbidae]]

[[Pigeon]]s and [[dove]]s are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy [[cere]].

*[[Henderson fruit dove]], ''Ptilinopus insularis'' (E)

==Parrots and allies==
'''Order''': [[Psittaciformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Psittaculidae]]

*[[Stephen's lorikeet]], ''Vini stepheni'' (E)

==Cuckoos and anis==
'''Order''': [[Cuculiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Cuculidae]]

The family Cuculidae includes [[cuckoo]]s, [[Geococcyx|roadrunner]]s and [[Ani (bird)|anis]]. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are [[brood parasite]]s.

*[[Long-tailed koel]], ''Eudynamys taitensis''

==Acrocephalid warblers==
'''Order''': [[Passeriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Acrocephalidae]]

The family Sylviidae is a group of small insectivorous passerine birds. They mainly occur as breeding species, as the common name implies, in Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, Africa. Most are of generally undistinguished appearance, but many have distinctive songs.

'''Postal codes''' were introduced and standardized in Spain in 1985, when [[Correos]] (the national postal service of Spain) introduced automated mail sorting. The first two digits (ranging 01–52) of the [[postal code]] correspond to one of the fifty [[provinces of Spain]] (as listed in general alphabetical order, with some exceptions), plus the two autonomous cities on the African coast.

==Former postal districts==
Large cities such as [[Madrid]] and [[Barcelona]], were divided into postal districts (''zonas'' in Spanish) similar to the [[arrondissement]] system in Paris.

*Plaza de España, 18
:Madrid 8&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2YyZ6kqwKSEC&amp;q=%22Madrid+8%22+%22avenida%22&amp;dq=%22Madrid+8%22+%22avenida%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNjNbDv4fLAhULlxoKHfuuAr4Q6AEITTAI ''Thomas Cook Overseas Timetable''], Thomas Cook Limited, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''location-based game''' (or '''location-enabled game''') is a type of [[pervasive game]] in which the [[gameplay]] evolves and progresses via a player's location. Thus, location-based games must provide some mechanism to allow the player to report their location, frequently this is through some kind of localization technology, for example by using [[satellite navigation system|satellite positioning]] through [[GPS]]. "Urban gaming" or "street games" are typically multi-player location-based games played out on city streets and built up urban environments. Various mobile devices can be used to play location-based games; these games have been referred to as "location-based mobile games",&lt;ref name="spacetimeplay"&gt;{{Citation

Some games have used embedded mobile technologies such as [[near field communication]], [[Bluetooth]], and [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]]. Poor technology performance in urban areas has led some location-based games to incorporate disconnectivity as a gameplay asset &lt;ref&gt;Nilsson et al., [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charith_Perera2/publication/303333036_Applying_Seamful_Design_in_Location-based_Mobile_Museum_Applications/links/5a42776d0f7e9ba868a47843/Applying-Seamful-Design-in-Location-based-Mobile-Museum-Applications.pdf "Applying Seamful Design in Location-based Mobile Museum Applications
"], ''ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM)''&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Organizations==
In 2006, [[Penn State]] students founded the [[Urban Gaming Club]]. The goal of the club is to provide location-based games and [[Alternate Reality Games]]. Some of the games played by Penn State's UGC are [[Humans vs. Zombies]], [[Manhunt (urban game)|Manhunt]], [[Freerunning]] and [[Capture the Flag]].  Students at other American universities have formed similar organizations, such as the Zombie Outbreak Management Facilitation Group at [[Cornell College]].

==Learning ==
Location-based games may induce learning. De Souza, (2006)&lt;ref name=DeSouza&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Souza|first=E Silva|author2=G. C Delacruz |title=Hybrid Reality Games Reframed Potential Uses in Educational Contexts|journal=[[Games and Culture]]|date=July 2006|volume=1|issue=3|pages=231–251|doi=10.1177/1555412006290443}}&lt;/ref&gt; has observed that these activities produce learning that is social, experiential and situated. Learning however is related to the objectives of the game designers. In a survey of location-based games (Avouris &amp; Yiannoutsou, 2012)&lt;ref name=Avouris&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avouris|first=N|author2=Yiannoutsou N. |title=A review of mobile location-based games for learning across physical and virtual spaces|journal=Journal of Universal Computer Science|year=2012|volume=18|url=http://hci.ece.upatras.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=431%3Aa-review-of-mobile-location-based-games-for-learning-across-physical-and-virtual-spaces&amp;catid=116%3A2012&amp;Itemid=115&amp;lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it was observed that in terms of the main objective, these games may be categorized as ludic,(e.g. games that are created for fun), pedagogic, (e.g. games created mainly for learning), and hybrid,(e.g. games with mixed objectives).
The ludic group, are to a large extent action oriented, involving either shooting, action or treasure hunt type of activities. These are weakly related to a narrative and a virtual world. However, the role-playing version of these games seem to have a higher learning potential, although this has yet to be confirmed through more extended empirical studies. On the other hand, the social interaction that takes place and skills related to strategic decisions, observation, planning, physical activity are the main characteristics of this strand in terms of learning. The pedagogic group of games involve participatory simulators, situated language learning and educational action games. Finally the hybrid games are mostly museum location-based games and mobile fiction, or city fiction.

==Legalities==
The nature of location-based gaming may mean that certain real-world locations will be visited by higher-than-normal numbers of people who are playing the game, which generally has been received favorably by nearby attractions or local businesses. However, these games may generate activity at locations that are privately-owned or have access limits, or otherwise cause undesirable congestion. ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' notably has several publicized events of players being drawn to inappropriate locations for the game, requiring the developer to manually remove these areas from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Velloso |first1 = Eduardo |last2 = Carter |first2 = Marcus |title = Some places should be off limits for games such as Pokémon GO |url = https://theconversation.com/some-places-should-be-off-limits-for-games-such-as-pokemon-go-62341 |website = The Conversation |accessdate = July 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Holocaust Museum, Auschwitz want Pokémon Go hunts out |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/07/12/holocaust-museum-auschwitz-want-pokmon-go-hunts-stop-pokmon/86991810/ |accessdate = July 13, 2016 |work = USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-holocaust-museum-pleads-stop-playing-pokemon-go-here |title = Holocaust museum pleads: stop playing Pokémon Go here |first = Tom |last = Phillips |work = [[Eurogamer]] |date = July 12, 2016 |accessdate = July 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the first legal challenges for location-based gaming, a Federal District court ruled that a Wisconsin county ordinance to require game developers of such location-based games to get appropriate permits to allow locations in the county's public park systems was likely unconstitutional. While the county had felt there was no [[First Amendment]] rights involved due to how locations were generated in-game, the Federal judge disagreed.&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/07/judge-blocks-law-regulating-where-augmented-reality-games-can-be-played/ | title = Augmented reality wins big in 1st Amendment legal flap | first = David | last=  Kravets | date = July 20, 2017 | accessdate = July 20, 2017 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Count (nobility)|Count]] '''Luigi Ferdinando Marsili''' (or '''Marsigli''', [[Latin|Lat.]] ''Marsilius''; 10 July 1658 – 1 November 1730) was an Italian scholar and eminent natural scientist, who also served as an emissary and soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Luigi Ferdinando, Count de Marsigli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Mining Map of Northern Transylvania in Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus 1726 by Marsigli.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mining map of northern [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Transylvania]] (today [[Romania]]) published in ''[[:commons:Category:Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus|Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus]]'', vol. 2 (1726)]]
Born in [[Bologna]], he was a member of an ancient patrician family and was educated in accordance with his noble social rank. He supplemented his reading by studying [[mathematics]], [[anatomy]], and [[natural history]] helped by the best Bolognese tutors and enhanced by his personal observations. After a course of scientific studies in his native city he travelled throughout [[Asia Minor]] collecting data on the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s military organisation, as well as on its natural history.

On his return he entered the service of the [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]] (1682) and fought with distinction against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], by whom he was wounded and captured in an action on the River [[Rába]]; sold to a [[pasha]] who met him after the [[Battle of Vienna]], his release was secured in 1684. He returned to the Imperial Army deploying his skills as a talented military engineer. Marsigli contributed to the successful [[Battle of Buda (1686)|siege of Buda]] in 1686 and in the following years in the military operations of the liberation war against the Turks.

After the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] he was commissioned to lead the Habsburg border demarcation commission. Marsigli mapped the 850&amp;nbsp;km-long [[Habsburg]]-Ottoman border in the former [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (today including [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]]). During the twenty years he spent in Hungary he collected scientific information, specimens, antiques, took measurements and observations for his work on the Danube. He was assisted by [[:de:Johann Christoph Müller|Dr Johann Christoph Müller]] who prepared manuscripts for printing and commissioned the engravers in his home town of Nuremberg. The sample of the work, ''[[Prodromus]]'', was published in 1700 and the large work was expected by 1704. His scholarship was well received in England, and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in November 1691.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/ |title=Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660–2007 |publisher=[[The Royal Society]] |accessdate=14 July 2010 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324095152/http://royalsociety.org/Lists-of-Royal-Society-Fellows-1660-2007/ |archivedate=24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] Marsigli was second-in-command under the [[Johann Philipp d'Arco|Count d'Arco]] at the Imperial fortress of [[Breisach]] on the Rhine, which was surrendered in 1703. Count d'Arco was beheaded because he was found guilty of capitulating before necessary, while Marsigli was stripped of his titles and honours by the Holy Roman Emperor, and his chivalric sword was broken over him. His appeals to the Emperor were in vain, but public opinion, however, acquitted him later of the charge of neglect or ignorance.

After he had left the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Habsburg Army]] he made journeys to [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]] and then France, spending a considerable time at [[Marseilles]] undertaking studies about the nature of the sea. He drew plans, made astronomical observations, measured the speed and size of rivers, studied the products, the mines, the birds, fishes, and [[fossil]]s of every land he visited, and also collected specimens of every kind, instruments, models, antiquities, etc. Finally he returned to Bologna and presented his entire collection to the [[Academic Senate|Senate]] of Bologna University in 1712. There he founded his "[[Institute of Bologna Academy of Sciences|Institute of Sciences and Arts]]", which was formally opened in 1715. Six professors were put in charge of the different divisions of the Institute. Later he established a printing-house furnished with the best [[Typeface|type sets]] for Latin, [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This was put in charge of the [[Dominican order|Dominicans]] under the patronage of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].

His major work on the [[Danube]] was published, after twenty years of delay, in 1726 in Amsterdam and The Hague. The maps of the work were published as an [[atlas]] in 1744. His [[treatise]] of oceans, published in 1725, renders Marsigli to be considered the founding father of modern [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartori, Renzo. “Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, Founding Father of Oceanography.” In Four Centuries of the Word Geology. Ulisse Aldrovandi 1603 in Bologna, edited by Gian Battista Vai and William Cavazza. Bologna, Italy: Minerva Edizioni, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1727 he added to his other collections [[East India]] material which he collected in England and [[Dutch Republic|Holland]]. A formal procession of the Institute he founded was established to take place every twenty-five years on the [[Annunciation|Feast of the Annunciation]]. In 1715 he was named a Foreign Associate of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]]; he was also a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] of London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/56/1/3 royalsocietypublishing.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Montpellier]].

== Works ==
A list of his works, over twenty in number, is given in [[Niceron]]'s ''Mémoirs''. His principal works are the following: ''Osservazioni interne al Bosforo Tracio'' (Rome, 1681); ''Histoire physique de la mer'', translated by Leclerc ([[Amsterdam]], 1725); ''[[:commons:Category:Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus|Danubius Pannonico-Mysicus]]'', richly illustrated work in six volumes containing much valuable historic and scientific information on the river [[Danube|Danubius]], (6 vols., [[The Hague]], 1726); and ''L'Etat militaire de l'empire ottoman'' (Amsterdam, 1732).

A '''measuring rod''' is a tool used to physically measure lengths and survey areas of various sizes. Most measuring rods are round or square sectioned; however, they can also be flat boards. Some have markings at regular intervals. It is likely that the measuring rod was used before the line, chain or steel tapes used in modern measurement.&lt;ref name="Engineers1891"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Society of Civil Engineers|title=Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGZDAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=6 April 2011|year=1891|publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Ancient Sumer===
The oldest preserved measuring rod is a [[copper]]-[[alloy]] bar which was found by the [[Germans|German]] [[Assyriology|Assyriologist]] [[Eckhard Unger]] while excavating at [[Nippur]] (pictured below). The bar dates from c. 2650 BC. and Unger claimed it was used as a measurement standard. This irregularly formed and irregularly marked ''graduated rule'' supposedly defined the '''''Sumerian cubit''''' as about 518.5&amp;nbsp;mm or 20.4&amp;nbsp;inches, although this does not agree with other evidence from the statues of [[Gudea]] from the same region, five centuries later.&lt;ref name="Center"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scandinavian Archaeometry Center|title=Archaeology and natural science, p. 118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3CRmAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 June 2011|publisher=P. Åströms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nippur_cubit.JPG|thumb|500px|center|Nippur cubit, graduated specimen of an ancient measure from Nippur, Mesopotamia (3rd millennium B.C.) – displayed in the Archeological Museum of Istanbul (Turkey).]]

===Ancient India===

Rulers made from ivory were in use by the Indus Valley Civilization in what today is Pakistan, and in some parts of Western India prior to 1500 BCE. Excavations at Lothal dating to 2400 BCE have yielded one such ruler calibrated to about 1/16 of an inch—less than 2 millimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelaw, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Whitelaw (2007) holds that 'The Mohenjo-Daro ruler is divided into units corresponding to 1.32 inches (33.5&amp;nbsp;mm) and these are marked out in decimal subdivisions with remarkable accuracy—to within 0.005 of an inch. Ancient bricks found throughout the region have dimensions that correspond to these units.'.&lt;ref&gt;Whitelaw, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The sum total of ten graduations from Lothal is approximate to the angula in the Arthashastra.&lt;ref&gt;S. R. Rao (1985). Lothal. Archaeological Survey of India. pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient East Asia===
Measuring rods for different purposes and sizes (construction, tailoring and land survey) have been found from China and elsewhere dating to the early 2nd millennium B.C.E.&lt;ref name="Zhao1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gang Zhao|title=Man and land in Chinese history: an economic analysis, p. 65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jKsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1986|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1271-2|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian units of measurement}}
Cubit-rods of wood or stone were used in Ancient Egypt. Fourteen of these were described and compared by Lepsius in 1865.&lt;ref name=lepsius&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepsius|first=Richard|title=Die altaegyptische Elle und ihre Eintheilung|year=1865|publisher=Dümmler|location=Berlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PRQGAAAAQAAJ|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flinders Petrie]] reported on a rod that shows a length of 520.5&amp;nbsp;mm, a few millimetres less than the Egyptian [[cubit]].&lt;ref name="AnthropologieUrgeschichte1976"&gt;{{cite book |title=Acta praehistorica et archaeologica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqYXAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=6 April 2011|year=1976|publisher=B.Hessling.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slate measuring rod was also found, divided into fractions of a Royal Cubit and dating to the time of [[Akhenaten]].&lt;ref name="Publishers2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers|title=Holman Illustrated Study Bible-HCSB|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2QxQUrFxoC&amp;pg=PA1413|accessdate=8 April 2011|date=15 September 2006|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-58640-275-4|pages=1413–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further cubit rods have been found in the tombs of officials. Two examples are known from the tomb of [[Maya (Treasurer)|Maya]]—the treasurer of the [[18th dynasty]] pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]]—in [[Saqqara]]. Another was found in the tomb of Kha ([[TT8]]) in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. These cubits are ca 52.5&amp;nbsp;cm long and are divided into seven palms, each palm is divided into four fingers and the fingers are further subdivided.&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;Marshall Clagett, Ancient Egyptian Science, A Source Book. Volume Three: Ancient Egyptian Mathematics, American Philosophical Society, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Another wooden cubit rod was found in Theban tomb [[TT40]] (Huy) bearing the throne name of Tutankhamun (Nebkheperure).&lt;ref name="Welsh2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frances Welsh|title=Tutankhamun's Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqFwXcf5S6cC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=19 April 2011|date=4 March 2008|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-7478-0665-3|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coudée-turin.jpg|thumb|550px|center| Cubit rod from the Turin Museum.]]

Egyptian measuring rods also had marks for the [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|Remen]] measurement of approximately 370mm, used in construction of the [[Pyramids]].&lt;ref name="Acta archaeologica"&gt;{{cite book|title=Acta archaeologica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVA-AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=1969|publisher=Levin &amp; Munksgaard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brennan1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Brennan|title=The Boyne Valley vision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3boAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=1980|publisher=Dolmen Press|isbn=978-0-85105-362-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Europe===
An [[oak]] rod from the [[Iron Age]] fortified settlement at [[Borre Fen]] in [[Denmark]] measured {{convert|53.15|in|cm}}, with marks dividing it up into eight parts of {{convert|6.64|in|cm}}, corresponding quite closely to half a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Pous]] (a Greek foot).&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, H.

===Roman Empire===
[[File:Measurement instrument IMG 4398-2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of a Roman measuring rod, from Musée romain de Lausanne-Vidy]]
Large public works and imperial expansion, particularly the large network of [[Roman roads]] and the many [[milecastle]]s, made the measuring rod an indispensable part of both the military and civilian aspects of Roman life. [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]] used several measures, including the various Greek feet measurements and the Oscan foot of 23,7&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, H.A. (1976): The World of Measurements. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; Standardisation was introduced by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] in 29 BC, replacing all previous measurements by a [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman foot]] of 29.6&amp;nbsp;cm, which became the foot of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Soren, D. &amp; Soren, N. (1999): A Roman villa and a late Roman infant cemetery : excavation at Poggio Gramignano, Lugnano in Teverina. Bibliotheca archaeologica (Rome, Italy), no. 23.

The Roman measuring rod was 10 Roman feet long, and hence called a ''decempeda'', [[Latin]] for ‘ten feet’. It was usually of square section capped at both ends by a metal shoe, and painted in alternating colours. Together with the ''[[Groma surveying|groma]]'' and ''[[Dioptra]]'' the ''decempeda'' formed the basic kit for the [[Gromatici|Roman surveyors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A shorter folding [[yardstick]] one Roman foot long is known from excavations of a Roman fort in [[Niederburg]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Main Limes Museum: [http://www.museen-mainlimes.de/content/2-museen/fund.en.php?id=48 Measuring rod]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Middle Ages]], bars were used as standards of length when [[surveying]] land.&lt;ref name="BreedHosmer1977"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Blaney Breed|author2=George Leonard Hosmer|title=The principles and practice of surveying|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsFRAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 April 2011|year=1977|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These bars often used a unit of measure called a [[Rod (unit)|rod]], of [[length]] equal to 5.5 [[yard]]s, 5.0292 [[metre]]s, 16.5 [[foot (length)|feet]], or {{Fraction|1|320}} of a [[statute mile]].&lt;ref name="dict-rod"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Two statues of [[Gudea of Lagash]] in the [[Louvre]] depict him sitting with a tablet on his lap, upon which are placed surveyors tools including a measuring rod.&lt;ref name="Preziosi1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Preziosi|title=Minoan architectural design: formation and signification, p. 498|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdqfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 April 2011|year=1983|publisher=Mouton|isbn=978-90-279-3409-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tablet of Shamash]] recovered from the ancient [[Babylon]]ian city of [[Sippar]] and dated to the 9th century BC shows [[Shamash]], the Sun God awarding the measuring rod and coiled rope to newly trained [[surveying|surveyor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/tablet_of_shamash.aspx The British Museum - Tablet of Shamash]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarperBurton1905"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Rainey Harper|author2=Ernest De Witt Burton|author3=Shailer Mathews|title=The Biblical world p. 120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YnNAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 April 2011|year=1905|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar scene with measuring rod and coiled rope is shown on the top part of the [[diorite]] [[stele]] above the [[Code of Hammurabi]] in the [[Louvre]], Paris, dating to ca. 1700 BC.&lt;ref name="Kuhrt1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amélie Kuhrt|title=The ancient Near East, c. 3000-330 BC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_sfMzRPTgoC&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16763-5|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "measuring rod" or [[tally stick]] is common in the [[iconography]] of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] Goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]].&lt;ref name="Dirven1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucinda Dirven|title=The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: a study of religious interaction in Roman Syria p. 329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&amp;pg=PA329|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-11589-7|pages=329–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Graeco-Egyptian God [[Serapis]] is also depicted in images and on coins with a measuring rod in hand and a vessel on his head.&lt;ref name="Eschenburg1836"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Joachim Eschenburg|title=Manual of classical literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arAoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA343|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=1836|publisher=Key and Biddle|pages=343–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VermaserenSection1979"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maarten Jozef Vermaseren|author2=International Association for the History of Religions.

The most elaborate depiction is found on the  [[Ur-Nammu]]-stela, where the winding of the cords has been detailed by the sculptor. This has also been described as a "staff and a chaplet of beads".&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, Anthony Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia'', Rod and Ring, p 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythology===
The myth of [[Inanna]]'s descent to the nether world describes how the goddess dresses and prepares herself: {{quote|"She held the [[lapis-lazuli]] measuring rod and measuring line in her hand."&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.4.1 Inana's descent to the nether world] line 25. The Sumerian has: gi-diš-'''nindan''' '''eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' za-gin&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; šu ba-ni-in-du&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; i.e. taken literally the rod would have the length of one ''nindan'' (6 cubit = 5.94m) and the eš&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gana&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  the surveyor's line - would be ten ''nindan'' in length.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]] in [[Greek mythology]] was one of the three [[Moirai]] (or Fates) and "allotter" (or drawer of lots). She measured the thread of life allotted to each person with her measuring rod. Her Roman equivalent was ''[[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]'' (the 'Tenth').&lt;ref name="Graves1957"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Graves|title=The Greek myths, p. 30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DzXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 April 2011|year=1957|publisher=G. Braziller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Varuna]] in the [[Rigveda]], is described as using the [[Sun]] as a measuring rod to lay out space in a [[creation myth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv05085.htm Rig Veda, Book 5, Hymn 85, Verse 5 tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, &amp;#91;1896&amp;#93;, at sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hopkins2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Washburn Hopkins|title=The Religions of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeQwFPhwxxkC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=10 January 2007|publisher=Echo Library|isbn=978-1-4068-1329-6|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt; W. R. Lethaby has commented on how the measurers were seen as [[solar deities]] and noted how [[Vishnu]] ''"measured the regions of the Earth"''.&lt;ref name="Lethaby2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. R. Lethaby|title=Architecture, Mysticism and Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTV1B-Z-ytsC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=December 2005|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59605-380-9|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bible===
Measuring rods or reeds are mentioned many times in the [[Bible]].

A measuring rod and line are seen in a vision of [[Yahweh]] in [[Ezekiel]] 40:2-3:
{{quote|In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city. He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand.&lt;ref name="BIBLE: New International Version"&gt;{{cite book|title=BIBLE: New International Version|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CuvrJLhk7O8C|accessdate=8 April 2011|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another example is [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 11:1:
{{quote|I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, "Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count the worshipers there".&lt;ref name="BIBLE: New International Version"/&gt;}}

The measuring rod also appears in connection with [[foundation stone]] rites in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:14-15:
{{quote|And the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. The one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall.&lt;ref name="Inc1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Foundation Publication Inc|title=New American Standard Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TjlAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 April 2011|date=1 March 1997|publisher=Foundation Publications, publisher for the Lockman Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Raskalov and Makhorov have been notable for their number of [[urban climbing|free-climbs up famous buildings and monuments]] around the world. Typically, their videos are uploaded onto [[YouTube]] and showcase their ascent and descent. Their most popular video, of the [[Shanghai Tower]], has over 68 million views as of May 2018. Raskalov and Makhorov appeared as recurring cast in the documentary series ''[[URBEX – Enter At Your Own Risk]]'', which launched globally on [[Red Bull TV]] on August 1, 2016.

== Climbs ==
Raskalov and Makhorov received press attention in early 2014 when they climbed up the [[Shanghai Tower]], the second tallest building in the world. They entered the construction site of the unfinished tower during the Lunar New Year and filmed a video, which attracted over 68 million views on [[YouTube]] as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLDYtH1RH-U|title=Shanghai Tower (650 meters)|first=|last=on the roofs|date=12 February 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the video sparked a discussion on the safety and the liability of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-kim/the-story-behind-that-ins_b_4832639.html|title=The Story Behind That Insane Shanghai Tower Climb|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=23 April 2014|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kgLKIrTq|archivedate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/13/russians-scale-chinas-new-tallest-building|title=Russian daredevils scale the Shanghai Tower, China's new tallest building|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 February 2014|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kgLdnsv6|archivedate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/two-chinese-guys-copied-that-insane-shanghai-tower-clim-1532287408 Two Chinese Guys Copied That Insane Shanghai Tower Climb].&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the Chinese authorities would ban the climbers from re-entering the country, but their pseudonyms allowed them to slip through the net a year later and climb [[Ping An Finance Center]] in Shenzhen, China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71MAFmlZzi0|title=Shenzhen Centre (660 meters)|first=|last=on the roofs|date=8 May 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2940831/Fearless-Far-East-Daredevil-climbers-scale-Hong-Kong-s-2-000ft-skyscrapers-reveal-biggest-fear-isn-t-death-surviving-crippled.html|title=Daredevil urban climbers reveal new pictures from dizzying heights.|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=5 February 2015|dead-url=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kgLnYdf6|archivedate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Suara Irama Indah era===
After [[PM2FGZ|Elshinta Radio]] was bought (possibly by [[Salim Group]]) in the late 1970s, Soejoso Karsono created Radio Suara Irama Indah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historia.id/persona/articles/the-singing-commodore-DLQwv|title=The Singing Commodore|website=Historia - Obrolan Perempuan Urban}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudibyo Karsono also contributed to Irama Indah radio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sutarko.blogspot.co.id/2011/05/sudibyo-karsono-dan-hidroponik-serius.html|title=Sudibyo Karsono dan Hidroponik Serius|website=sutarko.blogspot.co.id}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Later the radio changed into B-FM and Radio One in the late 1980s. 
===Radio One===
Radio One started broadcasting in late 1980s. This radio's audience was young adults, playing classical music. With affiliation to [[Prambors]] group in late 1980's, Radio One was partially owned by Masima Group along with sister station [[PM2FGK|Prambors]], Delta FM, Female Radio (acquisition of [[Tangerang]]-located station), Bahana 101.8, M97 (now RDI) and SPFM (now Oz Radio). Radio One once had provincial stations, but they were sold to Masima to create Prambors provincial stations. In 2007, this affiliation led to ownership of Masima Group's 20% share by Mahaka Group. In 2004, the 101.0 FM frequency was first time used, after using 101.25 FM for over a decade. In 2006, management decided to change Radio One branding into 101 Jak FM. Ownership was overtaken by Mahaka group and now they are the sole operators.
===Jak FM ===
Jak FM changed the branding only. Neither DJ's nor music was altered from Radio One. To cater younger and more varied listeners, Jak FM later added new music, mostly Western music. Jak FM slowly reduced [[Classic hits|classic hits]] and added new announcers, including morning show DJ Ronal Surapradja and Tike Prie.
==Programming==
Jak FM operates for 18 hours (06.00 (all time in [[UTC+7]])-00.00) . Outside operating hours, Jak FM plays automated music. Daily programs include:

* Sarapan Seru (Ronal, Tike, Melissa Karim)
* 101 Menit Musik Nonstop (various announcers)
* Jak Best Music (various announcers)
* Joki 3 In 1 (Jodi, Vecky) - based on abandoned 3-in-1 policy in Jakarta main avenues
* Night Mix (various announcers)

==Early history==
Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA—http://www.pasda.psu.edu), the official public geospatial data clearinghouse for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania marked its 18th year in 2014. PASDA, which has grown from a small website offering 35 data sets in 1996 to the expansive user-centered data clearinghouse that it is today, has become a staple of the GIS community in Pennsylvania. PASDA provides access to thousands of data files, terabytes of data, and hundreds of Internet Map Services, Google Earth KML files, metadata, mapping applications, and other information like guides and tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064809/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PASDA was developed by the Pennsylvania State University as a service to the citizens, governments, and businesses of the Commonwealth. PASDA is a cooperative project of the Governor's Office of Administration, Office for Information Technology, Geospatial Technologies Office and Penn State Institutes for Energy and the Environment of the Pennsylvania State University. Funding is provided by the Pennsylvania Office for Information Technology, Geospatial Technologies Office. The Pennsylvania State University provides additional substantial support to PASDA for system administration, database technologies administration, and infrastructure. The High Performance Computing Center at Penn State is also providing significant resources and support for PASDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064809/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
PASDA is housed at Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment (PSIEE). 
The purpose of Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access (PASDA) is to serve as a comprehensive geospatial data digital library by providing free, universal access to geospatial data and information by, for, and about the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. PASDA has served for almost 20 years as the Commonwealth's node on the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), Geospatial One Stop, and the National Biological Information Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064809/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data made available through PASDA is provided by our data partners to encourage the widespread sharing of geospatial data, eliminate the creation of redundant data sets, and to further build an inventory (through the development and hosting of metadata) of available data relevant to the Commonwealth. PASDA serves as a resource for locating data throughout the Commonwealth through its data storage, interactive mapping/webgis applications, and metadata/documentation efforts. PASDA services are provided free of charge to all users and data providers. The data on PASDA is provided by federal, state, local and regional government agencies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutions throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.directionsmag.com/entry/the-road-taken-the-evolution-of-gis-data-clearinghouses-from-ftp-to-map-ser/123378&lt;/ref&gt;

Data updates to existing datasets come to PASDA at different intervals and are based on the update frequency of our data partners. Monthly, quarterly, and annual updates are the norm and include PennDOT, PA Department of Environmental Protection, PA Fish and Boat Commission, PA Department of Health, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Chester County, Allegheny County, Lancaster County, City of Philadelphia, Southeast PA Transportation Authority, Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, PA DCNR Rivers Conservation Program, and the Natural Lands Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064809/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of metadata on PASDA is one of the most important functions. The background of PASDA's metadata development has its origins in the development of the ANSI Z39.50 standard (also known as the ISO 23950 Search and Retrieval Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M.C., Baxter, R.E., &amp; Haupt, B.J. (2008). The evolution of spatial data infrastructure (SDI) geospatial data clearinghouses: Architecture and services. In Encyclopedia of Data Warehousing and Mining, (2nd ed.). Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;) This protocol was originally designed for libraries to search and retrieve records from remote library catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;Nebert, D. (Ed.) (2004). Developing spatial data infrastructures:
The SDI cookbook (v.2). Global Spatial
Data Infrastructure Association. http://www.gsdi.org.&lt;/ref&gt; PASDA's goal is not only to meet the existing metadata standards but also to create metadata in a format that supports easy search and retrieval of data. In the early stages of PASDA's development the metadata was either in HTML or text format and was subsequently parsed with a metadata parser.  PASDA was one of the first clearinghouses to implement the use of XML(Extensible Markup Language).&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M.C. &amp; Stauffer, B.E. (2000). User needs and operations requirements for the Pennsylvania Geospatial Data Clearinghouse. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University, Environmental Resources Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services &amp; Applications==
PASDA provides direct access to download data via FTP. Currently, PASDA has approximately 60 terabytes of data for download including vector data, imagery, elevation and lidar.In addition to direct download, PASDA has developed multiple ways to access data.  In 2000, PASDA was one of the first clearinghouses to address issues related to what is known as "clip, ship, and reproject"—a process by which large data sets can be clipped to a user specified geography, reprojected, and zipped for quick download.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M.C. &amp; Stauffer, B.E. (2000). User needs and operations requirements for the Pennsylvania Geospatial Data Clearinghouse. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University, Environmental Resources Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.directionsmag.com/entry/the-road-taken-the-evolution-of-gis-data-clearinghouses-from-ftp-to-map-ser/123378&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent advances, in particular the development of Internet Map Services, have, in part, eliminated the need for these specialized services.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M.C., Haupt, B.J., &amp; Baxter, R.E. (2009). Internet map services and Web GIS: The new paradigm in spatial and temporal data integration over the Web. In Encyclopedia of Database Technologies and Applications, (2nd ed.). Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important developments in GIS in the past decade has been the ability to create Internet Map Services—also known simply as map services.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M.C., Haupt, B.J., &amp; Baxter, R.E. (2009). Internet map services and Web GIS: The new paradigm in spatial and temporal data integration over the Web. In Encyclopedia of Database Technologies and Applications, (2nd ed.). Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Map services allow users to consume or pull in data to their GIS software without actually having to download it thereby saving download time and storage space.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M.C., Haupt, B.J., &amp; Baxter, R.E. (2009). Internet map services and Web GIS: The new paradigm in spatial and temporal data integration over the Web. In Encyclopedia of Database Technologies and Applications, (2nd ed.). Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Map services have been some of the most heavily used features on PASDA and support multiple types of web based GIS applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PennsylvaniaSpatialDataAccessplssnew.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122191314/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PennsylvaniaSpatialDataAccessplssnew.ppt |archivedate=2015-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to downloading data and creating map services, many GIS clearinghouses also have created web based GIS applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.directionsmag.com/entry/the-road-taken-the-evolution-of-gis-data-clearinghouses-from-ftp-to-map-ser/123378&lt;/ref&gt;  The applications available through PASDA include the Pennsylvania Atlas—a data visualization and download app,&lt;ref&gt;http://maps.psiee.psu.edu/paatlas/&lt;/ref&gt; the Pennsylvania Imagery Navigator—a data visualization, search and retrieval app for imagery and LIDAR,&lt;ref&gt;http://maps.psiee.psu.edu/ImageryNavigator/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pennsylvania Mine Map Atlas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minemaps.psu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pennsylvania Mine Map Atlas is a joint project of PASDA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.psu.edu/story/287443/2013/09/12/impact/penn-state-dep-collaborate-digital-pennsylvania-mine-map-atlas&lt;/ref&gt; This Mine Map Atlas provides access to thousands of scanned, georeferenced underground mine maps in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.psu.edu/story/287443/2013/09/12/impact/penn-state-dep-collaborate-digital-pennsylvania-mine-map-atlas&lt;/ref&gt; It allows users to view their homes and see if any mines are beneath those homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minemaps.psu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this effort is to identify houses and other structures at risk of mine subsidence, ground movement caused by the collapse of old, abandoned mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://businessjournaldaily.com/drilling-down/pennsylvania-launches-online-mine-map-viewer-2013-5-31 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122190807/http://businessjournaldaily.com/drilling-down/pennsylvania-launches-online-mine-map-viewer-2013-5-31 |archivedate=2015-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final number of mine maps that will be provided through this application is expected to near 100,000 individual maps.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.psu.edu/story/287443/2013/09/12/impact/penn-state-dep-collaborate-digital-pennsylvania-mine-map-atlas&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Initiatives &amp; Users==
PASDA has participated in numerous national and international level initiatives since its beginnings in 1996.

PASDA was an original member of the [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] Geography Network and ESRI's ArcGIS.com. In addition, PASDA metadata is harvested by multiple data portals including Geospatial One Stop, Data.gov, and the National Biological Information Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108140407/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/default.asp |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PASDA is an open data portal—meaning that is provides open, free, unrestricted access to data in multiple formats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Open data]]&lt;/ref&gt; PASDA provides data storage, data access and retrieval, and metadata services free of charge to its data providers because access to data drives economic development, conservation efforts, and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PennsylvaniaSpatialDataAccessplssnew.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122191314/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PennsylvaniaSpatialDataAccessplssnew.ppt |archivedate=2015-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The data made available through PASDA is provided by data partners to encourage the widespread sharing of geospatial data, eliminate the creation of redundant data sets, and to further build an inventory (through the development and hosting of metadata) of available data relevant to the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108140407/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/default.asp |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PASDA user base is extensive. Users come from a broad spectrum of organizations and backgrounds, from teachers and citizens to businesses and government agencies—PASDA provides free access to data, applications, and customization tools to meet the needs of every user. PASDA saw a dramatic increase of use in almost every sector driven in part by factors such as Marcellus Shale exploration, environmental conservation, economic development initiatives, expanded use of geospatial data in universities, non profits, and the private sector, and the increased interest from average citizens who are able to access geospatial information via PASDA’s data previewer and KML files without the need for specialized GIS software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064809/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of PASDA has continually increased over its history.  In the past year, almost 2 million files were downloaded from the PASDA FTP site; while usage on the entire site topped 71 million hits, over 28 million page views, and over 1 million unique visitors. The PASDA web servers, which provide access to Internet Map Services and PASDA applications like the Imagery Navigator and PA Atlas supported over 57 million map views. The statistics this year demonstrate more than any other that there is a wide range of data that is of great interest to the user community. Data (and map services created from data) from partners at the PA Department of Environmental Protection, PennDOT, PA Fish and Boat Commission, PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Allegheny County, the DCNR PAMAP Program, and the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission received phenomenal use—with map service views and data downloads in the millions or hundreds of thousands. 
In addition, PASDA has created highly significant applications and services that dramatically increase the value of the data available. The Imagery Navigator supported almost 6.3 million views and the Aerial Photo Cache supported almost 22.4 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064809/http://www.pasda.psu.edu/about/publications/PASDAFinal201314.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rainbow Group in the European Parliament''' was a [[regionalism (politics)|regionalist]] [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political group]] in the [[European Parliament]] from 1989 to 1994.&lt;ref name="RhodesMazey1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carolyn Rhodes|author2=Sonia Mazey|title=Building a European Polity?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yphlsppkkhoC&amp;pg=PA141|year=1995|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-55587-605-0|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In 1989&lt;ref name="t1s11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t1s3"/&gt; the previous [[Rainbow Group (1984–89)|Rainbow Group]] split. For the [[Third European Parliament|third term of the European Parliament]], the [[Green politics|green parties]] formed [[The Green Group in the European Parliament|The Green Group]], whilst the regionalist parties stayed in the remaining Rainbow Group. 

This second Rainbow Group was the highpoint of the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA) to that date.&lt;ref name="DeWinterTürsan1998"/&gt;

But the 1994 elections saw a considerable reduction in Regionalist representation in the Parliament, with only the [[Canarian Coalition]], [[Lega Nord]], [[Scottish National Party]] and [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] keeping their MEPs.&lt;ref name="DeWinterTürsan1998"/&gt; But Lega Nord had been suspended from the EFA  following its decision to join the [[Berlusconi I Cabinet|Italian coalition government]] alongside the right-wing 
[[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]].&lt;ref name="DeWinterTürsan1998"/&gt; The weakened EFA was no longer able to maintain their own group, and instead allied with members of the French ''[[Radical Party of the Left|Energie Radicale]]'' to form the Group of the [[European Radical Alliance]].

[[File:Denny Regrade-1.jpg|thumb|Denny Regrade No. 1 in progress, circa 1910]]

The topography of central [[Seattle]] was radically altered by a series of [[regrading|regrades]] in the city's first century of urban settlement, in what might have been the largest such alteration of urban terrain at the time.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=44}}

The heart of Seattle, largest city in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], is on an [[isthmus]] between the city's chief harbor—the saltwater [[Elliott Bay]] (an inlet of [[Puget Sound]])—and the fresh water of [[Lake Washington]]. [[Capitol Hill, Seattle|Capitol Hill]], [[First Hill, Seattle|First Hill]], and [[Beacon Hill, Seattle|Beacon Hill]] collectively constitute a ridge along this isthmus. In addition, at the time the city was founded, the steep Denny Hill stood in the area now known as [[Belltown, Seattle|Belltown]] or the [[Denny Regrade, Seattle|Denny Regrade]].

When [[European colonization of the Americas|white settlers]] first came to Seattle in the early 1850s, the tides of Elliott Bay lapped at the base of Beacon Hill.{{sfn|Merrell|Latoszek|2003|p=15}} The original location of the settlement that became Seattle—today's [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]]—was a low-lying island. A series of regrades leveled paths for roads, demolished Denny Hill, and turned much of Jackson Hill (a remnant of which remains along Main Street in the [[International District, Seattle|International District]]) into a near-canyon between First and Beacon Hills. The roughly {{convert|50000000|ST|MT|sp=us|-5}} of earth from these 60 regrades{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=44}} provided [[Land reclamation|landfill]] for the city's waterfront and the industrial/commercial neighborhood now known as [[SoDo, Seattle|SoDo]], and built [[Harbor Island, Seattle|Harbor Island]], at the time the largest man-made island in the world.

== The early years ==

[[File:Seattle - Railroad Avenue - 1900.jpg|thumb|Railroad Avenue, today's Alaskan Way, depicted here in 1900, was built on fill from the early regrades. To the right in this picture, casting shadows, are the wharves of the Central Waterfront.]]

Seattle's first 58 regrades "consisted largely of cutting the tops off high places and dumping the dirt into low places and onto the beach."{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=41}} The most dramatic result of this was along that former beach, filling the land that constitutes today's [[Central Waterfront, Seattle|Central Waterfront]]. Today's Western Avenue and Alaskan Way lie on this landfill.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=41}}

These informal regrades came to an end around 1900; later regrades typically required changes to areas that had already undergone some development. City engineer [[Reginald H. Thomson|R.H. Thomson]] established his prestige in 1900. He successfully provided the city with ample fresh water by [[Seattle Public Utilities#Seattle's water supply|running a pipeline]] from the [[Cedar River (Washington)|Cedar River]]. He then undertook to level the extreme hills that rose south and north of the bustling city center.

== Cutting through Beacon Hill ==

[[File:Seattle 2nd Ave south from Pine Street 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Looking south from Pine Street on the south slope of Denny Hill, 1880. The wide bay at the foot of Beacon Hill is now the location of the SoDo neighborhood.]]
[[File:Seattle - Dearborn St regrade, 1912.gif|thumb|left|The Dearborn Regrade in progress, 1912. Looking west, towards the [[12th Avenue South Bridge]] / Jose P. Rizal Bridge, constructed the previous year.]]

The first, unsuccessful, attempt to pierce the Capitol Hill&amp;nbsp;– First Hill&amp;nbsp;– Beacon Hill ridge came at the end of this era of informal regrades. In 1895, former territorial governor [[Eugene Semple]] (1840–1908) proposed several ambitious plans to reengineer Seattle. One of these, which he undertook in 1901, was to dig a canal from Elliott Bay to Lake Washington by cutting through Beacon Hill&lt;ref name="Wilma" /&gt; in roughly the area of Spokane Street,{{sfn|Merrell|Latoszek|2003|p=15}} sluicing earth into the [[tide flat]]s. His effort was defeated by unstable soils, which caused several cave-ins, and by the legal and political maneuvering of Judge [[Thomas Burke (judge)|Thomas Burke]] and others aligned with the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]]. The [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]] ultimately followed the route north of downtown favored by Burke,{{sfn|Berner|1991|pp=17–18}} utilizing existing lakes and bays.&lt;ref name="Wilma" /&gt; Semple left behind a canyon that is now used by the Spokane Street interchange on [[Interstate 5]].{{sfn|Merrell|Latoszek|2003|p=15}}

Thomson resumed the work of cutting through Beacon Hill to connect central Seattle to the [[Rainier Valley, Seattle|Rainier Valley]], the first of his major regrades,&lt;ref name="Wilma" /&gt; but he made his cut farther north. The Jackson Regrade between 1907 and 1910 slashed {{convert|85|ft|m|1}} from the hill,{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=41}} requiring the demolition of the public South School and the original [[Holy Names Academy]]{{sfn|Merrell|Latoszek|2003|p=15}} but providing fill for the tide flats below Beacon Hill that stretched south from King Street, filling in today's SoDo. Jackson Street became a slow slope upward from Elliott Bay in the west to the [[Central District, Seattle|Central District]] east of the Capitol Hill&amp;nbsp;– First Hill&amp;nbsp;– Beacon Hill ridge.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=41}}

Shortly afterward, just south of the Jackson Regrade, the Dearborn Street Regrade made an even deeper cut through the ridge. In one place, the level of the land was lowered by {{convert|108|ft|m|1}}; {{convert|1600000|cuyd|m3|0}} of earth were moved.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=42}} As with Semple's abandoned canal, there were several landslides, and many homes were destroyed that were not originally planned to be removed.{{sfn|Merrell|Latoszek|2003|p=15}}

The resulting gap at Dearborn Street was deep enough to require a bridge running roughly north-south. Originally known as the [[12th Avenue South Bridge]] and now known as the Jose P. Rizal Bridge, it is now on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

== The Denny Regrade ==

[[File:Denny Regrade-2.jpg|thumb|left|A postcard shows the Washington Hotel atop Denny Hill before Denny Regrade No. 1 and the New Washington Hotel (the dark building in the lower picture, now the Josephinum) built on the newly leveled land.]]
[[File:Seattle - Denny School - 1900.jpg|thumb|The 1884 Denny School (depicted here in 1900) on Battery Street between Fifth &amp; Sixth Avenues was demolished in 1928, one of many major buildings demolished as part of Denny Regrade No. 2.]]

The Denny Regrade began before the Jackson and Dearborn Regrades, but the last stage was not completed until decades later. Before regrading, the much-admired Denny School&lt;ref name="Thompson Marr" /&gt; and the upmarket Washington Hotel stood atop the hill,&lt;ref name="Dorpat" /&gt; along with numerous residential buildings.&lt;ref name="Sanborn" /&gt;

Although in retrospect it is referred to as the Denny Regrade (and the name has become the name of a neighborhood), there were, in fact, several separate regrades of the former Denny Hill, beginning with private-sector efforts. Around 1900,&lt;!-- a more precise date would be nice--&gt; property owners along relatively low-lying First Avenue took it upon themselves to cut through from Pike Street to Cedar Street. A similar cut (but initiated by the City) lowered Second Avenue in 1904; around the same time, the south part of the hill was shaved off as Pike and Pine Streets were regraded between Second and Fifth Avenues.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=42}}

The more dramatic Denny Regrade No. 1 (1908–1911) sluiced away the entire half of the hill closest to the waterfront, about 27 city blocks extending from Pine Street to Cedar Street and from Second to Fifth Avenues. {{convert|20000000|USgal|kl|0}} of water a day were pumped from [[Lake Union]], to be aimed at the hill as jets of water, then run through tunnels to Elliott Bay.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=42}}

Much of the motivation for the regrade had been to increase land values, but the area opened up—the heart of today's Belltown—was left as a strip cut off from much of the rest of the city by the remaining eastern half of the hill, whose western face offered no route of approach. Meanwhile, property-owners and investors hesitated to build on the remaining portion of the hill, because they considered it likely that their buildings would eventually be destroyed in the next phase of the regrading process, which was now well under way.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=42}}

The result was Denny Regrade No. 2, begun in February 1929 and lasting 22 months. This time, the technology was power shovels rather than sluicing, with earth carried to the waterfront by [[conveyor belt]]s, then placed on specially designed [[scow]]s and dumped in deep water.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=42}} The scows were intentionally designed to capsize in a controlled manner. They were symmetrical top-to-bottom and side to side; a [[seacock]] could be opened to fill one side with water. In three minutes it would capsize, dump its load, bob up, empty the tank, and right itself.{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|pp=42–43}}

One of the buildings demolished in Denny Regrade No. 2 was the Denny School on Battery Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. Opened in 1884, it had been described as "an architectural jewel... the finest schoolhouse on the West Coast."&lt;ref name="Thompson Marr" /&gt;

While the 38 blocks were being regraded, the country entered the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], radically reducing the demand for land. Most of the new lots sat vacant into the 1940s;{{sfn|Peterson|Davenport|1950|p=44}} the area (especially east of Sixth Avenue) remained a "[[gray zone]]" into the early 21st century, when it finally began to gain an urban or suburban identity as the west edge of the new growth of [[South Lake Union, Seattle|South Lake Union]].

A '''''Sabon Gari''''' (strangers' quarters or literally new town in the [[Hausa language]], plural ''Sabon Garuruwa'') is a section of cities and town in [[Northern Nigeria]] south central [[Niger]] and northern [[Cameroon]] whose residents are not indigenous to Hausa lands.

==History==
Permanent communities of strangers segregated from the indigenous population had existed in Northern Nigeria and other parts of West Africa long before the arrival of the British at around 1900. Although living segregated from the Hausa population, residents of these communities were ultimately subject to the authority of the local [[emir]].This has changed over the years as apart from Kano in northern Nigeria, the Sabon Garis are of mixed habitation.

The establishment of British colonial rule under [[Frederick Lugard]] and the construction of new railway lines led to a large influx of laboreres and traders from Southern Nigeria. The immigrants, which were mostly [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Yoruba people]], settled in new towns or ''Sabon Garuruwa'', as these new towns were called by the local Hausa people. The Cantonments Proclamation of 1914 institutionalized this system of residential segregation. The Sabon Garuruwa became Native Reservations, officially reserved for employees of the government and commercial firms, and in practice inhabited by residents not indigenous to Northern Nigeria.

British colonial rule in Northern Nigeria was indirect, leaving the emirs in power, albeit as part of the colonial administration. In the beginning the Sabon Garuruwa were administrated by the emirs. This changed with the Township Ordinance of 1917, which placed the Sabon Garuruwa and their residents under direct British rule. Sabon Gari residents were granted more rights than those under the administration of the local emir. For example, residents of a Sabon Gari could send representatives to the advisory board responsible for a township, or could choose between courts administering Muslim law or British law.

Sabon Garuruwa were established in all major cities of Northern Nigeria, most notably in [[Kano]], [[Kaduna]] and [[Zaria]]. One exception was [[Maiduguri]], which never had a Sabon Gari. A typical city or town in Northern Nigeria would consist of the old city within fortified walls and inhabited by indigenous Hausa or Fulani people. The Sabon Gari would house immigrants mostly from Southern Nigeria. The ''Tudun Wada'' would house people from Northern Nigeria that were not indigenous to the local area. Europeans would live in the European Reservation Areas.

Over time the initially strict residential segregation would partially break down. Eventually a typical Sabon Gari would house a diversity of people from all parts of Nigeria and to a lesser extent from other parts of West Africa. For example, in 1939 various ethnic groups were represented in the Sabon Gari of Kaduna as follows: 27% were [[Hausa people|Hausa]], 11% were [[Igbo people|Igbo]], 19% were [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], 15% were [[Nupe people|Nupe]] and 28% were other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Salm |first=Steven J. |authorlink= |author2=Toyin Falola |title=Nigerian Cities |month= |url= |format= |publisher=Africa World Press|location= |language= |isbn=1-59221-169-0 |pages= 113–114|chapter= |chapterurl=|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sabon Garuruwa today==
Even today Sabon Garuruwa are predominantly inhabited by people from Southern Nigeria. Ethnic tensions between groups from southern and northern Nigeria lead to frequent riots in the Sabon Garuruwa of northern cities. With the introduction of [[Sharia]] law in the northern states of Nigeria some Sabon Garuruwa with its predominantly Christian population have become the place of officially forbidden activities like alcohol consumption, gambling and prostitution.

[[File:Sanborn Boston 1867 sheet 1a.gif|thumb|300px|Sanborn map of Boston from 1867]]

'''The Sanborn Map Company''' was a publisher of detailed maps of U.S. cities and towns in the 19th and 20th centuries.  The maps were originally created to allow [[fire insurance]] companies to assess their total liability in urbanized areas of the United States.  Since they contain detailed information about properties and individual buildings in approximately 12,000 U.S. cities and towns, Sanborn maps are invaluable for documenting changes in the [[built environment]] of American cities over many decades.&lt;ref name="keister1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Keister | first=Kim | coauthors= | title=Charts of Change | journal=Historic Preservation | volume=45  | issue=3 | pages=42–49 | doi= |date=May–June 1993 | quote=Stated simply, the Sanborn maps survive as a guide to American urbanization that is unrivaled by other cartography and, for that matter, by few documentary resources of any kind. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanborn held a monopoly over fire insurance maps for the majority of the 20th century, but the business declined as US insurance companies stopped using maps for underwriting in the 1960s. The last Sanborn fire maps were published on [[Microform|microfilm]] in 1977, but old Sanborn maps remain useful for historical research into urban geography.  The Sanborn Map Company continues on as a [[Geographic information system|geospatial]] solutions company.

==Description==

The Sanborn maps themselves are large-scale [[lithograph]]ed street plans at a scale of 50 feet to one inch (1:600) on {{convert|21|by|25|in|cm}} sheets of paper.  The maps were published in volumes, bound and then updated until the subsequent volume was produced.  Larger cities would be covered by multiple volumes of maps.  Between editions of published volumes, map updates were sent out as correction slips.  Sanborn employees, called "pasters" or "correctors", would visit subscribers' offices to paste the slips on top of the old maps.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Collection - Sanborn Maps|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/articles-and-essays/introduction-to-the-collection/|website=The Library of Congress|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buffett1960"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buffett|first1=Warren|title=Letter from Warren Buffett to Partners, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ristow1968"/&gt;

The map volumes contain an enormous amount of information.  They are organized as follows: a decorative title page; an index of streets and addresses; a ‘specials’ index with the names of churches, schools, businesses etc.; and a master index indicating the entirety of the mapped area and the sheet numbers for each large-scale map (usually depicting four to six blocks); and general information such as population, economy and prevailing wind direction.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

The maps include outlines of each building and outbuilding; the location of windows and doors; street names; street and sidewalk widths; property boundaries; fire walls; natural features ([[river]]s, [[canal]]s, etc.); railroad corridors; building use (sometimes even particular room uses); house and block number; as well as the composition of [[building material]]s including the framing, flooring, and roofing materials; the strength of the local fire department; indications of sprinkler systems; locations of [[fire hydrant]]s; location of water and gas mains; and even the names of most public buildings, churches and businesses.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

Unique information includes the location of the homes of prominent individuals, brothels, and more ephemeral buildings including outhouses and stables.

== Insurance underwriting ==

At the outset of the [[fire insurance]] industry, [[Underwriting#Insurance underwriting|underwriters]] visited every property that was under consideration for coverage.&lt;ref name="ristow1968"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ristow|first1=Walter W.|title=United States Fire Insurance and Underwriters Maps: 1852—1968|journal=The Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress|date=1968|volume=25|issue=3|pages=194–218|doi=10.2307/29781319|jstor=29781319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As insurance companies increased their service areas, it was no longer practical to send people to every insurable property to assess the risk.  The Sanborn maps allowed them to underwrite properties from the office, pooling the cost with other insurance companies that also subscribed to the maps.  It was said that at one time, insurance companies and their agents “relied upon them with almost blind faith”.&lt;ref name="keister1993"/&gt;

The maps were utilized by insurance companies to determine the potential risk of a particular building, taking into account all of the information included on the map: building material, proximity to other buildings and [[fire department]]s, the location of gas lines, etc.  The decision as to how much, if any, insurance would be offered to a customer was often determined solely through the use of a Sanborn map.  The maps also allowed insurance companies to visualize their exposure in their coverage areas; when an agent sold a policy, he could color in the corresponding building on the map.

== History ==

[[File:Lagoon Map 1911.JPEG|left|thumb|1911 Sanborn map showing Lagoon Amusement Park in [[Farmington, Utah]]]]

In the late 18th century, insurance companies in London began to create detailed maps to give underwriters the information they needed to assess fire risk.  The practice was adopted by American insurance companies in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;  Demand for fire insurance mapping grew rapidly after the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  Factors such as the [[Homestead Act]], [[railroad]] construction, the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and massive [[immigration to the United States]] all fostered huge population growths, urbanization, and heightened demand for mapping.

[[Daniel Alfred Sanborn]], a civil engineer and surveyor, began working on fire insurance maps in 1866. That year, he was contracted by the [[Aetna|Aetna Insurance Company]] to prepare maps of areas in [[Tennessee]]. About the same time, he developed similar maps of [[Boston]], published as ''Insurance Map of Boston,'' Volume 1, 1867. Seeing a lucrative market for this type of map, he established the D. A. Sanborn National Insurance Diagram Bureau in New York City to publish the Boston atlas and develop and sell maps of additional areas.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

Within several decades, the company became the largest and most successful American map company. This growth came about through savvy management and the buyout of competing firms. In 1916, Sanborn purchased its last major competitor, the E. Hexamer &amp; Sons of Philadelphia, and became a [[monopoly]].  Company headquarters moved to 629 Fifth Avenue in northern [[Pelham, New York]], but there were also regional offices in [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]], and [[Atlanta]]. The Sanborn Company sent out legions of surveyors to map building footprints in all major urbanized areas, along with building details related to fire risk.  At its peak in the 1920s, the company employed about 700 people, including about 300 field surveyors and 400 cartographers, printers, managers, salesmen, and support staff.  Areas under intensive development were surveyed every six months.&lt;ref name="ristow1968"/&gt;

Sanborn's monopoly was resented by some insurance companies for its high cost.  The Underwriter's Association of the Pacific complained that an "Eastern monopoly" was giving service that was "very slow, expensive, and generally unsatisfactory."  In the 1910s, the National Board of Fire Underwriters investigated the possibility of creating its own maps.  However, many insurance companies opposed the proposal, citing the "very large expenditure" required and their satisfaction with Sanborn's "commendably satisfactory" service.  Instead, the NBFU Map Committee took an active role in Sanborn's operations.  In 1922, Sanborn agreed to add a member of the Map Committee to its [[Board of Directors]], and a second seat was added by 1927.  However, the onset of the [[Great Depression]] greatly curtailed construction activity in the United States.  By 1936, Sanborn had reduced its publishing output from 60 to 20 volumes per year, a pace that would take over 50 years to update the entire map collection.&lt;ref name="ristow1968"/&gt;

=== Decline of insurance business ===

In the 1950s, insurance companies began to use an alternative form of [[underwriting]] known as '''line carding'''.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buffett1960"/&gt;  Line carding had been used for decades to underwrite properties that were not covered by fire maps.&lt;ref name="alabama1921"&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Alabama for the Year Ending December 31, 1921|date=1922|publisher=Brown Printing Company|location=Montgomery, Alabama|page=44|quote=Maps are kept of business in the downtown district and proper care is exercised in considering block lines and conflagration hazard.  They propose to institute a line card system to properly care for lines not shown on maps.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each insured property was listed on a single card, and no map was kept.  Corporate mergers also reduced the need for Sanborn Maps, since the consolidated company only needed to buy one set of maps.  As insurance companies increased in size, they could withstand larger disasters and no longer needed to use insurance maps to reduce their concentration of risk.  Companies also cited "modern building construction, better [[building code|building fire codes]], and improved fire protection methods for the decline in importance of fire insurance maps."&lt;ref name="ristow1968"/&gt;

From the late 1930s to the late 1950s, Sanborn's annual profit fell from $500,000 to just $100,000.  About thirty insurance companies accounted for most of the company's sales.  However, its monopoly over insurance mapping had allowed it to earn substantial profits over the decades.  These profits were invested in a portfolio of stocks and bonds.  By 1958, the stock was selling for $45 a share, but the investments were worth $65 a share.  This attracted the attention of a young [[Warren Buffett]], who pressured the company to distribute the investment portfolio to shareholders.&lt;ref name="buffett1960"/&gt;

Buffett eventually purchased 23% of the company's outstanding shares as an [[activist investor]], representing 35% of his investment partnership's total [[assets under management]].  Allied with other dissatisfied shareholders, Buffett could count on the votes of at least 44% of the shares in a [[proxy fight]].  The Board agreed to [[Share repurchase|buy back]] shares from any shareholder at fair value, paying with a portion of its investment portfolio.  72% of the outstanding shares were turned in.&lt;ref name="buffett1960"/&gt;  In just two years, Buffett had secured a 50% return on his investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowenstein|first1=Roger|title=Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist|date=1995|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=9780804150606|pages=65–66|edition=2008 Trade Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of its insurance business, Sanborn could no longer afford to maintain its army of surveyors.  However, the company continued to sell its maps and perform some updates. Government sales began to play a larger role, especially the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] and municipal planning agencies.  Sanborn Maps printed its last catalog in 1950, created its last new map in 1961, and issued its last update in 1977.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;

Over time, the company diversified into other mapping activities, and is today a geospatial specialist and holder of electronic GIS assets and systems, though the fire insurance business continues as a niche department. Corporate headquarters are now in Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sanborn.com/|title = Corporate home page|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-14|website = Total Geospatial Solutions|publisher = Sanborn|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former headquarters building in [[Pelham, New York]] houses other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Today, Sanborn maps are found primarily in the archives and special collections of [[town hall]]s and public and university libraries, and remain a vital resource for people in many different fields.  Historical research is the most obvious use, with the maps facilitating the study of urban growth and decline patterns, and for research into the evolution of specific buildings, sites and districts.  Genealogists use the maps to locate the residences and workplaces of ancestors.  [[Urban planning|Planners]] use the maps to study historic urban planning designs.  [[Historic preservation]]ists use the maps to understand the significance and historical evolution of buildings, including their historic uses and building materials in conservation and rehabilitation efforts.  [[Demographer]]s and urban geographers use them to study patterns of growth and migration of populations.

Historic Sanborn maps may be accessed in a variety of ways.  Many are available through public or university libraries, or most comprehensively through the [[Library of Congress]].  One may also obtain [[copyright]] information or request copies of the maps for purchase through the current owners, [http://www.edrnet.com Environmental Data Resources, Incorporated].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2058">:''For the measure of downside risk, see [[Variance#Semivariance]]
In [[spatial statistics]], the '''empirical semivariance''' is described by
semivariance=1/2(z(x)-z(x))^2 where z is the attribute value 

where ''z'' is a [[data|datum]] at a particular location, ''h'' is the distance between ordered data, and ''n''(''h'') is the number of paired data at a distance of ''h''. The semivariance is half the variance of the increments &lt;math&gt;z(x_i+h)-z(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;, but the whole variance of z-values at given separation distance ''h'' (Bachmaier and Backes, 2008).

A plot of semivariances versus distances between ordered data in a graph is known as a [[semivariogram]] rather than a [[variogram]]. Many authors call &lt;math&gt;2\hat\gamma(h)&lt;/math&gt; a variogram, others use the terms variogram and semivariogram synonymously. However,  Bachmaier and Backes (2008), who discussed this confusion, have shown that &lt;math&gt;\hat\gamma(h)&lt;/math&gt; should be called a variogram, terms like semivariogram or semivariance should be avoided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5867">A '''tapestry lawn''' (also referred to as a grass-free lawn&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grassfreelawns.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[lawn]] format that has no grass component and is instead formed by using many different mowing tolerant plant species in combination. The overall visual effect of the many species of plant grown together is referred to as a tapestry. 
The format is based on research carried out at the [[University of Reading]]. Developed with temperate humid [[oceanic climate]] in mind, it applies ecological principals and horticultural practices to address some of the ecological and environmental issues associated with traditional grass lawns&lt;ref&gt;Peel, M.C., B.L. Finlayson, and T.A. McMahon, Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 2007. 11(5): p. 1633-1644.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, W., Balmori, D., Haeg, F.,, Edible Estates: Attack on the Front Lawn.2010: Metropolis Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borman, F.H., D. Balmori, and T.G. Geballe, Redesigning the American Lawn. A Search for Environmental Harmony. 2nd ed2001, New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The lawn-defining and traditional practice of [[mowing]] is the key management tool in tapestry lawns. The need for its application is reduced by up to two thirds compared to traditional mowing regimes &lt;ref&gt;Smith, L.S. and M.D.E. Fellowes, The grass-free lawn: management and species choice for optimum ground cover and plant diversity. Urban Forestry &amp; Urban Greening., 2014. 13: p. 433-442&lt;/ref&gt;  because of the absence of grasses [[(monocotyledons)]] and the growth patterns of [[forbs]] [[(dicotyledons)]][5]. A consequence of this is that greater numbers of both plant and insect species are able to inhabit the lawn.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, L.S., et al., Adding [[ecological]] value to the urban lawnscape. Insect abundance and diversity in grass-free lawns. Biodiversity and Conservation, 2014. 23: p. 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
In tapestry lawns mowing not only operates to maintain a low lawn-like aspect but it also repeatedly modulates the light environment and intentionally creates physical stress. The relatively taller plant species used gradually take more and more of the light as they grow, creating internal shade within the lawn and stressing the lower growing plants. When mowing is applied it removes the tall growth. This allows light to reach the light starved low growing plants and stresses the tall plants by reducing their size and [[photosynthetic]] area. The tall plants stop growing and use reserves of carbohydrates to repair the damage. Once the damage has been repaired, they begin to regrow from a reduced size plant. The low growing plants take advantage of the post-mowing window of opportunity to access light. In this way both low growing prostrate plants and the somewhat taller plants can be grown together.

==Plants==
[[File:Tapestry lawn mixed autumnal foliage.JPG|thumb|Tapestry lawn in autumn. Reading University.]]
[[File:Tapestry lawn freshly mown.JPG|thumb|Tapestry lawn freshly mown. Reading University.]]
Suitable plant species for the tapestry lawn tend to have origins in NW Europe but can include species from other temperate regions:
*''[[Acaena]] inermis	''
*''[[Achillea]] millefolium	''
*''[[Ajuga]] reptans	''
*''[[Bellis]] perennis''
*''[[Chamaemelum]] nobile	''
*''[[Glechoma]] hederacea	''
*''[[Leptinella]] dioica''	
*''[[Lobelia]] pedunculata''
*''[[Lysimachia]] nummularia''
*''[[Pilosella]] officinarum''
*''[[Ranunculus]] repens''
*''[[Trifolium]] repens''
*''[[Veronica chamaedrys]]''
*''[[Viola odorata]]''

The primary component species of tapestry lawns all show the capacity for clonal reproduction i.e. they can spread and reproduce through [[rhizomes]], [[stolons]], adventitious roots and other clonal methods. Other component species include those that are able to successfully set seed in a mown environment e.g. daisies (''Bellis perennis''). Non-clonal species and those that do not manage to set seed in a mown environment can also be used, although these may require replacement at the end of their natural lifespan.

Some of the plants used have a role in providing simple [[ground cover]] (''Leptinella'' sp) and evergreen cover in winter (''Ranunculus repens''). Some species can be [[herbaceous]] and give autumn foliage colour (''Argentina anserina''); some produce flowers and extend the floral season from spring to autumn (''Veronica chamaedrys'', ''Parochetus communis''). The use of cultivars brings foliage effects (''Ajuga reptans'' ‘Burgundy Glow’), and allows for lawn gardening – where plants are added and subtracted according to requirements.
A wide variety of plant species is used, with a minimum of twelve different species and no upper limit, since environmentally unsuitable species will soon die out.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, L.S. and M.D.E. Fellowes The influence of species number on productivity, ground coverage and floral performance in grass-free lawns. Landscape and Ecological Engineering., 2014. DOI: 10.1007/s11355-014-0264-9 DOI: 10.1007/s11355-014-0264-9.&lt;/ref&gt; When more species are used there is greater scope for aesthetic choices, extending floral period and resource opportunities for pollinating insects and less chance of any one species becoming dominant in the lawn.

==Creation==
Unlike traditional grass lawns that use seed mixes tapestry lawns are created by using individual plant species in either pots or trays that are then combined in a mosaic style at planting.[[File:Tapestry lawn recently planted.JPG|thumb|Recently planted tapestry lawn. Reading University.]]

[[File:Entrance of Tin Bigha Corridor (02).jpg|thumb|Entrance of Tin Bigha Corridor from Mainland Bangladesh.]]
The '''Tin''' (or '''Teen''') '''Bigha Corridor''' ({{lang-bn|তিনবিঘা করিডর}}) is a strip of land belonging to [[India]] on the [[West Bengal]]–[[Bangladesh]] border which, in September 2011, was leased to Bangladesh so that it can access its [[Dahagram–Angarpota]] enclaves. It is based at [[Patgram Upazila|Patgram upazila]] town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nenanews.com/NEE%20%20Sept.22%20-%20Oct.%206,%2003/Cover%20Story.htm Cover story]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Tin Bigha Corridor (তিনবিঘা করিডোর) 03.jpg|thumb|Road connecting Dahgram-Angarpota enclave with mainland Bangladesh.]]
[[File:Tin Bigha Corridor (তিনবিঘা করিডোর) 05.jpg|thumb|The border fence around Tin Bigha Corridor.]]
According to the Indira Gandhi-Sheikh Mujibur Rahman treaty of 16 May, 1974, India and Bangladesh were to hand over the sovereignty of the Tin Bigha Corridor ({{convert|178|x|85|m}}) and South Berubari ({{convert|7.39|km2|abbr=on}}) to each other, thereby allowing access to the Dahagram–Angarpota enclaves and the Indian enclaves adjacent to South Berubari.  Bangladesh did hand over the sovereignty of the smaller South Berubari to India instantly in 1974. India, however, could not transfer the Tin Bigha Corridor to Bangladesh as it required constitutional amendment which could not be done due to political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2009/09/24/79555.html|title=404 Not Found|work=thefinancialexpress-bd.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402040134/http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2009/09/24/79555.html|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Enclaves|title=Enclaves|work=banglapedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After much Bangladesh government protest, India, instead of handing over sovereignty in 2011, proposed to lease the Tin Bigha Corridor to Bangladesh for a certain time. South Berubari, meanwhile, would remain in the possession of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110907/jsp/siliguri/story_14473988.jsp|title=Berubari plea to PM for place on map|work=telegraphindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total area of South Berubari Union No. 12 is {{convert|22.58|km2|abbr=on}} of which {{convert|11.29|km2|abbr=on}} was to go to Bangladesh. The area of the four Cooch Behar enclaves which would also have to go to Bangladesh was {{convert|6.84|km2|abbr=on}} making the total area to be transferred {{convert|18.13|km2|abbr=on}}. The population of the area including the four enclaves to be transferred, as per 1967 data, was 90% Hindu. The Bangladesh enclaves, [[Dohogram|Dahagram]] and Angorpota, were to be transferred to India. Their total area was {{convert|18.68|km2|abbr=on}} and as per 1967 data more than 80% of their population was Muslim. If this exchange had gone through, it would have meant a change of nationality for the population or migration of the population from Dahagram and Angorpota and South Berubari Union No. 12 and consequent serious rehabilitation problems. There were in any case major agitations by the people of Berubari protesting against the transfer.

After 1971, India proposed to Bangladesh that India may continue to retain the southern half of South Berubari Union No. 12 and the adjacent enclaves and, in exchange, Dahagram and Angorpota may be retained by Bangladesh. As part of the package a strip of land would be leased in perpetuity by India to Bangladesh, giving her access to Dahagram &amp; Angorpota to enable her to exercise sovereignty on these two enclaves. This was accepted by Bangladesh as part of a carefully constructed Land Boundary Agreement signed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 16 May 1974. The Berubari dispute was thus finally resolved by Article 1.14 of the Agreement which stated:

"India will retain the southern half of South Berubari Union No. 12 and the adjacent enclaves, measuring an area of {{convert|2.64|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} approximately, and in exchange Bangladesh will retain the Dahagram and Angorpota enclaves. India will lease in perpetuity to Bangladesh an area of {{convert|178|x|85|m|abbr=out}} near 'Tin Bigha' to connect Dahagram with Panbari Mouza (P.S. Patgram) of Bangladesh."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcidhaka.org/tin_bigha.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Tin'' is the word for the numeral "three" in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and [[bigha]] is a unit of area ranging from {{convert|1500|to(-)|6,771|m2|abbr=on}}.

== Gameplay ==

[[Image:Virginia Gameplay Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Players experience the game from the first-person perspective. The game features a large cast of animated characters, such as the player's FBI partner Maria Halperin.|alt=A view of Virginia's non-playable character Maria Halperin, sat in a car with a packed lunch arranged on the dashboard.]]

''Virginia'' is a first-person mystery thriller adventure game that takes place in a fictionalised [[Virginia]] in 1992. Players take on the role of Anne Tarver, a graduate FBI special agent who is assigned a partner, special agent Maria  Halperin.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.505games.com/games/virginia|title=Virginia - 505 Games|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924132639/http://www.505games.com/games/virginia|archive-date=2016-09-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the game involves the player, as Tarver, in the company of the [[Non-player character|non-playable]] Halperin, travelling between locations, interacting with other characters and with objects in the environments. Scenes transition using real-time [[Film editing|cinematic editing]], with [[Cut (editing)|cuts]] and [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]] occurring as dictated by the story, to propel events forward and to juxtapose moments for dramatic effect.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-08-25-virginia-one-of-2016s-most-promising-games-is-coming-to-xbox-one-ps4-and-pc-next-month|title=Virginia, one of 2016's most promising games, is coming to Xbox One, PS4 and PC next month|last=Robinson|first=Martin|date=2016-08-25|website=Eurogamer|language=en-UK|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premise ==
Set in the last days of summer 1992, players investigate the disappearance of Lucas Fairfax, a young boy from the fictional rural town of Kingdom, [[Virginia|VA]]. The game is experienced through the eyes of Anne Tarver, a graduate FBI special agent assigned to her first case. As a rookie detective, she's paired with an experienced partner, Maria Halperin, whom Tarver's superiors instruct to keep a watchful eye on. As the story progresses, the pair's trust in each other is tested, and their investigation takes a supernatural turn.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Development ==
''Virginia'' is the first game developed by Variable State, a British [[Independent video game development|independent game developer]] founded by Jonathan Burroughs and Terry Kenny, former developers with [[Google DeepMind|DeepMind Technologies]]. Lyndon Holland joined the project early in development in the role of [[composer]] and [[sound design]]er and is responsible for creating the entirety of the game's music and [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]]. ''Virginia'' is developed in the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] [[game engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://madewith.unity.com/games/virginia|title=Virginia {{!}} Made with Unity|website=Made with Unity|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variable State is a virtual studio, with all of the team [[Telecommuting|working remotely]] and coordinating each morning over [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/interview/this-is-the-indie-developer-narrative-no-one-talks-about-in-conversation-with-variable-state/0221287|title='This is the indie developer narrative no one talks about': In conversation with Variable State|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon forming Variable State, Burroughs and Kenny initially pursued a range of game ideas, but met with frustration, deeming early concepts to be too ambitious. Progress resumed after the developers played [[Blendo Games|Brendon Chung]]'s ''[[Thirty Flights of Loving]]'' for the first time and found themselves inspired by its creative use of [[Cut (transition)|cinematic editing]] in the context of real-time [[gameplay]]. In combination the team's shared interest in American television and films of the 1990s, in particular [[Film noir|FBI noir]] productions such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'', this gave the developers a stepping off point from which they could fashion an original story.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/07/08/a-mysterious-state-of-mind-virginia-interview/|title=A Mysterious State Of Mind: Virginia Interview|last=Smith|first=Adam|date=2014-07-08|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers took the unusual decision to omit dialogue from the game. This was due to the Burroughs' and Kenny's desire to keep the team small and agile and keep the focus on the cinematic editing, a technique that would require experimentation to get right. Spoken dialogue was perceived to be risky because of how many factors were involved in achieving quality; the writing, the choice of actors, the performance and the dialogue systems themselves. Instead of dialogue, ''Virginia'' conveys its story through the physical performances of its large cast of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/21/12248532/virginia-game-variable-state-interview|title=How Virginia uses the language of film to tell a different kind of video game story|last=Webster|first=Andrew|date=2016-07-21|website=The Verge|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nouse.co.uk/2015/09/29/a-variable-state-of-mind/|title=A Variable State of mind|last=Koper|first=Adam|date=2015-09-29|website=Nouse|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large animation workload required Variable State engage the help of Niamh Herrity and Aoife Doyle, Irish animators who run Pink Kong Studios animation company.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-06-10-virginia-territory-variable-states-indie-debut|title=Virginia Territory: Variable State's indie debut|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During development, Variable State expanded the ''Virginia'' development team to include programmer Kieran Keegan, the lead programmer on ''[[Kitty Powers' Matchmaker]]''. Additional contributors included technical artist Matt Wilde, 3D artist Stephen Brown and animators Abby Roebuck, Steve James Brown and Mikael Persson. 3D artist Wayne Peters assisted in an outsourcing capacity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pegbar.ie/site/index.php/variable-state-is-looking-for-an-ireland-or-uk-based-contract-animator-to-work-on-virginia/|title=Variable State is looking for an Ireland or UK based contract animator to work on Virginia {{!}} Pegbar|website=pegbar.ie|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed 27 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' awarded it 5 stars, saying "It is the game that titles like ''[[Dear Esther]]'', ''[[Gone Home]]'' and ''[[Firewatch]]'' have hinted at, but in a way that evolves the interactive narrative form way beyond anything we’ve seen before."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/what-to-play/virginia-review--the-x-files-meets-twin-peaks-in-a-remarkable-in/|title=Virginia review -The X-Files meets Twin Peaks in a remarkable interactive thriller|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] awarded it 4.5/5, saying "what gorgeous, reverberant moments there are in this game, empowered by its absent words and explanations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4498103/virginia-review-pc-xbox/|title=Review: If You Love David Lynch You Have to Play 'Virginia'|last=Peckham|first=Matt|website=TIME.com|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Game Informer]] awarded it a score of 9.25/10, saying "''Virginia'' is a taut thriller that strikes a fine balance between storytelling and interactivity in a way that narrative-driven first-person adventure games have not accomplished since their inception."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/virginia/b/playstation4/archive/2016/09/22/game-informer-virginia-review.aspx|title=Virginia Review – An Elegant And Riveting Thriller|website=Game Informer|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC Gamer]] awarded it a score of 72%, saying "A slick cinematic thriller, but interaction is limited and the story loses focus in the final act."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Andy, 22 September 2016, "Virginia Review" (http://www.pcgamer.com/virginia-review/).
