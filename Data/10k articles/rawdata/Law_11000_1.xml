The '''Civil Rights Act of 1960''' ({{USStatute|86|449|74|89|1960|05|06}}) is a [[United States federal law]] that established federal inspection of local [[voter registration]] polls and introduced penalties for anyone who obstructed someone's attempt to register to [[vote]]. It was designed to deal with discriminatory laws and practices in the segregated [[Southern United States|South]], by which blacks and Mexican Texans had been effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] since the late 19th and start of the 20th century. It extended the life of the [[Civil Rights Commission]], previously limited to two years, to oversee registration and voting practices. The act was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and served to eliminate certain loopholes left by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=11771 |title= Dwight D. Eisenhower: "Statement by the President Upon Signing the Civil Rights Act of 1960," May 6, 1960 |author1=Peters, Gerhart |accessdate= 21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
By the late 1950s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] had been pressuring [[United States Congress|Congress]] to enact [[Civil Rights Act (disambiguation)|legislation]] to protect the constitutional civil rights of [[African Americans]]. The first major piece of civil rights legislation passed by Congress was the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]]. While enforcing the [[voting rights]] of African Americans set out in the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]], the act had several loopholes. Southern states continued to discriminate against African Americans in application of voter registration and electoral laws, in segregation of school and public facilities, and in employment.

The new legislation was proposed by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in his message to the [[86th Congress]] on February 5, 1959, when he stated "that every individual regardless of his race, religion, or national origin is entitled to the equal protection of the laws."

===Eisenhower's mandate===
[[File:Eisenhower in the Oval Office.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenhower in the Oval Office]]
Toward the end of his presidency, President Eisenhower supported civil rights legislation. In his message to [[United States Congress|Congress]], he proposed seven recommendations for the protection of civil rights:
*Strengthen the laws that would root out threats to obstruct court orders in school [[desegregation]] cases
*Provide more investigative authority to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in crimes involving the destruction of schools/churches
*Grant [[Attorney General]] power to investigate Federal election records
*Provide temporary program for aid to agencies to assist changes necessary for school [[desegregation]] decisions
*Authorize provision of education for children of the [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces]]
*Consider establishing a statutory Commission on Equal Job Opportunity Under Government Contracts (later mandated in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to create the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]])
*Extend the Civil Rights Commission an additional two years&lt;ref name=Schwartz1970&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Bernard ed. |title=Statutory History of the United States |year=1970 |publisher=Chelsea House |isbn=0-07-055681-4 |pages=933–1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passage in the House of Representatives===
The bill, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131111052024/https://bulk.resource.org/gao.gov/86-449/000044B1.pdf H.R. 8601], began in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] under jurisdiction of the [[House Judiciary Committee]]. The chairman of the committee, Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]] of New York, was known to be a firm supporter of the civil rights movement. The bill was easily approved by the Judiciary Committee, but the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]] attacked the Judiciary Committee to prevent the bill coming to the floor of the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="Berman1966"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Daniel Marvin|title=A Bill Becomes a Law: Congress Enacts Civil Rights Legislation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bxVAAAAYAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced to the House on March 10, 1960.

The "voter referees" plan was part of a House amendment to the original bill to substitute Representative [[Robert Kastenmeier]]'s "enrollment officers" plan. After several amendments, the House of Representatives approved the bill on March 24, 1960 by a vote of 311-109.&lt;ref name=Schwartz1970 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 8601|url=http://bulk.resource.org/gao.gov/86-449/000044B1.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111052024/https://bulk.resource.org/gao.gov/86-449/000044B1.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 179 Democrats and 132 Republicans voted Aye. 93 Democrats, 15 Republicans, and 1 Independent Democrat voted Nay. 2 Democrats and 1 Republican voted present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 8601|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/86-1960/h102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passage in the Senate===
The Senate's [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]] also faced attempts to dislodge the bill. Southern  [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] had long acted as a voting bloc to resist or reject legislation to enforce constitutional rights in [[Southern United States|the South]] and made it difficult for proponents of civil rights to add strengthening amendments.&lt;ref name="Berman1966" /&gt; After amendments in the Senate, H.R. 8601 was approved by the Senate on April 8, 1960 by a vote of 71-18.

The House of Representatives approved the Senate amendments on April 21, 1960 by a vote of 288-95 {{dubious|date=December 2015}} and the bill was signed into law by President Eisenhower on May 6, 1960.&lt;ref name=Schwartz1970 /&gt; No Republican Senators voted [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/86-1960/s284 against the Bill].

==Content of the Act==

===Title I===
Title I which amended Chapter 17 of title 18 of the United States Code, {{usc|18|1509}}, outlawed obstruction of court orders. If convicted, one could be fined no more than $1,000 and/or imprisoned for no more than one year.&lt;ref name=Ashbrook&gt;{{cite web |title=Civil Rights Act of 1960 |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/civil-rights-act-of-1960/ |publisher=Ashbrook Center, Ashland University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title II===
Title II outlawed fleeing a state for damaging or destroying a building or property, illegal possession or use of [[explosives]], and threats or false threats to damage property using fire or explosives.

Section 201 amended Chapter 49 of title 18 ({{usc|18|1074}}). The amendment outlaws interstate or international movement to avoid prosecution for damaging or destroying any building or structure. The section also outlaws flight to avoid testimony in a case relating to such an offense. If convicted, one could be fined no more than $5,000 and/or imprisoned for no more than five years.

Section 203 amended Chapter 39 of title 18 ({{usc|18|837}}). The amendment dealt with the illegal use or possession of explosives. The section outlaws transportation or possession of any explosive with intent to damage a building or property. The section also makes the conveying of false information or threats to damage or destroy any building or property illegal.&lt;ref name=Ashbrook /&gt;

===Title III===
Title III focused on federal election records.

Section 301 calls for the preservation of all election records and papers which come into an officer or custodian's possession relating to [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other act regarding voting in an election (except [[Puerto Rico]]). If an officer fails to comply, he/she could be fined no more than $1,000 and/or imprisoned for no more than one year. Section 302 declares that any person that intentionally alters, damages, or destroys a record shall be fined no more than $1,000 and/or imprisoned for no more than one year. Section 304 establishes that no person shall disclose any election record. Section 306 defines the term "officer of election".&lt;ref name=Ashbrook /&gt;

===Title IV===
Title IV extended the powers of the [[Civil Rights Commission]].

Section 401 of Title IV amended Section 105 of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] ({{USStat|71|635}}) declaring that "each member of the Commission shall have the power and authority to administer oaths or take statements of witnesses under affirmation."&lt;ref name=Ashbrook /&gt;

===Title V===
Title V arranged for the provision of free education for children of members of the armed forces.&lt;ref name=Ashbrook /&gt;

===Title VI===
Title VI amended section 131 of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] ({{USStat|71|637}}) to address the issue of depriving [[African-Americans]] the right to vote.

Section 601 declares that those given the legal [[right to vote]] shall not be deprived of that right on account of race or color. Any person denying that right shall "constitute contempt of court."&lt;ref name=Ashbrook /&gt;  The section also states that the courts can appoint "voting referees" to report to the court their findings of voting infringement. The section also defines the word "vote" as the entire process of making a vote effective--[[voter registration|registration]], casting a ballot, and having that ballot counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before the Voting Rights Act|url=http://epic.org/privacy/voting/register/intro_a.html|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title VII===
Title VII established the separability of the act, affirming that the rest of the act shall go unaffected if one provision is found invalid.&lt;ref name=Ashbrook /&gt;

==Subsequent history==
After the subsequent intensive acts of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1965|1965]], the act of [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957]] and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 were deemed ineffective for the firm establishment of civil rights. The later legislation had firmer ground for the enforcement and protection of a variety of civil rights, where the acts of 1957 and 1960 were largely limited to voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bardolph|first=Richard|title=The Civil Rights Record: Black Americans and the Law, 1849-1970|year=1970|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Company, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-690-19448-X|pages=311, 352–3, 395, 403–5, 493, 495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Rights Act of 1960 dealt with race and color but omitted coverage of those discriminated against for national origin, although Eisenhower had called for it in his message to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perea|first=Juan F.|title=Ethnicity and Prejudice: Reevaluating "National Origin" Discrimination Under Title VII|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1796&amp;context=wmlr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fsa%3Dt%26rct%3Dj%26q%3Dspecial%2Bmessage%2Bto%2Bcongress%2Bby%2Bthe%2Bpresident%2Bfebruary%2B5%252C%2B1960%26source%3Dweb%26cd%3D2%26ved%3D0CCwQFjAB%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fscholarship.law.wm.edu%252Fcgi%252Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1796%2526context%253Dwmlr%26ei%3DyxJoT6L8HIfy0gHnqe2XCQ%26usg%3DAFQjCNGeNOelyTo-31ksbPU0iWw4tN-t4w#search=%22special%20message%20congress%20by%20president%20february%205%2C%201960%22|publisher=William and Mary Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 worked to fulfill the seven goals suggested by President Eisenhower in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964|url=http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_CivilRightsAct_1964.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting Rights Act of 1965|url=http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two satisfied proponents of the civil rights movement to end [[racial discrimination]] and protect legal equality in the United States.

'''Contract Lifecycle Management''' (CLM) is the proactive, methodical management of a [[contract]] from initiation through award, compliance and renewal. Implementing CLM can lead to significant improvements in cost savings and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Benefits of Contract Lifecycle Management/CLM|url=http://www.villanovau.com/contract-lifecycle-management-benefits/|publisher=Villanova University|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding and [[contract management software|automating CLM]] can also limit organizational liability and increase compliance with legal requirements.

The key steps in the Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Contract Lifecycle Management/CLM?|url=http://exari.com/contract-lifecycle-management.html|publisher=Exari Systems|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) '''[[Automatic identification and data capture|Capture]]:''' Step #1 for most people is to get all of their existing paper contracts in a central visible place. If you have no clear idea what contracts you have, then you have no idea what your potential risk exposure is.  The next step is to capture the data from the contracts.

2) '''[[Records management|Track]]:''' Once you know where all your contracts are, the next step is to track any important data so you don’t miss any milestone. This affects both old contracts and newly signed contracts.

3) '''Author:''' With tracking in place, the focus can shift to accelerating the new contract creation process. The “authoring” process is about setting up contract templates and clause libraries to empower business users and legal users, respectively, to create new contracts in a fast but controlled fashion.

4) '''Create:''' [[Contract creation]] has two tracks. First, empowering business users with [[self-service]], wizard-based creation using intelligent templates pre-approved by legal.  Second, making life easier for legal when drafting complex deals on your own paper, or reviewing and “patching” contracts negotiated on other people’s paper.

5) '''Approve:'''  Companies need an approval [[workflow]] process to ensure that risky contracts are reviewed and approved by the right person. Some risks need to be approved by legal, some by management, some by special departments like credit, etc. Ideally, safe deals are pre-approved.

6) '''Negotiate:''' The needs of the typical negotiator include: a checklist of issues for each type of deal;  a way of marking up the paper to highlight how it’s different from the original or the last draft; and a way of capturing and flagging those differences (if possible).

7) '''[[Digital signature|Sign]]:''' When the contract is final and agreed it needs to be signed by all relevant people, and the signed copies need to be stored. Someone also needs to validate that the final signed version was not modified in any way after execution copies were sent out.

8) '''Analyze:'''  [[Business|Enterprises]] with 100+ contracts need to analyze those contracts for potential risks, rights &amp; obligations. Executives, [[Legal &amp; Risk]] need scanned reports to manage common risks, and ad hoc reports for unexpected scenarios. “Fingertip access” to contract terms and data allows people to react quickly to new scenarios and deal with time-sensitive risks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1121">A '''contract price''' is the price listed in the contract for the good or services to be received in return.

==Contract law==
===Common law===
In contract law the contract price is a [[Contract#Uncertainty, incompleteness and severance|material term]].  The contract price is the price for the goods or services to be received in the contract. The contract price helps to  determine whether a contract may exist.  If the contract price is not included in the written contract, then upon litigation the court may hold that a contract did not exist.

In litigation, the contract price is a factor for determining [[damages]] upon a party forsaking its contractual obligations.  The contract price as a point of reference may help determine the [[Expectation damages|expectancy interest]] of the party suffering damages as well as the [[Reliance damages|reliance interest]] along with damages under [[Estoppel#Promissory estoppel|promissory estoppel]].

[[File:JFK closeup.jpg|thumb|On Nov. 2, 1961, President John F. Kennedy and the governors of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York signed the Delaware River Basin Compact at ceremony in the White House's Oval Office. This created the Delaware River Basin Commission.]]
The '''Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC)''' is a [[United States]] [[government agency]] created in 1961 by an [[interstate compact]], signed into law by President [[John F. Kennedy]], between four states ([[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]).

==Purpose and activities==
[[File:Delaware river basin map.png|thumb|Delaware River watershed]]
The purpose of the Commission is to bring the [[Delaware River]] under collective and balanced control, and to ensure fair usage by the states.  To this end, the Commission conducts programs related to [[water quality]] protection, [[water supply]] allocation and [[water conservation]], [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory review]] and permitting, [[Drainage basin|watershed]] planning, [[drought]] management, [[flood mitigation]] and loss reduction, and recreational activities (such as [[fishing]]).

The DRBC was one of the first government agencies in the United States to address the problem of [[water pollution]].  The agency predates the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.gov/drbc/about/accomplishments.html DRBC Milestones and Accomplishments]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domain hijacking''' or '''domain theft''' is the act of changing the registration of a [[domain name]] without the permission of its original registrant, or by abuse of privileges on domain hosting and registrar(s) software systems.

This can be devastating to the original domain name holder, not only financially as they may have derived commercial income from a website hosted at the domain or conducted business through that domain's e-mail accounts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Ruth|title=Cybercriminals Are Misappropriating Businesses’ Web Addresses As a Result, Customers Can’t Find the Real Companies on the Web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/now-cybercriminals-are-misappropriating-businesses-web-addresses-1426120840|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but also in terms of readership and/or audience for non-profit or artistic web addresses. After a successful hijacking, the hijacker can use the domain name to facilitate other illegal activity such as [[phishing]], where a website is replaced by an identical website that records private information such as log-in passwords, [[Email spam|spam]], or even distribution of [[malware]], causing additional damage to third-parties to the wrongful loss and wrongful gain of the domain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weslow|first1=David|title=Dealing with cybersquatting: the wisdom of thinking ahead|url=http://www.trademarksandbrandsonline.com/article/dealing-with-cybersquatting-the-wisdom-of-thinking-ahead|website=TBO: Trademarks &amp; Brands Online|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Domain hijacking can be done in several ways, generally by unauthorized access to, or exploiting a vulnerability in the domain name registrar's system, through [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], or getting into the domain owner's email account that is associated with the domain name registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLBR Featured Segment: David Weslow on Domain Theft|url=https://cyberlawradio.wordpress.com/2015/07/01/clbr-featured-segment-david-weslow-on-domain-theft/|website=Cyber Law Radio|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A frequent tactic used by domain hijackers is to use acquired personal information about the actual domain owner to impersonate them and persuade the domain [[Domain name registry|registrar]] to modify the registration information and/or transfer the domain to another registrar, a form of [[identity theft]]. Once this has been done, the hijacker has full control of the domain and can use it or sell it to a third party.

Other methods include email vulnerability, vulnerability at the domain-registration level, keyloggers,  and phishing sites.&lt;ref name="aplegal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aplegal.com/blog/slamming-door-domain-name-hijacking/|title=Domain Name Hijacking|date=31 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to discovered hijackings vary; sometimes the registration information can be returned to its original state by the current registrar, but this may be more difficult if the domain name was transferred to another registrar, particularly if that registrar resides in another country. If the stolen domain name has been transferred to another registrar, the losing registrar may invoke ICANN’s Registrar Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy to seek the return of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registrar Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy|url=https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tdrp-2012-02-25-en|website=ICANN|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases the losing registrar for the domain name is not able to regain control over the domain, and the domain name owner may need to pursue legal action to obtain the court ordered return of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Domain name theft: Knowing where to turn|url=http://www.trademarksandbrandsonline.com/article/domain-name-theft-knowing-where-to-turn|website=TBO: Trademarks &amp; Brands Online|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;In some jurisdictions, police may arrest cybercriminals involved, or prosecutors may file indict.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090804/0217125767.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the legal status of domain hijacking was formerly thought to be unclear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Gerry|title=When Hackers Steal A Web Address, Few Owners Ever Get It Back|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/29/domain-theft_n_5877510.html|website=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; certain U.S. federal courts in particular have begun to accept causes of action seeking the return of stolen domain names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkens|first1=Michael|title=Wiley Rein Files Suit Over 14 Stolen Domain Names: 9 Are 3 Letter .com’s|url=http://www.thedomains.com/2014/10/23/wiley-rein-files-suit-over-14-stolen-domain-names-9-are-3-letter-coms/|website=The Domains}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain hijacking is analogous with theft, in that the original owner is deprived of the benefits of the domain, but [[theft]] traditionally relates to concrete goods such as jewelry and electronics, whereas domain name ownership is stored only in the digital state of the domain name registry, a network of computers. For this reason, court actions seeking the recovery of stolen domain names are most frequently filed in the location of the relevant domain registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allemann|first1=Andrew|title=Lawsuit filed to recover stolen three letter domain names|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2014/10/23/lawsuit-filed-to-recover-stolen-three-letter-domain-names/|website=Domain Name Wire|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, victims have pursued recovery of stolen domain names through ICANN's ([[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP), but a number of UDRP panels have ruled that the policy is not appropriate for cases involving domain theft. Additionally, police may arrest cybercriminals involved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090804/0217125767.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2008/d2008-1141.html|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=D2010-1661|website=WIPO: World Intellectual Property Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mascot Media Circle, LLC dba OnlineMBA v.

==Notable cases==
* During the original "[[dot com boom]]", there was extensive media coverage of the hijacking of "sex.com".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnet.com/news/sex-com-domain-hijacker-captured/&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2015 Lenovo’s website and Google’s main search page for Vietnam were briefly hijacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirk |first1=Jeremy |title=Lenovo, Google websites hijacked by DNS attacks |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2889392/like-google-in-vietnam-lenovo-tripped-up-by-a-dns-attack.html |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=PC World |date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
ICANN imposes a 60-day waiting period between a change in registration information and a transfer to another registrar. This is intended to make domain hijacking more difficult, since a transferred domain is much more difficult to reclaim, and it is more likely that the original registrant will discover the change in that period and alert the registrar. [[Extensible Provisioning Protocol]] is used for many [[Top-level domain|TLD]] registries, and uses an authorization code issued exclusively to the domain registrant as a security measure to prevent unauthorized transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers|title=DOMAIN NAME HIJACKING:  INCIDENTS, THREATS, RISKS, AND REMEDIAL ACTIONS|url=http://archive.icann.org/en/announcements/hijacking-report-12jul05.pdf|accessdate=17 October 2014|date=15 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are certain steps that a domain-name owner can take to reduce the exposure to domain name hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cyger|first1=Michael|title=Help! My Domain Name Was Stolen (And 3 Ways to Recover It) – With David Weslow|url=http://www.domainsherpa.com/david-weslow-stolen-domains/|website=Domain Sherpa|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following suggestions may prevent an unwanted domain transfer:

* Use strong email passwords and enable two-factor authentication if available.
* Disable POP if your email provider is able to use a different protocol.
* Tick the setting "always use https" under email options.
* Frequently check the "unusual activity" flag if provided by your email service.
* Use a two-step (two-factor) authentication if available.
* Make sure to renew your domain registration in a timely manner—with timely payments and register them for at least five (5) years.
* Use a domain-name registrar that offers enhanced transfer protection, i.e., “domain locking” and even consider paying for registry locking.
* Makes sure your WHOIS information is up-to-date and really points to you and you only.
* If you have 2500 or more domain names consider buying your own registrar.
* Relief via the Inter-Registrar Dispute Process&lt;ref name="aplegal.com"/&gt;

The proponents of the bill generally held that such a law was required to prevent wealthy private parties from "buying elections" anonymously via advertising campaigns or other financially costly lobbying, while opponents considered it a serious restriction of [[civil liberties]], and further regarded spending private money on political campaigning as a [[democracy | democratic]] right.

The Act amended numerous areas of New Zealand electoral law, but was repealed on 17 February 2009. Principally and most controversially it regulated "third party" election campaigns&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10457070&amp;pnum=0|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=11 August 2007|title=Electoral bill no one wants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third party campaigns ===

The Act made it illegal for anyone to spend more than NZ$12,000 criticising or supporting a political party or taking a position on any political matter, or more than NZ$1,000 criticising or supporting an individual member of parliament, without first registering with a state agency, the Electoral Commission.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt;

The Bill as introduced required that unregistered third parties file statutory declarations before publishing election advertisements.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt;

The Bill originally limited the spending of registered third parties on political advertising to $60,000,&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt; but this was later increased to $120,000 by the Select Committee.

The regulation of third parties also extends to their finances. The Act requires that third parties disclose all donations they receive over $5000. Anonymous donations that third parties receive over this level must be given to the State.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt;

=== Regulated period ===

The Act extends the "regulated period" for election campaigning from the previous 90-day period to the period starting on 1 January of election year – from three months to around ten, depending on the timing of the election. During this period electoral advertising by candidates, political parties and third parties must follow election rules, and spending limits apply.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt;

== Controversy ==

The [[Coalition for Open Government]], a group that advocates the reform of election finance law in New Zealand, opposed parts of the Bill, particularly the failure of the Bill to ban secret donations to political parties, given the strong financial disclosure requirements placed on third parties.&lt;ref name="cog_newswire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.co.nz/main/viewstory.aspx?storyid=384166&amp;catid=32|publisher=Newswire|date=24 July 2007|title=Lobby Groups Unhappy With Electoral Finance Bill}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad definition of "election advertisement" came in for particular criticism. Critics, including the [[New Zealand Law Society]], Catholic charity [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]], and the Royal New Zealand Forest and Bird Society argued the definition will catch not just electoral speech, but almost all political speech – including things like placards at protest marches.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt;

The parliamentary opposition, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], also opposed the Bill. Political commentator Matthew Hooton argued that the Bill should not proceed, and that the [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]] was a "danger to democracy".&lt;ref name="Matthew_Hooton" /&gt; On 6 October 2007 the Free Speech Coalition was formed by prominent right-wing bloggers [[David Farrar (New Zealand)|David Farrar]] and [[Cameron Slater]], and [[Bernard Darnton]], leader of the [[Libertarianz]] Party, to oppose the Bill.&lt;ref name="freespeech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killthebill.org.nz/?q=node/164|title=Kill the Bill: Kill The Bill Campaign Launched!!|date=6 October 2007|author=Free Speech Coalition|accessdate=2007-10-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231045238/http://www.killthebill.org.nz/?q=node%2F164|archivedate=31 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Zealand Anti-Vivisection Society]] and [[NORML New Zealand]], and the [[Direct Democracy Party of New Zealand]] also opposed the Bill. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Criticism has also been made over the process that led to the Bill's introduction, which involved discussions only with the Labour Government's supporting parties and not the Opposition.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Claire Trevitt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=1501118&amp;objectid=10466413&amp;pnum=0|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=28 September 2007|title=Electoral bill 'backward step' – Law Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentator [[Chris Trotter]] had harsh criticism of the detractors of the Act in several opinion pieces in ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]''. On 17 August he wrote 
: "let's just take a deep breath and examine the rules that govern election spending in Britain and Canada (countries which, the last time I looked, were still counted among the world's leading democracies). In Britain, "third party" expenditure is capped at 5 per cent of the expenditure authorised for political parties in the 12 months prior to polling day.

: In Canada the figure is 1 per cent, but applies only to the period of official campaigning. (Mr Burton is proposing a cap of 2.5 per cent or $60,000 for 10 months.) In both Britain and Canada, third parties are required to register with the official electoral regulators; both countries also restrict the contributions of foreign donors to third parties; and both require the identity of third party donors to be made public. That is how modern democracies conduct themselves.

: But, in New Zealand, it is still acceptable (at least to the National Party) for those with the most money to have the most say."

=== Protests ===

{{wikinews|Protesters march for free speech in New Zealand}}
On 17 November 2007 a protest in Auckland against the Bill, organised by [[John Boscawen]], drew over 2,000 protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10476727|title=Protest against Electoral Finance Bill|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=18 November 2007|author=Rebecca Lewis|accessdate=2007-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second Auckland protest, on 1 December 2007, drew a crowd of around 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=1501118&amp;objectid=10479722|title=Protestors send a strong message|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=3 December 2007|author=|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller protests were held in Wellington and Christchurch.

== Parliamentary process ==

=== Introduction ===

The Bill was introduced on 23 July 2007 by [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|Minister of Justice]] [[Mark Burton]], who said at its introduction "The package of reforms introduced to Parliament will help promote participation in parliamentary democracy, and aims to clean up New Zealand's electoral system and protect it from abuse."&lt;ref name="beehive_introduced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0707/S00377.htm|title=Electoral finance changes announced|author=Hon. Mark Burton|publisher=New Zealand Government|date=23 July 2007|accessdate=2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bill of Rights ===

Under section 7 of the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]], the [[Attorney-General (New Zealand)|Attorney-General]] must advise Parliament at the introduction of a bill if that bill is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. The [[Crown Law Office (New Zealand)|Crown Law Office]], which undertook the review, concluded that the Bill was consistent with the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name="bora_report"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Crown Law Office]]|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/bill-of-rights/bill-list-2007/e-bill/electoral-finance-bill.html|title=Electoral Finance Bill: Consistency with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|date=26 June 2007|accessdate=2007-06-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012034000/http://www.justice.govt.nz/bill-of-rights/bill-list-2007/e-bill/electoral-finance-bill.html|archivedate=12 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Business Review]] described Crown Law's opinion as "...one of the worst, most politically expedient calls on New Zealand human rights legislation in memory."&lt;ref name="nbr_report"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[National Business Review]]|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/home/column_article.asp?id=19184&amp;cid=15&amp;cname=Politics|title=Crony Watch special: the Sims|date=4 October 2007|accessdate=2007-06-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011024310/http://www.nbr.co.nz/home/column_article.asp?id=19184&amp;cid=15&amp;cname=Politics|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First reading ===

The Bill passed its first reading on 27 July by 65 votes to 54, with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]], [[New Zealand First|NZ First]], [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]] and [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive]] voting in favour, and the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], [[Māori Party]] and independents [[Gordon Copeland]] and [[Taito Phillip Field]] voting against. [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] did not vote. The legislation was sent to the Justice and Electoral Committee for consideration, with agreement from MPs to extend the membership of the committee for consideration of the Bill to include members from almost all Parliamentary parties. The Committee's report on the Bill was due by 25 January 2008.

=== Select Committee ===

Public submissions on the Bill closed on 7 September 2007. [[Radio New Zealand]] reported on 31 August that the Government had indicated it might write to the Committee indicating that it intended to make unspecified changes to the parts of the legislation dealing with third parties. This would have prevented the Committee from hearing criticism of the existing provisions and allow the Government to introduce changes during the Committee of the Whole House without the public being able to make submissions on the new provisions.&lt;ref name="Brent Edwards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/national/mnr/strong_reservations_over_electoral_finance_bill|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=31 August 2007|title=Strong Reservations Over Electoral Finance Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] denied this.&lt;ref name="Helen Clark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10461538|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=4 September 2007|title=Government open to suggestions for electoral finance reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative journalist [[Nicky Hager]], author of [[The Hollow Men (book)|The Hollow Men]], submitted in favour of the need for changes to New Zealand electoral law.&lt;ref name="hager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4208841a6160.html|publisher=[[NZPA]]|title=MPs told bill would not stop Brethren campaigns|date=20 September 2007|accessdate=2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Zealand Law Society]],&lt;ref name="nzls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/36EEA306-2451-4246-876E-F43BA991E0DC/65710/NewZealandLawSociety1.pdf|publisher=New Zealand Law Society|title=Submission to the Justice and Electoral Committee on the Electoral Finance Bill|date=4 September 2007|accessdate=2007-07-10|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Zealand Human Rights Commission]] submitted against the Bill.

The [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] reported the Bill to the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 18 November 2007, and recommended that the Bill proceed.&lt;ref name="report_sc"&gt;{{cite web

[[Annette King]], who became Minister of Justice following a Cabinet reshuffle on 31 October 2007,
&lt;ref name="reshuffleOct07"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New Zealand Government|date=31 October 2007|title=Ministerial List for Announcement on 31 October 2007|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/Ministerial%20List.DOC|format=DOC|accessdate=2007-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195125/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/Documents/Files/Ministerial%20List.DOC|archive-date=1 October 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced a number of changes to the Bill.&lt;ref name="nzh_changes"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/feature/story.cfm?c_id=1501118&amp;objectid=10476929|title=Revamp of finance bill removes 'unintended consequences'|date=19 November 2007|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes included:
* Increasing the cap on total third party spending from $60,000 to $120,000;
* Increasing the cap on election advertising before they have to register under the new law from $5,000 to $12,000;
* Changing the definition of election advertising;
* Increasing the corruption penalties to $100,000 fine.

=== Second Reading ===

The Bill was put to a second reading vote on 22 November 2007.&lt;ref name="report_sc" /&gt; It passed by 65 votes to 54, with Labour, New Zealand First, the Greens, United Future, and the Progressive Party supporting it. National, ACT, the Māori Party, and independents Gordon Copeland and Taito Phillip Field voted against it, the Māori party voting two of its four votes in favour.&lt;ref name="second_vote_ZB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=127976|title=Electoral Finance Bill passes 2nd reading|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=2007-12-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231073614/http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/newsdetail1.asp?storyID=127976|archivedate=31 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal Assent and eventual repeal ==

The [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] signed the Act into law on 19 December 2007.&lt;ref name="parl_act" /&gt;
The Electoral Finance Act was repealed on 17 February 2009 by a vote in Parliament of 112 to 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/electoral-finance-act-repealed-2491786|title=Electoral Finance Act repealed|date=17 February 2009|publisher=[[Television New Zealand]]|accessdate=2009-05-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617043130/http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/electoral-finance-act-repealed-2491786|archivedate=17 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Party was the only Party opposing the repeal, saying it should stay in force until a replacement Bill was prepared. Justice Minister Simon Power said during debate on the repeal bill that all parties in Parliament had agreed to take part in consultations to draft replacement electoral law. Until that happens, the 1993 Electoral Act will be in force with clauses of the EFA dealing with donation disclosure inserted.

Newdow|volume=542|page=1|pin=|year=2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lawsuit]], originally filed as '''''Newdow v. United States Congress, Elk Grove Unified School District, et al.''''' in 2000, led to a 2002 ruling by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] that the words "under [[God]]" in the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] are an endorsement of [[religion]] and therefore violate the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].

On June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court held [[Michael Newdow]], as a [[noncustodial parent]], did not have [[standing (law)|standing]] to bring the suit on his daughter's behalf. The mother was previously given sole legal custody of the daughter. The Ninth Circuit's decision was thus reversed as a matter of procedural law, so it did not consider the constitutional question raised by the case.

On January 3, 2005, a new suit was filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California]] on behalf of three unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge [[Lawrence Karlton]] ruled in favor of Newdow. Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Karlton issued an order enjoining the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in pledging allegiance to "one Nation under God."&lt;ref name=Kraveats2005&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chicagodefender.com/page/religion.cfm?ArticleID=2273 |title=Federal judge rules Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional |author=David Kravets |date=September 16, 2005 |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111132924/http://www.chicagodefender.com/page/religion.cfm?ArticleID=2273  |archivedate=January 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was later appealed to the Ninth Circuit under ''[[Newdow v. Carey]]'' and was reversed.

==U.S. District Court Case==
[[Michael Newdow]], a [[Sacramento, California]] attorney and [[emergency medicine]] [[physician]], filed suit in March 2000 against the [[Elk Grove Unified School District]]. Newdow sued as the ''[[next friend]]'' on behalf of his daughter, who was enrolled in the Elk Grove public schools. He said the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance amounted to an unconstitutional establishment of religion and that, as such, the daily recitation of the Pledge with the offending words interfered with his right to inculcate his daughter with his religious beliefs.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Peter A. Nowinski found the Pledge was constitutional. The District Court accepted the magistrate's finding and dismissed the case on June 21, 2000.&lt;ref name=Kraveats2005 /&gt; Newdow then appealed.

==U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit==
The Ninth Circuit issued three opinions in the case, as outlined below.

===''Newdow I'' – June 26, 2002===

A three-judge panel of the court unanimously found Newdow had standing as a parent to challenge a practice that interferes with his right to direct the religious education of his daughter. On the merits of the case, the court reversed the trial court decision on a 2-to-1 vote, on June 26, 2002. The majority opinion was written by Judge [[Alfred T. Goodwin]] with a partial concurrence and partial dissent written by Judge [[Ferdinand F. Fernandez]].

In reviewing the case, the court applied the [[Lemon Test]], the [[Endorsement Test]], and the Coercion Test. In doing so, the Court concluded recitation of the Pledge with the words "under God" included violated the [[Establishment Clause]].

Fernandez asserted in his partial dissent that the religious content of the "under God" addition is so small that it is [[de minimis]]—so trivial as to be properly beneath judicial notice.

Public and congressional reaction to the Ninth Circuit's decision was decidedly negative. About 150 [[United States House of Representatives|Members of Congress]] stood on the front steps of the Capitol and recited the Pledge including the words ''under God''; and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed a [[non-binding resolution]] affirming the presence of ''under God'' by a unanimous vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:SN02690: S. 2690].&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Newdow II'' – December 4, 2002===

After the June opinion was issued, Sandra Banning—the mother of the child in question (Newdow and Banning were not married) filed a motion to [[Intervention (law)|intervene]] or, alternatively, to dismiss Newdow's complaint. She declared that although she and Newdow shared physical custody of their daughter, a California court order granted her exclusive ''legal'' custody of the child, including the sole right to represent her legal interests and make all decisions about her education and welfare. Banning further stated that her daughter is a Christian who believes in God and has no objection either to reciting or hearing others recite the Pledge of Allegiance, or to its reference to God. Banning said she believed her daughter would be harmed if the litigation were permitted to proceed because others might incorrectly perceive the child as sharing her father's [[Atheism|atheist]] views. Banning accordingly concluded, as her daughter's sole legal custodian, that it was not in the [[Best interests|child's interest]] to be a [[Party (law)|party]] to Newdow's lawsuit.

The court's second published opinion noted that Newdow no longer claimed to represent his daughter, but the judges unanimously concluded that Banning's sole legal custody of the child did not deprive Newdow, as a noncustodial parent, of [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three]] standing to object to unconstitutional government action affecting his child. The court further held that under California law Newdow retained the right to expose his child to his particular religious views even if those views contradicted the mother's, and that Banning's objections as sole legal custodian did not defeat Newdow's right to seek redress for an alleged injury to his own parental interests.

===''Newdow III'' – February 28, 2003===

Defendants sought [[en banc]] review. This was denied and an amended order and opinion was issued in February 2003. The amended opinion omitted the initial opinion's discussion of Newdow's standing to challenge the 1954 Act and declined to determine whether Newdow was entitled to declaratory relief regarding the constitutionality of that Act.&lt;ref name=NewdowIII/&gt;

On September 11, 2003, Newdow was awarded partial custody of his daughter, including joint legal custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mauro |first=Tony |title=Dad Who Mounted Pledge Challenge Gets Partial Custody |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/law/sfb/lawArticleSFB.jsp?id=900005536596 |accessdate=August 29, 2011 |newspaper=Legal Times |date=September 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotations and legal detail===

From the 9th circuit hearing:
* Decided – the 1954 insertion of "under God" was made "to recognize a Supreme Being" and advance religion at a time "when the government was publicly inveighing against atheistic communism"—a fact which (according to the court) the federal government did not dispute. The court also noted that when President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed the act which added the phrase "under God," he also announced "From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our Nation and our people to the Almighty."
* Judge Alfred Goodwin from the 9th Circuit remarked: "A profession that we are a nation 'under God' is identical, for Establishment Clause purposes, to a profession that we are a nation 'under [[Jesus]],' a nation 'under [[Vishnu]],' a nation 'under [[Zeus]],' or a nation 'under [[Atheism|no god]],' because none of these professions can be neutral with respect to religion."

==U.S. Supreme Court==
On March 24, 2004 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] agreed to hear the case to consider two questions: (1) whether Newdow had [[standing (law)|standing]] as a noncustodial parent to challenge the School District's policy on recitation of the Pledge, and (2) if so, whether the policy offends the First Amendment.

Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] recused himself from the case after a request by Newdow that cited Scalia's disapproval of the Ninth Circuit decision in a public speech. According to Scalia, many lower courts often misinterpret the [[Establishment Clause]], extending its proscription of religiosity in the public sphere.

On June 14, 2004, in an opinion written by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], five of the remaining eight justices – Stevens, [[Anthony Kennedy]], [[Stephen Breyer]], [[David Souter]], and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] – found Michael Newdow lacked [[standing (law)|standing]] to bring the case as "next friend" to his daughter, because Sandra Banning had sole legal custody of the child at the time – including exclusive authority over the girl's education. The majority also found that Michael Newdow lacked [[standing (law)|prudential standing]] to bring the case on behalf of himself due to the custody arrangement. This resulted in reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision as a matter of procedural law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/14/scotus.pledge/ |title=Court dismisses Pledge case: Atheist father cannot sue over use of 'Under God' |date=June 15, 2004 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327080103/http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/14/scotus.pledge/ |archivedate=March 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newdow-SC/&gt;

The other three justices concurred in the judgment reversing the Ninth Circuit, but dissented on the issue of standing. They found Michael Newdow ''did'' have standing to bring the suit. Thus, they proceeded to examine the constitutional question, and in doing so they found it did not offend the Constitution. Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] wrote an opinion in which the other two joined in part; and both justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] and Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote their own separate opinions.

Rehnquist's opinion asserts the term "under God" does not endorse or establish religion but it actually asserts that the term merely acknowledges the nation's religious heritage, in particular the role of religion for the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. Thus, according to the opinion, the Pledge is a secular act rather than an act of indoctrination in religion or expression of religious devotion.

Justice Thomas, by contrast, asserts that finding the Pledge unconstitutional is an unjustifiable expansion of the meaning of "coercion" as that term is used in legal precedent: to prohibit compelling students in a "fair and real sense" by "subtle and indirect public and peer pressure" (see, ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lee v. Weisman|505|577|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) to be prayerful, as well as prohibiting actual coercion by force of law and threat of penalty. Further, he argues that the Establishment Clause ought not be considered a right that attaches to individuals pursuant to the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|Incorporation Doctrine]], because he believes the clause only prohibits interference by the federal government in the right of individual states to establish their own official religions – notwithstanding current majority opinion on the question is against states having such a right, as a result of the Incorporation Doctrine.

An '''entitlement''' is a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] made in accordance with a [[law|legal framework]] of a society. Typically, entitlements are based on concepts of [[principle]] ("[[rights]]") which are themselves based in concepts of [[social equality]] or [[enfranchisement]]. In recent decades the meaning of the word has been extended to encompass informal expectations of social relationships, social conventions and [[social norms]] which are considered unreasonable or unduly prescriptive upon others{{clarify|date=October 2018}}{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

== Psychology ==
[[Psychoanalysis]] differentiated among children three main varieties of the sense of entitlement: normal; inflated; and compromised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; A normal or healthy sense of entitlement included an expectation of responsiveness from significant others,&lt;ref&gt;A. Goldberg, ''Advances in Self-Psychology'' (2013) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; a sense of agency, and a sense of one's right to one's own feelings - all forming positive elements in [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Ronningstam, ''Identifying and Understanding the Narcissistic Personality'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The inflated sense of entitlement sought special privileges for the individual alone, perhaps to compensate for childhood suffering or [[narcissistic injury]]; while the compromised sense involved an inability to expect the basic rights enjoyed by those around one.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vamik Volkan]], ''Psychoanalysis, International Relations, and Diplomacy'' (2014) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy]] distinguished in adult life between (ethically) ''earning'' entitlement in relationships, through care and consideration, and a subjective feeling of entitlement the real basis for which may be very different.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 109-10&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the depressive may have an unjustifiably low sense of entitlement, the manic an exaggeratedly high one.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The gambler may feel ''entitled'' to expect a big win, to compensate for childhood deprivation; those who clamour most loudly for such reimbursement from fate may in fact unconsciously doubt their entitlement to anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis''. (London 1946) p. 372 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

An inflated sense of what is sometimes called ''psychological entitlement''&lt;ref&gt;L. Ashner, ''When is Enough, Enough?'' (1997) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; - unrealistic, [[exaggerated]], or rigidly held - is especially prominent among narcissists.  According to the [[DSM-5]], individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] (NPD) are likely to have a "sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others", typically without commensurate qualities or accomplishments:&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{citation|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.)|location=Arlington|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|pages=669–672|isbn=0890425558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{citation|author=Mayo Clinic Staff|title=Narcissistic personality disorder: Symptoms|website=Mayo Clinic|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research|date=18 Nov 2014|accessdate=29 Apr 2016|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/con-20025568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to [[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin]], the [[narcissistic]] personality attempts to protect the [[vulnerable self]] by building layers of [[grandiosity]] and a huge sense of entitlement.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Farrell, ''Acts of Trust'' (2010) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

While an earned sense of entitlement is usually seen as more beneficent than purely psychological entitlement, it can also have a destructive counterpart in the sense of a felt entitlement to revenge based on the accumulation of grievances.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, ''Between Give and Take'' (2013) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''FXP board''' is an [[internet forum]] composed of members which distribute access to [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers or "[[pubstro]]s".  These forums are used to provide access to servers usually containing [[warez]].  FXP boards generally differ from other forums by having a very selective membership, typically opening public registration for a limited time and then closing until further notice.

There are several types of members of FXP boards, each with their own job:

* '''Scanners''' scan [[IP address|IP]] ranges for vulnerable computers with a fast internet connection. Once a vulnerable system has been found, the information is passed on to the rest of the board and subsequently the "''hackers''".
* '''Hackers''' gain access to and install an FTP server on the systems the ''scanners'' have found using different tools depending on the vulnerability.
* '''Fillers''' add [[Warez]] to the FTP server, transferring files via FXP from other sources to the newly compromised servers once the "''hackers''" have posted the admin details for the FTP servers.

Most FXP boards have a time limit on the release time before the release can be posted as a "race". If the release is complete and posted after the pre limit it should be posted as a normal fill in a mirror section. If it is still posted in the race area it will be nuked and moved to the appropriate section.
 
FXP boards are the main reason for lots of activity on FTP servers, as the links are posted on multiple boards. Leechers soon exploit the servers, sometimes causing a huge slow-down due to consumed bandwidth.

==History==
The original draft for the FCRPA started as a cave management plan for the [[Forest Service Directive System]] (FSM). Tom Lennon of [[Washington Office Recreation]] met with [[caving|cavers]] Jer Thornton and Jim Nieland to discuss the scope of cave management. In one evening, a paper draft of the plan was written up and titled FSM 2356. Lennon then escorted the bill through official channels where it was then adopted by FSM.&lt;ref name="Nieland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.lib.usf.edu/content/SF/S0/06/41/23/00005/K26-05393-v11n01-2018-BTF_Spring_18.pdf||last=Nieland|first=Jim|title=Beneath the Forest|date=Spring 2018|website=Digital.lib.usf.edu|publisher=United States Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Thornton, along with the help of the [[National Speleological Society]] (NSS) and the [[American Cave Conservation Association]] (ACCA), stepped up to get a federal bill passed. Thornton used the FSM 2356 as the basis for this new bill. The bill was introduced with the help of Congressman [[Frederick C. Boucher]] of [[Virginia]] on March 2, 1987. Senator [[Tom Daschle]] of [[South Dakota]] introduced a similar bill in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and by November of next year it was signed into law by President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name="Nieland"/&gt;

A major difference between FSM 2356 and the FCRPA is the concept of "significant" caves. The FCRPA introduced this new aspect, where a cave must be recognized as significant in order to receive protection under the Act. This meant not all caves received protection, only those recognized as significant by the Federal government through a nomination process.&lt;ref name="Nieland"/&gt;

The original nomination process began in 1994 which was required by the newly passed law. A [[national clearing house]] was established to oversee this initial process of nominations. The initial batch of cave nominations needed to meet only two criteria: they had to be on federal land and be [[nature|natural]] features; not [[Artificiality|man-made]].&lt;ref name="Nieland"/&gt;

'''''[[Friends of the Earth]], Inc. et al. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.''''', 528 U.S. 167 (2000),{{ref|citation}} was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that addressed the law regarding [[standing (law)|standing]] to sue and [[mootness]].

The Court held that the [[plaintiff]] residents in the area of [[South Carolina|South Carolina's]] [[Tyger River|North Tyger River]] had standing to sue an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent [[Civil penalty|civil penalties]] were being pursued. Standing was properly based on the fact that the residents alleged that they would have used the [[river]] for recreational purposes, but could not because of the [[pollution]].

The [[defendant]] polluter also claimed that the case was moot because it had ceased polluting, and had closed the [[factory]] responsible for the pollution complained of. The Court noted that the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, and could reopen similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the fine sought. Therefore, the case was held not to be moot.

The Supreme Court's majority in ''Friends'' ruled that plaintiffs did not need to prove an actual (particular) harm to residents. Writing for the majority, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] held that injury to the plaintiff came from lessening the "aesthetic and recreational values of the area" for residents and users of the river because of their knowledge of Laidlaw’s repeated violations of its clean water permit.

In addition, the case held that a civil penalty could be enforced against an entity even though the interests protected were private.  The court agreed with Congress in holding that civil penalties in the Clean Water Act cases "do more than promote immediate compliance by limiting the defendant's economic incentive to delay its attainment of permit limits; they also deter future violations."{{fact|date=September 2018}}

The 7-2 decision was written by Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], and joined by Justices [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]], [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]], [[Anthony Kennedy|Kennedy]], [[David Souter|Souter]], and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]].

[[Image:Joschka Fischer 2002.jpeg|thumb|200px|Joschka Fischer]]
The '''visa affair''' is the name given by the German press to the controversy that arose in early 2005 over a change in the procedure for issuing [[Visa (document)|visa]]s to foreign nationals seeking to enter Germany from non-[[European Union|EU]], Eastern European states. The new visa policy put in place in 2000, it was claimed, dispensed with safeguards against abuses such as [[illegal immigration]] and [[human trafficking]] in favour of speeding up the issuing process for tourist visas. The affair prompted the resignation of the responsible Minister of State Ludger Volmer of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green party]] from his roles in the [[Bundestag (Germany)|Bundestag]] foreign affairs committee and as foreign affairs spokesperson of his party. The claims severely damaged the reputation of his party colleague, [[List of German foreign ministers|Foreign Minister]] [[Joschka Fischer]]. The allegation was that changes had been made to the previous tougher visa rules, without correct political procedure. Some{{who|date=March 2014}} commentators have suggested that the increase in the number of Ukrainians visiting Germany may have promoted a more positive view of [[Western Europe]], assisting the [[Orange Revolution]].

== Background ==

=== 1999/2000 ===
In 1999 the German embassy in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] alone issued more than 150,000 visas for Germany. Long queues formed in front of the embassy. Applicants reported that Ukrainian security personnel demanded [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 100 to 500 (€50 - 250) from applicants to get ahead in the queue.

At the beginning of 2000, the [[Minister of State]] at the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]], [[Ludger Volmer]], issued a decree (known as "Volmer's Decree"), which extended the powers of the individual embassies in deciding about visa applications. The decree aimed at making travel to Germany easier. When in doubt, the application was to be decided in favour of the applicant.

At the same time, visa applications directly from travel agencies were introduced. This regulation was opposed by the Federal ''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (Border Guard) as well as by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] (BKA), because they feared that it would lead to easier migration into Germany for criminals. They cited a criminal court decision against the manager of a travel agency who organized illegal migration into Germany. The "tourists", in this case; went underground, became [[prostitution|prostitutes]] or left Germany for other countries of the [[European Union]].

On March 9, 2000, the [[Minister of the Interior (Germany)|Minister of the Interior]], [[Otto Schily]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) wrote a letter to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Joschka Fischer]], saying that he saw the "Volmer's Decree" as a violation of the Aliens Act as well as of the [[Schengen Treaty]]. As of 2005, it is not clear if Schily intervened further, or if not, why?

===2001 - 2003===
On May 2, 2001 embassies worldwide were advised to accept the ''Carnet de Touriste'' travel insurance introduced by [[Helmut Kohl]]'s [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] in 1995.  These insurance documents covered medical costs incurred abroad as well as any costs resulting from [[deportation]]. They were accepted in place of a written guarantee by a German citizen to prove that the visa applicant could finance his stay and his return home.

The German Automobile Club ([[ADAC]]) sold between 120,000 and 150,000 of these insurance documents, the [[Allianz]] insurance company sold more than 35,000, and the ITREC GmbH company more than 31,000. The Foreign Office also advised the embassies to accept similar travel insurance documents from the ''Reiseschutz AG'', owned by private entrepreneur Kübler. The press claims this played an important role in the smuggling of people into Germany. The Ministry of the Interior was informed about this by the Federal Crime Agency (''Bundeskriminalamt'').

In the trial of [[Anatoli Barg]], the [[Cologne]] criminal court claimed that the "Volmer's Decree", the acceptance of travel insurance documents instead of guarantors or proof of credit-worthiness and the applications for visas at travel agencies had led to mass human trafficking. In the verdict, this was described as "a cold putsch against the law".

In July, 2001, the Foreign Office prevented applications for visas at travel agencies from October 1, 2001. Instead of going to a travel agency, once more every applicant had to go to the visa department in an embassy. However, it was assumed that a travel insurance document sufficed as proof of the applicant's credit-worthiness.

From January 29, 2002 the Foreign Office decreed that it was possible to buy and sell travel insurance documents directly in foreign countries. It is said in the press that this increased the problems in Kiev and that traders sold travel insurance documents for as much as $1,000.

On February 8, 2002 the [[Embassy of Germany, Kiev|German ambassador in Kiev]], Dietmar Stüdemann, reported that the embassy was flooded with applicants proving their credit-worthiness with travel insurance documents.

In March 2003, "Volmer's Decree" later called the "Fischer degree"-since it was his responsibility, was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1495078,00.html| title = German Visa Scandal Gets Brussels' Attention | date = 2005-02-20| publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]]| accessdate = 2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once more, applicants' credit-worthiness had to be examined. From April 2003, travel insurance documents were no longer accepted.

In February 2004, a German regional court found the defendant, Ukrainian-born Anatoli Barg, guilty of people trafficking and smuggling. The court found that laxness in issuing German visas in Ukraine, where about 300,000 tourist visas were issued to visit Germany between 2000 and 2002, made it easier for Barg to commit his offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bernstein (April 26, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/world/europe/25iht-germany.html Fischer accepts blame in visa affair] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
On January 20, 2005 the first meeting of the Commission of Inquiry was held in the [[German Bundestag]]. This commission—a kind of judicial hearing—was set up with the votes of the opposition parties CDU and CSU. The CDU/CSU parliamentary group was represented by [[Eckart von Klaeden]].

On February 12, 2005 Ludger Volmer retired as the Speaker for Foreign Affairs of the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Green Party]]'s parliamentary group in the Bundestag, after the media criticized his work as a consultant for the company Synthesis GmbH, which worked for the [[Bundesdruckerei]], the agency producing identity cards, banknotes and other secure documents.

For the first time in over six years, in February 2005, opinion polls did not show Joschka Fischer in first place in the popularity vote. Instead, the leading position in the popularity vote went to the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic]] ''[[Ministerpräsident]]'' of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Christian Wulff]], with Fischer coming in second.

On February 15, Fischer agreed to testify before the special parliamentary commission.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bernstein (February 16, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/16/international/europe/16germany.html German Foreign Minister to Testify to Parliament in Visa Scandal] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, he accepted what he called "political responsibility" for mistakes that may have been made by German consulates in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bernstein (February 16, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/16/international/europe/16germany.html German Foreign Minister to Testify to Parliament in Visa Scandal] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, during his first trip to Berlin since being sworn in, [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] of Ukraine in a speech before the German [[Bundestag]] asked for a visa-free regime for business people, students, artists and young people seeking contact with EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Dempsey (March 10, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/world/europe/09iht-germany.html Yushchenko courts the Germans] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2005 the media reported that the [[German Chancellery|Federal Chancellery]] had been informed about a dispute between [[Otto Schily]] and Joschka Fischer about visa politics as early as March 2000. It was said that Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] himself was not informed.

On March 26, 2005 Eckart von Klaeden called for Joschka Fischer to tell the truth before the elections in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The CDU/CSU tried to force a statement by Fischer.

On March 31, 2005 the media reported that Fischer would speak before the Inquiry Commission in mid-April, earlier than previously expected.  &lt;!--[the following part needs evidence or a source] While the opposition parties had wanted Fischer to testify before the May elections in [[North-Rhine Westphalia]]. The North-Rhine Westphalian Greens had also wanted to get the matter cleared up before election day. However many members of the national government appeared to want to delay Fischer's testimony until after the elections.--&gt;  The testimony of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] minister of the interior [[Otto Schily]] was scheduled for June.

In April 2005 the media reported that there were difficulties in 2004. Fischer claimed the difficulties were resolved in mid-2004. Eckart von Klaeden said on the main German television channel [[ZDF]] that the Commission of Inquiry wanted to investigate the differing statement of Fischer in March 2005. On April 21, the Commission of Inquiry heard Ludger Volmer and the State Secretary at the Foreign Office at the time, [[Gunter Pleuger]]. This Commission of Inquiry hearing (duration: more than 12 hours) was the first such hearing broadcast by television (and was watched by more than 400,000 people).

At a second all-day televised hearing on 25 April 2005, Fischer admitted that mistakes had been made during his time in office when thousands of visas to Germany were granted to criminals and prostitutes from the Ukraine from 2000 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bernstein (April 26, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/world/europe/25iht-germany.html Fischer accepts blame in visa affair] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; But Fischer also dismissed opposition arguments that the security and well-being of Germany were significantly harmed by the influx of immigrants, and he contended that once the problem was discovered in 2002 the policy was immediately corrected.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bernstein (April 26, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/world/europe/25iht-germany.html Fischer accepts blame in visa affair] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer's decision to admit some responsibility came after weeks of stonewalling by his party, which had even tried to delay appearing before the special parliamentary commission.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Dempsey (April 28, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/world/europe/27iht-fischer.html Fischer admits to visa-scandal errors] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing lasted 14 hours and was viewed by 700,000 viewers on [[Phoenix (German TV station)|Phoenix]] only, a 10.5% quota. After the hearing, members of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] continued to ask for Fischers retirement, whereas members of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]] said that Fischer performed well and that the CDU/CSU members in the commission were not able to show evidence for their accusations.

On 29 April, the Foreign Office passed the relevant documents to the [[European Commission]], following months of pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Lisbeth Kirk (May 2, 2005), [https://euobserver.com/justice/18976 German visa scandal moves to EU level] ''[[EUobserver]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, the German ambassador to Ukraine said the visa policies of Fischer were lax and eased the application of visas. He also said that the Volmer Decree discouraged the embassy's employees.

On June 2, 2005, the Commission of Inquiry was adjourned after a short session of only 30 minutes. The commission called an end to the hearing of evidence with the majority of its SPD/The Greens members. CDU and FDP on the other hand are likely to appeal to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]] should this matter be dropped permanently. Some ministers, who were due to appear before the commission (e.g. [[Otto Schily]] or others [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] of the Federal Chancellory), were not to be questioned in the end. Instead, the work of the commission was prematurely ended due to the widely anticipated call for an [[German federal election, 2005|early election]].

On June 15, 2005, in a provisional ruling, the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]] considered the end of the hearings of evidence, as mentioned above on June 2, as unconstitutional and ordered the Commission of Inquiry to continue with its timetable as planned as long as the Federal Diet isn't dissolved due to the expected call for a snap election later this summer. This would mean the cancelled hearings of ministers like [[Otto Schily|Schily]] (Minister of the Interior) and Steinmeier (Minister of State of the Federal Chancellory) will most likely take place after all.

On August 4, the [[European Commission]] decided that while the lax system at the heart of the German visa scandal violated European Union norms (including the [[Schengen Agreement]] and the Common Consular Instructions), Germany had since remedied the problem with a reformed policy that complies with EU rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/eu-all-but-clears-germany-in-visa-affair/a-1668515-1 EU All But Clears Germany in Visa Affair] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', August 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Joachim Würmeling]] of Germany challenged the European Commission to investigate Germany’s new policies, claiming that these too were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/eu-all-but-clears-germany-in-visa-affair/a-1668515-1 EU All But Clears Germany in Visa Affair] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', August 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Google France SARL and Google Inc. v Louis Vuitton Malletier SA (C-236/08) ,''' also known as Google v. Louis Vuitton was a landmark decision in which the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) held that [[Web search engine|search engines]] operators such as Google do not themselves infringe [[Trademark|trademark rights]] if they allow advertisers to use a competitor’s trademark as a [[keyword advertising|keyword]].

== Facts ==
[[Louis Vuitton|Vuitton]] has the Community trademark ‘Vuitton’ as well as the French trademarks ‘Louis Vuitton’ and ‘LV’. These are widely accepted for having a well-renowned reputation.

In 2003, Vuitton detected that if internet users entered his trademark terms into [[Google]]’s search engine, they would be directed to websites selling imitations of Vuitton’s products, under the heading of ‘[[Sponsored link|sponsored links]]’.

Additionally, Google enabled the advertisers to use simultaneously with Vuitton’s trademarks, expressions suggesting [[counterfeit]] products, such as ‘imitation’ and ‘copy’. Thus, Vuitton brought a proceeding against Google, attempting to ascertain that it had infringed Vuitton’s trademarks.

In 2005, the Regional Court of Paris rendered a decision determining that Google was guilty due to the infringement of Vuitton’s trademarks. Subsequently, on appeal, the Court of appeal in Paris, confirmed the same outcome.

However, Google brought an appeal on a point of law to the [[Court of cassation|Cassation court]] against the last judgement. Consequently, the French Court of Cassation stayed the proceedings and asked the CJEU for further clarification on certain aspects essential to decide the case. Thus, it referred the following questions for a [[preliminary ruling]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130deb9df5869f7a048b099eac5ff2b9a5a44.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4Pb3aLe0?text=&amp;docid=83961&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=469816|title=CURIA – Documents|website=curia.europa.eu|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

== Judgement ==
The Court found that signs corresponding to trademarks were used in an internet referencing service through the usage of keywords, without consent of the trademark proprietors. Such keywords were chosen and accepted by clients of the referencing service provider. The Court found that Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of [[Directive 89/104/EEC|Directive 89/104]] and Article 9(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation No 40/94 allow proprietors of trade marks to prohibit any third parties from using signs identical or similar to their trademarks for goods or services. This triggers viewing of advertising links which display goods identical to those registered under protected trade marks. The Court interprets that this triggering falls under the scope of the overall scheme of Directive 89/104 and as such affects the functions of the trademark. As such, it held that by application of Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 89/104 and Article (9)(1)(a) of Regulation No 40/95, the proprietor of a trademark can prohibit a third party from using signs identical to the trade mark in use in the course of trade of similar goods, namely through the use of keywords in a referencing service provider.

The use of keywords is considered to affect the course of trade. In the words of the Court:

{{Cquote
| quote = From the advertiser’s point of view, the selection of a keyword identical with a trademark has the object and effect of displaying an advertising link to the site on which he offers his goods or services for sale. Since the sign selected as a keyword is the means used to trigger that ad display, it cannot be disputed that the advertiser indeed uses it in the context of commercial activity and not as a private matter. With regard, next, to the referencing service provider, it is common ground that it is carrying out a commercial activity with a view to economic advantage when it stores as keywords, for certain of its clients, signs which are identical with trademarks and arranges for the display of ads on the basis of those keywords.
}}

The Court concludes on a first instance that a referencing system is not necessarily involved in use in the course of trade according to the wording of Directive 89/104. However, its relation to the trademarked products can be established through a “relation to goods or services”, as Vuitton’s trade marks appeared in advertisements under a heading of” sponsored links”. Although Google stated that in the absence of the mention of a sign in the actual ad no trademark rights were being violated, the Court held that the list in the Directive should be incorporated as to include modern electronic commerce and that, in that context, referencing service providers allow advertisers to choose identical signs as keywords in order to invite internet users to enter words as search terms to then click the links displayed and also the advertising links. If these sponsored links are provided above the regular list of results, internet users are more likely to click them, as they are listed first, as alternatives to the original Vuitton bags. [68] As such, it follows that the use by an advertiser of a sign identical with a trademark as a keyword falls within the concept of use “in relation to goods or services”.

The Court concluded by stating that Louis Vuitton has the right to prohibit an advertiser from advertising on Google by using keywords identical with its trademark without their consent. However, "an internet referencing service provider which stores, as a keyword, a sign identical with a trade mark and organises the display of advertisements on the basis of that keyword does not use that sign within the meaning of Directive 89/104 and Regulation No 40/95." The conclusion of the Court's judgement relied on the concept of "active role" of the internet referencing service provider, regarding "knowledge or control over the data store. If the internet servicing provider has not played such a role, than it cannot be held liable for the data which it has stored at the request of an advertiser, unless it failed to act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the data concerned."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130deb9df5869f7a048b099eac5ff2b9a5a44.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4Pb3aLe0?text=&amp;docid=83961&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=469816|title=Ruling of Case C-236/08 CURIA – Documents|last=|first=|date=|website=curia.europa.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierro Gode (vice-president at [[LVMH]]), considers that “This decision represents a critical step towards the clarification of the rules governing online advertising, of which LVMH is one of the foremost clients. "As the world's leading luxury group, with more brands actively engaged with the internet than any other luxury company, we are committed to working with all parties, including Google, to eradicate illicit online practices and to promote a framework that fosters the continued growth of the digital economy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/23/google-louis-vuitton-trademark-legal-case|title=Google triumphs in Louis Vuitton trademark case|last=Wray|first=Richard|date=2010-03-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiona McBride, trademark lawyer at Withers &amp; Rogers, described the ECJ ruling about the origin of an ad as "perplexing". She said it seemed to be unnecessarily introducing "a requirement of element or doubt as to the origin of goods and services which is not relevant for determining the infringement of a registered trademark". "This is a setback for brand owners and seriously limits the scope of their trade mark rights when it comes to challenging use of their trade marks in online advertising," added McBride. "Only rarely will the internet user be unable to ascertain the origin of the goods and services and it will therefore be easy for advertisers to circumvent the law and use third party trademarks as keywords. This means that advertisers can secure a commercial advantage by [[Piggybacking (Internet access)|piggy-backing]] on the reputation of the trademarks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/23/google-louis-vuitton-search-ads|title=Google wins Louis Vuitton trademark case|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2010-03-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues arising on whether the facts of this case constitute a trademark infringement are debatable amongst the national european courts regarding operator responsibility for comparative trademark use. But the issue itself, in the perspective of advocate-general [[Miguel Poiares Maduro]] poses no real issue, as he previously stated that "Google has not committed a trademark infringement by allowing advertisers to select, in [[AdWords]], keywords corresponding to trademarks.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulk|first=Stefan|date=2011-07-01|title=Search Engines Searching for Trouble? Comparing Search Engine Operator Responsibility for Competitive Keyword Advertising Under EU and US Trademark Law|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1911038|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers that the use of the algorithm that creates and organizes Googles advertising  "cannot therefore be considered as being a use made in relation to goods or services identical or similar to those covered by the trademarks. Similarly, advertisers themselves do not commit a trademark infringement by selecting in Adwords keywords corresponding to trademarks,” and in no way should it be construed that due to the fact that Google displays certain types of advertisement when a specific search term is inputed it means that it wants to affect companies sales. Users are fully aware that several search results will be presented outside of the owner of the Trademark, and the costumers will make an assessment of the origins of the product and consequently their purchase decision on the content of the website rather than on the display of the ad.

{{Gun laws by country}}

According to the database of the [[National Police of Ukraine]] 878,739 persons were owners of firearms in 2016.&lt;ref name=FU29117/&gt; For 2016 the increase was 10,158 people.&lt;ref name=FU29117&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7133832/ Weapons in Ukraine are more than a million people - Avakov], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (29 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law ==
Ukraine is the only country in Europe where firearms are not regulated by statute. Everything related to firearms is regulated by the Order №622 of Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Citizens are permitted to own non-fully automatic rifles and shotguns as long as they are stored properly when not in use. Handguns are illegal except for target shooting and those who hold concealed carry permits.

A license is required to own firearms, and a citizen may be issued a license if that person:

* is 25 years of age for rifle ownership, 21 years of age for smoothbore weapon ownership, 18 years of age for cold or pneumatic weapon ownership;
* has no criminal record;
* has no history of domestic violence;
* has no mental illness or history of mental illness;
* has a good reason (target shooting, hunting, collection).

Gun owners are required by Order to renew their licenses and registration of their guns every three years. Failure to comply will result in revocation as well as confiscation of guns. 

Limited categories of citizens like People's Deputies of Ukraine, judges, journalists and some other may own [[trauma pistol]]s that fire rubber bullets.
 
Concealed carry licenses are available, but are not normally issued unless a threat to life is present and can be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/cp/ukraine |title=Guns in Ukraine: Firearms, armed violence and gun law |publisher=Gunpolicy.org |date=2001-05-07 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a license is issued, all guns must be kept unloaded and in a safe.

==Early life and academic career==
In his student years, Hans Köchler was actively involved as a Board Member of the [[European Forum Alpbach]] and established contacts with leading European intellectuals and philosophers such as [[Manès Sperber]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Rudi Supek]] of the [[Praxis school]] who he invited to his lecture series that he organized from 1969 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hanskoechler.com/Innsbruck_Lectures.htm Innsbruck Lectures 1969-1989]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of the 1970s, he had joined the team around [[Otto Molden]], the founder of the [[European Forum Alpbach]]. These were his formative philosophical years; he initially developed an interest in [[existential philosophy]], [[transcendental philosophy]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. In particular, he undertook an epistemological critique of Husserl's transcendental idealism&lt;ref&gt;"The 'A priori' Moment of the Subject-Object-Dialectic in Transcendental Phenomenology: The Relationship between 'A priori' and 'Ideality'," in: ''Analecta Husserliana'', Vol. 3 (1974), pp. 183-198.&lt;/ref&gt;  and interpreted Heidegger's philosophy of Being in the sense of social critique,&lt;ref&gt;''Skepsis und Gesellschaftskritik im Denken Martin Heideggers''. Meisenheim a. G.: Anton Hain, 1978. {{ISBN|3-445-01381-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening up—in the [[Cold War]] era—a dialogue with humanist philosophers of the [[Praxis school]] in [[Yugoslavia]] and in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;See correspondence with Rudi Supek in the archive of ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik'', University of Innsbruck, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; As a doctoral student, he also had met in Alpbach with [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Arthur Koestler]] and [[Karl Popper]].

In 1972, Köchler graduated at the [[University of Innsbruck]] with a doctor degree  in [[philosophy]] (Dr. phil.) with highest honours ("sub auspiciis praesidentis rei publicae"). In the years following his graduation he expanded his scholarly interest to philosophy of law and later political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophie - Recht - Politik''. Vienna/New York: Springer, 1985. {{ISBN|0-387-81899-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1970s he has been promoting the idea of inter-cultural dialogue which—since the last decade—has become known under the slogan of ''dialogue of civilizations''. Köchler first outlined his hermeneutical [[philosophy of dialogue]] and his concept of ''cultural self-comprehension'' in lectures at the University of Innsbruck (1972)&lt;ref&gt;''Kulturelles Selbstverständnis und Koexistenz: Voraussetzungen für einen fundamentalen Dialog'' (Cultural Self-comprehension and Co-existence: Preconditions of Fundamental Dialogue), in: ''Philosophie und Politik. Dokumentation eines interdisziplinären Seminars''. Innsbruck: Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik, 1973, pp. 75-78. In this text he coined the term "dialogue of cultures".&lt;/ref&gt;  and at the Royal Scientific Society in [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], in March 1974 &lt;ref&gt;Text of the lecture: ''Cultural-Philosophical Aspects of International Cooperation''. Studies in  International Cultural Relations, II.

==Research==

[[Image:Schaff-koechler-1980.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hans Köchler, left, and Polish philosopher [[Adam Schaff]] at the European Forum Alpbach, August 1980]]
During the 1970s, he co-operated with Cardinal Karol Wojtyła of Kraków, later to become [[Pope John Paul II]], within the framework of the International Society for Phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;See Nancy Mardas Billias and Agnes B. Curry in: ''Karol Wojtyla's Philosophical Legacy''. Washington, DC: The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy, 2008, pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; He published the first comment articles on the future Pope's anthropological conception.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. "The Dialectical Conception of Self-determination. Reflections on the Systematic Approach of Karol Wojtyla," in: ''Analecta Husserliana'', Vol. 6 (1977), pp. 75-80.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s he engaged in a critique of legal positivism (''Philosophie—Recht—Politik'', 1985) and developed a theory according to which human rights are the basis of the validity of international law (''Die Prinzipien des Völkerrechts und die Menschenrechte'', 1981). He also dealt with the applicability of democracy in inter-state relations (''Democracy in International Relations'', 1986). Legal theory led him to questions of political philosophy, and in particular a critique of the representative paradigm of democracy.  During the 1990s Köchler got increasingly involved in questions of [[New world order (politics)|world order]]—including the role and philosophical foundations of civilizational dialogue—and in what he has called the dialectic relationship between [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[law]]. On the basis of these reflections, he made major proposals for the reform of the United Nations Organization, in particular the Security Council, and for a comprehensive system of international criminal justice.

Köchler's bibliography contains more than 600 books, reports and scholarly articles in several languages (Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Spanish, Serbo-Croat, Turkish). His publications deal with issues of phenomenology, existential philosophy, anthropology, human rights, philosophy of law, theory of international law, international criminal law, United Nations reform, theory of democracy, etc. He acts as editor of the series ''Studies in International Relations'' (Vienna), ''Veröffentlichungen der Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik'' (Innsbruck), and as member of the Editorial Board of the international academic journal ''Hekmat va Falsafeh'' (Wisdom and Philosophy), published by the Philosophy Department of [[Allameh Tabatabaii University]], [[Iran]].

Köchler has served in several committees and expert groups dealing with issues of international democracy, [[human rights and development]] such as the Research Network on Transnational Democracy sponsored by the [[European Commission]]; the [[Council of Europe]]'s Expert Group on Democratic Citizenship (1998–2000); and the [[Asia-Europe Foundation]]’s expert meeting on Cultural, Religious and Social Conceptions of Justice in Asia &amp; Europe ([[Singapore]], 2004).

Köchler calls in his research paper "The “Global War on Terror” and its Implications for Muslim-Western Relations " presented during the International Roundtable Conference at the University of Sains Malaysia, Centre for Policy Research and International Studies (CenPRIS) Penang, Malaysia, during 13–14 December 2007, the "official narrative" of 9/11, told by the American authorities, an "official conspiracy theory".&lt;ref&gt;The “Global War on Terror” and its Implications for Muslim-Western Relations", p.21&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he claims that the Western establishment refuses to investigate what really happened on 9/11 and this is part of a collective denial process.&lt;ref&gt;The “Global War on Terror” and its Implications for Muslim-Western Relations", p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)==

Köchler is the Founder and President (since 1972) of the [[International Progress Organization]] (I.P.O.), an international non-governmental organization (NGO) in consultative status with the [[United Nations]] and with a membership in over 70 countries, representing all continents. He was the founder and Secretary-General (1973-1977) of Euregio Alpina (Study Group for the Alpine Region), a transnational planning structure for the Alpine region and predecessor of the new concept of the "Euro Regions" in the framework of the [[European Union]]. During the 1970s and 1980s Köchler participated in the international phenomenological movement and organized several conferences and colloquia on the phenomenology of the life-world; he was the organizer of the Eighth International Phenomenological Conference in Salzburg (1980) and is the co-founder of the Austrian Society of Phenomenology.

==International impact==
Köchler has been the organizer of major international conferences in the fields of [[International|transnational]] co-operation, [[democracy]], [[human rights]], [[terrorism]], and [[conflict resolution]], among them the "International Conference on the European Vocation of the Alpine Region" in Innsbruck (1971), which initiated transborder co-operation in Europe and the  development towards the "Euro Regions" within the [[European Union|EU]]; the "International Conference on the Question of Terrorism" in Geneva (1987); and the "Second International Conference On A More Democratic United Nations" (CAMDUN-2) at the Vienna headquarters of the United Nations (1991). In 1996 he acted as Chairman of the final session and co-ordinator of the Drafting Committee of the "International Conference on Democracy and Terrorism" in New Delhi. In March 2002 he delivered the 14th Centenary Lecture at the Supreme Court of the Philippines on "The United Nations, the International Rule of Law and Terrorism." On 1 September 2004 he delivered the Foundation Day Speech at [[Mindanao State University]], Islamic City of [[Marawi]], on "The Dialogue of Civilizations and the Future of World Order."

[[Image:Kreisky-Koechler-Vienna-1980.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hans Köchler, left, and Austrian Federal Chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]], right, at the Federal Chancellery in Vienna, November 1980]]Through his research and civil society initiatives, Professor Köchler made major contributions to the debate on international democracy and United Nations reform, in particular reform of the Security Council. This was acknowledged by international figures such as the German Foreign Minister [[Klaus Kinkel]] in 1993. In 1985, he organized the first colloquium on "Democracy in International Relations" on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the United Nations in New York. With Irish Nobel Laureate [[Sean MacBride|Seán MacBride]] he initiated the Appeal by Lawyers against Nuclear War, which set in motion an international campaign that eventually led to a General Assembly resolution and the issuing of an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice. As President of the I.P.O. he dealt with the humanitarian issues of the exchange of prisoners of war between Iran and Iraq and with the issue of Kuwaiti POWs and missing people in Iraq. Since 1972, UN Secretaries-General in their statements subsequently acknowledged Professor Köchler's contribution to international peace.

[[Image:Jean PaulII-Kochler-1979.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Hans Köchler with Pope John Paul II in the Vatican, February 1979]]
In the framework of his activities as President of the International Progress Organization, he co-operated with numerous international figures such as the Founder President of [[Senegal]], [[Léopold Senghor|Léopold Sédar Senghor]], on the issue of civilizational dialogue; [[Prince Hassan|Crown Prince Hassan]] of [[Jordan]] and [[Franz König|Cardinal Franz König]] of Austria on Islamic-Christian understanding;&lt;ref&gt;See "Message by His Eminence Cardinal Franz König, Archbishop of Vienna," in: Hans Köchler, ed., ''The Concept of Monotheism in Islam and Christianity''.

During the [[Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy]], he wrote in a commentary: "In his lecture preaching the compatibility of reason and faith, Benedict XVI, the scholar,  deliberately overlooks the fact that the insights of Greek philosophy – its commitment to the λόγος – have been brought to medieval Christian Europe by the great Muslim thinkers of the Middle Ages. What he calls the 'encounter between the Biblical message and Greek thought' ... was, to a large extent, the result of the influence of Muslim philosophers – at a time when European Christians were totally ignorant of classical Greek philosophy."."&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-o.org/koechler-Religion_Reason_Violence-16Sept06.htm Religion, Reason and Violence: Pope Benedict XVI and Islam] - Hans Köchler, Statement for the [[International Progress Organization]]. 16 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Köchler is also an outspoken critic of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and has condemned its inception and practice by citing provisions of international law.&lt;ref&gt;http://i-p-o.org/yu-tribunal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He came to prominence in the world of international politics when he was nominated, on 25 April 2000, by then [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] as [[Hans Köchler's Lockerbie trial observer mission|an observer at the]] [[Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial|Pan Am Flight 103 (Lockerbie) bombing trial]]. His critical reports on the trial and appeal proceedings contributed to a global debate on the politicization of international criminal justice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2045">The Crown of England traditionally exercised the right to impose import duties for the regulation of trade and the protection of domestic industry. New '''impositions''' of this kind were imposed by [[Elizabeth I]] on currants and tobacco (1601) and extended by [[James I of England|King James I]] to most imports (1608) after a favourable ruling in [[Bates' Case]] (1606).&lt;ref&gt;James I, Christopher Durston, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; John Bates was a merchant from the [[Levant Company]] who refused to pay the import duty on currants, this was taken to the [[Court of the Exchequer]], he lost and so impositions were extended giving the treasury a "windfall".&lt;ref name="Coming of the Civil War pg30"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=David|title=The Coming of the Civil War, 1603 - 49|publisher=Heinemann|year=2000|series=Heinemann Advanced History |pages=30|chapter=2 James I's reign 1603 - 25 |isbn=0-435-32713-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s angry protests in 1610, the tax was amended to ensure that the greatest impact fell on foreign merchants.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stuart Age, 1603-1714'', by [[John Wroughton]]. Pages 151-152&lt;/ref&gt;

Impositions were among the [[prerogative]] rights that King James I was to give up under the [[Great Contract]] of 1610, as drawn up by [[Lord Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], then [[Lord Salisbury]], in return for an immediate sum to pay off Royal debt and an annual subsidy that would greatly increase income.  However negotiations fell through, mainly because both sides kept changing what they wanted out of the Contract.&lt;ref name="Coming of the Civil War"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=David|title=The Coming of the Civil War, 1603 - 49|publisher=Heinemann|year=2000|series=Heinemann Advanced History |pages=33|chapter=2 James I's reign 1603 - 25 |isbn=0-435-32713-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Selbstfahrerstudio-modern.jpg|thumb|An Internet radio studio]]

'''Internet radio''' (also '''web radio''', '''net radio''', '''streaming radio''', '''e-radio''', '''IP radio''', '''online radio''') is a [[digital audio]] service transmitted via the [[Internet]]. Broadcasting on the Internet is usually referred to as [[webcasting]] since it is not transmitted broadly through wireless means. It can either be used as a stand-alone device running through the internet, or as a software running through a single computer system.''' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|title=Method and system for implementing an internet radio device for receiving and/or transmitting media information|date=June 19, 2001|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6249810|inventor-last=Kiraly|inventor-first=Jozsef|issue=US6249810 B1|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet radio is generally used to communicate and easily spread messages through the form of talk. It is distributed through a wireless communication network connected to a switch packet network (the internet) via a disclosed source.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|title=Internet radio communication system|date=July 9, 2002|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6418138|inventor-last=Cerf|inventor2-last=Huddle|inventor-first=Vinton|inventor2-first=Scott|issue=US6418138 B1|accessdate=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet radio involves [[streaming media]], presenting listeners with a continuous stream of audio that typically cannot be paused or replayed, much like traditional broadcast media; in this respect, it is distinct from on-demand file serving. Internet radio is also distinct from [[podcast]]ing, which involves [[downloading]] rather than streaming.

Internet radio services offer news, sports, talk, and various genres of music—every format that is available on traditional [[broadcast radio]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Audio Essentials|last=Fries|first=Bruce|last2=Fries|first2=Marty|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2005|isbn=9780596008567|location=|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Internet radio services are associated with a corresponding traditional (terrestrial) radio station or [[radio network]], although low start-up and ongoing costs have allowed a substantial proliferation of independent Internet-only radio stations.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The first Internet radio service was launched in 1993. As of 2017, the most popular internet radio platforms and applications in the world include (but are not limited to) [[TuneIn Radio]], [[iHeartRadio]], and [[Sirius XM]].

==Internet radio technology==
Internet radio services are usually accessible from anywhere in the world with a suitable internet connection available; one could, for example, listen to an Australian station from Europe and America. This has made internet radio particularly suited to and popular among [[expatriate]] listeners.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Nevertheless, some major networks like [[TuneIn Radio]], [[CBS Radio]], [[Pandora Radio]], [[iHeartRadio]] and [[Citadel Broadcasting]] (except for news/talk and sports stations) in the United States, and [[Chrysalis Group|Chrysalis]] in the United Kingdom, restrict listening to in-country due to music licensing and advertising issues.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Internet radio is also suited to listeners with special interests, allowing users to pick from a multitude of different stations and genres less commonly represented on traditional radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanghoon|first=Jun|date=Spring 2013|title=SmartRadio: Cloning Internet Radio Broadcasting Stations|url=|journal=International Information Institute (Tokyo). Information|volume=16|pages=2701–2709|via=School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listening===
[[File:A Kerbango.jpg|thumbnail|An early [[Kerbango]] [[Internet radio receiver]]]]
Internet radio is typically listened to on a standard home [[personal computer|PC]] or similar device, through an embedded player program located on the respective station's website. In recent years, dedicated devices that resemble and offer the listener a similar experience to a traditional [[radio receiver]] have arrived on the market.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Streaming===
[[Streaming media|Streaming]] technology is used to distribute Internet radio, typically using a [[lossy data compression|lossy]] [[audio codec]]. Streaming audio formats include [[MP3]], [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], [[Windows Media Audio]], [[RealAudio]], and [[HE-AAC]] (or [[aacPlus]]).&lt;ref name="Hoeg"&gt;{{cite book | title=Digital audio broadcasting: principles and applications of DAB, DAB+ and DMB| last=Hoeg|first=Wolfgang|last2=Lauterbach|first2=Thomas |page=26 |publisher=Wiley |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-51037-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0KSa6w3qH4C&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audio data is continuously transmitted serially (streamed) over the local network or internet in [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] [[Packet (information technology)|packets]], then reassembled at the receiver and played a second or two later. The delay is called [[lag]], and is introduced at several stages of digital audio broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeg, p 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulation===
A local tuner simulation program includes all the online radios that can also be heard in the air in the city.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Popularity==

In 2003, revenue from online streaming music radio was US$49 million.  By 2006, that figure rose to US$500 million.&lt;ref name="LastDays" /&gt; A February 21, 2007 "survey of 3,000 Americans released by consultancy Bridge Ratings &amp; Research" found that "[a]s much as 19% of U.S. consumers 12 and older listen to Web-based radio stations."  In other words, there were "some 57 million weekly listeners of Internet radio programs. More people listen to online radio than to satellite radio, high-definition radio, podcasts, or cell-phone-based radio combined."&lt;ref name="LastDays" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The "HD" in "HD radio" actually stands for ''hybrid digital'', not ''high-definition''.  It's hybrid because analog and digital signals are broadcast together.&lt;/ref&gt; An April 2008 Arbitron survey&lt;ref name="Arbitron08"&gt;{{cite web| title=The Infinite Dial 2008: Radio’s Digital Platforms |author=Joe Lensky |author2=Bill Rose | publisher=Arbitron and Edison Research | work=Digital Radio Study 2008| url=http://www.arbitron.com/downloads/digital_radio_study_2008.pdf | format=PDF | date=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that, in the US, more than one in seven persons aged 25–54 years old listen to online radio each week.&lt;ref name="EarthTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1334023/weekly_online_radio_audience_increases_from_11_percent_to_13/index.html |title=Weekly online radio audience increases from 11 percent to 13 percent of Americans in last year, according to the latest Arbitron/Edison media research study|work=Arbitron &amp; Edison Research |publisher=Red Orbit|date=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, 13 percent of the American population listened to the radio online, compared to 11 percent in 2007. Internet radio functionality is also built into many dedicated [[Internet radio device]]s, which give an FM like receiver user experience.

In the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2012, Pandora, TuneIn Radio, iHeart Radio, and other subscription-based and free Internet radio services accounted for nearly one quarter (23 percent) of the average weekly music listening time among consumers between the ages of 13 and 35, an increase from a share of 17 percent the previous year.&lt;ref name="npd.com"&gt;Streaming Music is Gaining on Traditional Radio Among Younger Music Listeners by The [[NPD Group]]: https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/streaming-music-is-gaining-on-traditional-radio-among-younger-music-listeners/&lt;/ref&gt;

As Internet-radio listening rose among the 13-to-35 age group, listening to AM/FM radio, which now accounts for 24 percent of music-listening time, declined 2 percentage points. In the 36-and-older age group, by contrast, Internet radio accounted for just 13 percent of music listening, while AM/FM radio dominated listening methods with a 41 percent share.&lt;ref name="npd.com"/&gt;

Currently, 47% of all Americans ages 12 and older—an estimated 124 million people—said they have listened to online radio in the last month, while 36% (94 million people) have listened in the last week.

== Broadcasting freedoms ==
Some stations, such as [[Primordial Radio]], use Internet radio as a platform as opposed to other means such as [[FM broadcasting|FM]] or [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]], as it gives greater freedom to broadcast as they see fit, without being subject to regulatory bodies such as [[Ofcom]] in the UK. For example, Ofcom has very strict rules about presenters endorsing products and product placement;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0029/35876/adv_sponsorship_code.pdf|title=Radio Sponsorship Rules|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ofcom.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; being an Internet radio station they are free of this constraint.

==History==
Internet radio was pioneered by [[Carl Malamud]]. In 1993, Malamud launched "Internet Talk Radio", which was the "first computer-radio talk show, each week interviewing a computer expert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.media.org/radio/|title=Internet Talk Radio|work=museum.media.org|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On November 7, 1994, [[WXYC]] (89.3 [[Frequency modulation|FM]] [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], USA) became the first traditional radio station to announce broadcasting on the Internet. WXYC used an FM radio connected to a system at SunSite, later known as [[Ibiblio]], running Cornell's [[CU-SeeMe]] software. WXYC had begun test broadcasts and bandwidth testing as early as August 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wxyc.org/about/first/ WXYC's groundbreaking internet simulcast is now 10 years old] November 12, 2004.

In 1995, Scott Bourne founded NetRadio.com as the world's first Internet-only radio network. NetRadio.com was a pioneer in Internet radio. It was the first Internet-only network to be licensed by ASCAP. NetRadio eventually went on to an IPO in October 1999. Most of the current Internet radio providers followed the path that NetRadio.com carved out in digital media.

Internet radio attracted significant media and investor attention in the late 1990s. In 1998, the initial public stock offering for [[Broadcast.com]] set a record at the time for the largest jump in price in stock offerings in the United States.  The offering price was US$18 and the company's shares opened at US$68 on the first day of trading.&lt;ref name="Broadcast.comInNYTimes"&gt;{{cite news

With the advent of streaming RealAudio over HTTP, streaming became more accessible to a number of radio shows. One such show, ''TechEdge Radio'' in 1997, was broadcast in three formats – live on the radio, live from a RealAudio server and streamed from the web over HTTP.In 1998, the longest running internet radio show,&lt;ref name="The Vinyl Lounge"&gt;{{cite web

In 1999, Australian telco "Telstra" launched The Basement Internet Radio Station but it was later shut down in 2003 as it was not a viable business for the company.

From 2000 onwards, most Internet radio stations increased their stream quality as bandwidth became more economical.  Today, most stations stream between 64&amp;nbsp;kbit/s and 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s providing near CD quality audio.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} As of 2017 the [[mobile app]] Radio Garden, a research project of the [[Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision]], was streaming approximately 8,000 radio stations to a global audience.&lt;ref name="Radio Garden"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.creativeapplications.net/js/radio-garden-radio-in-the-age-of-globalisation-and-digitisation/ |title=Radio Garden – Radio in the age of globalisation and digitisation |last=Visnjic |first=Filip |date=2017-07-09 |website=Creative Applications Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US royalty controversy===
In October 1998, the US Congress passed the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), one result of which is that performance royalties are to be paid for [[satellite radio]] and Internet radio broadcasts in addition to publishing royalties.  In contrast, traditional radio broadcasters pay only publishing royalties and no performance royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Internet Radio: The Case for a Technology Neutral Royalty Standard | work=Virginia Law Review | date = December 2009 | accessdate=October 6, 2013 | url=http://www.virginialawreview.org/volumes/content/internet-radio-case-technology-neutral-royalty-standard | first=Andrew | last=Stockment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael Roberts"&gt;Michael Roberts (May 2, 2002).

To focus attention on the consequences of the impending rate hike, many US Internet broadcasters participated in a "Day of Silence" on June 26, 2007.  On that day, they shut off their audio streams or streamed ambient sound, sometimes interspersed with brief [[public service announcement]]s voiced, written and produced by popular voiceover artist Dave Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioprofile.com/savenetradio/ Official SaveNetRadio PSAs &amp; Day Of Silence Network Audio].

[[SoundExchange]], representing supporters of the increase in royalty rates, pointed out that the rates were flat from 1998 through 2005 (see above), without being increased to reflect cost-of-living increases. They also declared that if Internet radio is to build businesses from the product of recordings, the performers and owners of those recordings should receive fair compensation.

On May 1, 2007, SoundExchange came to an agreement with certain large webcasters regarding the minimum fees that were modified by the determination of the [[Copyright Royalty Board]]. While the CRB decision imposed a $500 per station or channel minimum fee for all webcasters, certain webcasters represented through DiMA negotiated a $50,000 "cap" on those fees with SoundExchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Webcasters and SoundExchange Shake Hands | work=BusinessWeek.com | author=Olga Kharif | date = August 23, 2007 | accessdate=August 24, 2007 | url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2007/08/web_radio_and_m.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DiMA and SoundExchange continue to negotiate over the per song, per listener fees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

SoundExchange has also offered alternative rates and terms to certain eligible small webcasters, that allow them to calculate their royalties as a percentage of their revenue or expenses, instead of at a per performance rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SoundExchange Offers Discounted Music Rates To Small Webcasters | work=DigitalMediaWire.com | author=Mark Hefflinger | date=August 22, 2007 | accessdate=August 24, 2007 | url=http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2007/08/22/soundexchange-offers-discounted-music-royalties-to-small-webcasters | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092602/http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2007/08/22/soundexchange-offers-discounted-music-royalties-to-small-webcasters | archivedate=September 29, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To be eligible, a webcaster had to have revenues of less than US $1.25 million a year and stream less than 5 million "listener hours" a month (or an average of 6830 concurrent listeners).&lt;ref&gt;Rusty Hodge, (August 1, 2007) [http://somafm.com/blogs/rusty/2007_08_01_archive.html SoundExchange extends (not very good) offer to small webcasters].

An August 16, 2008 ''Washington Post'' article reported that although Pandora was "one of the nation's most popular Web radio services, with about 1 million listeners daily...the burgeoning company may be on the verge of collapse" due to the structuring of performance royalty payment for webcasters.  "Traditional radio, by contrast, pays no such fee. Satellite radio pays a fee but at a less onerous rate, at least by some measures."  The article indicated that "other Web radio outfits" may be "doomed" for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Whoriskey (August 16, 2008) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/15/AR2008081503367.html Giant Of Internet Nears Its 'Last Stand'].

'''''Landmark Communications v. Virginia''''', 435 U.S. 829 (1978), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case that was argued on January 11, 1978 and decided on May 1, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Abrams, ''Speaking Freely'', published by [[Viking Press]], Page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court reversed a lower court's conviction of the publisher of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]'s ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'' for illegal disclosure of confidential proceedings before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission about a judge's misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=435&amp;invol=829 ''Landmark Communications v. Virginia''], 435 U.S. 829 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Floyd Abrams]] represented [[Landmark Communications]], which owned ''The Virginian-Pilot''. ''The Pilot'' had reported on October 4, 1975, that Judge H. Warrington Sharp, who sat on the [[Virginia Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court]], was under an investigation by a judicial fitness panel. They were deciding whether or not to begin disciplinary proceedings against Sharp.

Under [[Virginia]] statute, each complaint against a judge was to be reviewed in secret; it would be announced only if it deemed serious enough to require a public hearing. All states had confidentiality requirements to avoid use of the disciplinary inquiry as retribution against a judge, but only Virginia and [[Hawaii]] provided for criminal penalties for disclosure.

There was a quick trial and conviction of the publisher of a [[misdemeanor]] and a $500, fine plus the costs of prosecution. Landmark appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]], which affirmed the conviction by 6–1. The court concluded that the "requirement of confidentiality in Commission proceedings" served three purposes:
# protection of the judge's reputation;
# protection of public confidence in the judicial system; and
# protection of complainants and witnesses from possible recriminations.

==Arguments==
Abrams wrote that his primary argument was straightforward: the newspaper published a true account and had obtained the information legally, and the alleged offense was simply reporting a complaint about how a public official performed his civic role. In his brief, Abrams argued that the case raised "anew a question which penetrates to the core of our concept of self-government: whether the press may be punished for printing the truth about a public official with his public duties."

In his memoir ''Speaking Freely'', Abrams stated that it was the first case he argued by himself before the Supreme Court. He continued that he devoted most of their preparation for the case with three overlapping issues, "ones that have consumed my attention in every later Supreme Court argument as well."

The first was jurisprudential: what rule of law would they urge the Court to adopt? What would be its effect as ''[[stare decisis]]'' and its impact on the First Amendment.

The second was tactical. Justices are known for taking up the 30 minutes of allotted argument time with question-and-answer sessions. Abrams felt he needed to figure out his core message.

The Third question was what the court might ask that would be exceptionally difficult to respond to, and what should such responses be?

Assistant [[Attorney General]] James Kulp defended the Virginia Supreme Court opinion with the above-mentioned three reasons for the statute. Justice [[Byron White]] questioned Kulp about whether the case was really about not criticizing public officials, a constitutional right, and whether he would defend a statute calling for confidentiality for protection of the judge. "No, sir," responded Kulp. "I think the cases from this Court have been clear in that respect, that, in other words, a judge, as any public official, may certainly be criticized, the administration of justice may be criticized, and we don't have any argument about that." White said if that was so, his arguments about protection the judiciary and the system held no weight. Kulp agreed.

Virginia's time before the Court dealt with the scope of the statute.

Abrams declined his rebuttal time, as he was confident in Landmark's victory.

"During one exchange, Justice [[William Rehnquist]] asked a question for which Mr. Abrams said he was "totally unprepared," but Justice [[Potter Stewart]] came to his rescue. Of all the justices, Mr. Abrams found Justice Byron R. White the most unnerving. White "invariably asked questions that were both pointed and powerful," he recalls, and Mr. Abrams never once "had the sense that anything I said pleased him." He confides that during [[oral argument]] he often felt like a mouse with "a tormenting cat." Nonetheless, he won a unanimous victory."

"It had been quite an introduction for me to arguing for a complete thirty minutes in the Supreme Court: fifty-four judicial questions and comments. Years later, when I saw [[Albert Brooks]] play a television journalist in Broadcast News who perspired so much when on the air that his shirt looked like he had just returned from a swim, I wondered if I had presented the same appearance after my Landmark argument."

==Decision==
The Court held unanimously in favor of Landmark. Chief Justice Burger wrote the opinion for himself and the other five members (Justices Brennan and Powell recused themselves). The Court did not adopt Abrams's categorical approach (all truth reporting in reference to public duties was insulated from criminal sanctions by the First Amendment). However, the Court rejected the argument that these interests were sufficient grounds for criminal sanctions on nonparticipants in proceedings.

In its conclusion, the Court wrote: "the [clear and present danger] test requires a court to make its own inquiry into the imminence and magnitude of the danger said to flow from the particular utterance and then to balance the character of the evil as well as its likelihood against the need for free and unfettered expression."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6149">In the United States, a '''legal defense fund''' (or LDF) is an account set up to pay for legal expenses, which can include [[Attorneys fees|attorneys' fees]], court filings, litigation costs, legal advice, or other legal fees.  The fund can be public or private and is set up for individuals, organizations, or for a particular purpose. These funds are often used by government public officials, civil rights organizations, and public interest organizations.

Legal defense funds often have large membership counts where the members contribute to the fund.  The fund sometimes is or operates like a [[law firm]], where teams of [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorneys]] provide legal services through litigation.&lt;ref&gt;http://earthjustice.org/about ("Earthjustice is a non-profit public interest law firm"); http://www.celdf.org/about-us (“The Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund is a non-profit, public interest law firm”)&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the name, attorneys working for legal defense funds both file and [[Defense (legal)|defend]] [[lawsuits|lawsuit]]. Unlike [[legal financing]] from legal financing companies, legal defense funds provide a separate account for litigation rather than a one-time cash advancement, though both are used for purposes of financing litigation and legal costs.

==History==
The exact origins of legal defense funds are unclear. In the mid-nineteenth-century United States, a number of minority groups pioneered the practice of amassing funds to cover legal costs associated with their battles for civil rights and civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, Kyle G. (2014). ''[https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Minorities-Making-American-Democracy/dp/0199371911/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1404596908&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=moral+minorities Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy]''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|019937192X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

A government legal defense fund is an account set up to pay for the legal expenses encountered by a person holding government office, or by other public officials. While public figures are undergoing legal proceedings, they may incur large legal fees and face conflict of interest laws that restrict how they may pay for such expenses. A legal defense fund allows third parties to donate monies, with an option for anonymity, to pay for such legal costs.

Many American public figures have employed legal defense funds, including [[Bill Clinton]]&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/1998-02-18/politics/defense.fund_1_legal-bills-clinton-legal-expense-trust-new-fund?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alaska: Palin Defense Fund Is Called Illegal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/us/25brfs-PALINDEFENSE_BRF.html|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=Associated Press|publisher=New York Times|date=24 Jun 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2010, Congressman [[Charlie Rangel]]'s credibility was questioned when he claimed that until very recently he was unaware that the establishment of a legal defense fund was an option he could use to pay for his defense against [[Political corruption|corruption]] charges&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1011/15/acd.01.html&lt;/ref&gt; These funds are governed by [[United States Congress|Congressional]] ethics rules and guidelines from the [[United States Office of Government Ethics|Office of Governmental Ethics]] (OGE), which impose various requirements to limit contributions to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Congressional_legal_defense_fund_regulations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public interest==

[[Public interest]] legal defense funds are [[non-profit organizations]] that use legal services to advance [[environmentalism]], [[animal rights]], [[labor rights]], and other public interests. They file lawsuits, provide free legal assistance to clients, push for legislative reform, and provide public education through seminars, workshops, and other outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aldf.org/section.php?id=3; http://www.celdf.org/about-us; Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Quigg, 932 F.2d 920 (Fed. Cir. 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest legal defense funds include the [[Earthjustice]] Legal Defense Fund (formerly known as the [[Sierra Club]] Legal Defense Fund),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalresearch.org/pubs/pdf/v1233348420.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]], the [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]], the [[National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation]], the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, Life Legal Defense Fund, and the [[National Association of Social Workers]] Legal Defense Fund and many others.

==Civil rights==
[[Civil rights]] legal defense funds are [[non-profit organizations]] that use legal services to advance civil rights.  They often provide legal assistance, advocacy, litigation support, and public education to increase gender and racial equality.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-09-01/news/0509010100_1_legal-defense-fund-naacp-legal-affirmative-action; http://www.theindychannel.com/news/27890295/detail.html; http://empire.wnyc.org/2011/10/civil-rights-advocates-propose-their-own-redistricting-maps/&lt;/ref&gt;  Common issues include equality in the workplace, equality in education, immigration rights, [[suffrage|voting rights]], and violence prevention.&lt;ref&gt;http://aaldef.org/programs/; http://www.legalmomentum.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil rights legal defense funds include the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], the Women's Equity Action League Educational and Legal Defense Fund, and the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund ([[Legal Momentum]]), the [[Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund]], the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund]], and the [[Transgender Legal Defense &amp; Education Fund]] and many others.

'''Missouri State Public Defender''' ('''MSPD''') provides legal representation to all indigent citizens accused of or convicted of crimes in Missouri at the levels of the state trial court, state appellate court, [[Missouri Supreme Court]], and the [[United States Supreme Court]].

==History==
The constitutional requirement for the public defender system at all levels of government was established in 1963 by [[Gideon v. Wainwright]]. The Missouri State Public Defender System was established in 1972. By 1973, there were 14 public defender offices in the state of Missouri. In 1976, the Public Defender Commission was created to appoint full-time public defenders to four-year terms and to oversee the system. Legal representation was provided for felony, juvenile, and misdemeanor cases when the offense charged could result in jail time. By 1977, the total number of public defender offices had reached 18.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.publicdefender.mo.gov/about/history.htm|publisher=Missouri State Public Defender|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, a house bill amended the system with the creation of the Office of State Public Defender (OSPD) as an independent department of the judicial branch of state government. By 1987, 23 public defender offices existed and employed 233 people. The remainder of the state was served by contracts with private attorneys. At that time, the system provided representation in more than 41,000 cases annually.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===Public Defender System funding crisis===
On August 2, 2016, [[Michael Barrett (Missourian public defender)|Michael Barrett]], director of the Missouri State Public Defender System called on Nixon to act as a public defender in a criminal assault case.  Nixon's communications director, Scott Holste, questioned the authority of Barrett to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

The appointment follows a July 2016 legal action in which Barrett et al. challenge the constitutionality of restricting funds for indigent defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 26, 2017, Judge Victor Howard ruled that "because the public defender does not exercise judicial power, a withholding of expenditures to it by the governor (the executive) does not violate the separation of powers doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In an open letter to Nixon, Barrett cites [[Missouri Revised Statues]] Section 600.042.5(1)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] amendments to the [[United States Constitution]] as reason for the controversial action.  Barrett blames Nixon for the underfunding and understaffing of the public defender system and chose to appoint him because he is "the one attorney in the state who not only created the problem, but is in a unique position to address it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Barrett, the funding for "resources that assist with delivering legal services" have increased between 5 and 6% since 2009, while costs over the same period have increased 18%.  The case load has increased over 12% in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 2008 report by the [[National Legal Aid &amp; Defender Association]], Missouri ranks 49th in per capita legal aid spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.''''', 314 U.S. 488 (1942),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.|volume=314|page=488|year=1942}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a patent misuse decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. It was the first case in which the Court expressly labeled as “[[Patent misuse|misuse]]” the ''[[Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co.|Motion Picture Patent]]''&lt;wbr&gt;/&lt;wbr&gt;''[[Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp.|Carbice]]'' tie-in defense to a charge of patent infringement and created the present blanket remedy in infringement cases of unenforceability of the misused patent.&lt;ref&gt;314 U.S. at 493 ("Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated.")&lt;/ref&gt; The decision re-emphasized that misuse can be found without finding an antitrust violation.&lt;ref&gt;314 U.S. at 494 ("It is unnecessary to decide whether respondent has violated the Clayton Act, for we conclude that, in any event, the maintenance of the present suit to restrain petitioner's manufacture or sale of the alleged infringing machines is contrary to public policy, and that the district court rightly dismissed the complaint for want of equity.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Suppiger_salt_dispenser.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Salt dispensing machine at issue in ''Suppiger'' case]]

===Facts===

G.S. Suppiger Co. operated a canning company which had a subsidiary "devoted to making and leasing a patented tablet depositing machine and to making and selling salt tablets of a particular design and configuration." The salt tablets were unpatented, common salt (NaCl) but they had a particular shape to fit the patented salt tablet depositing machine that Suppiger made ("a particular configuration which is required for use in plaintiff's depositing machines for continuous, untroubled use"). Suppiger's leases to canners of tomatoes and other vegetables "included a license to use the patented machine, upon the condition and agreement by the lessee that plaintiff's and its predecessor's salt tablets be used exclusively in said patented, leased machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=G.S. Suppiger Co. v. Morton Salt Co. |vol=117 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=968 |pinpoint=969-70 |court=[[7th Cir.]] |date=1941 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/117/968/1480299/ |accessdate=2018-06-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morton Salt]] Co. was in the same business and made and leased salt tablet depositing machines alleged to infringe the patent, as well as salt tablets for the machines. Morton also provided in its "leases that the lessee shall use only salt tablets made by it." The facts were undisputed.&lt;ref name=Circuit970&gt;117 F.2d at 970.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proceedings in lower courts===

Suppiger sued Morton and the district court dismissed the complaint on summary judgment because of "plaintiff's use of its patent to develop a monopoly of an unpatented article, to-wit, salt tablets."&lt;ref name=Circuit970/&gt; The [[Seventh Circuit]] reversed because Suppiger controlled only a small amount of the salt market by its tie-in:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The volume of all the salt business is large. The amount used in the canning field is so small that its complete control would not result in a monopoly of the salt industry. It is not the salt tablet as such but the salt which goes into the salt tablet which must determine the monopolistic tendency of plaintiff's lease contracts.&lt;ref&gt;117 F.2d at 972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;14, makes certain tie-ins unlawful. "However, unlawfulness is made to depend upon a provision which is here important, where the effect of such lease or such condition may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce." The record did not support a conclusion that Suppiger's tie-in had such an effect.&lt;ref&gt;117 F.2d at 971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morton appealed to the Supreme Court.

==Ruling of the Supreme Court==

[[File:Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone photograph circa 1927-1932.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone]]

Chief Justice [[Harlan Stone]] delivered the opinion of the Court, unanimously reversing the judgment of the Seventh Circuit. He began by stating that the court of appeals misunderstood the relevant issue: "The question we must decide is not necessarily whether respondent has violated the Clayton Act, but whether a court of equity will lend its aid to protect the patent monopoly when respondent is using it as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article."&lt;ref&gt;314 U.S. at 490.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, "nothing turns on the fact that petitioner also competes with respondent in the sale of the tablets, and we may assume for purposes of this case that petitioner is doing no more than making and leasing the alleged infringing machines" subject to a tie-in as to the salt tablets.&lt;ref name=Pin491&gt;314 U.S. at 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

On these facts, Suppiger "is making use of its patent monopoly to restrain competition in the marketing of unpatented articles, salt tablets, for use with the patented machines, and is aiding in the creation of a limited monopoly in the tablets not within that granted by the patent." Suppiger has a patent on the tablet dispensing machine, not on salt tablets. The patent gives it a monopoly "to make, use, and vend the particular device described and claimed in the patent. But a patent affords no immunity for a monopoly not within the grant."&lt;ref name=Pin491/&gt;

The policy of the patent system "includes inventions within the granted monopoly [but] excludes from it all that is not embraced in the invention. It equally forbids the use of the patent to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the Patent Office and which it is contrary to public policy to grant." It is well recognized that "courts of equity may appropriately withhold their aid where the plaintiff is using the right asserted contrary to the public interest."&lt;ref&gt;314 U.S. at 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proper rule in such cases, the Court said, is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where the patent is used as a means of restraining competition with the patentee's sale of an unpatented product, the successful prosecution of an infringement suit, even against one who is not a competitor in such sale, is a powerful aid to the maintenance of the attempted monopoly of the unpatented article, and is thus a contributing factor in thwarting the public policy underlying the grant of the patent. Maintenance and enlargement of the attempted monopoly of the unpatented article are dependent to some extent upon persuading the public of the validity of the patent, which the infringement suit is intended to establish. Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated.&lt;ref&gt;314 U.S. at 493.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reasons for invoking the "[[clean hands]]" doctrine to bar the prosecution of an infringement suit against even one who is not a competitor with the patentee in the sale of the unpatented product (here, salt tablets&lt;ref&gt;The Court assumes here that the relevant market is salt tablets rather than salt, which the Seventh Circuit considered the relevant market.&lt;/ref&gt;) are fundamentally the same as those which bar an infringement suit against a licensee who has violated a condition of the license by using with the licensed machine a competing unpatented article, as in the ''Motion Picture Patents'' case: "It is the adverse effect upon the public interest of a successful infringement suit in conjunction with the patentee's course of conduct which disqualifies him to maintain the suit, regardless of whether the particular defendant has suffered from the misuse of the patent.&lt;ref&gt;314 U.S. at 493-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

These considerations made it unnecessary, the Court added, to decide whether Suppiger had committed an antitrust violation "for we conclude that, in any event, the maintenance of the present suit to restrain petitioner's manufacture or sale of the alleged infringing machines is contrary to public policy, and that the district court rightly dismissed the complaint for want of equity."

==Subsequent development of unenforceability defense==

The ''Suppiger'' case expanded the patent misuse defense from its original rule that a contractual provision considered patent misuse could not be enforced, as in the ''Motion Picture Patents'' tie-in case, to a defense in third party infringement suits, as in ''Suppiger'', where the patentee's use of a tie-in disabled it from enforcing its patent against infringement by Morton. The disability continues until the misuse has been fully "purged" and its effects have fully dissipated.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{ussc|name=B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis|volume=314|page=495|year=1942}}; see also ''Suppiger'', 314 U.S. at 493. ''B.B. Chemical'' was a companion case to ''Suppiger'' that developed more fully the requirement for "purgation" before misuse would stop preventing grant of relief against infringement or collection of royalties.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics have argued that this remedy is too harsh,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Mark A. Lemley, ''Comment, The Economic Irrationality of the Patent Misuse Doctrine'', 78 {{smallcaps|Cal. L. Rev.}} 1599 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and that it should be enough to require the patentee to stop engaging in the abusive conduct. The [[Seventh Circuit]], in ''Panther Pumps &amp; Equipment Co. v. Hydrocraft, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Panther Pumps &amp; Equipment Co. v. Hydrocraft, Inc. |vol=468 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=225 |pinpoint=232 |court=[[7th Cir.]] |date=1972 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/468/225/284068/ |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively limited ''Suppiger'' by holding that violations of the rule in ''[[Lear, Inc. v. Adkins]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lear, Inc. v. Adkins|volume=395|page=653|year=1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; against agreements not to challenge patent validity should not lead to the harsh result of making the patent unenforceable against infringement, because such an agreement was "not the kind of misuse which forecloses recovery of damages" from an infringer. On the other hand, such a rule of lenity may encourage patentees to adopt the principle of "nothing ventured, nothing gained."

'''''National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India''''' is a landmark decision by the [[Supreme Court of India]], which declared [[transgender]] people to be a '[[third gender]]', affirmed that the [[fundamental rights]] granted under the [[Constitution of India]] will be equally applicable to transgender people, and gave them the right to self-identification of their gender as male, female or third-gender. This judgement is a major step towards gender equality in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India recognises transgender people as third gender|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/15/india-recognises-transgender-people-third-gender|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCoy|first=Terrence|title=India now recognizes transgender citizens as ‘third gender’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/04/15/india-now-recognizes-transgender-citizens-as-third-gender/?tid=hp_mm|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court recognizes transgenders as 'third gender'|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Supreme-Court-recognizes-transgenders-as-third-gender/articleshow/33767900.cms|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=Times of India|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark E.

==Parties==
The [[National Legal Services Authority]] of India (NALSA) was the primary petitioner. It had been constituted with the primary objective of providing free legal aid services to the disadvantaged sections of Indian society.&lt;ref&gt;http://nalsa.gov.in/&lt;/ref&gt; The other petitioners in the matter were the Poojya Mata Nasib Kaur Ji Women Welfare Society, a registered society and NGO, and Laxmi Narayan Tripathy, a renowned [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/outtoday/wc40012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527105348/http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/outtoday/wc40012.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bench ==
The case was heard before a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court, composed of Justice [[K. S. Radhakrishnan Panicker|K.S. Panicker Radhakrishnan]] and Justice [[Arjan Kumar Sikri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/outtoday/wc40012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527105348/http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/outtoday/wc40012.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Radhakrishnan had functioned as a Standing Counsel for a number of educational and social organizations and held appointments in the High Courts of Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir and Gujarat before his elevation to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.nic.in/judges/sjud/ksradhakrishnan.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140726042027/http://sci.nic.in/judges/sjud/ksradhakrishnan.htm |archivedate=2014-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Sikri began legal practice in Delhi, specializing in Constitutional cases, Labour and Service matters, and Arbitration matters. Prior to his elevation to the Supreme Court, he held appointments in the Delhi High Court and Punjab and Haryana High Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/rcji/13smsikri.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judgment ==
The Court has directed Centre and State Governments to grant legal recognition of gender identity whether it be male, female or third-gender:

Legal Recognition for Third Gender : In recognizing the third gender category, the Court recognizes that fundamental rights are available to the third gender in the same manner as they are to males and females. Further, non-recognition of third gender in both criminal and civil statutes such as those relating to marriage, adoption, divorce, etc. is discriminatory to the third gender.

Legal Recognition for Persons transitioning within male/female binary : As for how the actual procedure of recognition will happen, the Court merely states that they prefer to follow the psyche of the person and use the "Psychological Test" as opposed to the "Biological Test". They also declare that insisting on Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) as a condition for changing one's gender is illegal.

Public Health and Sanitation : Centre and State Governments have been directed to take proper measures to provide medical care to Transgender people in the hospitals and also provide them separate public toilets and other facilities. Further, they have been directed to operate separate HIV/Sero-surveillance measures for transgender people.

Socio-Economic Rights : Centre and State Governments have been asked to provide the community various social welfare schemes and to treat the community as socially and economically backward classes. They have also been asked to extend reservation in educational institutions and for public appointments.

Stigma and Public Awareness : These are the broadest directions - Centre and State Governments are asked to take steps to create public awareness so that Transgender people will feel that they are also part and parcel of the social life and not be treated as untouchables; take measures to regain their respect and place in society; and seriously address the problems such as fear, shame, gender dysphoria, social pressure, depression, suicidal tendencies and social stigma.

The Court notes that these declarations are to be read in light of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment Expert Committee Report on Issues Relating to transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Expert Committee on the Issues relating to Transgender Persons|url=http://socialjustice.nic.in/transgenderpersons.php|publisher=Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India|accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under national treatment, a [[Sovereign state|state]] that grants particular rights, benefits or privileges to its own [[citizen]]s must also grant those advantages to the citizens of other states while they are in that country.  In the context of [[international agreements]], a state must provide equal treatment to citizens of the other states participating in the agreement. Imported and locally produced goods should be treated equally — at least after the foreign goods have entered the market.&lt;ref name="wtofact"/&gt;

While this is generally viewed as a desirable principle, in custom it conversely means that a state can deprive foreigners of anything of which it deprives its own citizens.  An opposing principle calls for an international minimum standard of justice (a sort of basic [[due process]]) that would provide a base floor for the protection of rights and of access to judicial process.  The conflict between national treatment and minimum standards has mainly played out between [[industrialization|industrialized]] and [[developing nation]]s, in the context of [[expropriation]]s.  Many developing nations, having the power to take control over the property of their own citizens, wished to exercise it over the property of aliens as well.

Though support for national treatment was expressed in several controversial (and legally non-binding) [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolutions, the issue of expropriations is almost universally handled through treaties with other states and contracts with private entities, rather than through reliance upon international custom.

National treatment only applies once a product, service or item of intellectual property has entered the market. Therefore, charging customs duty on an import is not a violation of national treatment even if locally produced products are not charged an equivalent tax.&lt;ref name="wtofact"/&gt;

==GATT/WTO==

National treatment is an integral part of many [[World Trade Organization]] agreements. Together with the [[most favoured nation]] principle, national treatment is one of the cornerstones of WTO trade law.  It is found in all 3 of the main WTO agreements (GATT, GATS and TRIPS).&lt;ref name="wtofact"/&gt;

National treatment is a basic principle of GATT/WTO that prohibits discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods with respect to internal taxation or other government regulation. The principle of national treatment is formulated in Article 3 of the GATT 1947&lt;ref&gt;The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/gatt47_01_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; (and incorporated by reference in GATT 1994); Article 17 of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); and in Article 3 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The aim of this trade rule is to prevent internal taxes or other regulations from being used as a substitute for tariff protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good summary is found in Japan-Alcohol&lt;ref&gt;Report of the WTO Appellate Body 1994 http://www.worldtradelaw.net/reports/wtoab/japan-alcohol(ab).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which states; "[a] national treatment obligation is a general prohibition on the use of internal taxes and other internal regulatory measures so as to afford protection to domestic production".

{{Globalize/Eng|date=November 2017}}
'''Nuisance''' (from archaic ''nocence'', through Fr. ''noisance'', ''nuisance'', from Lat. ''nocere'', "to hurt") is a [[common law]] [[tort]]. It means that which causes offence, [[annoyance]], trouble or injury. A nuisance can be either public (also "common") or private. A [[public nuisance]] was defined by English scholar Sir J. F. Stephen as,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"an act not warranted by law, or an omission to discharge a legal duty, which act or omission obstructs or causes inconvenience or damage to the public in the exercise of rights common to all Her Majesty's subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Sir J. F. Stephen, ''Digest of the Criminal Law'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Private nuisance'' is the interference with the right of specific people. Nuisance is one of the oldest [[causes of action]] known to the common law, with cases framed in nuisance going back almost to the beginning of recorded [[case law]]. Nuisance signifies that the "right of quiet enjoyment" is being disrupted to such a degree that a [[tort]] is being committed.

==Definition==
{{Tort law}}
Under the common law, persons in possession of [[real property]] (land owners, lease holders etc.) are entitled to the '''quiet enjoyment''' of their lands. However this doesn't include visitors or those who aren't considered to have an interest in the land. If a neighbour interferes with that quiet enjoyment, either by creating smells, sounds, [[pollution]] or any other hazard that extends past the boundaries of the property, the affected party may make a claim in nuisance.

Legally, the term ''nuisance'' is traditionally used in three ways: 
# to describe an activity or condition that is harmful or annoying to others (e.g., indecent conduct, a rubbish heap or a smoking chimney)
# to describe the harm caused by the before-mentioned activity or condition (e.g., loud noises or objectionable odors)
# to describe a legal liability that arises from the combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821A cmt. b (1979). Originally developed as a private tort tied to the land, a nuisance action was generally brought when a person interfered with another's "use or enjoyment of land."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the "interference" was not the result of a neighbor stealing land or trespassing on the land. Instead, it arose from activities taking place on another person's land that affected the enjoyment of that land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuisancelaw.com/sites/default/files/uploads/Virginia%20Law%20Review.pdf "William L. Prosser, Private Action for Public Nuisance, 52 Va. L. Rev. 997, 997 (1966)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of nuisance was created to stop such bothersome activities or conduct when they unreasonably interfered either with the rights of other private landowners (i.e., private nuisance) or with the rights of the general public (i.e., [[public nuisance]])

A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with the public's right to property. It includes conduct that interferes with public health, safety, peace or convenience. The unreasonableness may be evidenced by statute, or by the nature of the act, including how long, and how bad, the effects of the activity may be.&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821B&lt;/ref&gt;

Private nuisance arose out of the action on the case and protects a person’s right to the use and enjoyment of their land.&lt;ref&gt;Sappideen, C (Carolyn), Torts: Commentary and Materials (Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited, 12 ed, 2016) 771.&lt;/ref&gt; It doesn't include trespass.&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821D&lt;/ref&gt;

To be a nuisance, the level of interference must rise above the merely aesthetic.  For example: if your neighbour paints their house purple, it may offend you; however, it doesn't rise to the level of nuisance.  In most cases, normal uses of a property that can constitute quiet enjoyment cannot be restrained in nuisance either.  For example, the sound of a crying baby may be annoying, but it is an expected part of quiet enjoyment of property and does not constitute a nuisance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}Nuisance distinguishes between cases where the conduct alleged to be a nuisance has caused material injury to property and the cases where it has caused “sensible personal discomfort”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=St Helen’s Smelting v Tipping |year=1865 |court=UKHL |num=J81 |parallelcite=(1865) 11 HLC 642; 11 ER 1483 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any affected property owner has standing to sue for a private nuisance. If a nuisance is widespread enough, but yet has a public purpose, it is often treated at law as a public nuisance. Owners of interests in real property (whether owners, lessors, or holders of an easement or other interest) have standing only to bring private nuisance suits. According to ''Oldham v Lawson''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|69|1976|litigants=Oldham v Lawson (No 1) |parallelcite=[1976] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 654 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (where held that the husband has a mere licence and had no title to sue whereas his wife as owner did have title to sue) and some later cases, exclusive possession is necessary to establish a private nuisance case. However, one situation related to transform a private nuisance against land to one against person, this case is no longer considered to be authoritative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Khorasandjian v Bush |year=1993 |court= EWCA |division=Civ |num=18 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[1993] [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 727}}, was overruled by the House of Lords in {{cite BAILII |litigants=Hunter v Canary Wharf Pty Ltd |year=1997 |court= UKHL |num=14 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[1997] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 655}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and legal development==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the law of nuisance became difficult to administer, as competing property uses often posed a nuisance to each other, and the cost of litigation to settle the issue grew prohibitive.  As such, most jurisdictions now have a system of [[land use planning]] (e.g. [[zoning]]) that describes what activities are acceptable in a given location.  Zoning generally overrules nuisance.  For example: if a factory is operating in an industrial zone, neighbours in the neighbouring residential zone can't make a claim in nuisance. Jurisdictions without zoning laws essentially leave land use to be determined by the laws concerning nuisance.

Similarly, modern environmental laws are an adaptation of the doctrine of nuisance to modern complex societies, in that a person's use of his property may harmfully affect another's property, or person, far from the nuisance activity, and from causes not easily integrated into historic understandings of nuisance law.

==Remedies==
Under the common law, the only [[Legal remedy|remedy]] for a nuisance was the payment of [[damages]].  However, with the development of the courts of equity, the remedy of an [[injunction]] became available to prevent a defendant from repeating the activity that caused the nuisance, and specifying punishment for [[contempt]] if the defendant is in breach of such an injunction.

The [[law and economics]] movement has been involved in analyzing the most efficient choice of remedies given the circumstances of the nuisance. In ''[[Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.]]'' a cement plant interfered with a number of neighbors, yet the cost of complying with a full injunction would have been far more than a fair value of the cost to the plaintiffs of continuation. The New York court allowed the cement plant owner to 'purchase' the injunction for a specified amount—the permanent damages. In theory, the permanent damage amount should be the [[net present value]] of all future damages suffered by the plaintiff.

===Inspector of Nuisances===
An Inspector of Nuisances was the title of an office in several English-speaking jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions this term is now archaic, the position and/or term having been replaced by others. In medieval England it was an office of the Courts Leet and later it was also  a parochial office concerned with local action against a wide range of 'nuisances' under the common law: obstructions of the highway, polluted wells, adulterated food, smoke, noise, smelly accumulations, eavesdropping, peeping toms, lewd behaviour, and many others. In the United Kingdom from the mid- 19th century this office became associated with solving public health and sanitation problems, with other types of nuisances being dealt with by the local constables.

The first Inspector of Nuisances appointed by a UK local authority Health Committee was [[Thomas Fresh]]  in Liverpool in 1844. Liverpool later promoted a private Act, the Liverpool Sanatory (sic) Act 1846, that created a statutory post of Inspector of Nuisances. This became the precedent for later local and national legislation. In local authorities that had established a Board of Health under the Public Health Act 1848, or under local Acts implementing the Towns Improvement Clauses Act of 1847, the title was 'Inspector of Nuisances'. The 1855 Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act and the Metropolis Management Act 1855 (via section 134) mandated such an office but with the title of 'Sanitary Inspector'. So in some places the title was 'Sanitary Inspector' and in others 'Inspector of Nuisances'. Eventually the title was standardized across all UK local authorities as 'Sanitary Inspector'. An Act of Parliament in 1956 changed the title to 'Public Health Inspector'. Similar offices were established across the British Commonwealth and Empire.

The nearest modern equivalent of this position in the UK is the Environmental Health Officer. This title being adopted by local authorities on the recommendation of Central Government after the Local Government Act 1972. Today, Registered UK Environmental Health Officers working in non-enforcement roles (e.g. in the private sector) may prefer to use the generic term 'Environmental Health Practitioner'.

In [[New South Wales]] the NSW Public Health Act 1896 gave the NSW Board of Health power to establish 'standards of strength and purity for articles of general consumption', to appoint analysts, and 'to cause to be made such enquiries as it thinks fit in relation to any matters concerning the public health'. Inspectors under the new Act were known as Inspectors of Nuisances, but were later renamed 'sanitary inspectors'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/aboutus/history/eraend.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513171127/http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/aboutus/history/eraend.asp |archive-date=13 May 2016 |title=An era ends |publisher=NSW Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a modern example of an officer with the title 'Inspector of Nuisances' but not the public health role is found in Section 3767[7] of the Ohio Revised Code which defines such a position to investigate nuisances, where this term broadly covers establishments in which lewdness and alcohol are found. Whereas in the United States the environmental health officer role is undertaken by local authority officers with the titles 'Registered Environmental Health Specialist' or 'Registered Sanitarian' depending on the jurisdiction.

==Law related to nuisance, by country==

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Nuisance in English law}}
The boundaries of the [[tort]] are potentially unclear, due to the public/private nuisance divide, and existence of the rule in [[Rylands v Fletcher]]. Writers such as John Murphy at Lancaster University have popularised the idea that ''Rylands'' forms a separate, though related, tort. This is still an issue for debate, and is rejected by others (the primary distinction in ''Rylands'' concerns 'escapes onto land', and so it may be argued that the only difference is the nature of the ''nuisance'', not the nature of the civil ''wrong''.)

Under English law, unlike US law, it is no defence that the claimant "came to the nuisance": the 1879 case of [[Sturges v Bridgman]] is still good law, and a new owner can bring a claim in nuisance for the existing activities of a neighbour. In February 2014 the UK Supreme Court ruling in the case of Coventry v Lawrence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Coventry v Lawrence |year=2014 |court= UKSC |num=13 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[2014] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 822}}.&lt;/ref&gt; prompted the launch of a campaign&lt;ref&gt;http://www.steamin.in/RDC/Petition.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to have the "coming to a nuisance" law overturned. Campaigners hold that established lawful activity continuing with planning permission and local residents' support should be accepted as part of the character of the area by any new residents coming to the locality.

===United States===

Many states have limited instances where a claim of nuisance may be brought. Such limitation often became necessary as the sensibilities of urban dwellers were offended by smells of agricultural waste when they moved to rural locations. For example: many states and provinces have "right to farm" provisions, which allow any agricultural use of land zoned or historically used for [[agriculture]].

There are two classes of nuisance under the American law: a nuisance in fact, or "nuisance per accidens", and a nuisance ''per se''. The classification determines whether the claim goes to the jury, or gets decided by the judge. An alleged nuisance in fact is an issue of fact to be determined by the jury, who will decide whether the thing (or act) in question created a nuisance, by examining its location and surroundings, the manner of its conduct, and other circumstances.&lt;ref name="Sunland"&gt;City of Sunland Park v. Harris News, Inc., 2005-NMCA-128, 45, 124 P.3d 566, 138 N.M. 58 (citing 58 AM.JUR.2D NUISANCES § 21)&lt;/ref&gt;  A determination that something is a nuisance in fact also requires proof of the act and its consequences.&lt;ref name="Sunland" /&gt;

By contrast, a nuisance per se is "an activity, or an act, structure, instrument, or occupation which is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings."&lt;ref&gt;Id.  40 (citing State ex rel. Village of Los Ranchos v. City of Albuquerque, 119 N.M. 150, 164, 889 P.2d 185, 199 (1994))&lt;/ref&gt;  Liability for a nuisance per se is absolute, and injury to the public is presumed; if its existence is alleged and established by proof, it is also established as a matter of law.&lt;ref&gt;See 58 AM.JUR.2D NUISANCES § 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, a judge would decide a nuisance per se, while a jury would decide a nuisance in fact.

Most nuisance claims allege a nuisance in fact, for the simple reason that not many actions or structures have been deemed to be nuisances per se. In general, if an act, or use of property, is lawful, or authorized by competent authority, it cannot be a nuisance ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;See 58 AM.JUR.2D NUISANCES § 20&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the act in question must either be declared by public statute, or by case law, to be a nuisance ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;State v. Davis, 65 N.M. 128, 132, 333 P.2d 613, 616 (1958); See also Sunland Park, 2005-NMCA-128, 47&lt;/ref&gt; There are few state or federal statutes or case law declaring actions or structures to be a nuisance in and of themselves. Few activities or structures, in and of themselves and under any and all circumstances, are a nuisance; which is how courts determine whether or not an action or structure is a nuisance ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;Koeber, 72 N.M. at 5, 380 P.2d at 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last 1000 years, public nuisance has been used by governmental authorities to stop conduct that was considered quasi-criminal because, although not strictly illegal, it was deemed unreasonable in view of its likelihood to injure someone in the general public. Donald Gifford&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=193 "Donald G. Gifford"], Research Professor of Law at the University of Maryland School of Law&lt;/ref&gt; argues that civil liability has always been an "incidental aspect of public nuisance".&lt;ref&gt;Donald G. Gifford, Public Nuisance as a Mass Products Liability Tort, 71 U. Cin. L. Rev. 741, 781 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, actionable conduct involved the blocking of a public roadway, the dumping of sewage into a public river or the blasting of a stereo in a public park.&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Second) of Torts § 821A cmt. b (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; To stop this type of conduct, governments sought injunctions either enjoining the activity that caused the nuisance or requiring the responsible party to abate the nuisance.

In recent decades, however, governments blurred the lines between public and private nuisance causes of action.  [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]] noted this in 1966 and warned courts and scholars against confusing and merging the substantive laws of the two torts. In some states, his warning went unheeded and some courts and legislatures have created vague and ill-defined definitions to describe what constitutes a public nuisance. For example, Florida's Supreme Court has held that a public nuisance is any thing that causes "annoyance to the community or harm to public health."&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, [http://www.nuisancelaw.com/learn/historical#PNL "Public Nuisance Law: An Historical Perspective"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary example of a nuisance law in the United States is the Article 40 Bylaw of Amherst, Massachusetts known as the Nuisance House Bylaw. The law is voted on by members of the town at town meetings. The stated purpose of such a law is "In accordance with the Town of Amherst’s Home Rule Authority, and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the Town, this bylaw shall permit the Town to impose liability on owners and other responsible persons for the nuisances and harm caused by loud and unruly gatherings on private property and shall discourage the consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons at such gatherings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amherstnoise.weebly.com/nuisance-house-bylaw.html|title=Amherst Noise By-Law - Nuisance House Bylaw|website=amherstnoise.weebly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the law works so that if one member of the neighborhood feels that there is  a neighbor's noise level is annoying or excessively loud, that neighbor is instructed to inform the town police so that they can respond to the location of the noise. "The responding officer has some discretion in how to deal with the noise complaint.... When determining the appropriate response, the officer may take many factors into consideration, such as the severity of the noise, the time of day, whether the residents have been warned before, the cooperation of the residents to address the problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amherstnoise.weebly.com/enforcement.html|title=Amherst Noise By-Law - Enforcement|website=amherstnoise.weebly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amherstma.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=66&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used less formally in the United States to describe the non-meritorious nature of [[frivolous litigation]]. A lawsuit may be described as a "nuisance suit", and a [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]] a "nuisance settlement", if the [[defendant]] pays money to the [[plaintiff]] to drop the case primarily to spare the cost of litigation, rather than because the suit would have a significant likelihood of winning.

==Environmental nuisance==
In the field of environmental science, there are a number of phenomena which are considered nuisances under the law, including most notably noise, water and light pollution. Moreover there are some issues that are not necessarily legal matters that are termed environmental nuisance; for example, an excess population of insects or other vectors may be termed a "nuisance population" in an ecological sense.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan, ed. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/American_kestrel ''American Kestrel''. Encyclopedia of Earth, U.S. National Council for Science and the Environment, Ed-in-chief C.Cleveland]&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of environmental nuisance litigations, it is hard for someone to be successful in this area due to the standing requirements of private and public nuisance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sappideen|first1=Carolyn|last2=Vines|first2=Prue|last3=Watson|first3=Penelope|title=Torts commentary and materials|date=2012|publisher=Thomson Reuters|location=Sydney|isbn=9780455230436|page=754|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the Court's opinion that legislation should regulate this area.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Collieries Plc [1994] 1 All ER 53, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly, in Australia, all the jurisdictions have such kind of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|epa1997284|Environmental Protection Act 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|epaaa1979389|Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Britannica 1911==
&lt;!-- This needs to be edited for relevance and amalgamated into the rest of the article.--&gt;
A common nuisance is punishable as a misdemeanour at common law, where no special provision is made by statute. In modern times, many of the old common law nuisances have been the subject of legislation. It's no defence for a master or employer that a nuisance is caused by the acts of his servants, if such acts are within the scope of their employment, even though such acts are done without his knowledge, and contrary to his orders. Nor is it a defence that the nuisance has been in existence for a great length of time, for no lapse of time will legitimate a public nuisance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|loc=Nuisance}}

A private nuisance is an act, or omission, which causes inconvenience or damage to a private person, and is left to be redressed by action. There must be some sensible diminution of these rights affecting the value or convenience of the property. "The real question in all the cases is the question of fact, whether the annoyance is such as materially to interfere with the ordinary comfort of human existence" ([[Lord Romilly]] in ''[[Crump v. Lambert]]'' (1867) L.R. 3 Eq. 409). A private nuisance, differing in this respect from a public nuisance, may be legalized by uninterrupted use for twenty years. It used to be thought that, if a man knew there was a nuisance and went and lived near it, he couldn't recover, because, it was said, it is he that goes to the nuisance, and not the nuisance to him. But this has long ceased to be law, as regards both the remedy by damages, and the remedy by injunction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|loc=Nuisance}}

The remedy for a public nuisance is by information, indictment, summary procedure or abatement. An information lies in cases of great public importance, such as the obstruction of a navigable river by piers. In some matters, the law allows the party to take the remedy into his own hands, and to "abate" the nuisance. Thus; if a gate be placed across a highway, any person lawfully using the highway may remove the obstruction, provided that no breach of the peace is caused thereby. The remedy for a private nuisance is by injunction, action for damages or abatement. An action lies in every case for a private nuisance; it also lies where the nuisance is public, provided that the plaintiff can prove that he has sustained some special injury. In such a case, the civil is in addition to the criminal remedy. In abating a private nuisance, care must be taken not to do more damage than is necessary for the removal of the nuisance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|loc=Nuisance}}

In Scotland, there's no recognized distinction between public and private nuisances. The law as to what constitutes a nuisance is substantially the same as in England. A list of statutory nuisances will be found in the [[Public Health (Scotland) Act 1867]], and amending acts. The remedy for nuisance is by interdict, or action.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|loc=Nuisance}}

'''Open government''' is the governing [[doctrine]] which holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings of the government to allow for effective public [[Regulation|oversight]].&lt;ref name="ruma"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Lathrop |editor2-first=Laurel |editor2-last=Ruma |title= Open Government: Transparency, Collaboration and Participation in Practice |publisher= O'Reilly Media |date=February 2010  |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24435672M/Open_Government |isbn= 978-0-596-80435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its broadest construction it opposes [[national interest|reason of state]] and other considerations, which have tended to legitimize extensive state [[secrecy]]. The origins of open government arguments can be dated to the time of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]: to debates about the proper construction of a then nascent [[democratic society]].

The concept of Open Government is broad in scope but is most often connected to ideas of government transparency and accountability. One definition, published by The Quality of Government institute at the University of Gothenburg, limits government openness to information released by the government, or the extent to which citizens can request and receive information that is not already published.&lt;ref&gt;https://qog.pol.gu.se/digitalAssets/1418/1418047_2012_16_bauhr_grimes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Harlan Yu and David G. Robinson specify the distinction between [[Open data|Open Data]] and open government in their paper “The New Ambiguity of “Open Government”. They define open government in terms of service delivery and public accountability. They argue that technology can be used to facilitate disclosure of information, but that the use of open data technologies does not necessarily equate accountability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Harlan|last2=Robinson|first2=David G.|date=February 28, 2012|title=The New Ambiguity of 'Open Government'|ssrn=2012489|journal=UCLA L. Rev|volume=59|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OECD]] approaches open government through the following categories: whole of government coordination, civic engagement and access to information, budget transparency, integrity and the fight against corruption, use of technology, and local development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/open-government.htm|title=Open Government|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'open government' originated in the United States after World War II. Wallace Parks, who served on a subcommittee on Government Information created by the U.S. Congress, introduce the term in his 1957 article “The Open Government Principle: Applying the Right to Know under the Constitution.” After this and after the passing of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, federal courts began using the term as a synonym for government transparency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although this was the first time that ‘open government’ was introduced the concept of transparency and accountability in government can be traced back to Ancient Greece in fifth century B.C.E. Athens where different legal institutions regulated the behavior of officials and offered a path for citizens to express their grievances towards them. One such institution, the euthyna, held officials to a standard of “straightness” and enforced that they give an account in front of an Assembly of citizens about everything that they did that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Dornum|first=Deirdre Dionysia|date=June 1997|title=The Straight and the Crooked: Legal Accountability in Ancient Greece|jstor=1123441|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=97|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent history, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to [[public opinion]] dates back to the time of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when many ''[[philosophe]]s'' made an attack on [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] doctrines of state secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere'' (1962, trans., Cambridge Massachusetts, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinhart Koselleck, ''Critique and Crisis'' (1965, trans., Cambridge Massachusetts, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of formal legislature can also be traced to this time with [[Sweden]], for example, (which then included [[Finland]] as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution ([[Freedom of the Press]] Act, 1766).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/~slamble/freedom_of_information.html |last=Lamble |first=Stephen |date=February 2002 |title=Freedom of Information, a Finnish clergyman’s gift to democracy |publisher=Freedom of Information Review |volume=97 |pages=2–8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001204513/http://members.optusnet.com.au/~slamble/freedom_of_information.html |archivedate=2010-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and [[freedom of the press]] in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by [[Metternich]]ean statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, including [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]].

Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary [[democracy|democratic]] practice and is often linked to the passing of [[freedom of information]] legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).

Government transparency is beneficial for efficient democracy, as information helps citizens form meaningful conclusions about upcoming legislation and vote for them in the next election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment|title=Transparency and Open Government|website=The White House|access-date=2016-12-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215181923/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/TransparencyandOpenGovernment|archivedate=2016-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], greater citizen participation in government is linked to government transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/10/20/accountability-transparency-participation-and-inclusion-new-development-consensus-pub-56968|title=Accountability, Transparency, Participation, and Inclusion: A New Development Consensus?|last=Carothers|first=Thomas|website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of open government often argue that [[civil society]], rather than government [[legislation]], offers the best route to more transparent administration. They point to the role of [[whistleblowers]] reporting from inside the government bureaucracy (individuals like [[Daniel Ellsberg]] or [[Paul van Buitenen]]). They argue that an independent and inquiring press, printed or electronic, is often a stronger guarantor of transparency than legislative checks and balances.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael, ''The Politics of Secrecy: Confidential Government and the Public's Right to Know'' (London, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Theoharis, ed., ''A Culture of Secrecy: the Government Versus the People's Right to Know'' (Kansas, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary doctrine of open government finds its strongest advocates in [[non-governmental organisations|non-governmental organizations]] keen to counter what they see as the inherent tendency of government to lapse, whenever possible, into secrecy. Prominent among these NGOs are bodies like ''[[Transparency International]]'' or the ''[[Open Society Institute]]''. They argue that standards of openness are vital to the ongoing prosperity and development of democratic societies.

Critics of government transparency argue that transparency leads to government indecision, poor performance and gridlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-critics-of-transparency-are-wrong/|title=Why Critics of Transparency are Wrong|last=Bass|first=Gary|last2=Brian|first2=Danielle|date=November 2014|website=www.brookings.edu|access-date=|last3=Eisen|first3=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Frum writes in an article for the Atlantic, “instead of yielding more accountability, however, these reforms [transparency reforms] have yielded more lobbying, more expense, more delay, and more indecision.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/09/the-transparency-trap/375074/|title=The Transparency Trap|last=Frum|first=David|date=September 2014|website=theatlantic.com|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Grumet argues that government officials cannot properly deliberate, collaborate and compromise when everything they are doing is being watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/laws-aimed-at-transparency-have-hindered-serious-debate/2014/10/02/7c5eb022-48dd-11e4-b72e-d60a9229cc10_story.html|title=When sunshine doesn’t always disinfect the government|last=Grumet|first=Jason|date=October 2, 2014|website=washingtonpost.com|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, open government initiatives may raise privacy concerns. In her article, Teresa Scassa outlines three main possible privacy challenges. First, the difficulty of  balancing further transparency of government, while also protecting the privacy of personal information, or information about identifiable individuals that is in the hands of the government. Second, is dealing with distinctions between data protection regulations between private and public sector actors because governments may access information collected by private companies which are not controlled by as stringent laws. Third, is the release of "Big data", which may appear anonymized can be reconnected to specific individuals using sophisticated algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scassa|first=Teresa|date=June 18, 2014|title=Privacy and Open Government|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263423589_Privacy_and_Open_Government|journal=Future Internet|volume=|pages=|issn=1999-5903|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern for protecting citizens' privacy so they are not exposed to "adverse consequences, retribution or negative repercussions"&lt;ref name="ruma" /&gt; from information provided by governments.

A number of scholars have questioned the moral certitude behind much transparency advocacy, questioning the foundations upon which advocacy rests. They have also highlighted how transparency can support certain neoliberal imperatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Garsten|first=C.|title=Transparency in a New Global Order:Unveiling Organizational Visions|year=2008|publisher=Edward Elger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and open government ==
See also [[Open data|Open Data]]

Governments and organizations are using new technologies as a tool for increased transparency. Examples include use of [[open data]] platforms to publish information online and the theory of [[open source governance]].

Open Government Data (OGD), a term which refers specifically to the public publishing of government datasets,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/digital-government/open-government-data.htm|title=Open Government Data|last=|first=|date=|website=oecd.org|access-date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often made available through online platforms such as data.gov.uk or www.data.gov. Proponents of OGD argue that easily accessible data pertaining to governmental institutions allows for further citizen engagement within political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/6/2/397/pdf|title=Privacy and Open Government|last=Scassa|first=Teresa|date=June 18, 2014|website=Future Internet|publisher=Future Internet|access-date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; OGD principles require that data is complete, primary, timely, accessible, machine processable, non-discriminatory, non-proprietary, and license free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomes|first=Alvaro|last2=Soares|first2=Delfina|date=October 2014|title=Open government data initiatives in Europe: northern versus southern countries analysis|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2691246|journal=ICEGOV '14 Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance|volume=|pages=342–350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public and private sector platforms provide an avenue for citizens to engage while offering access to transparent information that citizens have come to expect. Numerous organizations have worked to consolidate resources for citizens to access government (local, state and federal) budget spending, stimulus spending, lobbyist spending, legislative tracking, and more.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano Koch &amp; Maximilian Rapp: Open Government Platforms in Municipality Areas: Identifying elemental design principles, In: Public Management im Paradigmenwechsel, Trauner Verlag, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

* [[Open Government Partnership]] - OGP was an organization launched in 2011 to allow domestic reformers to make their own governments across the world more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens. Since 2011, OGP has grown to 75 participating countries today whose government and civil societies work together to develop and implement open government reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/|title=Open Government Partnership|website=Open Government Partnership|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Code for All]] - Code for All is a non-partisan, non-profit international network of organizations who believe technology leads to new opportunities for citizens to lead a more prominent role in the political sphere and have a positive impact on their communities. The organizations relies on technology to improve government transparency and engage citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://codeforall.org/|title=Code for All|website=Code for All|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sunlight Foundation]] - The Sunlight Foundation is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded in 2006 that uses civic tech, open data, and policy analysis to make information from government and politics more transparent to everyone. Their ultimate vision is to increase democratic participation and achieve changes on political money flow and who can influence government. While their work began with an intent to focus only on the [[US Congress]], their work now influences the local, state, federal, and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sunlightfoundation.com/|title=Sunlight Foundation|website=Sunlight Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Open Government Pioneers UK is an example of a civil society led initiative using open source approaches to support citizens and civil society organisations use open government as a way to secure progress towards the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. It uses an Open Wiki to plan the development of an open government civil society movement across the UK's home nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opengovpioneers.miraheze.org|title=Open Government Pioneers UK|website=Opengovpioneers|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Primary}}
The political history of the [[world]] is the history of the various [[Politics|political entities]] created by the [[human race]] throughout their existence and the way these states define their borders. Throughout history, political entities have expanded from basic systems of [[self-governance]] and [[monarchy]] to the complex [[democracy|democratic]] and totalitarian systems that exist today. In parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type  [[Border|boundaries]], to the national definite boundaries existing today.

==Ancient history==
&lt;!-- Reference, may be useful later on &lt;ref name="ancienttimeline"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baigent |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Baigent |title=Ancient Traces: Mysteries in Ancient and Early History |date=1998 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=0-670-87454-X |pages=117–119 |chapter=Where Did Our Civilization Come From?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;In ancient history, [[Ancient civilizations|civilizations]] did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as [[frontier]]s. [[Sumer#Early Dynastic Period|Early dynastic Sumer]], and [[Ancient Egypt#Early Dynastic Period|early dynastic Egypt]] were the [[first civilization]]s to define their [[border]]s. Moreover, for the past 200,000 years and up to the twentieth century, many people have lived in non-state societies. These range from relatively egalitarian [[Band society|bands]] and [[tribe]]s to complex and highly stratified [[chiefdom]]s.

The first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the [[Uruk period]] and [[Predynastic Egypt]] respectively at approximately 3000BCE.&lt;ref name="ancientlocations"&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniel |first=Glyn |authorlink=Glyn Daniel |title=The First Civilizations: The Archaeology of their Origins |origyear=1968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx9FAAAAMAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=New York |isbn=1-84212-500-1 |pages=xiii |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early dynastic [[Egypt]] was based around the [[Nile River]] in the north-east of [[Africa]], the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where [[oasis|oases]] existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniel |first=Glyn |authorlink=Glyn Daniel |title=The First Civilizations: The Archaeology of their Origins |origyear=1968 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx9FAAAAMAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=New York |isbn=1-84212-500-1 |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early dynastic [[Sumer]] was located in southern [[Mesopotamia]] with its borders extending from the [[Persian Gulf]] to parts of the [[Euphrates River|Euphrates]] and [[Tigris River|Tigris]] [[river]]s.&lt;ref name="ancientlocations"/&gt;

By 2500 BCE the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], located in modern-day India, Pakistan and Afghanistan had formed. The civilization's boundaries extended 600&amp;nbsp;km inland from the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Patrica S |author2=Stephen G Hyslop |author3=[[Douglas Brinkley]] |author4=Esther Ferington |author5=Lee Hassig |author6=Dale-Marie Herring |editor=Toni Eugene |title=Almanac of World History |year=2003 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |isbn=0-7922-5092-3 |pages=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5gPAQAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

336 BCE saw the rise of [[Alexander the Great]], who forged an empire from various vassal states stretching from modern [[Greece]] to the Indian subcontinent, bringing Mediterranean nations into contact with those of central and southern Asia, much as the Persian Empire had before him. The boundaries of this empire extended hundreds of kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=de Blois |first=Lukas |author2=[[Robartus van der Spek]] |title=An Introduction to the Ancient World |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, US |isbn=0-415-12773-4 |pages=131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9o3Ti6H2_BQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Empire (27 BCE - 476 CE) was the first western civilization known to accurately define their borders, although these borders could be more accurately described as frontiers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wrt-intertext.syr.edu/IX/arras.html |title=A World Defined By Boundaries |accessdate=2008-11-21 |work=Intertext |publisher=Syracuse University |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the Empire defining its borders with precision, the borders were allowed to trail off and were, in many cases, part of territory indirectly ruled by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=David H |author2=Jouni Häkli |title=Boundaries and Place: European Borderlands in Geographical Context |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edb-7VL6H0cC |year=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8476-9883-1 |pages=19 |chapter=The 'Civilisational' Roots of European National Boundaries |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=edb-7VL6H0cC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman and Greek ideals of nationhood can be seen to have strongly influenced Western views on the subject, with the basis of many governmental systems being on authority or ideas borrowed from Rome or the Greek city-states. Notably, the European states of the Dark Ages and Middle Ages gained their authority from the Roman Catholic religion, and modern democracies are based in part on the example of Ancient Athens.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

After the death of Prophet [[Muhammad]] in 632, the [[Quran]] and the teachings of [[Islam]] inspired the genesis of a new civilization. In less than a century, the Islamic [[Caliphate]] rapidly extended its reach from the Atlantic Ocean and Andalusia in the west to Central Asia in the east. The subsequent [[Muslim]] empires of the [[Umayyads]], [[Abbasids]], [[Fatimids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuqs]], [[Safavids]], [[Mughals]], and [[Ottomans]] were among the most influential and distinguished powers in the world during Middle Ages. The period between the 8th and 13th century saw a flourishing of trade, as well as several advances in science, engineering, medicine and mathematics.
In Western Europe, briefly mostly united into a single state under [[Charlemagne]] around 800CE, a few countries, including [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]], had already effectively become [[nation state]]s by 1,000CE, with a kingdom ([[Icelandic Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] in Iceland's case) largely co-terminus with a people mostly sharing a language and culture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Over most of the continent, the peoples were emerging around ethnic, linguistic and geographical groups, but this was not reflected in political entities. In particular, [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]], though recognised by other nations as countries where the [[French people|French]], [[Italian people|Italians]] and [[German people|Germans]] lived, did not exist as states largely matching the countries for centuries, and struggles to form them, and define their borders, as states were a major cause of wars in Europe until the 20th century. In the course of this process, some countries, such as [[Poland]] under the [[Partitions of Poland|Partitions]] and [[France]] in the [[High Middle Ages]], almost ceased to exist as states for periods. The [[Low Countries]], in the Middle Ages as distinct a country as France, became permanently divided, today into [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. [[Spain]] was formed as a nation state by the dynastic union of small Christian kingdoms, augmented by the final campaigns of the [[Reconquista]] against [[Al-Andaluz]], the vanished country of Islamic [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

200 years after the Aztec and Toltec empires began, northern and central [[Asia]] saw the rise of the [[Mongol]] empire.

Exploiting opportunities left open by the Mongolian advance and recession as well as the spread of Islam, Russians took control of their homeland around 1613, after many years being dominated by the Tartars (Mongols). After gaining independence, the Russian princes began to expand their borders under the leadership of many [[tsars]].&lt;ref name="almanac"/&gt; Notably, [[Catherine the Great]] seized the vast western part of [[Ukraine]] from the [[Poles]], expanding Russia's size massively.

In the 15th and 16th centuries three major [[Muslim]] empires formed: the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empire in the Middle East, the Balkans and Northern Africa; the [[Safavid Empire]] in Greater Iran; and the [[Mughul]] Empire in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of [[gunpowder]] and more efficient administration. By the end of the 19th century, all three had declined, and by the early 20th century, with the Ottomans' defeat in [[World War I]], the last Muslim empire collapsed.

In 1700, [[Charles II of Spain]] died, naming [[Phillip of Anjou]], [[Louis XIV]]'s grandson, his heir. Charles' decision was not well met by the British, who believed that Louis would use the opportunity to ally [[France]] and [[Spain]] and attempt to take over Europe. Britain formed the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] with [[Holland]], [[Austria]] and a majority of the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]] and declared war against Spain in 1702. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] lasted 11 years, and ended when the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] was signed in 1714.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frey|first=Marsha|author2=Linda Frey|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1995|edition=illustrated|isbn=0-313-27884-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrJmCvFY6ocC|accessdate=2009-01-29|title=The Treaties of the War of the Spanish Succession}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than 50 years later, in 1740, war broke out again, sparked by the invasion of [[Silesia]], part of [[Austria]], by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]]. Britain, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Hungary]] supported [[Maria Theresa]].

'''Prioritarianism''' or the '''priority view'''&lt;ref name=Parfit1997&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parfit |first=Derek |title=Equality and priority |journal=Ratio |volume=10 |issue=3 |date=December 1997 |pages=202–221 |doi=10.1111/1467-9329.00041}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a view within [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]] that holds that the goodness of an outcome is a function of overall [[well-being]] across all individuals with extra weight given to worse-off individuals. Prioritarianism resembles [[utilitarianism]]. Like [[utilitarianism]], prioritarianism is a form of aggregative [[consequentialism]]; however, it differs in that it does not weight the [[well-being]] of all individuals equally, but instead prioritizes those individuals that are worse-off.

The term "prioritarianism" was coined by moral philosopher [[Larry Temkin]] in an effort to explicate the theory's non-egalitarian form.  [[Richard Arneson]], a proponent of the view,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Arneson |title=Luck Egalitarianism and Prioritarianism |journal=Ethics |volume=110 |issue=2 |date=January 2000 |pages=339–349 |doi=10.1086/233272}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers the following formulation:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Prioritarianism holds that the moral value of achieving a benefit for an individual (or avoiding a loss) is greater, the greater the size of the benefit as measured by a well-being scale, and greater, the lower the person's level of well-being over the course of her life apart
from receipt of this benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Arneson, Richard, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/egalitarianism/ Egalitarianism]", The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like utilitarians, prioritarians believe in maximizing moral value or goodness, provided that the latter consists in more than just overall well-being. Prioritarianism says that benefits to the worse off matter more than benefits to the better off.

== Distinction from utilitarianism ==

To further sharpen the difference between [[utilitarianism]] and prioritarianism, imagine a two-person society:  its only members are Jim and Pam. Jim has an extremely high level of well-being, is rich, and lives a blissed-out existence.  Pam, by contrast, has an extremely low level of well-being, is in extreme poverty, living a hellish existence.  Now imagine that we have some free resources (say, $10,000) that we may distribute to the members of this society as we see fit.  Under normal circumstances, due to the [[diminishing marginal utility]] of money, the $10,000 will generate more well-being for Pam than it will for Jim.

Thus, under normal circumstances, a utilitarian would recommend giving the resources to Pam. However, imagine that Jim, for whatever reason, although already very well-off, would gain just as much well-being by receiving the $10,000 as would Pam.  Now, since it makes no
difference in terms of overall well-being who gets the $10,000, [[utilitarians]] would say it makes no difference at all who gets the $10,000.  Prioritarians, by contrast, would say that it is better to benefit Pam, the worse off individual.

== Advantages ==

Prioritarianism does not merely serve as a "tie-breaker" (as in the case above), but it can go against overall utility. Suppose there are two outcomes. In outcome 1, Jim's well-being level is 110 (blissful); Pam's is -73 (hellish); overall well-being is 37. In outcome 2, Jim's well-being level is 23; Pam's well-being level is 13; overall well-being is 36.  Prioritarians would say that if their prioritarian views were sufficiently strong, outcome 2 is better or more desirable than outcome 1 despite being lower than outcome 1 in terms of overall well-being.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Bringing Pam up by 86 has more moral value than bringing Jim down by 87 if a sufficiently higher weight is given to improvements in condition for the worst off (Pam), but if the added weight is small (very weak priority), that might not be the case. If one could move from a society described by outcome 1 to one described by outcome 2, under sufficiently strong prioritarianism, that ought to be done. Prioritarianism is arguably more consistent with commonsense moral thinking than [[utilitarianism]] when it comes to these kinds of cases, especially because of the prioritarian's emphasis on [[compassion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crisp |first=Roger |title=Equality, Priority, and Compassion |journal=Ethics |volume=113 |issue=4 |date=July 2003 |pages=145–63 |doi=10.1086/373954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also arguably more consistent with common sense than radical forms of [[egalitarianism]] that value only equality.  Such a view might say that if the only way to achieve equality is by bringing Jim down from 110 to -73, it ought to be done. Prioritarianism does not accord any [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] to equality of well-being across individuals and would not regard a move toward a more equal distribution of well-being as better if the worse off did not benefit.&lt;ref name=Parfit1997/&gt;

In addition to having potential advantages over utilitarianism and [[radical egalitarianism]] (as noted above), prioritarianism also avoids some putatively embarrassing implications of a related view, the [[maximin principle]] (also note [[John Rawls|Rawls]]'s [[difference principle]]).&lt;ref&gt;A Theory of Justice. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The maximin principle ranks outcomes solely according to the well-being of the worst-off member of a society. It can thus be viewed as an extreme version of prioritarianism. Imagine choosing between two outcomes: in outcome 1, Jim's well-being level is 1; Pam's well-being level is 100; Dwight's well-being level is 100 (one could add an indefinite number of people with indefinitely high well-being levels). In outcome 2, Jim's well-being level is 2; Pam's well-being level is 3; Dwight's well-being level is 3. Many of us would part ways with the maximin principle and judge that outcome 1 is better than outcome 2 despite the fact that the worst-off member (Jim) has a lower level of well-being in outcome 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harsanyi |first=J. C. |date=June 1975 |title=Can the Maximin Principle Serve as a Basis for Morality? A Critique of John Rawls's Theory |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=594–606 |jstor=1959090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections  ==

Objections to prioritarianism include many of the standard objections that adhere to aggregative [[consequentialism]], for instance, the [[repugnant conclusion]]&lt;ref&gt;Ryberg, Jesper, Tännsjö, Torbjörn, Arrhenius, Gustaf, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/repugnant-conclusion/ The Repugnant Conclusion]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (fall 2008 edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; and related objections based on the apparent implausibility of certain trade-offs (if there is some very large number of mild headaches such that it would be worse to bring about these mild headaches than the protracted and intense torture of an innocent person).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Norcross |first=Alastair |year=1998 |title=Great Harms from Small Benefits Grow: How Death can be Outweighed by Headaches |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=152–158 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.2.152 |jstor=3328486}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also objections to quantifying, measuring, or making interpersonal comparisons of [[well-being]], that strike against most if not all forms of aggregative consequentialism, including prioritarianism.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Another objection to prioritarianism concerns ''how much'' weight should be given to the well-being of the worse off. There may be issues of arbitrariness or "sloppy [[intuitionism]]" lurking there. Prioritarians are faced with the potentially awkward task of balancing overall well-being against priority.  Any theory that leaves any room for judgment in particular cases is also susceptible to that kind of objection about sloppiness or arbitrariness. A prioritarian might claim that how much weight should be given to the well-being of the worse off is something to be worked out in [[reflective equilibrium]], or that if weights cannot be determined exactly, there is a range of weights that is acceptable or justifiable.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A [[utilitarian]] (or radical [[egalitarian]]) might also claim that their theory is more [[parsimonious]] than prioritarianism (which values well-being and priority). However, a prioritarian might, in response, argue that even a putatively genuinely [[monistic]] [[utilitarianism]] like [[hedonistic]] [[utilitarianism]] is not fully mechanized (and perhaps not even genuinely monistic) as it still requires judgment, as when it comes to balancing various pleasures against various pains.&lt;ref&gt;On the last point, see [[W.D. Ross]], [[Foundations of Ethics]], p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68970">Regarding [[privacy]] concerns with the technology corporation [[Google]], Google's privacy change (March 1, 2012) enables the company to share data across a wide variety of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/|title=Google Privacy Policy |date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These embedded services include millions of third-party websites that use [[AdSense|Adsense]] and [[Analytics]].  The policy was widely criticized for creating an environment that discourages Internet-innovation by making Internet users more fearful and wary of what they put online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/03/05/will-we-ever-get-strong-internet-privacy-rules/?xid=gonewsedit|title=Will We Ever Get Strong Internet Privacy Rules?|date=March 5, 2012|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around December 2009, after privacy concerns were raised, Google's CEO [[Eric Schmidt]] declared: "If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that [[Web search engine|search engines]]—including Google—do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the [[Patriot Act]] and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/07/schmidt_on_privacy/|title=Google chief: Only miscreants worry about net privacy |last=Cade|first=Metz |date=December 7, 2009 |work=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Privacy International]] has raised concerns regarding the dangers and privacy implications of having a centrally located, widely popular data warehouse of millions of Internet users' searches, and how under controversial existing U.S. law, Google can be forced to hand over all such information to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].&lt;ref name=BBC11June2011&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6740075.stm |work=BBC News | title=Google ranked 'worst' on privacy | date=June 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2007 Consultation Report, Privacy International ranked Google as "Hostile to Privacy", its lowest rating on their report, making Google the only company in the list to receive that ranking.&lt;ref name=BBC11June2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/internet/interimrankings.pdf "Consultation Report: Race to the Bottom? 2007"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612031502/http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/internet/interimrankings.pdf |date=2007-06-12 }}, Privacy International, June 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delichatsios, Stefanie Alki; Sonuyi, Temitope, [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/google.pdf "Get to Know Google...Because They Know You"], MIT, Ethics and Law on the Electronic Frontier, 6.805, December 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Techonomy Media|Techonomy]] conference in 2010, Eric Schmidt predicted that "true transparency and no anonymity" is the path to take for the internet: "In a world of asynchronous threats it is too dangerous for there not to be some way to identify you. We need a [verified] name service for people. Governments will demand it." He also said that, "If I look at enough of your messaging and your location, and use artificial intelligence, we can predict where you are going to go. Show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are. You think you don't have 14 photos of yourself on the internet? You've got Facebook photos!"&lt;ref name="thinq.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thinq.co.uk/2010/8/5/no-anonymity-future-web-says-google-ceo/ |title=No anonymity on future web says Google CEO |publisher=THINQ.co.uk |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |date=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2016, [[Google]] quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its [[DoubleClick]] ad service. Google's privacy policy was changed to state it "may" combine web-browsing records obtained through [[DoubleClick]] with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the "Activity controls" in the "My Account" page of a Google account. ''ProPublica'' states that "The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct." Google contacted ''ProPublica'' to correct the fact that it doesn't "currently" use Gmail keywords to target web ads.&lt;ref name="2016 DoubleClick change"/&gt;

==Potential for data disclosure==

===Data leaks===
On March 10, 2009, Google reported that a bug in Google Docs had allowed unintended access to some private documents. It was believed{{By whom|date=January 2016}} that 0.05% of all documents stored via the service were affected by the bug.  Google stated the bug has now been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Google software bug shared private online documents |url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/google-software-bug-shared-private-online-documents-20090310-8tup.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=10 March 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cookies===
Google places one or more [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] on each user's computer, which is used to track a person's web browsing on a large number of unrelated websites, and track their search history.  If you are logged into a Google service, Google also uses the cookies to record which Google Account is accessing each website and doing each search. Originally the cookie did not expire until 2038, although it could be manually deleted by the user or refused by setting a browser preference.&lt;ref name=agger&gt;{{cite web

|date=October 10, 2007
|accessdate=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Google's cookie expired in two years, but renewed itself whenever a Google service is used.&lt;ref name=agger/&gt; As of 2011, Google said that it anonymizes the IP address data that it collects, after nine months, and the association between cookies and web accesses after 18 months.&lt;ref name=privacyfaq&gt;[https://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html "Privacy FAQ"], Google, accessed October 16, 2011 and December 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2016, Google's privacy policy does not promise anything about whether or when its records about your web browsing or searching are deleted from its records.&lt;ref name=privacyfaq /&gt;

The non-profit group Public Information Research launched Google Watch, a website advertised as "a look at Google's monopoly, algorithms, and privacy issues."&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sherman |first1=Chris |title=Google power: unleash the full potential of Google |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SRadJIuhVjAC&amp;dq=Google+Power;+Unleash+the+Full+Potential+of+Google&amp;q=Daniel+Brandt#v=snippet&amp;q=Daniel%20Brandt |accessdate=June 13, 2010 |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Emeryville, California |isbn=0-07-225787-3 |page=415 |quote=...a look at Google's monopoly, algorithms, and privacy issues.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Breaking/Google-critic-releases-source-code-for-proxy/2005/01/12/1105423537735.html |title=Google critic releases source code for proxy |work=The Age |first=Sam |last=Varghese |date=January 12, 2005 |accessdate=October 11, 2008 | location=Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site raised questions relating to Google's storage of cookies, which in 2007 had a life span of more than 32 years and incorporated a unique ID that enabled creation of a [[data logger|user data log]].&lt;ref name=agger /&gt; Google faced criticism with its release of [[Google Buzz]], Google's version of social networking, where Gmail users had their contact lists automatically made public unless they opted out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2010/02/google-buzz--facebook-in-gmail/1 | work=USA Today | title=Google adds Facebook-like features to Gmail | date=February 9, 2010 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 | first=Jefferson | last=Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google shares this information with law enforcement and other government agencies upon receiving a request.  The majority of these requests do not involve review or approval by any court or judge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/ "Transparency Report: User Data Requests"], Google. Retrieved December 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tracking===
Google is suspected of collecting and aggregating data about Internet users through the various tools it provides to developers, such as [[Google Analytics]], [[Google Fonts]], and [[Google Code|Google APIs]]. This could enable Google to determine a user's route through the Internet by tracking the [[IP address]] being used through successive sites (cross-domain web tracking). Linked to other information made available through Google APIs, which are widely used, Google might be able to provide a quite complete web user profile linked to an IP address or user. This kind of data is invaluable for marketing agencies, and for Google itself to increase the efficiency of its own marketing and advertising activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Report from Dagstuhl: the liberation of mobile location data and its implications for privacy research|date = April 2013|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2505398|volume = 17|journal = SIGMOBILE Mobile Computing and Communications Review|publisher = ACM|issue = 2|pages = 7–18|doi = 10.1145/2505395.2505398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google encourages developers to use their tools and to communicate end-user IP addresses to Google: "Developers are also encouraged to make use of the userip parameter to supply the IP address of the end-user on whose behalf you are making the API request. Doing so will help distinguish this legitimate server-side traffic from traffic which doesn't come from an end-user."&lt;ref&gt;[https://developers.google.com/web-search/docs/ "Developer's Guide"], ''Google Web Search API'', July 26, 2012. Retrieved October 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the light of new data protection laws and privacy regulations in Europe (2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj|title=EUR-Lex - 32016R0679 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, developers started to create plugins for an integration of Google services like Google Analytics in ways that respect user privacy choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.robert-matthees.de/ecommerce/easy-ga/|title=easy-ga.js - How to Set Up Google Analytics for Opt-Out/In Cookies &amp; Do-not-Track Browser-Settings|last=Matthees|first=Robert|website=www.robert-matthees.de|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the support of [[Do Not Track]] browser settings, [[opt-out]] cookies and methods like tracking by opt-in.

Google Inc. claims that mail sent to or from Gmail is never read by a human being other than the account holder, and content that is read by computers is only used to improve the relevance of advertisements and block spam emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html|title=Privacy Policy|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy policies of other popular email services, like [[Outlook.com]] and [[Yahoo]], allow users' personal information to be collected and utilized for advertising purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/details.html|title=Yahoo Privacy Policy|publisher=|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.aspx#collection|title=Microsoft Privacy Statement|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, thirty-one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://privacyrights.org/ar/GmailLetter.htm|publisher=Privacy Rights Clearinghouse|title=Thirty-One Privacy and Civil Liberties Organizations Urge Google to Suspend Gmail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding [[data retention]] and data sharing among its business units. The organizations voiced their concerns about Google's plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider.

In 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wingfield |first=Nick |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/microsoft-attacks-google-on-gmail-privacy/?smid=tw-nytimesbits&amp;seid=auto |title=Microsoft Attacks Google on Gmail Privacy - NYTimes.com |publisher=Bits.blogs.nytimes.com |date=February 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy "Google's kryptonite."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Other concerns include the unlimited period for data retention that Google's policies allow, and the potential for unintended secondary uses of the information Gmail collects and stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epic.org/privacy/gmail/faq.html#13 "What privacy risks are presented by Gmail?"], ''Gmail Privacy FAQ'', Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). Retrieved October 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A court filing uncovered by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog in August 2013 revealed that Google stated in a court filing that no "reasonable expectation" exists among Gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails. According to the British Newspaper, The Guardian, "Google's court filing was referring to users of other email providers who email Gmail users{{snd}} and not to the Gmail users themselves".&lt;ref name="Rushe" /&gt; In response to a lawsuit filed in May 2013, Google explained:

{{quote|... all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing ...  Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient's assistant opens the letter, people who use web-based email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipient's ECS [electronic communications service] provider in the course of delivery.&lt;ref name="Rushe" /&gt;}}
 
A Google spokesperson stated to the media on August 15, 2013 that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of Gmail users "very seriously."&lt;ref name="Rushe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Google: Gmail users shouldn't expect email privacy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/14/google-gmail-users-privacy-email-lawsuit|accessdate=August 14, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 15, 2013|author=Dominic Rushe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIA and NSA ties===
In February 2010, Google was reported to be working on an agreement with the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to investigate recent attacks against its network. And, while the deal did not give NSA access to Google's data on users' searches or e-mail communications and accounts and Google was not sharing proprietary data with the agency, privacy and civil rights advocates were concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/02/google-seeks-nsa-help/ "Google Asks NSA to Help Secure Its Network"], Kim Zetter, ''Wired'', February 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/02/from-dont-be-evil-to-spy-on-everyone/ "'Don’t Be Evil,' Meet 'Spy on Everyone': How the NSA Deal Could Kill Google"], Noah Shachtman, ''Wired'', February 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, Google acquired [[Keyhole, Inc|Keyhole]], a 3D mapping company. In February 2004, before its acquisition by Google, Keyhole received an investment from [[In-Q-Tel]], the [[CIA]]'s investment arm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/10/28/google_buys_keyhole/ "Google buys CIA-backed mapping startup"], Andrew Orlowski, ''The Register'', October 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; And in July 2010 it was reported that the investment arms of both the CIA (In-Q-Tel) and Google ([[Google Ventures]]) were investing in [[Recorded Future]], a company specializing in [[predictive analytics]]—monitoring the web in real time and using that information to predict the future. And, while private corporations have been using similar systems since the 1990s, the involvement of Google and the CIA with their large data stores raised privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/exclusive-google-cia/#ixzz0v7drHZhm "Google, CIA Invest in 'Future' of Web Monitoring"], Noah Shachtman, ''Wired'', July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-jacobson/google-and-cia-invest-in_b_664525.html "Google and CIA Invest in a Minority Report-Like Technology That May Make Our World a Less Certain Place"], Bob Jacobson, ''Huffington Post'', July 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a federal district court judge in the United States turned down a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request, submitted by the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]. In May 2012, a [[Court of Appeals]] upheld the ruling. The request attempted to disclose NSA records regarding the [[Operation Aurora|2010 cyber-attack on Google users in China]]. The NSA stated that revealing such information would make the US Government information systems vulnerable to attack. The NSA [[Glomar response|refused to confirm or deny]] the existence of the records, or the existence of any relationship between the NSA and Google.&lt;ref name=USAToday-nsa-spy-china&gt;{{cite news|title=Court rules that Google-NSA spy ties can remain secret|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-05-11/court-google-nsa-spy-china/54912902/1|accessdate=May 14, 2012|date=May 11, 2012|agency=The Associated Press|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google has denied the existence of any "government backdoor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/06/google-facebook-apple-deny-participation-in-nsa-prism-program/ |title=Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Yahoo, Microsoft And Apple Deny Participation In NSA PRISM Surveillance Program |work=Tech Crunch |date=June 6, 2013 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government requests===
Google has been criticized both for disclosing too much information to governments too quickly and for not disclosing information that governments need to enforce their laws. In April 2010, Google, for the first time, released details about how often countries around the world ask it to hand over user data or to censor information.&lt;ref name=Shiels-20Apr2010&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8633642.stm "Google reveals government data requests and censorship"], Maggie Shiels, ''BBC News'', April 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Online tools make the updated data available to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/governmentrequests/ "Government Requests"], Google Transparency Report, accessed October 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Between July and December 2009, Brazil topped the list for user data requests with 3,663, while the US made 3,580, the UK 1,166, and India 1,061. Brazil also made the largest number of requests to remove content with 291, followed by Germany with 188, India with 142, and the US with 123. Google, who stopped offering search services in China a month before the data was released, said it could not release information on requests from the Chinese government because such information is regarded as a state secret.&lt;ref name=Shiels-20Apr2010/&gt;

Google's chief legal officer said, "The vast majority of these requests are valid and the information needed is for legitimate criminal investigations or for the removal of child pornography".&lt;ref name=Shiels-20Apr2010/&gt;

===Google Chrome===
In 2008, [[Consumer Watchdog]] produced a video showing how [[Google Chrome]] records what a user types into the [[URL|web address]] field and sends that information to Google servers to populate search suggestions. The video includes discussion regarding the potential privacy implications of this feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtech.com/security/Consumer-Watchdog-Exposes-Google-Privacy-Problems.html "Consumer Watchdog Exposes Google Privacy Problems "], Digital Communities, November 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncerhCLi2o0 "How Google Chrome Doesn't protect Privacy"], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- There is no mention of keylogging in the cited article.

===Incognito browsing mode===
[[Google Chrome]] includes a [[privacy mode|private browsing]] feature called "incognito browsing mode" that prevents the browser from permanently storing any [[web browsing history|browsing or download history]] information or [[HTTP cookie|cookies]]. Using incognito mode prevents tracking by the browser. However, the individual websites visited can still track and store information about visits. In particular any searches performed while signed into a Google account will be saved as part of the account's web history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95464&amp;hl=en |title=Incognito Mode (browse in private) |publisher=Google |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, other programs such as those used to [[Streaming media|stream media files]], which are invoked from within Chrome, may still record history information, even when incognito mode is being used. Furthermore, a limitation of Apple's iOS 7 platform allows some information from incognito browser windows to leak to regular Chrome browser windows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/3/4797968/chrome-for-ios-incognito-mode-not-private-bug "Chrome for iOS' incognito mode isn't private, bug reveals"], Tom Warren, ''The Verge'', [[Vox Media, Inc.]], October 3, 2013. Retrieved November 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerns that these limitations may have led Chrome users to believe that incognito mode provides more privacy protection than it actually does.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vpnexpress.net/google-chrome-incognito-mode/ "Google Chrome Incognito Mode"], VPN Express, August 8, 2013.

==Street View==
{{Main |Google Street View |Google Street View privacy concerns}}

Google's online map service, [[Google Street View|"Street View"]], has been accused of taking pictures and viewing too far into people's private homes and/or too close to people on the street when they do not know they are being photographed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/13/google_grills_privacy_buff/ "EFF lawyer is smokin' on Google Street View"], Dan Goodin, The Register, June 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/article1858476.ece "All-seeing Google Street View prompts privacy fears"], Times Online, June 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==WiFi networks information collection==
During 2006–10, Google Streetview camera cars collected about 600 gigabytes of data from users of unencrypted public and private [[Wi-Fi]] networks in more than 30 countries. No disclosures nor privacy policy was given to those affected, nor to the owners of the Wi-Fi stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Google-grabs-personal-info-apf-2162289993.html?x=0 |title="Google grabs personal info off of Wi-Fi networks" |accessdate=2011-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528181755/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Google-grabs-personal-info-apf-2162289993.html?x=0 |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |df= }}, Michael Liedtke, AP, May 14, 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Google apologized and said that they were "acutely aware that we failed badly here" in terms of privacy protection, that they were not aware of the problem until an inquiry from German regulators was received, that the private data was collected inadvertently, and that none of the private data was used in Google's search engine or other services. A representative of [[Consumer Watchdog]] replied, "Once again, Google has demonstrated a lack of concern for privacy. Its computer engineers run amok, push the envelope and gather whatever data they can until their fingers are caught in the cookie jar." In a sign that legal penalties may result, Google said it will not destroy the data until permitted by regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Google-grabs-personal-info-apf-2162289993.html?x=0 |title="Google grabs personal info off of Wi-Fi networks" |accessdate=2011-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528181755/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Google-grabs-personal-info-apf-2162289993.html?x=0 |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |df= }}, Michael Liedtke (AP), Yahoo!

The Streetview data collection prompted several lawsuits in the United States. The suits were consolidated into one case before a California federal court. Google's motion to have the case dismissed, saying the Wi-Fi communications it captured were "readily accessible to the general public" and therefore not a violation of federal wiretapping laws, was rejected in June 2011 by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and upon appeal in September 2013 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The ruling is viewed as a major legal setback for Google and allows the case to move back to the lower court for trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/technology/court-says-privacy-case-can-proceed-vs-google.html "Court Says Privacy Case Can Proceed vs. Google"], David Streitfeld, ''New York Times'', September 10, 2013.

==Google Buzz==
{{Main |Google Buzz}}

On February 9, 2010, Google launched [[Google Buzz]], Google's microblogging service. Anyone with a Gmail account was automatically added as a contact to pre-existing Gmail contacts, and had to opt out if they did not wish to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2010/02/google-buzz–facebook-in-gmail/1 | work=USA Today | title=Google adds Facebook-like features to Gmail | date=February 9, 2010 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 | first=Marc | last=Saltzman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of Google Buzz as an "opt-out" social network immediately drew criticism for violating user privacy because it automatically allowed Gmail users' contacts to view their other contacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/home/technology/article/15547473 "Google's Buzz 'Has Serious Privacy Flaws'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518045253/http://news.sky.com/home/technology/article/15547473 |date=2012-05-18 }}, Roddy Mansfield, Sky News Online, February 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the United States Federal Trade Commission initiated a Commission proceeding against respondent Google, Inc., alleging that certain personal information of Gmail users was shared without consumers' permission through the Google Buzz social network.&lt;ref name=Maggs  /&gt;

* Using real names online can disadvantage or endanger some individuals, such as victims of violence or harassment. The policy prevents users from protecting themselves by hiding their identity.

==Do Not Track==
{{Main|Do Not Track|Do Not Track Policy|Google Chrome}}

In April 2011, Google was criticized for not signing onto the [[Do not track header|Do Not Track]] feature for Chrome that was being incorporated in most other modern web browsers, including [[Firefox]], Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera. Critics pointed out that a new patent Google was granted in April 2011, for greatly enhanced user tracking through web advertising, will provide much more detailed information on user behavior and that ''do not track'' would hurt Google's ability to exploit this. Software reviewer Kurt Bakke of ''Conceivably Tech'' wrote:

{{quote|Google said that it intends to charge advertisers based on click-through rates, certain user activities and a pay-for-performance model. The entire patent seems to fit Google's recent claims that Chrome is critical for Google to maintain search dominance through its Chrome web browser and Chrome OS and was described as a tool to lock users to Google's search engine and{{snd}} ultimately{{snd}} its advertising services. So, how likely is it that Google will follow the do-not-track trend? Not very likely.&lt;ref name="Bakke18Apr11" /&gt;}}

Mozilla developer Asa Dotzler noted: "It seems pretty obvious to me that the Chrome team is bowing to pressure from Google's advertising business and that's a real shame. I had hoped they'd demonstrate a bit more independence than that."&lt;ref name="Bakke18Apr11"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.conceivablytech.com/6863/products/chrome-shields-websites-from-denial-of-service-attacks|title = Chrome Shields Websites From Denial-Of-Service Attacks|accessdate = April 20, 2011|last = Bakke|first = Kurt|date = April 2011|work = Conceivably Tech|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110419181334/http://www.conceivablytech.com/6863/products/chrome-shields-websites-from-denial-of-service-attacks|archivedate = April 19, 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakke19Apr11"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.conceivablytech.com/6891/business/google-menu-ad-tracking-a-case-of-bad-timing|title = Google Menu Ad Tracking: A Case Of Bad Timing?|accessdate = April 20, 2011|last = Bakke|first = Kurt|date = April 2011|work = Conceivably Tech|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110426004142/http://www.conceivablytech.com/6891/business/google-menu-ad-tracking-a-case-of-bad-timing|archivedate = April 26, 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dotzler14Apr11"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2011/04/chrome_do_not_track.html|title = Chrome, Do Not Track, and Google Advertising|accessdate = April 20, 2011|last = Dotzler|first = Asa|date = April 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110423060325/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2011/04/chrome_do_not_track.html|archivedate = April 23, 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the criticisms, Google argued that the technology is useless, as advertisers are not required to obey the user's tracking preferences and it remains unclear as to what constitutes tracking (as opposed to storing statistical data or user preferences). As an alternative, Google continues to offer an extension called "Keep My Opt-Outs" that permanently prevents advertising companies from installing cookies on the user's computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hhnjdplhmcnkiecampfdgfjilccfpfoe |title =Keep My Opt-Outs, Chrome Web Store |accessdate =June 19, 2011 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110507231456/https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hhnjdplhmcnkiecampfdgfjilccfpfoe |archivedate =May 7, 2011 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction to this extension was mixed. Paul Thurrott of ''Windows IT Pro'' called the extension "much, much closer to what I've been asking for—i.e. something that just works and doesn't require the user to figure anything out—than the IE or Firefox solutions" while lamenting the fact that the extension is not included as part of the browser itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://winsupersite.com/news/daily-update-googles-do-not-track-solution-apple-stuff-crysis-2-demo-more |title = Daily Update: Google's Do Not Track Solution, Apple Stuff, Crysis 2 Demo, More|accessdate =April 22, 2011|last = Thurrott|first = Paul|date=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Google announced that Chrome will incorporate a ''Do Not Track'' feature by the end of 2012, and it was implemented in early November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://browserfame.com/478/google-chrome-support-do-not-track |title = Google and Chrome To Support Do Not Track |accessdate = March 3, 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120226042318/http://browserfame.com/478/google-chrome-support-do-not-track |archivedate = February 26, 2012 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Pól Mac and Douglas J. (2016) in their study “Don’t Let Google Know I’m Lonely”, presented strong evidence that the two giant techs have very high accuracy while providing results based on user's sensitive entries.  Pól Mac and Douglas J. (2016) specifically focused on user's financial and sexual preferences and they have concluded that "For Google, 100% of user sessions on a sensitive topic reject the hypothesis that no learning of the sensitive topic by the search engine has taken place and so are identified as sensitive. For Bing, the corresponding detection rate is 91%."&lt;ref&gt;Aonghusa, P. M., &amp; Leith, D. J. (2016). Don’T Let Google Know I’M Lonely. ACM Trans. Priv.

The service was launched in 2003 by Google critic Daniel Brandt, who was concerned about Google collecting personal information on its users.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Scroogle offered a web interface and browser plugins for [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], and [[Internet Explorer]] that allowed users to run Google searches anonymously.  The service [[Web scraping|scraped]] Google search results, removing ads and sponsored links.  Only the raw search results were returned, meaning features such as page preview were not available.  For added security, Scroogle gave users the option of having all communication between their computer and the search page be [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] encrypted.

Although Scroogle's activities technically violated Google's terms of service, Google generally tolerated its existence, [[whitelist]]ing the site on multiple occasions. After 2005, the service encountered rapid growth before running into a series of problems starting in 2010. In February 2012, the service was permanently shut down by its creator due to a combination of [[Throttling process (computing)|throttling]] of search requests by Google and a [[denial-of-service attack]] by an unknown person or group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120224015409/http://www.betabeat.com/2012/02/21/scroogle-privacy-first-search-engine-shuts-down-for-good/|title=Scroogle, Privacy-First Search Engine, Shuts Down for Good {{!}} Betabeat — News, gossip and intel from Silicon Alley 2.0.|date=2012-02-24|access-date=2018-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its demise, Scroogle handled around 350,000 queries daily,&lt;ref name=Zeit&gt;{{cite news |last=Beuth |first=Patrick |title=Anonymisierte Google-Suche über Scroogle ist blockiert |url=http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2012-02/google-scroogle |language=German |trans-title=Anonymized Google Search via Scroogle is blocked |work=Die Zeit Online |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2012-02/google-scroogle&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DAnonymisierte%2BGoogle-Suche%2B%25C3%25BCber%2BScroogle%2Bist%2Bblockiert English translation]).&lt;/ref&gt; ranked among the top 4,000 sites worldwide and in the top 2500 for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries in [[web traffic]].&lt;ref name=Alexa&gt;{{cite web |title=Scroogle.org Site Info |publisher=Alexa.com |year=2012 |url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/scroogle.org |accessdate=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) compliance==
Google has been criticized by some for the way it implements support for the requirements of the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA) because of its "biased" terms of service on [[YouTube]] and its "heavy-handed" ways of enforcing the law. According to Google's Privacy Policy, children under 13 aren't allowed to use any Google services, including [[Gmail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunpig.com/martin/archives/2011/07/03/google-made-my-son-cry.html |title=Google made my son cry |author=Martin Sutherland |work=Legends of the Sun Pig |date=July 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628055130/http://sunpig.com/martin/archives/2011/07/03/google-made-my-son-cry.html |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy and data protection cases and issues by country==

===European Union===
[[European Union]] (EU) data protection officials (the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|Article 29]] working party who advise the EU on privacy policy) have written to Google asking the company to justify its policy of keeping information on individuals' internet searches for up to two years. The letter questioned whether Google has "fulfilled all the necessary requirements" on the EU laws concerning data protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/dc89ec96-0a24-11dc-93ae-000b5df10621.html "EU probes Google grip on data"], Maija Palmer, ''Financial Times'', May 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2007|05|24}} the probe by the EU into the data protection issue is continuing. On May 31, 2007, Google agreed that its privacy policy is vague, and that they are constantly working at making it clearer to users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6704013.stm "Google privacy policy 'is vague'"], Darren Waters, BBC News, May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
After Google merged its different privacy policies into a single one in March 2012, the working group of all European Union Data Protection Authorities assessed that it failed to comply with the EU legal framework. Several countries then opened cases to investigate possible breach of their privacy rules.&lt;ref name="reuters_barzic_2014"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/07/us-google-privacy-france-idUSBREA161BS20140207 |title=French court orders Google to display fine for privacy breach |last1=Barzic |first1=Gwenaelle |last2=Huet |first2=Natalie |date=February 7, 2014 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google has also been implicated in ''[[Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja González]]'', a [[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|Spanish Audiencia Nacional]] and [[European Court of Justice]] case that decided Google must comply with the European privacy laws (i.e., the [[Data Protection Directive]]) and [[right to be forgotten|allow users to be forgotten]] when operating in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=[[European Court of Justice]] |title=Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-131/12: An internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/P_127116/ |location=Luxembourg |publisher= |agency= |date=May 13, 2014 |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kanter |first1=James |last2=Scott |first2=Mark |date=May 13, 2014 |title=Google Must Honor Requests to Delete Some Links, E.U.

===Czech Republic===
Starting in 2010, after more than five months of unsuccessful negotiations with Google, the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection has prevented Street View from taking pictures of new locations. The Office described Google's program as taking pictures "beyond the extent of the ordinary sight from a street", and claimed that it "disproportionately invaded citizens' privacy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,6006085,00.html "Czech Republic stops Google from further Street View photography"], Cyrus Farivar (Reuters), ''Deutsche Welle'', September 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seerpress.com/czech-republic-blocks-googles-data-mapping-feature/7691/ "Czech Republic blocks Google's data mapping feature"], J.G. Enriquez, ''Seer Press News'', September 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Google resumed Street View in Czech Republic in 2012 after having agreed to a number of limitations similar to concessions Google has made in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Czech Republic Gives Google Green Light To Resume Street View|url = http://searchengineland.com/czech-republic-gives-google-green-light-to-resume-street-view-110091|accessdate = 2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In January 2014, the French authority, [[CNIL]], sanctioned Google to pay its highest fee and to display on its search engine web site a banner referring to the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnil.fr/english/news-and-events/news/article/the-cnils-sanctions-committee-issues-a-150-000-EUR-monetary-penalty-to-google-inc/ |title=The CNIL's Sanctions Committee issues a 150 000 € monetary penalty to GOOGLE Inc. |date=January 8, 2014 |publisher=[[CNIL]] |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google complied, yet will appeal to the supreme court of administrative justice, the [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'Etat]].&lt;ref name="reuters_barzic_2014" /&gt;  A number of French and German companies came together to form a group called the ''Open Internet Project'', seeking a ban of Google’s manipulative favoring of its own services and content over those of others.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/technology/google-is-target-of-european-backlash-on-us-tech-dominance.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=LedeSum&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news|title=Google Is Target of European Backlash on U.S. Tech Dominance |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 8, 2014 |accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In May 2010, Google was unable to meet a deadline set by Hamburg's data protection supervisor to hand over data illegally collected from unsecured home wireless networks. Google added, "We hope, given more time, to be able to resolve this difficult issue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=128021&amp;sectionid=3510208 "Google refuses to give up 'illegal' data"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916021453/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=128021&amp;sectionid=3510208 |date=2013-09-16 }}, Press TV, May 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The data was turned over to German, French, and Spanish authorities in early June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/197955/google_relents_will_hand_over_european_wifi_data.html "Google Relents, Will Hand Over European Wi-Fi Data"], Robert McMillan, PC World/IDG News, June 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, vandals in Germany targeted houses that had opted out of Google's Street View.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11827862 "German vandals target Street View opt-out homes"], BBC News, November 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Google announced that it will not expand its Street View program in Germany, but what has already been shot—around 20 cities' worth of pictures—will remain available. This decision came in spite of an earlier Berlin State Supreme Court ruling that Google's Street View program was legal.&lt;ref&gt;

In September 2014, A top official in Germany called for Google to be broken up as publishers were fighting in court over compensation for the snippets of text that appear with Google News updates. The chief executive of Axel Springer, a German publishing giant, expressed fears over Google's growing influence in the country.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Italy===
Google vs. Vividown: In February 2010, in a complaint brought by an Italian advocacy group for people with Down's Syndrome, Vividown, and the boy's father, three Google executives were handed six-month suspended sentences for breach of the Italian Personal Data Protection Code in relation to a video, uploaded to Google Video in 2006, of a disabled boy being bullied by several classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8533695.stm |title= Google bosses convicted in Italy |work=BBC News | date=February 24, 2010 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidoscorza.it/?p=1816 "Caso Google-Vividown: un bel saggio che deve far riflettere]" {{it icon}} ("Google case-Vividown: a good essay that should give pause"), Guido Scorza, May 16, 2010 ([https://www.google.com/translate_c?langpair=en&amp;u=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8533695.stm English translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/4/356.full.pdf+html "The Italian Google-Case: Privacy, Freedom of Speech and Responsibility of Providers for User-Generated Contents"], Giovanni Sartor and Mario Viola de Azevedo Cunha, ''International Journal of Law and Information Technology'', Vol. 18 No. 4 (Winter 2010), pp. 356–378&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, these convictions and sentences were overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/12_dicembre_21/manager-google-assolti-picchiato-ragazzo-disabile-video-2113264459098.shtml "Video del ragazzo disabile picchiato, assolti i tre manager di Google"] {{it icon}}, English translation: [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.ilpost.it/2012/12/21/assoluzione-appello-google-vividown/&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dgoogle-vividown%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-beta%26hs%3DzX0%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AlhHUc_0EoXGygG8_YCgBQ&amp;ved=0CGwQ7gEwBw "Video of the disabled boy beaten, acquitted the three managers of Google"], ''Corriere Della Sera'' (Milano), December 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The Data Inspectorate of Norway (Norway is not a member of the EU) investigated Google (and others) and stated that the 18- to 24-month period for retaining data proposed by Google was too long.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=agImLlGaNKaw&amp;refer=home "Google Data on Users May Break EU Law, Watchdog Says"], Stephanie Bodoni, Bloomberg, May 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
On 27 March 2015, the Court of Appeal ruled that British consumers have the right to sue Google in the UK for misuse of private information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google loses UK appeal court battle over 'clandestine' tracking|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/27/google-loses-uk-appeal-court-battle-clandestine-tracking|website=theguardian.com|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google appeal ruling should send shivers through US tech companies|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500243342/Google-appeal-ruling-should-sent-shivers-through-US-tech-companies|website=computerweekly.com|publisher=''[[Computer Weekly]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In early 2005, the [[United States Department of Justice]] filed a motion in federal court to force Google to comply with a [[subpoena]] for "the text of each search string entered onto Google's search engine over a two-month period (absent any information identifying the person who entered such query)."&lt;ref name="DOJsubpeona"&gt;"[https://www.google.com/press/images/subpoena_20060317.pdf ACLU v.

"[http://20130120053719/http://news.com.com/Judge+Google+must+give+feds+limited+access+to+records/2100-1028_3-6051257.html Judge: Google must give feds limited access to records]." ''[[CNET]].'' March 17, 2006. Retrieved on April 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, a Pittsburgh couple, Aaron and Christine Boring, sued Google for "invasion of privacy". They claimed that Street View made a photo of their home available online, and it diminished the value of their house, which was purchased for its privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Couple Sues Google Over "Street View". |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/internet/couple-sues-google-over-street-view |quote= |publisher=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=April 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. "While it is easy to imagine that many whose property appears on Google's virtual maps resent the privacy implications, it is hard to believe that any{{snd}} other than the most exquisitely sensitive{{snd}} would suffer shame or humiliation," Judge Hay ruled; the Boring family was paid one dollar by Google for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jemima|last= Kiss|title=Google wins Street View privacy case |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/19/google-wins-street-view-privacy-case |quote=An American couple who attempted to sue Google over what they claimed was its "privacy invading" Street View technology have lost their case in a Pennsylvania court. |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=February 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, a U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon ordered Google to hand over two copies of wireless data that the company's [[Google Street View|Street View]] program collected as it photographed neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2713025120100527 | title=US court orders Google to copy data in Wi-Fi case | first=Diane | last=Bartz | date=May 27, 2010 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 and 2013, Google reached two settlements over tracking consumers online without their knowledge after bypassing privacy settings in [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]’s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari browser]]. The first was settlement in August 2012 for $22.5 million with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]—the largest civil penalty the F.T.C. has ever obtained for a violation of a Commission order.&lt;ref name=Maggs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maggs|first1=Peter|title=Internet and Computer Law|date=2013|publisher=West|isbn=9780314287595|page=686|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was a November 2013 settlement for $17 million with 37 [[U.S. state|states]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. In addition to the fines, Google agreed to avoid using software that overrides a browser's cookie-blocking settings, to avoid omitting or misrepresenting information to consumers about how they use Google products or control the ads they see, to maintain for five years a web page explaining what [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] are and how to control them, and to ensure that the cookies tied to Safari browsers expire. In both settlements Google denied any wrongdoing, but said it discontinued circumventing the settings early in 2012, after the practice was publicly reported, and stopped tracking Safari users and showing them personalized ads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/technology/google-to-pay-17-million-to-settle-privacy-case.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss "Google to Pay $17 Million to Settle Privacy Case"], Claire Cain Miller, ''New York Times'', November 18, 2013. Retrieved November 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== DoubleClick ads combined with other Google services ==
In the summer of 2016, Google quietly dropped its ban on personally-identifiable info in its DoubleClick ad service. Google's privacy policy was changed to state it "may" combine web-browsing records obtained through DoubleClick with what the company learns from the use of other Google services. While new users were automatically opted-in, existing users were asked if they wanted to opt-in, and it remains possible to opt-out by going to the Activity controls in the My Account page of a Google account. ''ProPublica'' states that "The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct." Google contacted ''ProPublica'' to correct the fact that it doesn't "currently" use Gmail keywords to target web ads.&lt;ref name="2016 DoubleClick change"&gt;{{cite web|first=Julia|last=Angwin|title=Google Has Quietly Dropped Ban on Personally Identifiable Web Tracking|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking|publisher=ProPublica|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PRADO''' - The Council of the European Union '''P'''ublic '''R'''egister of '''A'''uthentic Travel and Identity '''D'''ocuments '''O'''nline

'''PRADO''' contains technical descriptions, including information on some of the most important security features of identity and travel documents of countries within the European Union, all [[Schengen Area]] countries, of other neighbouring countries as well as of many third countries worldwide.

With Council Joint Action 98/700/JHA from 3 December 1998 the European Image Archiving System '''"[[FADO]]"''' ('''''F'''alse and '''A'''uthentic '''D'''ocuments '''O'''nline'') was set up. The first part of the system, "Expert FADO", went online at the end of 2004 for secure communication among document experts. In 2007, iFADO and PRADO were released. '''''iFADO''''' (''intranet FADO''), contains the most important information from "Expert [[FADO]]" for access restricted, governmental use, while in PRADO a small subset of this information is published for the general public.

'''PRADO''' is hosted by the [[General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union]] (GSC), Directorate General for Justice and Home Affairs (DGD 1A).

== Content ==
PRADO contains basic technical descriptions, including information on security features, of authentic [[Identity document|identity]] and [[travel document]]s. The information is selected and provided by document experts in the member states of the [[European Union]] (EU), [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Switzerland]]; part of the information contained in the classified, restricted "Expert [[FADO]]" system is made publicly available via the PRADO pages.

'''Rational economic exchange''' also called goods exchange economy is an [[economic]] transaction where goods or services are transferred from the provider for a return of relative value (compensation) from the receiver in a manner that advances the economic interests of both parties. Rational economic exchange is implied in voluntary economic transactions between private parties (i.e., regular commerce) where it is assumed that an economic transaction would not occur unless both parties believed they would be better off after the trade.  Rational economic exchange can be implied in governmental taxation and spending where the agents of the citizen—government legislators and administrators—implement fiscal policy where tax assessment to the citizen is related, substantially, to an [[implied level of government service]].

[[File:Income Tax Germany 2010.png|thumb|German [[progressive tax]] rates for different incomes. Progressive tax systems require the rich to pay taxes at higher rates, to make it possible to raise larger total sums to pay for governmental functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Investopedia|title=The Advantages of a Progressive Tax|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue such systems are primarily for wealth redistribution.]]

'''Redistribution of income''' and '''redistribution of wealth''' are respectively the transfer of [[income]] and of [[wealth]] (including physical [[property]]) from some [[individual]]s to others by means of a social mechanism such as [[taxation]], [[charity (practice)|charity]], [[welfare]], [[public services]], [[land reform]], [[monetary policies]], [[confiscation]], [[divorce]] or [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/redistribution/ |title=Redistribution |date=2 July 2004 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |publisher=Stanford University |quote=The ''social mechanism'', such as a change in tax laws, monetary policies, or tort law, that engenders the redistribution of goods among these subjects|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically refers to redistribution on an economy-wide basis rather than between selected individuals.

Interpretations of the phrase vary, depending on personal perspectives, political ideologies and the selective use of statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker: Elizabeth Warren’s claim that the bottom 90 percent got ‘zero percent’ of wage growth after Reagan.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/23/elizabeth-warrens-claim-that-the-bottom-90-percent-got-zero-percent-of-wage-growth-after-reagan/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is frequently heard in politics, usually referring to perceived redistributions from those who have more to those who have less.  Occasionally, however, it is used to describe laws or policies that cause opposite redistributions that shift monetary burdens from wealthy to low-income individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Robert|title=Trump’s Stock in Trade is Cruelty. Count the ways.|url=http://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trumps-stock-trade-cruelty-count-ways-594472|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase can be emotionally charged and used to exaggerate or misconstrue the motivations of opponents during political debates.  For example, if an individual politician calls for increased taxes on higher income individuals, their sole focus may be to raise funds for specific government programs, tapping the largest available sources while realizing that low-wage workers have little or no excess income to draw tax revenues from. Political opponents might argue that this politician's prime motivation is to redistribute wealth, when redistribution is not their goal.

The phrase is often coupled with the term "[[Class conflict|class warfare]]," with high income earners and the wealthy portrayed as victims of unfairness and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FAIR|title=For Media, ‘Class War’ Has Wealthy Victims, Rich getting richer seldom labeled as belligerents.|url=http://fair.org/extra/for-media-class-war-has-wealthy-victims/|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redistribution tax policy should not be confused with [[predistribution]] policies.  "Predistribution" is the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities occurring in the first place rather than through the tax and benefits system once they have occurred.  For example, a government predistribution policy might require employers to pay all employees a [[living wage]], not just a [[minimum wage]], as a "bottom-up" response to widespread income inequalities or high poverty rates.

Many alternate taxation proposals have been floated without the political will to alter the status quo. One example is the proposed "[[Buffett Rule]]", which is a hybrid taxation model composed of opposing systems, intended to minimize the favoritism of the special interest tax design.

The effects of a redistribution system are actively debated on ethical and economic grounds. The subject includes analysis of its rationales, objectives, means, and policy effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Cowell ([1987] 2008).  "redistribution of income and wealth," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000067&amp;edition=current&amp;q= TOC.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=January 27, 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 survey among 264 members of the [[American Economic Association]] found that 71.2% of them support redistribution, while 20.4% oppose it, and 7.2% had mixed feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Stern|first2=Charlotta|title=Economists’ policy views and voting|journal=Public Choice|date=2006|volume=126|issue=3-4|page=337|doi=10.1007/s11127-006-7509-6|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/klein/PdfPapers/KS_PublCh06.pdf|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient times, redistribution operated as a [[palace economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lukas|last=de Blois |author2=R.J. van der Spek |translator=Susan Mellor |title=An Introduction to the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|pages=56–60|isbn=0-415-12773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These economies were centrally based around the administration, so the dictator or pharaoh had both the ability and the right to say who was taxed and who got special treatment.

Another early form of wealth redistribution occurred in [[Plymouth Colony]] under the leadership of [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]].&lt;ref name=commoncourse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/william-bradford|title=William Bradford – Facts &amp; Summary |publisher=History.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradford records in his diary that this "common course"&lt;ref name=commoncourse /&gt; bred confusion, discontent, distrust, and the colonists looked upon it as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tYecOAN1cwwC&amp;pg=PA135 ''History of Plymouth Plantation''], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term [[Distributism]] (also known as distributionism or distributivism) is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of [[Catholic social teaching]], especially the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his encyclical ''Rerum novarum'' and [[Pope Pius XI]] in ''Quadragesimo anno''.  More recently, [[Pope Francis]] in his ''Evangelii Gaudium'', echoed the earlier Papal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt III|first1=Arthur W.|title=Pope Francis Needs Distributism: Americans and popes alike can embrace a humane alternative to modern capitalism.|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/pope-francis-needs-distributism/|publisher=The American Conservative|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in economic systems ==
Different types of [[economic system]]s feature varying degrees of interventionism aimed at redistributing income, depending on how unequal their initial distributions of income are. Free-market [[capitalist]] economies tend to feature high degrees of income redistribution. However, Japan's government engages in much less redistribution because its initial wage distribution is much more equal than Western economies. Likewise, the [[socialist]] planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc featured very little income redistribution because private [[Property income|capital and land income]] – the major drivers of income inequality in capitalist systems – was virtually nonexistent; and because the wage rates were set by the government in these economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 11|quote=Economies vary based on the extent to which and the methods by which governments intervene to redistribute income. This depends partly on how unequal income is to begin with before any redistributive policies are implemented. Thus the Japanese government does much less redistributing than the governments of many other capitalist countries because Japan has a more equal distribution of wages than most other capitalist countries. Command socialist economies also have had less income redistribution because governments initially control the distribution of income by setting wages and forbidding capital or land income.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern forms of redistribution ==
Today, income redistribution occurs in some form in most [[Democracy|democratic]] countries through economic policies. Some redistributive policies attempt to take wealth, income, and other resources from the “haves” and give them to the “have-nots,” but many redistributions go elsewhere.

In his article ''Redistribution'',&lt;ref name="Redistribution"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Dwight R.|title=Redistribution|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight R. Lee states:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
“…most government transfers are not from the rich to the poor. Instead, government takes from the relatively unorganized (e.g., consumers and general taxpayers) and gives to the relatively organized (groups politically organized around common interests, such as the elderly, sugar farmers, and steel producers). The most important factor in determining the pattern of redistribution appears to be political influence, not poverty. “

“The direct transfer of cash and services is only one way that government transfers income. Another way is by restricting competition among producers. The inevitable consequence—indeed, the intended consequence—of these restrictions is to enrich organized groups of producers at the expense of consumers. Here, the transfers are more perverse than with Medicare and Social Security. They help relatively wealthy producers at the expense of relatively poor (and, in some cases, absolutely poor) consumers. Many government restrictions on agricultural production, for example, allow farmers to capture billions of consumer dollars through higher food prices (see [[agricultural subsidy]] programs). Most of these dollars go to relatively few large farms, whose owners are far wealthier than the average taxpayer and consumer (or the average farmer). Also, wealthy farmers receive most of the government’s direct agricultural subsidies."

|}

Some consider the U.S. government’s progressive-rate [[income tax]] policy as redistributive, because some of the tax revenue goes to social programs such as welfare and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Christine, and Gerald C. Wright. ''Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics.'' 7th ed.: CQ, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] system, a high income earner will pay a higher tax rate (a larger percentage of their income) than a low income earner; and therefore, will pay more total dollars per person.&lt;ref&gt;Prante, Gerald, and Scott A. Hodge. "The Distribution of Tax and Spending Policies in the United States." Tax Foundation. N.p., 13 Nov. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other taxation-based methods of redistributing income are the [[negative income tax]] for very low income earners and [[tax loopholes]] (tax avoidance) for the better-off.

Two other common types of governmental redistribution of income are [[subsidies]] and [[vouchers]] (such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]). These [[transfer payment]] programs are funded through general taxation, but benefit the poor or influential special interest groups and corporations.&lt;ref name="Redistribution"/&gt; While the persons receiving transfers from such programs may prefer to be directly given cash, these programs may be more palatable to society than cash assistance, as they give society some measure of control over how the funds are spent.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey S. Rosen &amp; Ted Gayer, Public Finance pp. 271–72 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the U.S. [[Social security|Social Security]] program redistributes income from the rich to the poor,  but the majority of those receiving Social Security earned their benefits through tax withholding from their paychecks or quarterly income statements, and most benefits are indexed to the actual earning levels of individual workers.  Only the highest- and lowest-income workers fall outside normal rates.  In addition, Social Security deductions are only taken from the first $200,000 in income, with nothing further taken from higher incomes over that amount. In other words, a person who earns $100 million a year pays the same Social Security tax as another worker who earns $200,000 a year.

Contrary to popular belief, a recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balls|first1=Andrew|title=Social Security Does Not Redistribute Income|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html#navDiv=6|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, overall, the Social Security System was slightly regressive against the poor and not redistributive, once important factors were taken into account (for example, the longer life expectancy of the wealthy when compared to the poor gives them more years to collect benefits).

Governmental redistribution of income may include a direct benefit program involving either cash transfers or the purchase of specific services for an individual. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Rector, Robert. "The Redistributive State: The Allocation of Government Benefits, Services, and Taxes in the United States." The Heritage Foundation. N.p., 15 Sept. 2015. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare is a government-run health insurance program that covers people age 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with [[end-stage renal disease]] (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD). This is a direct benefit program because the government is directly providing health insurance for those who qualify.

The difference between the [[Gini index]] for the [[income distribution]] before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Wealth redistribution can be implemented through [[land reform]] that transfers ownership of land from one category of people to another, or through [[inheritance tax]]es or direct [[wealth tax]]es. Before-and-after Gini coefficients for the [[distribution of wealth]] can be compared.

==Objectives==
The objectives of income redistribution are to increase economic stability and opportunity for the less wealthy members of society and thus usually include the funding of [[public services]].

One basis for redistribution is the concept of [[distributive justice]], whose premise is that money and resources ought to be distributed in such a way as to lead to a [[socially just]], and possibly more financially [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], society. Another argument is that a larger [[middle class]] benefits an economy by enabling more people to be [[consumer]]s, while providing equal opportunities for individuals to reach a better standard of living. Seen for example in the work of [[John Rawls]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} another argument is that a truly fair society would be organized in a manner benefiting the least advantaged, and any inequality would be permissible only to the extent that it benefits the least advantaged.

Some proponents of redistribution argue that [[capitalism]] results in an [[externality]] that creates unequal wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. A. ,''Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=December 2011}} argue that wealth and income inequality are a cause of [[economic crises]], and that reducing these inequalities is one way to prevent or ameliorate economic crises, with redistribution thus benefiting the economy overall. This view was associated with the [[underconsumptionism]] school in the 19th century, now considered an aspect of some schools of [[Keynesian economics]]; it has also been advanced, for different reasons, by [[Marxian economics]]. It was particularly advanced in the US in the 1920s by [[Waddill Catchings]] and [[William Trufant Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dorfman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title= Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics.

There is currently a great debate concerning the extent to which the world's extremely rich have become richer over recent decades. Thomas Piketty's ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' is at the forefront, critiqued in certain publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Forget the 1%; Free Exchange", ''The Economist'', 8 November 2014, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral obligation ===
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
[[Peter Singer]]'s argument contrasts to Thomas Pogge's in that he states we have an individual moral obligation to help the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utilitarianism.net/singer/by/1972----.htm|title=Famine, Affluence, and Morality, by Peter Singer|first=Pablo|last=Stafforini|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/fighting-poverty|title=Fighting Poverty|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, British researchers [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]] show a correlation between income inequality and higher rates of health and social problems ([[obesity]], [[mental illness]], [[homicide]]s, [[teenage birth]]s, [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration]], child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods ([[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy]], educational performance, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust among strangers]], [[Women's rights#2011 study of status by country|women's status]], [[social mobility]], even numbers of [[patent]]s issued per capita), on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resources/slides|title=The Spirit Level - The Equality Trust|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue inequality leads to the social ills through the psychosocial [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], [[Social status|status]] anxiety it creates.&lt;ref name=thinktanks&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/14/the-spirit-level-equality-thinktanks "The Spirit Level: how 'ideas wreckers' turned book into political punchbag"], Robert Booth, ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[International Monetary Fund]] by Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry found a strong association between lower levels of inequality and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries (such as Brazil, Cameroon, Jordan) with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf "Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin?"] Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D.

==Criticism==
[[Public choice]] theory states that redistribution tends to benefit those with political clout to set spending priorities more than those in need, who lack real influence on government.&lt;ref&gt;Plotnick, Robert (1986) "An Interest Group Model of Direct Income Redistribution", ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', vol. 68, no. 4, pp. 594–602.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] criticize redistribution via taxation in the context of [[Nordic model|Nordic-style]] [[social democracy]], highlighting its limited success at promoting relative egalitarianism and its lack of sustainability. They point out that social democracy requires a strong labor movement to sustain its heavy redistribution, and that it is unrealistic to expect such redistribution to be feasible in countries with weaker labor movements. They point out that, even in the Scandinavian countries, social democracy has been in decline since the labor movement weakened. Instead, Roemer and Bardhan argue that changing the patterns of enterprise ownership and [[market socialism]], obviating the need for redistribution, would be more sustainable and effective at promoting egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation", by Pranab Bardhan and Johen E. Roemer. 1992. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', vol. 6, no. 3, p. 104: "Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] argue that social democratic reforms – including policies to redistribute income – such as unemployment benefits and high taxes on profits and the wealthy create more contradictions in capitalism by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system via reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism 1998. P.60-61"&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. pp. 60–61: "The Marxist answers that...it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the [[reserve army of labour]], taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion)."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Marxist view, redistribution cannot resolve the fundamental issues of capitalism – only a transition to a socialist economy can.

{{PropertyLaw}}

The '''right of conquest''' is the [[right]] of a conqueror to [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] taken by [[force (law)|force]] of arms. It was traditionally a principle of [[international law]] that has gradually given way in modern times until its proscription after [[World War II]] when the crime of [[war of aggression]] was first codified in the [[Nuremberg Principles]] and then finally, in 1974, as [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/da/da.html|title=Definition of Aggression – General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents state that this right acknowledges the [[status quo]], and that denial of the right is meaningless unless one is able and willing to use military force to deny it. Further, the right was traditionally accepted because the conquering force, being by definition stronger than any lawfully entitled governance which it may have replaced, was therefore more likely to secure peace and stability for the people, and so the Right of Conquest legitimises the conqueror towards that end.{{Citation needed lead|date=July 2011}}

The completion of colonial conquest of much of the world (see the [[Scramble for Africa]]), the devastation of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the alignment of both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] with the principle of [[self-determination]] led to the abandonment of the right of conquest in formal international law. The 1928 [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]], the post-1945 [[Nuremberg Trials]], the [[UN Charter]], and the UN role in [[decolonization]] saw the progressive dismantling of this principle. Simultaneously, the [[UN Charter]]'s guarantee of the "[[territorial integrity]]" of member states effectively froze out claims against prior conquests from this process.

==Conquest and military occupation==
After the attempted conquests of [[Napoleon]] and up to the attempted conquests of [[Hitler]], the disposition of territory acquired under the principle of conquest had to, according to international law, be conducted according to the existing [[laws of war]].  This meant that there had to be [[military occupation]] followed by a peace settlement, and there was no reasonable chance of the defeated sovereign regaining the land.  While a formal [[peace treaty]] "makes good any defects in title",{{sfn|Korman|1996|p=127}} it was not required.  Recognition by the losing party was not a requirement: "the right of acquisition vested by conquest did not depend on the consent of the dispossessed state".{{sfn|Korman|1996|p=128}} However, the alternative was [[annexation]] (part or in whole) which if protested as unlawful, a peace treaty was the only means to legitimize conquest in a time of war.  Essentially, conquest itself was a legal act of extinguishing the legal rights of other states without their consent.  Under this new framework, it is notable that conquest and subsequent occupation outside of war was illegal.{{sfn|Korman|1996|p=128}}

In post-World War II times, when the international community frowned on wars of aggression, not all wars involving territorial acquisitions ended in a peace treaty. For example, the fighting in the [[Korean War]] ended in an [[armistice]], without any peace treaty covering it.

==Early life and academic career==
After graduating from [[Tohoku Imperial University]] in 1933, Kuroda was sent to [[Manchukuo]] to be an instructor at a [[service academy]]. He spent five years in a [[Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|Siberian labor camp]] before he returned to Japan in 1950, and became a professor of law at [[Osaka City University]] in 1956.

==Political career==
Kuroda was elected as [[governor]] of [[Osaka Prefecture]] in 1971, supported by the [[Japan Socialist Party]] and the [[Japanese Communist Party]]. In 1975, he became the first Japanese governor who won reelection with backing only from the Japanese Communist Party. He unsuccessfully ran for a third term in 1979.

While he was in office, Kuroda took positive [[pollution control|antipollution measures]] and introduced free [[medical care]] for the elderly.&lt;ref name="jl"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jlaf.jp/tsushin/2003/1109.html#1109-04|title=黒田了一さんを悼む|publisher=Japan Lawyers Association for Freedom|language=Japanese|last=Ishikawa|first=Motoya|journal={{lang|ja|自由法曹団通信}}|volume=1109|accessdate=28 April 2009|date=1 November 2003|location=Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected a plan to build a missile base in Osaka, for he held a view that the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]] were [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|unconstitutional]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5230">{{Politics of Rhodesia}}

A '''referendum on the status''' of [[Southern Rhodesia]] was held in the colony on 27 October 1922. Voters were given the options of establishing [[responsible government]] or joining the [[Union of South Africa]].&lt;ref name=SAH&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/southern-rhodesia-rejects-joining-union-south-africa Southern Rhodesia rejects joining the Union of South Africa] South African History&lt;/ref&gt; After 59% voted in favour of responsible government, it was officially granted on 1 October 1923.

==Background==
The referendum arose after the [[Southern Rhodesia Legislative Council election, 1920|1920 Legislative Council elections]] resulted in a majority which favoured immediate moves towards establishing responsible government within the colony. Immediately after the election, the Legislative Council passed a resolution requesting the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] to inaugurate responsible government, and the United Kingdom's response was establishing a Commission under [[Sydney Buxton, 1st Earl Buxton|Earl Buxton]], a former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] minister.

The Commission reported in 1921 that the Colony was ready for responsible government and that a referendum should be held to confirm it. A delegation was sent from the Legislative Council to negotiate with the Colonial Office on the form of the constitution. The delegation comprised Sir [[Charles Patrick John Coghlan|Charles Coghlan]], W. M. Leggate, [[John McChlery]], R. A. Fletcher, and Sir Francis Newton. At the 1920 election there had been three schools of opinion in Southern Rhodesia, one favouring responsible government inside Southern Rhodesia, one favouring a continuation of rule through the [[British South Africa Company]], and the third believing that the best solution would be to seek membership of the [[Union of South Africa]]. The British South Africa Company option dropped out of consideration, but the Buxton Commission had said that its recommendations should not preclude consideration of joining South Africa if this was favoured by voters. 

The Southern Rhodesians did petition the Colonial Office to inquire what circumstances the Union of South Africa would admit them, as this option had received some support (especially in [[Matabeleland]]) at the election. Representatives of the Southern Rhodesian administration visited [[Cape Town]] to confer with [[Jan Smuts]] who after some delay was willing to offer terms he considered reasonable and which were also acceptable to the United Kingdom government. In accordance with the wishes of [[Winston Churchill]] (the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in London), the Southern Rhodesians decided to invite the electorate to make the decision. Although they did not try to interfere in the referendum, opinion among the United Kingdom government, the South African government and the British South Africa Company favoured the union option.

==Arrangements==
The election used the existing Legislative Council electoral roll and votes were counted in the electoral districts used for the Legislative Council elections. However, there was one minor change, with voters entitled to cast their votes in whichever district they wanted, regardless of where they were registered.

==Results==
All but one of the electoral districts supported responsible government and rejected Union with South Africa. The one district to support a Union with South Africa was Marandellas, and this was by a slim margin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4370">The '''step transaction doctrine''' is a [[judicial doctrine]] in the [[United States]] that combines a series of formally separate steps, resulting in tax treatment as a single integrated event. The doctrine is often used in combination with other doctrines, such as [[substance over form]]. The doctrine is applied to prevent tax abuse, such as [[tax shelters]] or bailing assets out of a [[corporation]]. The step transaction doctrine originated from a [[common law]] principle in ''Gregory v. Helvering'', 293 U.S. 465 (1935), which allowed the court to recharacterize a tax-motivated transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = RETHINKING THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIAL STEP TRANSACTION PRINCIPLE AND A PROPOSAL FOR CODIFICATION | journal = Akron Tax Journal | year = 2007 | first = Yoram | last = Keinan | volume = 22 | pages = 45| id = | quote = As early as 1938, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that "a given result at the end of a straight path is not made a different result because reached by following a devious path."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
The doctrine states:
:interrelated yet formally distinct steps in an integrated transaction may not be considered independently of the overall transaction. By thus linking together all interdependent steps with legal or business significance, rather than taking them in isolation, federal tax liability may be based on a realistic view of the entire transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Clark|link=|volume=489|page=726|pin=738|year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three tests for applying the step transaction doctrine: (1) a binding commitment, (2) a mutual interdependence of steps, or (3) the intent of particular result.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tax Avoidance and Income Measurement | journal = Michigan Law Review | date = November 1988 | first = Joshua | last = Rosenberg | volume = 87 | pages = 365| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Binding commitment test ===
The binding commitment test was established in ''Commissioner v. Gordon''.&lt;ref name='Gordon'&gt;{{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Gordon|link=|volume=391|page=83|pin=93|year=1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this strict test, a court will combine a series of separate steps if the parties had a formal obligation to complete each step. This test is applied usually when there are long periods of time between steps in the transaction.

=== Mutual interdependence test ===
The mutual interdependence test combines a series of events if the steps are so interdependent that the legal relations created by one transaction would have been fruitless without a completion of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Paul | first1 = Randolph | last2 = Zimet | first2 = Phillip | title = Selected Studies in Federal Taxation | chapter = Step Transaction | editors = 2nd Series | year = 1938 | accessdate = 2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intent test ===
The intent, or end result, test combines a series of closely related events that do not have independent purposes. If the intent of a step was merely to serve the next step, the court may consider the steps together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants = Long-Term Capital Holdings v. United States | vol = 330 | reporter = F. Supp. 2d | opinion = 122 | court = D. Conn. | date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test is more concerned with subjective intent of each step than the mutual interdependence test is.

== Examples ==
*In ''Commissioner v. Court Holding Co.'', 324 U.S. 331 (1945) the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] affirmed the tax court's treatment of a [[liquidating dividend]] and sale by shareholder as a sale of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Commissioner v. Court Holding Co.|link=|volume=324|page=331|pin=|year=1945}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''Kimbell-Diamond Milling Co. v. Commissioner'', 14 T.C. 74 (1950), the purchase of a corporation and subsequent liquidation were disregarded and treated as purchase of assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kimbell-Diamond Milling Co. v. Commissioner |vol=14 |reporter=T.C. |opinion=74 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1950 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/19508814jtc74179 |accessdate=2017-10-19 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Scots law}}
'''Stipendiary magistrates''', [[magistrate]]s in receipt of a [[stipend]], were the most junior judges in the [[Scottish judiciary]]. As of 2014 there were only 4.9 [[full-time equivalent]] posts and the only court they sit in was the [[Justice of the Peace Court]] in [[Glasgow]]. The [[Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014]], passed by the  [[Scottish Parliament]], abolished the post with the creation of the new post of '''summary sheriff'''.

The intention is that there will be a larger number of summary sheriffs, with around 60 of them sitting in more [[justice of the peace courts]] and [[sheriff courts]], throughout the country. Under the Act any stipendiary magistrates in post on implementation of the legislation became summary sheriffs and transferred unless they declined appointment.

Summary sheriffs are able to sit in [[justice of the peace court]]s and [[sheriff court]]s. In justice of the peace courts they can exercise the same summary criminal powers as a [[justice of the peace]]. However, when they sit in a sheriff court they will exercise the same powers as a sheriff in relation to [[summary offence|summary criminal business]].

==Duties==
All 6 [[sheriff principal|sheriffs principal]] had the power to appoint stipendiary magistrates but the power had only been used in the [[Sheriffdom of Glasgow and Strathkelvin]].

Stipendiary magistrates exercised the same powers as a [[Sheriff (Scotland)|sheriff]] (judge) when dealing with [[Summary (law)|summary]] [[Scottish criminal law|criminal cases]]. Like sheriffs, stipendiary magistrates wore [[wig and gown]] in court.

Stipendiary Magistrates were approved [[Law Society of Scotland|solicitors]] or [[Faculty of Advocates|advocates]], and they handled similar summary cases as sheriffs, for example [[Drink driving (United Kingdom)|drink driving]], [[dangerous driving]] and [[assault]] cases. They could impose [[sentence (law)|sentence]]s of up to 1 year [[imprisonment]] and fines of up to £10,000.

==Stipendiary magistrates in other countries==
Stipendiary magistrates have also existed in [[Australian law]], [[Canadian law]], [[English law]] and [[New Zealand law]].

The post was abolished in [[Magistrate (England and Wales)|England and Wales]] in August 2000 when their role was passed to [[District judge (magistrates courts)|district judge]]s.

The post was abolished in New Zealand in 1980 when it was renamed to [[district court judge]].

'''Straw-bale construction''' is a [[Building construction|building]] method that uses [[straw bale|bales of straw]] (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, [[building insulation]], or both. This construction method is commonly used in [[natural building]] or "brown" construction projects. Research has shown that straw-bale construction is a sustainable method for building, from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Milutiene, Edita, et al. "increase in Buildings Sustainability Using Renewable materials and Energy." Clean Technologies &amp; Environmental policy 14.6 (2012): 1075-84.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of straw-bale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and high insulation value.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

==History==
Straw houses have been built on the African plains since the [[Paleolithic]] Era. Straw bales were used in construction 400 years ago in Germany; and straw-thatched roofs have long been used in northern Europe and Asia. When European Settlers came to North America, [[Tipi|teepees]] were insulated in winter with loose straw between the inner lining and outer cover.&lt;ref name=viable&gt;Marks, Leanne R.  (2005).

Straw-bale construction was greatly facilitated by the mechanical hay baler, which was invented in the 1850s and was widespread by the 1890s.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  It proved particularly useful in the [[Sand Hills (Nebraska)|Nebraska Sandhills]]. Pioneers seeking land under the 1862 [[Homestead Act]] and the 1904 [[Kinkaid Act]] found a dearth of trees over much of Nebraska. In many parts of the state, the soil was suitable for [[Dugout (shelter)|dugouts]] and [[sod house]]s.&lt;ref name=custersurvey&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/custer_county.pdf Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey: Custer County]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.htm Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2010-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in the Sandhills, the soil generally made poor construction sod;&lt;ref name=nomform&gt;Spencer, Janet Jeffries and D. Murphy (1979).

in the few places where suitable sod could be found, it was more valuable for agriculture than as a building material.&lt;ref name=laststraw&gt;Hammett, Jerilou and Kingsley (1998).

The first documented use of hay bales in construction in Nebraska was a schoolhouse built in 1896 or 1897. Unfenced and unprotected by stucco or plaster, it was reported in 1902 as having been eaten by cows. To combat this, builders began plastering their bale structures; if cement or lime stucco was unavailable, locally obtained "gumbo mud" was employed.&lt;ref name=laststraw /&gt; Between 1896 and 1945, an estimated 70 straw-bale buildings, including houses, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores had been built in the Sandhills.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  In 1990, nine surviving bale buildings were reported in [[Arthur County, Nebraska|Arthur]] and [[Logan County, Nebraska|Logan]] Counties,&lt;ref name=arthursurvey&gt;Kay, John, David Anthone, Robert Kay, and Christina Hugly (1990).

including the 1928 [[Pilgrim Holiness Church (Arthur, Nebraska)|Pilgrim Holiness Church]] in the village of [[Arthur, Nebraska|Arthur]], which is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nomform /&gt;

Since the 1990s straw-bale construction has been substantially revived, particularly in North America, Europe, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hollis | first=Murray | year=2005 | title=Practical Straw Bale Building | publisher=Landlinks Press | location=Collingwood | isbn=0-643-06977-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival is likely attributed to greater environmental awareness and the material's natural, non-toxic qualities, low [[embodied energy]], and relative affordability.  Straw-bale construction has encountered issues regarding building codes depending on the location of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Henderson

However, in the USA, the introduction of Appendices S and R in the 2015 International Residential Code has helped to legitimize and improve understanding of straw-bale construction. In France, the approval in 2012 of professional rules for straw-building recognized it as “common technology” et qualifies for standard-insurance programs&lt;ref&gt;http://rfcp.fr/les-regles-professionnelles/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Method==

Straw bale building typically consists of stacking rows of bales (often in [[Stretcher bond|running-bond]]) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier or capillary break between the bales and their supporting platform.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Barbara|title=Building with Straw Bales: A Practical Guide for UK and Ireland|publisher=Green Books|location=Dartington, Totnes, Devon TQ9 6EB|year=2002|edition=2011|page=26|isbn=978-1-900322-51-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of straw-bales commonly used, those bound together with two strings and those with three.  The three string bale is the larger in all three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keefe |first=Chris |title=Straw Bale Design - Choosing the Right Size Straw Bales |url=http://www.strawbale.com/straw-bale-design-choosing-your-bales/ |publisher=Strawbale.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale walls can be tied together with pins of [[bamboo]] or [[wood]] (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed, either with a lime-based formulation or earth/clay render. The bales may actually provide the structural support for the building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Malin |first=Nadav |title=Building With Straw Bale |publisher=.buildinggreen.com |date=1 May 1993 |accessdate=5 October 2013 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1993/5/1/Building-with-Straw-Bales/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style" technique), as was the case in the original examples from the late 19th century. The plastered bale assembly also can be designed to provide [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] and shear [[Support (structure)|support]] for wind and seismic loads.

[[File:Lehmverputztes Strohballenhaus.jpg|thumb|left|This straw bale house plastered with [[loam]] [[earthen plaster]] is located in [[Swalmen]], in the southeastern [[Netherlands]]]]
Alternatively, bale buildings can have a structural frame of other materials, usually lumber or timber-frame, with bales simply serving as insulation and plaster substrate, ("infill" or "non-loadbearing" technique), which is most often required in northern regions and/or in wet climates. In northern regions, the potential snow-loading can exceed the strength of the bale walls. In wet climates, the imperative for applying a vapor-permeable finish precludes the use of cement-based stucco. Additionally, the inclusion of a skeletal framework of wood or metal allows the erection of a roof prior to raising the bales, which can protect the bale wall during construction, when it is the most vulnerable to water damage in all but the most dependably arid climates. A combination of [[Framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing techniques may also be employed, referred to as "hybrid" straw bale construction.&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite book |last= Myhrman |first= Matts |author2=S.O. MacDonald  |title= Build it with Bales |publisher= Out on Bale |year= 1994 |isbn= 0-9642821-1-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Straw bale house03.jpg|thumb|right|Straw bale construction]]
Straw bales can also be used as part of a [[Spar and Membrane Structure]] (SMS) wall system in which lightly reinforced 5&amp;nbsp;- 8&amp;nbsp;cm (2 - 3") [[gunite]] or [[shotcrete]] skins are interconnected with extended "X" shaped light rebar in the head joints of the bales.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Gary, and Mannik, Henri, "Spar and Membrane Structure" The Last Straw journal, #17, Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In this wall system the concrete skins provide structure, seismic reinforcing, and fireproofing, while the bales are used as leave-in [[formwork]] and insulation.

The [[University of Bath]] has completed a research programme which used ‘ModCell’ panels - pre-fabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales and rendered with a breathable lime-based system - to build 'BaleHaus', a straw bale construction on the university's campus. Monitoring work of the structure carried out by architectural researchers at the university has found that as well as reducing the environmental footprint, the construction offers other benefits, including healthier living through higher levels of thermal insulation and regulation of humidity levels. The group has published a number of research papers on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BaleHaus: innovation in straw bale building|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/research/case-studies/balehaus-innovative-straw-bale-building|work=The University of Bath|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically "field bales" (bales created on farms with baling machines) have been used, but recently higher-density "precompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported. Oryzatech out of Goleta, California has been developing rice straw compressed block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Alex |title=Lego Blocks from Straw |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date=1 December 2009 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2009/12/1/Lego-Blocks-from-Straw/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Field bales might support around 900&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (600&amp;nbsp;lb./ lin. ft.), but the high density bales bear up to 6000&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.), and more. The basic bale-building method is now increasingly being extended to bound modules of other oft-recycled materials, including tire-bales, cardboard, paper, plastic, and used carpeting. The technique has also been extended to bags containing "bales" of wood chips or [[rice-hull bagwall construction|rice hulls]].&lt;ref name=Steen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Magwood /&gt;

Straw bales have also been used in very energy efficient high performance buildings such as the S-House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans-Peter Petek |url=http://www.s-house.at/presentations.htm |title=S-House |publisher=S-house.at |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Austria which meets the Passivhaus energy standard. In South Africa, a five-star lodge made from 10,000 strawbales has housed luminaries such as Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/five-star-didimala-lodge-is-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-strawbale-building/ |title=Five Star Didimala Lodge Is The World’s Largest Strawbale Building! |publisher=Inhabitat |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of [[Nax|Nax Mont-Noble]], construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com/ |title=Blog about the first hotel built with straw bales |publisher=Mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrison Vault,&lt;ref&gt;[http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621161559/http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg |date=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDo1OTU1YWQ2NWU1ODRjNDRj |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDozMTcyM2VlMTdlZDQ1MTQ |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw bale domes along the Syrio-African rift at Kibbutz Lotan have an interior geodesic frame of steel pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kibbutzlotan.com/#!creative-ecology-eco-campus/cg14 EcoCampus, Center for Creative Ecology, Kibbutz Lotan]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another method to reap the benefits of straw is to incorporate straw-bale walls into a pre-existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;Whitty, Cadmon.

==Thermal Properties==
Compressed straw bales have a wide range of documented R-value. R-value is a measurement of a materials insulating quality, higher the number the more insulating.  The reported R-value ranges from 17-55 (in American units) or 3-9.6 (in SI) depending on the study, differing wall designs could be responsible for wide range in R-value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1998/9/1/R-Value-of-Straw-Bales-Lower-Than-Previously-Reported/ |title=R-Value of Straw Bales Lower Than Previously Reported - EBN: 7:9 |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710075736/http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bale walls are typically coated with a thick layer of plaster, which provides a well-distributed [[thermal mass]], active on a short-term (diurnal) cycle. The combination of insulation and mass provide an excellent platform for [[passive solar building design]] for winter and summer.

Compressed and plastered straw bale walls are also resistant to fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobuildnetwork.org/fire-test-video |title=Straw Bale Fire Test Video - Ecological Building Network |publisher=Ecobuildnetwork.org |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with straw-bale==
Two significant problems related to straw-bale construction are moisture and [[mold]]. During the construction phase, buildings need to be protected from rain and from water leakages into the body of the walls.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesustainablehome.net/do-straw-bale-buildings-last/&lt;/ref&gt; If exposed to water, compressed straw may expand due to absorption of moisture. In turn, this can cause more cracking through which more moisture can infiltrate. Further damage to the wall can be caused by mold releasing potentially toxic spores into the wall cavities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=145304|year=2003|author1=Kuhn|first1=D. M.|title=Indoor Mold, Toxigenic Fungi, and Stachybotrys chartarum: Infectious Disease Perspective|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=16|issue=1|pages=144–172|last2=Ghannoum|first2=M. A.|doi=10.1128/CMR.16.1.144-172.2003|pmid=12525430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nachi.org/strawbalehomebasics2006.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In hot climates, where walls may have become internally dampened, internal temperatures may rise (due to decomposition of affected straw). While fire is generally considered a rare event, compressed straw or hay bales have the serious potential of undergoing spontaneous internal combustion.&lt;ref&gt;http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/dairy/pastures-management/haystack-fires-spontaneous-combustion Vermin&lt;/ref&gt; Rats and mice can infiltrate straw bale homes during construction, so care must be taken to keep such animals out of the material. Other problems relate to straw dust which may cause breathing difficulties among people with allergies to straw or hay.&lt;ref&gt;http://envibuild.eu/archive/2014/proceedings2014/enviBUILD-2014-proceedings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298811-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

Several companies have developed prefabricated strawbale walls. A passive ecological house can easily be assembled with those panels.

The federal '''Volunteer Protection Act of 1997''' (the '''VPA''' or the '''Act''')&lt;ref&gt;The Act (S.543) was signed by President Clinton on 18 June 1997 and became effective ninety days thereafter. It was Pub. L. 105-19, 111 Stat. 221, and is codified at [http://www.mke-skywarn.org/vpa.htm 42 U.S.C. 14501-05].&lt;/ref&gt; aims to promote [[volunteerism]] by limiting, and in many cases completely eliminating, a volunteer's risk of [[tort]] [[legal liability|liability]] when acting for [[nonprofit organizations]] or government entities.

==Introduction==
People who volunteer to assist nonprofit organizations or [[government agencies]] or programs run the risk that their actions, while well-intentioned, may cause harm to another. If those actions are deemed [[negligent]], the volunteer may face [[civil liability]] for damages caused by the negligent conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''See generally'' ''Prosser and Keeton on Torts'', 5th Edition (West Group 1984) {{ISBN|0-314-09256-0}} (''Prosser &amp; Keeton''); ''Prosser, Wade, and Schwartz's Torts: Cases and Materials'', 10th Edition (Foundation Press 2000) {{ISBN|1-56662-955-1}} (''Prosser &amp; Wade''); ''Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts 2d'', Revised Edition (American Law Institute 1965)(''Restatement''); ''Harper, James and Gray on Torts'', Third Edition (Aspen Publishers 1995)(''Harper &amp; James''); ''Exploring Tort Law'', M.

'''Whole-of-Government Approach''' (“WGA”) refers to the joint activities performed by diverse [[Ministry (government department)|Ministries]], [[Public Administration]]s and [[Public agency|Public Agencies]] in order to provide a common solution to a particular problem or issue.

The approach and content of the initiatives can be formal or informal. Areas covered can be related to [[policy development]], public project management or [[public service]]s.&lt;ref&gt;“Connecting Government report”, Management Advisory Committee (MAC) for the Australian Government (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural reforms performed within Public Administrations during the past decades, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries, have introduced this new methodology which aims to reflect individual Government’s global policy and priorities through the improvement and coordination of services. WGA also seeks to introduce coherence in the decision making process of Public Administrations.

== Background ==

The first reference to this operational approach is found in Tony Blair’s Administration in the United Kingdom. It was then referred to as Joined-Up-Government (“JG”).&lt;ref name="jug"&gt;{{cite news|title=So what is joined-up government?|work=[[BBC News]]|date=23 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By means of this methodology the Government tried to overcome the existing problem of departmentalism within the rigid structures of public institutions, hampering the use of existing resources and incentives.&lt;ref&gt;“Can Joined-up-Government be a reality?”, David Richards and Dennis Kavanagh, University of Liverpool (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  Departmentalism leads to complex procedures in order to deliver desired policy outcomes.

Policy reforms implemented within the Administration were based on the principle that traditional processes, independent in each Government Department or Public Institution, is built according to past reforms, but is also a reflection of past failures.

Nowadays, several internal and external issues justify the coordination among different public administrations:

a) External issues:

Pressures from public opinion, budgetary constraints, security, counterterrorism and environmental impact are some examples of the limitations imposed by external factors. These issues show a growing complexity of social problems and demand meaningful experiences in diverse areas, reflective knowledge and strategic answers to provide solutions.

b) Internal issues:

Aligning common interests, avoiding task duplications, reducing costs, increasing productivity and achieving a coherent line of action, in order to provide desired results, are some elements that stimulate the improvement of vertical and horizontal coordination of different Government Departments and Public Institutions.

== Methodology ==

On a national stage, the methodology of a WGA challenges the established regulation and political context of any given country. Governmental structures were originally designed for Agencies and Ministries working and approaching issues individually.   The challenge is to develop new legal supportive structures for shared frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;“The Whole of Government Approach”, Working paper, Stein Rokkan Centre for Social Studies, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperative structures develop as a result of collaboration rather than through hierarchic pressures, thus coordination goals can be achieved by soft and systematic techniques, with a higher degree of consideration on pragmatic interaction before formal interaction. This has been the case of Public Administrations in Canada, where horizontal collaboration has been encouraged through internal communication of “Best Practices” and “Lessons Learned” of selected projects.&lt;ref&gt;“Basic Research The horizontal challenge”, Bakvis, H. &amp; Julliet, L. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in order to achieve a successful WGA, results are also necessary on the vertical array, where voluntary collaboration is constrained as each actor is part of a definite hierarchical configuration. In this case, a centralized element of leadership is necessary to coordinate the agenda and to supervise principles and policies that need to be accomplished.

The methodology of the Australian Government, to perform projects with a WGA, builds within a simple framework of a shared definition of Top-Down goals, in order to align the interests of the various departments involved. Moreover, each department works internally in order to attain the accorded objectives.&lt;ref&gt;“Developing Whole-Of-Government Performance Indicators”, Discussion Paper Council on the Cost and Quality of Government (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing efforts have to be measurable and regularly assessed. Metric indicators are needed in order to measure the development and the success/ failure of any Project.

== WGA on International Cooperation issues ==

One of the main functions of a WGA, in the international arena, relates to intergovernmental coordination towards the assistance provided to Fragile States. A growing international concern towards terrorism and other security issues after the attacks on September 11 and the military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, together with reiterative downfalls of some unstable states that where left alone to providence, have led into unexpected consequences within the International Arena:

* Many limitations of traditional military and diplomatic interventions have been uncovered.
* There is a general agreement towards the need for a greater impetus from developed Governments, to come up with viable formulas towards the progress and well-being of Fragile States, due to these nations’ specific deprived conditions and risks.
	
Research conducted in this direction highlight the contributions that WGA can bring, towards the achievement of long term development and stability to Fragile States at a lower cost. Moreover, the application of this methodology reduces the risk of failure to meeting planned objectives.&lt;ref&gt;“Whole of Government Approaches to Fragile States”, OECD Governance, Peace and Security papers (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wolf ticket''' is a literal translation of the [[Russian language]] phrase {{lang|ru|волчий билет}} (volchiy bilyet), a colloquial expression to denote a version of a document with restrictive clauses in comparison to the full document. Figuratively, the phrase remains in use in many of the countries of the former [[communist bloc]], usually to denote any kind of document that negatively affects one's career.

Originally the phrase was used in [[Imperial Russia]] to denote a document issued in lieu of the [[internal passport]] to persons who were given a half-year postponement of [[katorga]] or [[exile]] for settling personal affairs. Later, it denoted a limited certificate for completion of studies. Unlike a regular diploma, it merely stated that the studies were completed, but the student was not allowed to take exams for reasons of poor study or improper behavior.

A wolf ticket was a serious impediment to one's career. Still later this phrase was applied to a document issued in place of an [[internal passport]] to persons released from imprisonment ("certificate of release"). Usually this kind of document restricted the rights of a citizen in terms of place of residence (the [[101st kilometre]] rule), occupation, and so on.
