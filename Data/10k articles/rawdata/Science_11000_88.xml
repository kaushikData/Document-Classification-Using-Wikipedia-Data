[[File:ArtificialGravity.gif|thumb|Bouncing ball in a rotating space station: The objective reality of the ball bouncing off the outer hull is confirmed both by a [[rotating frame of reference|rotating]] and by a [[inertial system|non-rotating]] observer, hence the rotation of the space station is an "absolute", objective fact regardless of the chosen frame of reference.]]
In [[physics]], the concept of '''absolute rotation'''—[[rotation]] independent of any external reference—is a topic of debate about [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[cosmology]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.

For the concept of absolute rotation to be scientifically meaningful, it must be measurable. In other words, can an observer distinguish between the rotation of an observed object and their own rotation? Newton suggested two experiments to resolve this problem. One is the effects of [[centrifugal force]] upon the shape of the surface of water rotating in a [[bucket argument|bucket]], equivalent to the phenomenon of [[rotational gravity]] used in proposals for [[manned spaceflight]].
The second is the effect of centrifugal force upon the tension in a string joining two spheres rotating about their center of mass.

==Classical mechanics==
===Newton's bucket argument===
{{main|Bucket argument}}
{{see|Rotational gravity}}
[[Image:Parabola shape in rotating layers of fluid.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1: The interface of two [[Miscibility|immiscible]] liquids of different density (a denser colorless liquid and a lighter orange-colored liquid) rotating around a vertical axis is an upward-opening circular paraboloid.]]

Newton suggested the shape of the surface of the water indicates the presence or absence of absolute rotation relative to the [[fixed stars]]: rotating water has a curved surface, still water has a flat surface. Because rotating water has a concave surface, if the surface you see is concave, and the water does not seem to you to be rotating, then ''you'' are rotating with the water.

Centrifugal force is needed to explain the concavity of the water in a co-rotating frame of reference (one that rotates with the water) because the water appears stationary in this frame, and so should have a flat surface. Thus, observers looking at the stationary water need the centrifugal force to explain why the water surface is concave and not flat. The centrifugal force pushes the water toward the sides of the bucket, where it piles up deeper and deeper, Pile-up is arrested when any further climb costs as much work against gravity as is the energy gained from the centrifugal force, which is greater  at larger radius.

If you need a centrifugal force to explain what you see, then you are rotating. Newton's conclusion was that rotation is absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other thinkers suggest that pure logic implies only relative rotation makes sense. For example, [[Bishop Berkeley]] and [[Ernst Mach]] (among others) suggested that it is relative rotation with respect to the [[fixed stars]] that matters, and rotation of the fixed stars relative to an object has the same effect as rotation of the object with respect to the fixed stars.&lt;ref name=Ridley&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Newton's arguments do not settle this issue; his arguments may be viewed, however, as establishing centrifugal force as a basis for an [[operational definition]] of what we actually mean by absolute rotation.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;

Rather than justifying a causal link between rotation and centrifugal effects, Newton's arguments may be viewed as ''defining'' "absolute rotation" by stating a ''procedure'' for its detection and measurement involving centrifugal force. See {{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Newton |pages= 44–45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wIzvqzfUXkC&amp;pg=PA43#PPA44,M1 |isbn=0-521-65696-6 |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |author=Robert Disalle |editor=I. Bernard Cohen &amp; George E. Smith  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotating spheres===
{{See also|Rotating spheres}}
[[Image:Rotating spheres.svg|thumb|180px|Figure 2: Two spheres tied with a string and rotating at an angular rate ω. Because of the rotation, the string tying the spheres together is under tension.]]

Newton also proposed another experiment to measure one's rate of rotation: using the tension in a cord joining two spheres rotating about their center of mass. Non-zero tension in the string indicates rotation of the spheres, whether or not the observer thinks they are rotating. This experiment is simpler than the bucket experiment in principle, because it need not involve gravity.

Beyond a simple "yes or no" answer to rotation, one may actually calculate one's rotation. To do that, one takes one's measured rate of rotation of the spheres and computes the tension appropriate to this observed rate. This calculated tension then is compared to the measured tension. If the two agree, one is in a stationary (non-rotating) frame. If the two do ''not'' agree, to obtain agreement, one must include a centrifugal force in the tension calculation; for example, if the spheres appear to be stationary, but the tension is non-zero, the entire tension is due to centrifugal force. From the necessary centrifugal force, one can determine one's speed of rotation; for example, if the calculated tension is greater than measured, one is rotating in the sense opposite to the spheres, and the larger the discrepancy the faster this rotation.

The tension in the wire is the required centripetal force to sustain the rotation. What is experienced by the physically rotating observer is the centripetal force and the physical effect arising from his own inertia. The effect arising from inertia is referred to as [[reactive centrifugal force]].

Whether or not the effects from inertia are attributed to a fictitious centrifugal force is a matter of choice.

===Rotating elastic sphere===

[[Image:Elipsoid zplostely.png|thumb|200px |Figure 3: An ellipsoid]]

In a similar fashion, if we did not know the Earth rotates about its axis, we could infer this rotation from the centrifugal force needed to account for the bulging observed at its equator.&lt;ref name=Ritchie&gt;

In his ''Principia'', [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] proposed the shape of the rotating Earth was that of a homogeneous ellipsoid formed by an equilibrium between the gravitational force holding it together and the centrifugal force pulling it apart. This effect is more easily seen with the planet [[saturn#Physical characteristics|Saturn]] which has a radius 8.5 to 9.5 times that of Earth but has a rotational period of only 10.57 hours.  The ratios of Saturn's diameters is approximately 11 to 10.

[[Isaac Newton]] explained this in his ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) in which he outlined his theory and calculations on the shape of the Earth.  Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac|publisher =|year =|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A modern measurement of the Earth's oblateness leads to an equatorial radius of 6378.14&amp;nbsp;km and a polar radius of 6356.77&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;
{{cite book |title=Spacecraft mission design |author=Charles D Brown |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpilMLP7OHQC&amp;pg=PA57 |isbn=1-56347-262-7 |year=1998 |edition=2 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronomy}}
&lt;/ref&gt; about 0.1% less [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] than Newton's estimate.&lt;ref name=Flatness&gt;
This error is the difference in the estimated ratio of diameters. However, a more demanding measure of oblateness is the ''[[flattening]]'', defined as ''f = (a−b)/a'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are the semimajor and semiminor axes. Using the cited numbers, the flattening of Newton's prediction differs by 23% from that of modern estimates.

&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical determination of the precise extent of oblateness in response to a centrifugal force requires an understanding  of the make-up of the planet, not only today but during its formation.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia"&gt;

In 1672 [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the equator.

It was only in 1743 that [[Alexis Clairaut]], in ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'', was able to show that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct
Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clairaut|first = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide an valid equation to back up his argument as well. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

==Special relativity==
{{main|Sagnac experiment}}
French physicist [[Georges Sagnac]] in 1913 conducted an experiment that was similar to the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], but was intended to observe the effects of rotation. Sagnac set up this experiment to prove the existence of the [[luminiferous aether]] that Einstein's 1905 [[theory of special relativity]] had discarded.

The [[Sagnac experiment]] and later similar experiments showed that a stationary object on the surface of the Earth will rotate once every rotation of the Earth when using stars as a stationary reference point.  Rotation was thus concluded to be absolute rather than relative.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==General relativity==
{{see|Mach's principle|Frame-dragging}}
[[Mach's principle]] is the name given by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to a hypothesis often credited to the [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach]].

The idea is that the local motion of a [[rotating reference frame]] is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe.  Mach's principle says that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. The principle is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here".

The example considered by Einstein was the rotating elastic sphere. Like a rotating planet bulging at the equator, a rotating sphere deforms into an oblate (squashed) [[spheroid]] depending on its rotation. 

In classical mechanics, an explanation of this deformation requires external causes in a frame of reference in the spheroid it is not rotating, and these external causes may be taken as "absolute 
rotation" in classical physics and special relativity.&lt;ref name="Ferraro"&gt;{{cite|title=Einstein's Space-Time: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity|first1=Rafael|last1=Ferraro|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date=2007|isbn=9780387699462|chapter=Chapter 8: Inertia and Gravity}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In [[general relativity]], no external causes are invoked. The rotation is relative to the local [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]], and since the local geodesics eventually channel information from the [[Distribution of matter in the universe|distant stars]], there appears to be absolute rotation relative to these stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Mach's Principle II|first1=James G.|last1=Gilson|date=September 1, 2004|arxiv=physics/0409010|bibcode = 2004physics...9010G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academic administration''' is a branch of [[university]] or [[college]] employees responsible for the maintenance and supervision of the institution and separate from the [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] or [[academics]], although some personnel may have joint responsibilities.  Some type of separate administrative structure exists at almost all [[academic]] institutions, as fewer and fewer schools are governed by employees who are also involved in academic or scholarly work. Many senior administrators are academics who have advanced degrees and no longer teach or conduct research.

==Key responsibilities==

Key broad administrative responsibilities (and thus administrative units) in academic institutions include:
* Admissions
* Supervision of academic affairs such as hiring, promotion, [[tenure]], and evaluation (with faculty input where appropriate);
* Maintenance of official records (typically supervised by a [[Registrar (education)|registrar]]);
* Maintenance and audit of financial flows and records;
* Maintenance and construction of campus buildings (the ''physical plant'');
* Maintenance of the campus grounds;
* Safety and security of people and property on the campus (often organized as an office of [[public safety]] or [[campus police]]);
* Maintenance and construction 
* Supervision and support of campus [[computer]]s and [[local area network|network]] ([[information technology]]).
* Fundraising from private individuals and foundations ("development" or "advancement")
* Research administration (including grants and contract administration, and institutional compliance with federal and state regulations)
* Public affairs (including relations with the media, the community, and local, state, and federal governments)
* Student services such as disability services, career counselling and library staff.

==Administrative titles==
The chief executive, the administrative and educational head of a university, depending on tradition and location, may be termed the [[Chancellor (education)#University president|university president]], the [[Provost (education)|provost]], the [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] (the United States), the [[Chancellor (education)#Vice-chancellor|vice-chancellor]] (many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), [[Principal (academia)|principal]] (Scotland and Canada), or [[Rector (academia)|rector]] (Europe, Russia, Asia and the Middle East).

An administrative executive in charge of a university department or of some schools, may be termed a [[Dean (education)|dean]] or some variation, such as dean emeritus. The chief executive of academic establishments other than universities, may be termed headmaster or [[head teacher]] (schools), director (used to reflect various positions ranging from the head of an institution to the head of a program), or principal, as used in [[primary education]].

==By country==
{{globalize|date=December 2012}}
Academic administrations are structured in various ways at different institutions and in different countries.

===Australia===
Full-time [[tertiary education]] administrators emerged as a distinct role in Australia from the mid-1970s, as institutions sought to deal with their increasing size and complexity, along with a broadening of their aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Maree.  'Defining administrators and new professionals.' PERSPECTIVES, VOLUME 4, NUMBER 1, 2000: pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; As the professionalism of tertiary administrators has developed, there has been a corresponding push to recognise the uniqueness and validity of their role in the academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;GORNALL, L. (1988) `New professionals’: changes and occupational roles in higher education. perspectives, 3(2), pp. 44-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Maree and Ian Dobson. 'Fear and Loathing in University Staffing: The Case of Australian Academic and General Staff.' Journal of Higher Education Management and Policy, Volume 15, No. 3,: pp. 123.133.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2004}}, general staff comprised over half the employees at Australian universities.&lt;ref name=Szerkerez2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szekeres|first=Judy|title=Professional staff carve out a new space|journal=Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management|year=2011|volume=33|issue=6|pages=679–691|doi=10.1080/1360080X.2011.621193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 65% of these are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Michelle|author2=Marchant, Teresa|title=Female administrative managers in Australian universities: not male and not academic|journal=Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management|year=2011|volume=33|issue=6|pages=567–581|doi=10.1080/1360080X.2011.621184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has recently been a shift in the preferred nomenclature for non-academic staff at Australian universities, from "general staff" to "professional staff".&lt;ref name=Szerkerez2011/&gt;  It has been argued that the changing in role of the professional staff has been due to the changing work that they are performing, as professional staff assist students with technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=C.|title=Changing technologies, changing identities: A case study of professional staff and their contributions to learning and teaching|journal=Perspectives: Policy and Practice in Higher Education|date=2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=62–70|doi=10.1080/13603108.2012.716376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overarching body for all staff working in administration and management in Australia is the [[Association for Tertiary Education Management]].

===United Kingdom===

====Administrative structures====

The structures for administration and management in higher education in the United Kingdom vary significantly between institutions. Any description of a general structure will therefore not apply to some or even many institutions, and therefore any general statement of structures may be misleading. Not all UK universities have the post of Registrar.

The Director of Finance may report to the Registrar or directly to the Vice-Chancellor, whilst other senior posts may or may not report to the Registrar. This next tier of senior positions might include Directors of Human Resources, Estates, and Corporate Affairs. The Academic Registrar is often included in this next tier. Their role is mostly to accomplish student-facing administrative processes such as admissions, student records, complaints, and graduation.

====Professional associations====

The overarching body for all staff working in administration and management in the UK is the [[Association of University Administrators]].

===United States===

====Presidents and chancellors====

In the [[United States]], a college or university is typically supervised by a [[University President|President]] or [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] who reports regularly to a [[Board of Trustees]] (made up of individuals from outside the institution) and who serves as [[Chief Executive Officer]]. Most large colleges and universities now use an administrative structure with a tier of vice presidents, among whom the [[Provost (education)|Provost]] (or Vice President for Academic Affairs, or Academic Dean) serves as the chief academic officer.

==== Deans ====

[[Dean (education)|Deans]] may supervise various and more specific aspects of the institution, or may be CEOs of entire campuses.  They may report directly to the president or chancellor. The division of responsibility among deans varies widely among institutions; some are chiefly responsible for clusters of academic fields (such as the [[humanities]] or [[natural sciences]]) or whole academic units (such as a [[graduate school]] or [[college]]), while others are responsible for non-academic but campus-wide concerns such as [[minority group|minority]] affairs.  In some cases a [[provost (education)|provost]] supervises the institution's entire academic staff, occupying a position generally superior to any dean.  In other instances the Dean of a College may be the equivalent to a Provost or Vice Chancellor or Vice President for Academic Affairs.  Below deans in the administrative hierarchy are heads of individual [[academic department]]s and of individual administrative departments from groundskeeping to libraries to registrars of records.  These heads (commonly styled "chairs" or "directors") then supervise the faculty and staff of their individual departments.

==== Departmental Chairs ====

The Chair of a department is typically a tenured or at least tenure-track faculty member, supported by administrative staff.

==== Administrative staff ====

All levels of the university have administrative staff, reporting to Chancellors, Presidents, Provosts, Deans, and Departmental Chairs. Each department is typically led by a Management Services Officer (MSO), the departmental head of administrative staff, who reports to the Chair of the department. Front Desk staff, Admissions staff, Graduate and Undergraduate Student Counselors, and other staff report to the MSO.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1326">An '''anion exchange membrane''' ('''AEM''') is a [[semipermeable membrane]] generally made from [[ionomer]]s and designed to conduct [[anions]] while being impermeable to gases such as [[oxygen]] or [[hydrogen]].

Anion exchange membranes are used in [[electrolytic cells]] and [[fuel cells]] to separate reactants present around the two electrodes while transporting the anions essential for the cell operation. An important example is the [[hydroxide anion exchange membrane]] used to [[membrane electrode assembly|separate the electrodes]] of a [[direct methanol fuel cell]] (DMFC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=chemistry Comparison of PVDF and FEP based radiation-grafted alkaline anionexchange membranes for use in low temperature portable DMFCs]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[direct-ethanol fuel cell]] (DEFC).

'''Biomedical sciences''' are a set of [[applied science]]s applying portions of [[natural science]] or [[formal science]], or both, to  knowledge, interventions, or technology that are of use in [[healthcare]] or [[public health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Consultations/Liveconsultations/DH_091137?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=181510&amp;Rendition=Web |title=The Future of the Healthcare Science Workforce. Modernising Scientific Careers: The Next Steps. |page=2 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=26 Nov 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such disciplines as [[medical microbiology]], [[clinical virology]], [[clinical epidemiology]], [[genetic epidemiology]], and [[biomedical engineering]] are medical sciences.  In explaining [[physiology|physiological]] mechanisms operating in [[pathology|pathological processes]], however, [[pathophysiology]] can be regarded as [[basic science]].

==Roles within biomedical science==
There are at least 45 different specialisms within healthcare science, which are traditionally grouped into three main divisions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117982.pdf |title=Extraordinary You |publisher=Department of Health|page=116 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=16 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biomedical science in the United Kingdom ==
The healthcare science workforce is an important part of the UK's [[National Health Service]]. While people working in healthcare science are only 5% of the staff of the NHS, 80% of all diagnoses can be attributed to their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113275 |title=Modernising Scientific Careers: The UK Way Forward |page=3 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=26 Feb 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volume of specialist healthcare science work is a significant part of the work of the NHS. Every year, NHS healthcare scientists carry out:
* nearly 1 billion pathology laboratory tests
* more than 12 million physiological tests
* support for 1.5 million [[Radiation therapy|fractions]] of radiotherapy

The four governments of the UK have recognised the importance of healthcare science to the NHS, introducing the [[Modernising Scientific Careers]] initiative to make certain that the education and training for healthcare scientists ensures there is the flexibility to meet patient needs while keeping up to date with scientific developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113275 |title=Modernising Scientific Careers: The UK Way Forward |page=5 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |date=26 Feb 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}
The '''central meridian''' of a celestial body that presents a disc to an observer (such as [[planet]], [[moon]], or [[star]]) is the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] on the body's surface that goes through the centre of the body's disc as seen from the point of view of the observer.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Meeus |first= Jean |title= Astronomical Algorithms, Second Edition |date= 1998 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The term as generally used in [[observational astronomy]] refers to the central meridian of the celestial body as seen by a theoretical observer on Earth for whom the celestial body is at the [[zenith]]. An imaginary line is drawn from the centre of the Earth to the center of the other celestial body. The intersection between this line and the celestial body's surface is the sub-Earth point. The central meridian is the meridian going through the sub-Earth point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United States Naval Observatory|title=Astronomical Almanac 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the body's rotation and orbital alignment with the observer the central meridian changes with time, as it is based on the observer's point of view. For example, consider the Earth as seen from the Moon. There will be a meridian going through the centre of the Earth's visible disc (for example 75° West). This is not always the Earth's prime meridian (0° W / 0° E), as the central meridian of the Earth as seen from the Moon changes as the Earth rotates.

'''''Cosmos''''' is a 1980 [[popular science]] book by [[astronomer]] and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Carl Sagan]]. Its 13 illustrated chapters, corresponding to the 13 episodes of the [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|''Cosmos'' TV series]], which the book was co-developed with and intended to complement, explore the mutual development of [[science]] and [[civilization]]. One of Sagan's main purposes for the book and television series was to explain complex scientific ideas to anyone interested in learning. Sagan also believed the television was one of the greatest teaching tools ever invented, so he wished to capitalize on his chance to educate the world.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Frederic, Peter Stoler, and Calif. 1980. "The Cosmic Explainer He-e-e-re's Carl, bringing you nothing less than the universe." Time 116, no. 16: 62. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed April 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred in part by the popularity of the TV series, ''Cosmos'' spent 50 weeks on the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' best-sellers list and 70 weeks on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] to become the best-selling science book ever published at the time. In 1981, it received the [[Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book]]. The book's unprecedented success ushered in a dramatic increase in visibility for science-themed literature. The success of the book also jumpstarted Sagan's literary career. The sequel to ''Cosmos'' is ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio?PID=27627&amp;cgi=product&amp;isbn=9780345376596|title=Pale Blue Dot|work=Powell's Books|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''Cosmos'' was published in a new edition, with a foreword by [[Ann Druyan]] and an essay by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sagan, Carl |author2=Druyan, Ann |author3=Tyson, Neil deGrasse |title=Cosmos |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-345-53943-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''Cosmos'' has 13 chapters, corresponding to the 13 episodes of the [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|''Cosmos'' television series]]. In the original edition, each chapter is heavily illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780349107035/Cosmos?b=-3&amp;t=-26#Bibliographicdata-26|title=Cosmos: Bibliographical Data|work=Book Depository|publisher=The Book Depository International Ltd|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book covers a broad range of topics, comprising Sagan's reflections on anthropological, cosmological, biological, historical, and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times. Sagan reiterates his position on extraterrestrial life—that the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of alien civilizations, but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever visited earth.&lt;ref name="NYT review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Michener|first=James|title=Ten Million Civilizations Nearby|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/books/ten-million-civilizations-nearby.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=21 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan explores 15 billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of science and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9780349107035/Cosmos?b=-3&amp;t=-20#Fulldescription-20|title=Cosmos: Full Description|work=Book Depository|publisher=The Book Depository International Ltd|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method, mixing science and philosophy, and speculates about the future of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borders.com/online/store/TitleDetail?sku=0345331354|title=Cosmos: About this Edition|work=Borders|publisher=Borders, Inc|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discusses the underlying premises of science by providing biographical anecdotes about many prominent scientists, placing their contributions in the broader context of the development of modern science.&lt;ref name=Rhetoric&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lessel|first=Thomas|title=Science and the Sacred Cosmos: The Ideological Rhetoric of Carl Sagan.|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=May 1985|volume=71|issue=2|pages=175–187|doi=10.1080/00335638509383727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, like the television series, contains a number of Cold War undertones including subtle references to self-destruction and the futility of the arms race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyson|first=Neil deGrasse|title=Another round of Cosmos|journal=Columbia Journalism Review|date=January–February 2013|volume=51|issue=5|pages=30–33|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and contents==
''Cosmos'' utilizes a light, conversational tone to render complex scientific topics readable for a lay audience. On many topics, the book encompasses a more concise, refined presentation of previous ideas about which Sagan had written.&lt;ref name="NYT review"

''Cosmos'' is not just about the mysteries of space. Sagan leads every chapter with a philosophical quote to remind readers that the universe is not simply stars and planets, but a link between all things. He reminds readers that "we are all star stuff," and, though it seems humans are currently alone in space, the universe was not created for our race to thrive, but that we are a product of something much larger. Sagan's book explicitly supports the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life, as he believes the extraterrestrials will be able to spur an enormous change in life on Earth.

Shortly after release, ''Cosmos'' became the best-selling science book ever published in the English language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/93/930412Arc3331.html|title=Carl Sagan to lecture at Stanford April 23 |date=2012-04-04|work=Stanford News Service|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/about/founders/carl_sagan.html|title=Carl Sagan: Founder and First President of The Planetary Society|work=The Planetary Society|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/ear/nsc110/Crystal/WashPost.html|title=Science's Mything Links As the Boundaries of Reality Expand, Our Thinking Seems to Be Going Over the Edge|last=Garreau|first=Joel|date=2003-07-21|work=Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post Company|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 |title=Meet Dr. Carl Sagan |publisher=The Science Channel |accessdate=2010-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518042909/http://science.discovery.com/convergence/cosmos/bio/bio.html?clik=fsmain_feat3 |archivedate=2007-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first science book to sell more than half a million copies.&lt;ref name="nsf" /&gt; Though spurred in part by the popularity of the television series, ''Cosmos'' became a best-seller by its own regard, reaching hundreds of thousands of readers.&lt;ref name="Lewenstein" /&gt; It was only surpassed in the late 1980s by [[Stephen Hawking]]'s ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 490&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Cosmos'' spent 50 weeks on the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' best-seller's list,&lt;ref name="CN1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Feb01/Lewenstein.AAAS.je.deb.html|title=From somber Silent Spring to creative Cosmos, author's style can make difference in selling science, says Cornell researche|last=Brand|first=David |first2=Blaine P.k Jr.|last2=Friedlander|date=2001-02-19|work=Cornell News|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 70 weeks on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref name="CN2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Dec96/saganobit.ltb.html|title=Carl Sagan, Cornell astronomer, dies today (Dec. 20) in Seattle|last=Brand|first=David|date=1996-12-20|work=Cornell News|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cosmos'' sold over 900,000 copies while on these lists,&lt;ref name="Print Culture"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nord |first=David|author2=Joan Shelley Rubin|others=Michael Schudson|title=A History of the Book in America: Volume 5: The Enduring Book: Print Culture|publisher=UNC Press|date=2009|pages=357|chapter=Science Books Since 1945|isbn=978-0-8078-3285-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lLetiCmAIkC&amp;pg=PT376&amp;lpg=PT376&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued popularity has allowed ''Cosmos'' to sell about five million copies internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruprecht|first=Louis|date=1996|title=Book Reviews|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|publisher=Oxford Journals|volume=LXIV|issue=2|pages=459–464|issn=1477-4585|url=http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/LXIV/2/459|accessdate=2010-02-06|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lxiv.2.459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after ''Cosmos'' was published, Sagan received a $2 million advance for the novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]''.&lt;ref name="Lewenstein2" /&gt; This was the largest release given for an unwritten fiction book at the time.&lt;ref name="nsf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/c7/c7s1.htm|title=Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding|date=2004|work=National Science Foundation|accessdate=3 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114020153/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/c7/c7s1.htm|archivedate=14 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''Cosmos'' made Sagan "wealthy as well as famous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=David|title=Man for the Cosmos: Carl Sagan's Life and Legacy as Scientist, Teacher, and Skeptic|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/carl_sagans_life_and_legacy_as_scientist_teacher_and_skeptic|publisher=Skeptical Inquirer|accessdate=July 11, 2015|date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ushered in a dramatic increase in visibility for science books, opening up new options and readership for the previously fledgling genre.&lt;ref name="Print Culture" /&gt; Science historian Bruce Lewenstein of [[Cornell University]] noted that among science books "''Cosmos'' marked the moment that something different was clearly going on."&lt;ref name="Lewenstein" /&gt;

After the success of ''Cosmos'', Sagan turned into an early scientific celebrity. He appeared on many television programs, wrote a regular column for ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'', and worked to continually advance the popularity of the science genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawler|first=Peter|title=Aliens, the Cosmos, and the Foundations of Political Life.|journal=Perspectives on Political Science|date=Summer 1999|volume=28|issue=3|page=131|doi=10.1080/10457099909602354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewenstein also noted the power of the book as a recruitment tool. Along with ''Microbe Hunters'' and ''[[The Double Helix]]'', he described ''Cosmos'' as one of the "books that people cite as 'Hey, the reason I'm a scientist is because I read that book'."&lt;ref name="Lewenstein"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/bestpractices/Lewenstein2.htm|title=How Science Books Drive Public Discussion|last=Lewenstein|first=Bruce|date=2002-03-08|publisher=National Institute for Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in astronomy and physics, he said, the book inspired many people to become scientists.&lt;ref name="Lewenstein2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewenstein|first=Bruce|date=March 2007|title=Why should we care about science books?|journal=Journal of Science Communication|publisher=International School for Advanced Studies|volume=6|issue=1|issn=1824-2049|url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/library/find/ScienceBooks.pdf|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan has also been called the "most successful popularizing scientist of our time," for his ability to draw such a large and varied audience.&lt;ref name="Lawler"/&gt;

The popularity of Sagan's ''Cosmos'' has been referenced in arguments supporting increased space exploration spending.&lt;ref&gt;Extensions of Remarks - Friday, November 18, 1983, 129 Cong. Rec. E5773 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan's book was also referenced in Congress by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in a speech promoting an end to Cold War anti-ICBM spending, instead arguing that the anti-ICBM budget would be better spent on Mars exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Senate - Wednesday, October 10, 1984, 130 Cong. Rec. 31165 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Reception for Sagan's work was generally positive. In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', novelist James Michener praised ''Cosmos'' as "a cleverly written, imaginatively illustrated summary of [Sagan's]... ruminations about our universe... His style is iridescent, with lights flashing upon unexpected juxtapositions of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1109.html|title=Carl Sagan, an Astronomer Who Excelled at Popularizing Science, Is Dead at 62|last=Dicke|first=William|date=1996-12-21|work=New York Times|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] describes "''Cosmos''" as something "more than Carl Sagan".&lt;ref&gt;Why Carl Sagan is Truly Irreplaceable https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-carl-sagan-truly-irreplaceable-180949818/&lt;/ref&gt; David Whitehouse of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] went so far as to say that "there is not a book on astronomy &amp;ndash; in fact not one on science &amp;ndash; that comes close to the eloquence and intellectual sweep of Cosmos...

The expertise of the laboratory staff includes the areas of guidance, navigation, and control technologies and systems; fault-tolerant computing; advanced algorithms and software solutions; modeling and simulation; and [[microelectromechanical systems]] and multichip module technology.

==History==
[[Image:Dsky.jpg|thumb|right|The display and keyboard (DSKY) interface of the Apollo Guidance Computer mounted on the control panel of the Command Module, with the Flight Director Attitude Indicator (FDAI) above.]]

In 1932 Charles Stark Draper, an MIT aeronautics professor, created a teaching laboratory to develop the instrumentation needed for tracking, controlling and navigating aircraft. During [[World War II]], Draper’s lab was known as the “Confidential Instrument Development Laboratory”. Later, the name was changed to the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory. The laboratory was renamed for its founder in 1970 and remained a part of MIT until 1973 when it became an independent, not-for-profit research and development corporation.&lt;ref name="CSDLFUNDINGUNIVERSE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DRAPERAT25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.draper.com/history|title=History|last=Editors|first=|authorlink=|date=|publisher=The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.|doi=|work=Website|accessdate=2013-12-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to an independent corporation arose out of pressures for divestment of MIT laboratories doing military research at the time of the [[Vietnam War]], despite the absence of a role of the laboratory in that war.&lt;ref name = "Moments"&gt;

A primary focus of the laboratory's programs throughout its history has been the development and early application of advanced guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C) technologies to meet the U.S. Department of Defense’s and [[NASA]]’s needs. The laboratory’s achievements includes the design and development of accurate and reliable guidance systems for undersea-launched ballistic missiles as well as the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] that guided the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts to the Moon and back safely to Earth, every time. The laboratory contributed to the development of inertial sensors, software, and other systems for the GN&amp;C of commercial and military aircraft, submarines, strategic and tactical missiles, spacecraft, and unmanned vehicles.&lt;ref name = "Astronavigation"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Inertial-based GN&amp;C systems were central for navigating [[ballistic missile submarine]]s for long periods of time undersea to avoid detection and guiding their [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s to their targets, starting with the [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missile program.

==Locations==
[[File:Draper Lab Cambridge headquarters building.jpg|thumb|right|Draper headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.]]
Draper has locations in several U.S. cities:&lt;ref name="ABOUTDRAPER"/&gt;

# [[Cambridge, MA]] (headquarters) 
# [[Houston, TX]] at NASA Johnson Space Center
# [[Reston, VA]]
# [[Huntsville, AL]]

===Former Locations===
# [[Tampa, FL]] at [[University of South Florida]] (Bioengineering Center) 
# [[St. Petersburg, FL]]  (Multichip Module Facility)

==Technical areas==
According to its website,&lt;ref name="ABOUTDRAPER"/&gt; the laboratory staff applies its expertise to autonomous air, land, sea and space systems; information integration; distributed sensors and networks; precision-guided munitions; biomedical engineering; chemical/biological defense; and energy system modeling and management. When appropriate, Draper works with partners to transition their technology to commercial production.

The laboratory encompasses seven areas of technical expertise:
* ''Strategic Systems''—Application of guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C) expertise to hybrid GPS-aided technologies and to submarine navigation and strategic weapons security.
* ''Space Systems''—As "NASA’s technology development partner and transition agent for planetary exploration", development of GN&amp;C and high-performance science instruments. Expertise also addresses the national security space sector.
* ''Tactical Systems''—Development of: maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, miniaturized munitions guidance, guided aerial delivery systems for materiel, soldier-centered physical and decision support systems, secure electronics and communications, and early intercept guidance for missile defense engagement.
* ''Special Programs''—Concept development, prototyping, low-rate production, and field support for first-of-a-kind systems, connected with the other technical areas.
* ''Biomedical Systems''—[[Microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS), microfluidic applications of medical technology, and miniaturized smart medical devices.
* ''Air Warfare and ISR''—Intelligence technology for targeting and target planning applications.
* ''Energy Solutions''—Managing the reliability, efficiency, and performance of equipment throughout complex energy generation and consumption systems, including [[coal-fired power plants]] or the [[International Space Station]].

==Project areas in the news==
[[File:USS George Washington (SSBN-598).jpg|thumb|The {{USS|George Washington|SSBN-598}} relied on inertial navigation while submerged and its [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missiles relied on inertial guidance to find their targets.]]
Project areas that have surfaced in the news referred to Draper Laboratory's core expertise in [[inertial navigation]], as recently as 2003. More recently, emphasis has shifted to research in innovative space navigation topics, intelligent systems that rely on sensors and computers to make autonomous decisions, and nano-scale medical devices.

===Inertial navigation===
The laboratory staff has studied ways to integrate input from [[Global Positioning System]]s (GPS) into [[Inertial navigation system]]-based navigation in order to lower costs and improve reliability. Military inertial navigation systems (INS) cannot totally rely on GPS satellite availability for course correction—required by error growth—owing to blocking or jamming of signal. A less accurate inertial system usually means a less costly system, but one that requires more frequent checking of position from another source, like GPS. Systems that integrate GPS with INS are classified as “loosely coupled” (pre-1995), “tightly coupled” (1996-2002), or "deeply integrated" (2002 onwards), depending on the degree of integration of the hardware.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, it was envisioned that many military and civilian uses would integrate GPS with INS, including the possibility of shells with a deeply integrated system that can withstand 20,000 g, when fired from an artillery piece.&lt;ref name = "NATO"/&gt;

===Space navigation===
[[File:STS-134 International Space Station after undocking.jpg|thumb|right|The operation of the [[International Space Station]] employs several Draper Laboratory technologies.]]
In 2010 Draper Laboratory and MIT collaborated with two other partners as part of the Next Giant Leap team to win a grant towards achieving the [[Google Lunar X Prize]] send the first privately funded robot to the Moon. To qualify for the prize, the robot must travel 500 meters across the lunar surface and transmit video, images and other data back to Earth. A team developed a "Terrestrial Artificial Lunar and Reduced Gravity Simulator" to simulate operations in the space environment, using Draper Laboratory's guidance, navigation and control algorithm for reduced gravity.&lt;ref name = "Talaris"&gt;

In 2012, Draper laboratory engineers in [[Houston]], Texas developed a new method for turning the [[International Space Station]], called the “optimal propellant maneuver”, which achieved a 94 percent savings over previous practice. The algorithm takes into account everything that affects how the station moves, including "the position of its thrusters and the effects of gravity and gyroscopic torque".&lt;ref name = "ISS"&gt;

At a personal scale Draper, as of 2013, was developing a garment for use in orbit that uses Controlled Moment Gyros (CMGs) that creates resistance to movement of an astronaut's limbs to help mitigate bone loss and maintain muscle tone during prolonged space flight. The unit is called a Variable Vector Countermeasure suit, or V2Suit, which uses CMGs also to assist in balance and movement coordination by creating resistance to movement and an artificial sense of "down". Each CMG module is about the size of a deck of cards. The concept is for the garment to be worn "in the lead-up to landing back on Earth or periodically throughout a long mission."&lt;ref name = "V2Suit"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a Draper/MIT/NASA team was also developing a CMG-augmented space suit that would expand the current capabilities of NASA's "Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue" (SAFER)—a space suit designed for "propulsive self-rescue" for when an astronaut accidentally becomes untethered from a spacecraft. The CMG-augmented suit would provide better counterforce than is now available for when astronauts use tools in low-gravity environments. Counterforce is available on earth from gravity. Without it an applied force would result in an equal force in the opposite direction, either in a straight line or spinning. In space this could send an astronaut out of control. Currently, astronauts must affix themselves to the surface being worked on. The CMGs would offer an alternative to mechanical connection or gravitational force.&lt;ref name = "CMG suit"&gt;

===Intelligent systems===
Draper researchers develop artificial intelligence systems to allow robotic devices to learn from their mistakes, This work is in support of [[DARPA]]-funded work, pertaining to the Army [[Future Combat System]]. This capability would allow an autonomous under fire to learn that that road is dangerous and find a safer route or to recognize that its fuel status and damage status. Paul DeBitetto, reportedly led the cognitive robotics group at the laboratory in this effort, as of 2008.&lt;ref name = "Autonomous"&gt;

As of 2009, the US [[Department of Homeland Security]] funded Draper Laboratory and other collaborators to develop a technology to detect potential terrorists with cameras and other sensors that monitor behaviors of people being screened. The project is called “Future Attribute Screening Technology’’ or FAST. The application would be for security checkpoints to assess candidates for follow-up screening. In a demonstration of the technology, the project manager Robert P. Burns explained that the system is designed to distinguish between malicious intent and benign expressions of distress by employing a substantial body research into the psychology of deception.&lt;ref name ="FAST"&gt;

As of 2010 Neil Adams, a director of tactical systems programs for Draper Laboratory, led the systems integration of [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]]'s (DARPA) Nano Aerial Vehicle (NAV) program to miniaturize flying reconnaissance platforms. This entails managing the vehicle, communications and ground control systems allow NAVs to function autonomously to carry a sensor payload to achieve the intended mission. The NAVS must work in urban areas with little or no GPS signal availability, relying on vision-based sensors and systems.&lt;ref name="Hummingbird"&gt;

===Medical systems===
[[File:Microfluidics.jpg|thumb|right|Microfluidic devices have the potential for implantation in humans to deliver corrective therapies.]]
In 2009, Draper collaborated with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary to develop an implantable drug-delivery device, which "merges aspects of [[microelectromechanical systems]], or MEMS, with microfluidics, which enables the precise control of fluids on very small scales." The device is a "flexible, fluid-filled machine", which uses tubes that expand and contract to promote fluid flow through channels with a defined rhythm, driven by a micro-scale pump, which adapts to environmental input. The system, funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]], may treat hearing loss by delivering "tiny amounts of a liquid drug to a very delicate region of the ear, the implant will allow sensory cells to regrow, ultimately restoring the patient's hearing".&lt;ref name = "MEM"&gt;

As of 2010, Heather Clark of Draper Laboratory was developing a method to measure blood glucose concentration without finger-pricking. The method uses a nano-sensor, like a miniature tattoo, just several millimeters across, that patients apply to the skin. The sensor uses near-infrared or visible light ranges to determine glucose concentrations. Normally to regulate their blood glucose levels, [[diabetics]] must measure their blood glucose at several times a day by taking a drop of blood obtained by a pinprick and inserting the sample into a machine that can measure glucose level. The nano-sensor approach would supplant this process.&lt;ref name = "Blood"&gt;

[[File:Láminas 8 y 9 del Códice de Dresden.jpg|thumb|upright 1.3|''Dresden Codex'', pages 10 and 11]]
The '''''Dresden Codex''''' is a [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] book, the oldest surviving from the Americas, dating to the 13th or 14th century. The [[codex]] was rediscovered in the city of [[Dresden, Germany]], hence the book's present name. It is located in the museum of the [[Saxon State and University Library Dresden|Saxon State Library]].

The book suffered serious water damage during World War II. The pages are made of [[Amate]], {{convert|8|in|cm}} high, and can be folded [[Accordion|accordion-style]]; when unfolded the codex is {{convert|12|ft|m}} long. It is [[Mesoamerican writing systems|written]] in [[Mayan hieroglyph]]s and refers to an original text of some three or four hundred years earlier, describing local history and [[Maya astronomy|astronomical tables]].

== Description ==
The ''Dresden Codex'' contains 78 pages with decorative board covers on the front and back.{{sfn|Lyons|2011|p=85}} Most pages have writing on both sides.{{sfn|Lyons|2011|p=85}} They have a border of red paint,{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=19}} although many have lost this framing due to age deterioration. The pages are generally divided into three sections; students of the codex have arbitrary labeled these sections '' a '',  ''b'' , and '' c ''.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=19}} Some pages have just two horizontal sections, while one has four and another five sections.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=19}} The individual sections with their own theme are generally separated by a red vertical line. Sections are generally divided into two to four columns.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=19}}

The ''Dresden Codex'' is one of four hieroglyphic [[Maya codices]] that survived the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the [[New World]].{{sfn|Ruggles|2005|p=133}} Three, the Dresden, [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]], and [[Paris Codex|Paris codices]], are named after the city where they were ultimately rediscovered.{{sfn|Ruggles|2005|p=133}}{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=3}} The fourth is the ''[[Grolier Codex]]'', located at the [[Grolier Club]] in New York City.{{sfn|Sharer|2006|p=129}} The ''Dresden Codex'' is held by the Saxon State and University Library Dresden (SLUB Dresden, Saxon State Library) in Dresden, Germany.{{sfn|Coe|1982|p=4}}{{sfn|Sharer|2006|p=127}} The Maya codices all have about the same size pages, with a height of about {{convert|20|cm}} and a width of {{convert|10|cm}}.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=3}}

The pictures and [[glyphs]] were painted by skilled craftsmen using thin brushes and vegetable dyes.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=3, 15, 16}} Black and red were the main colors used for many of the pages.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=3, 15, 16, 122}} Some pages have detailed backgrounds in shades of yellow, green, and the [[Maya blue|Mayan blue]].{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=15, 122}} The codex was written by eight different scribes, who all had their own writing style, glyph designs, and subject matter.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=3, 15}}

== History ==
[[File:Dresden Codex pp.58-62 78.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Six pages (55–59, 74) on eclipses (left), multiplication tables, and a flood (far right)]]
The ''Dresden Codex'' is described by historian [[J. Eric S. Thompson]] as writings of the indigenous people of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in southeastern [[Mexico]]. Maya historians Peter J. Schmidt, Mercedes de la Garza, and Enrique Nalda confirm this.{{sfn|Nalda|1998|p=210}} Thompson further narrows the probable origin of the ''Dresden Codex'' to the area of [[Chichen Itza]], because certain picture symbols in the codex are only found on monuments in that location. He also argues that the astronomical tables would support this as the place of origin. Thompson claims that the people of the Yucatán Peninsula were known to have done such studies around 1200 A.D. Thompson also notes the similar ceramic designs in the Chichen Itza area which are known to have ceased in the early thirteenth century.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=16}} British historian [[Clive Ruggles]] suggests, based on the analyses of several scholars, that the ''Dresden Codex'' is a copy and was originally written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.{{sfn|Ruggles|2005|p=134}} Thompson narrows the date closer to 1200 to 1250.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=15–16}} Maya archaeologist [[Linton Satterthwaite]] puts the date when it was made as no later than 1345.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=15}} It is the oldest surviving book from the Americas.{{sfn|Lyons|2011|p=85}}{{sfn|Anzovin|2000|p=197}}

[[Johann Christian Götze]] (1692–1749), German theologian and director of the [[Sächsische Landesbibliothek|Royal Library at Dresden]], purchased the codex from a private owner in Vienna in 1739 while traveling to Italy.{{sfn|Sharer|2006|p=127}}{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=16}}{{sfn|Lyons|2011|p=86}} Thompson speculates that the codex was sent as a tribute to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Hernán Cortés]], governor of Mexico, since examples of local writings and other Maya items were sent to the king in 1519 when he was living in Vienna.{{sfn|Sharer|2006|p=127}}{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=17}}

In 1828 [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] had identified this book as being of Maya origin based on its glyphs looking like those found at [[Palenque]].{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=17}}&lt;ref name=LongAgo&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Architecture Long Ago |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7784188// |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York City |date=July 12, 1896 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Cyrus Thomas]] made a connection between the codex and the 260 year cycle ("Ahau Katun") of the Maya calendar and the 365 days in a year.&lt;ref name=LongAgo/&gt;{{sfn|Keane|2011|p=392}}{{sfn|Thomas|1894|p=15}}{{sfn|American Anthropologist|1891|p=299}}{{sfn|Smithsonian Institution|1897|p=36}} Ruggles shows that in the codex the Maya related their 260-day calendar to celestial bodies, especially [[Venus]] and [[Mars]].{{sfn|Ruggles|2005|p=257}}

Paul Schellhas in 1897 and 1904 assigned letters to gods for specific glyphs since they had several possible names. For example God D could be Hunab Ku Itzam Na among several other names and God A could be Cizin (god of death) among others.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=31}} The Schellhas system of assigning letters for the gods represented by certain glyphs as a noncommittal system was adopted by later researchers of Maya codices.{{sfn|Taube|1992|p=6}}

The ''Dresden Codex'' contains accurate astronomical tables,{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=63–69}} which are recognized by students of the codex for its detailed [[Maya astronomy#Venus|Venus tables]] and [[Maya calendar#Lunar Series|lunar tables]].{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=62–71}} The lunar series has intervals correlating with eclipses, while the Venus tables correlate with the movements of the planet Venus.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=63–69}} The codex also contains astrological tables and ritual schedules.{{sfn|Ruggles|2005|p=134}}{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=32–47}} The religious references show in a cycle of a 260-day ritual calendar the important Maya royal events.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=3,63,73}} The codex also includes information on the Maya new-year ceremony tradition.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=89–93}} The rain god [[Chaac]] is represented 134 times.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=27}}

Italian artist and engraver [[Agostino Aglio]], starting in 1826, became the first to transcribe and illustrate the codex completely for Lord Kingsborough, who published it in his nine volumes of ''[[Antiquities of Mexico]]'' in 1831&amp;ndash;1848. The codex then had some damage due to handling, sunlight, and moisture. It received direct water damage that was significantly destructive from being kept in a flooded basement during the [[bombing of Dresden in World War II]].{{sfn|Coe|1982|p=3}} German historian G. Zimmerman noted that the damage was extreme on pages 2, 4, 24, 28, 34, 38, 71 and 72.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|p=19}} Certain details of the glyph images have been lost because of this. This shows when the current codex is compared to the Kingsborough copies of 1831-1848 and the Förstemann facsimile editions of 1880 and 1892.{{sfn|Thompson|1972|pp=18-19}}{{sfn|Foster|2005|p=297}}

Today’s page numbers were assigned to the codex by [[Agostino Aglio]] when he became the first to transcribe the manuscript in 1825/26. For this, he divided the original codex into two parts, labeled ''Codex A'' and ''Codex B''.  He sequenced ''Codex A'' on the front side followed by its back side, with the same order on ''Codex B''. Today, historians such as Helmut Deckert and Ferdinand Anders understand that a codex reading should traverse the complete front side followed by the complete back side of the manuscript, i.e., pages 1–24 followed by 46-74 and 25-45.{{sfn|Deckert|1989|pp=30-43}} The librarian K. C. Falkenstein adjusted the relative position of pages for “esthetical reasons” in 1836, resulting in today’s two similar length parts.{{sfn|Deckert|1989|p=7}} While deciphering the codex, the  librarian [[Ernst Förstemann|E. W. Förstemann]] noticed an error in Aglio’s page assignment of the sheets 1/45 and 2/44, so he correctly reassigned Aglio’s pages 44 and 45 to become pages 1 and 2.{{sfn|Deckert|1989|pp=32-33}} The reversal of the sheets 6/40, 7/39 and 8/38 is due to an error when the sheets were returned to their protective glass cabinet after drying from the water damage due to the bombing of Dresden in 1945.{{sfn|Deckert|1989|p=41}}

In general, treatment with [[cephalosporin]]s results in inducible beta-lactamase activity. Treatment with an [[aminoglycoside]] or [[carbapenem]] is usually indicated. Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. They have a structure that renders them highly resistant to beta-lactamases. Examples of carbapenems include [[meropenem]] and [[imipenem]].

'''''Encounters with the Archdruid''''' (1971) is a narrative nonfiction book by author [[John McPhee]].  ''Encounters'' is split into three parts, each covering environmentalist [[David Brower]]'s confrontations with his ideological enemies.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; The book chronicles his struggles against miners, developers and finally the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]].  McPhee blurs traditional journalism&amp;mdash;the reporting of facts and accounting of events, with thematic elements more common to fiction.  The book was generally well received in the popular press and became an enduring part of the portrait of David Brower.

==Synopsis==

While notionally a profile of Brower, ''Encounters'' is broken into three sections.  The first chronicles Brower's conflict with Charles Park, a mineral engineer hoping to find and exploit mineral reserves in [[Glacier Peak Wilderness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McPhee|first=John|title=Encounters with the Archdruid|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=1971|pages=22–23|isbn=0-374-51431-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles Park is portrayed as calculating and pragmatic, unwilling to foreclose real economic value from current generations in order to leave the environment pristine for future generations.  This pragmatic view was starkly contrasted with Brower's insistence that "I believe in wilderness for itself alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Robert H.|date=Spring 1997|title= Does "Existence Value" Exist? Environmental Economics Encroaches on Religion|journal=The Independent Review|publisher=The Independent Institute|volume=1|issue=4|pages=499|issn=1086-1653}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McPhee facilitates or observes the dialogue between these two contrasted figures as he does for the other two sections in the book.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/70836607.html?dids=70836607:70836607&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Aug+11%2C+1971&amp;author=By+EDMUND+FULLER&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal++(1889-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=8&amp;type=historic&amp;desc=Of+Honest+Men+Who+Disagree|title=Of Honest Men Who Disagree|last=Fuller|first=Edmund|date=August 11, 1971|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|pages=8|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section introduces [[Charles E. Fraser|Charles Fraser]], a real estate developer in [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]].  Fraser's characterization of environmentalists as modern druids who "worship trees and sacrifice human beings to those trees" provides the charge against Brower that forms the title of the book.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Last Word: Wild Men|last=Jellenick|first=Roger|date=September 12, 1971|work=[[The New York Times]]|pages=BR71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brower came to Georgia in order to stop Fraser's plan to develop [[Cumberland Island]].  Like Park, Fraser is depicted as nuanced and pragmatic: his vision of development is controlled and regulated land use.  Fraser's development of Hilton Head Island is still considered a model for planned development and McPhee notes that Fraser considers himself a true conservationist.&lt;ref&gt;McPhee (1971), pp. 92&amp;ndash;95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E3DC103DF93AA25751C1A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|title=Charles E. Fraser, 73, Dies; Developer of Hilton Head |last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=December 19, 2002|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brower would eventually win this battle, with a groundswell of opposition forcing Fraser to sell his development on Cumberland Island to the [[National Park Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;McPhee (1971), pp. 149&amp;ndash;150&lt;/ref&gt;

The third section presents David Brower's unraveling.  Here Brower battles [[Floyd Dominy]], then the commissioner of the United States Bureau of Reclamation.  Displaying only some of the reserve and pragmatism of the previous two figures, Dominy relished the damming of rivers, while Brower considered damming the ultimate offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/books/review/Royte-t.html?_r=2&amp;sq=&amp;oref=slogin|title=Of Crime and the River |last=Royte|first=Elizabeth|date=February 17, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brower struggled to save the [[Glen Canyon]] from being flooded by the [[Glen Canyon Dam]] but failed and as the story progresses, he is increasingly marginalized in the environmental movement for his perceived militancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Nicholas A.|date=Summer 2001|title=David Ross Brower and Nature's Laws|journal=Pace Environmental Law Review|publisher=Pace University|volume=18|issue=2|pages=224|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/374|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wendy Nelson Espeland, in ''The Struggle for Water'', argues that the Bureau carries much of the blame (or credit) for "radicalizing" Brower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson Espeland|first=Wendy |title=The Struggle for Water: Politics, Rationality, and Identity in the American Southwest|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|pages=76&amp;ndash;77|isbn=978-0-226-21794-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==
McPhee's catalog of these conflicts between the growing needs of society and the shrinking wilderness "pre-saged" what would become known as "wise use", or prescriptions for use that balance the existential value of the environment against societal needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Susanne |author2=Lucas, Brad |author3=Tchudi, Steven |title=Western Futures: Perspectives on the Humanities at the Millennium|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=2000|pages=171&amp;ndash;175|isbn=978-1-890591-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Encounters'' was positively received in both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' gave a positive review as well, noting the narrative similarities to a novel.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;  The term "archdruid" stuck with Brower and was used appreciatively in many of his obituaries, including one McPhee wrote for him, when he died in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/08/guardianobituaries1|title=David Brower: Environmental champion whose passion founded Friends of the Earth|last=Reed|first=Christopher|date=November 8, 2000|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=John|date=January 2001|title=Farewell to the Archdruid &amp;mdash; conservationist David Brower |journal=Sierra|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200101/brower.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epistemology]] is a major branch of philosophy and is concerned with the nature and scope of [[knowledge]]. The '''epistemology of [[Wikipedia]]''' has been a subject of interest from the  earliest days of its existence.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Early analysis related the epistemology of Wikipedia to [[social epistemology]]. Other realms of epistemological research; epistemology of [[testimony]], and epistemic [[value theory]] have been addressed with reference to Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="fallis"&gt;{{cite journal &lt;!-- can this be used for SSRN? --&gt;

|journal=[[Social Science Research Network]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

More recent analysis suggests that the epistemology of Wikipedia derives from the combined epistemic values of wikis and of encyclopedias. Jankowski&lt;ref name="jankowski"&gt;{{cite thesis

'''Family Tree DNA''' is a division of [[Gene by Gene]], a commercial [[genetic testing]] company based in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].  Family Tree DNA offers analysis of [[autosomal DNA]], [[YDNA|Y-DNA]], and [[mitochondrial DNA]] to individuals for genealogical purpose. It is the most popular company worldwide for Y-DNA and mitochondrial DNA, and the third most popular for autosomal DNA. In Europe, it is the most common also for autosomal DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.isogg.org/wiki/Autosomal_DNA_testing_comparison_chart| title=Autosomal DNA testing comparison chart| publisher=ISOGG| accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Concept and founding (2000–2002) ===
Family Tree DNA was founded based on an idea conceived by [[Bennett Greenspan]], a lifelong entrepreneur and genealogy enthusiast. In 1999, Greenspan had entered semi-retirement and was working on his family history.  He began work on his mother's Nitz lineage.&lt;ref name=Capper /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dardashti /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lomax /&gt; When faced with a roadblock in his work, he remembered two cases of genetics being used to prove ancestry that had recently been covered by the media.  These were a study by University of Arizona researchers showing that many Cohen men from both Ashkenazic and Sephardic groups share the same Y-chromosome&lt;ref name=Skorecki1997 /&gt; and a study that showed that male descendants of US President [[Thomas Jefferson]] and male descendants of his freed slave Sally Hemings shared the same Y-chromosome and a recent common ancestry.&lt;ref name=NGSQ2005 /&gt;

Greenspan had both Nitz cousins in California and had discovered someone in Argentina with the same ancestral surname and the same ancestral location in Eastern Europe. Wishing to use the same method of DNA comparison for his own genealogy, he contacted Dr. Michael Hammer at the University of Arizona. Greenspan discovered that academic labs did not offer testing directly to the public and that in general direct to consumer testing for genealogy was not commercially available either. Their conversation inspired him to start a company dedicated to using genetics to solve genealogy problems.&lt;ref name=Lomax /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibbens /&gt;&lt;ref name=Belli /&gt;

It was early 2000 when Greenspan with his business partners Max Blankfeld and Jim Warren officially launched Family Tree DNA.&lt;ref name=HBJ2008 /&gt; Initially, the Arizona Research Labs at the University of Arizona performed all testing for Family Tree DNA. Family Tree DNA includes among its scientific staff, Dr. Michael Hammer (PhD), one of a team of scientists that first published on the [[Y-chromosomal Aaron|Cohen Modal Haplotype]] in 1997 in the journal Nature.&lt;ref name=Skorecki1997 /&gt;

Family Tree DNA began with a proof in concept group of twenty-four that returned results in January. They began by offering 12 Y-chromosome STR marker tests much like those used in many scientific publications of the time in March 2000. Family Tree DNA became widely known for its Y-chromosome STR testing for the Cohen Modal Haplotype.&lt;ref name=Bopp2010 /&gt;

Soon, they were offering not only DNA tests but an interface by which dedicated genealogists could run surname research studies. The first person to create such a project through the Family Tree DNA site was Doug Mumma. It was the Mumma project.&lt;ref name=Bopp2010 /&gt;

=== Early testing (2000–2006) ===
The first tests offered by Family Tree DNA were Y-chromosome STR and mitochondrial DNA ([[mtDNA]]) tests like those used by published academic studies at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smarterhobby.com/genealogy/family-tree-dna-review/|title=Family Tree DNA Review - Everything You Need to Know About FTDNA Tests|date=2017-08-14|work=smarterhobby.com|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family Tree DNA's initial Y-chromosome tests were described as 11 marker tests. They eventually began to call this a 12 STR marker test as one of the STRS (DYS385) almost always had two copies. This they billed as a method to affirm or disprove a genealogical connection on the direct paternal line.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Family Tree DNA's first mtDNA tests were for [[HVR1]] (hypervariable region 1) of the mtDNA.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Eventually, they added a Plus test that tested for both HVR1 and HVR2.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In the early days, they did not confirm haplogroups for either mtDNA or Y-DNA.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Opening of the Genomics Research Center ===
In 2006, Family Tree DNA bought out the assets of DNA-Fingerprint, which was a German paternity testing company that offered à la carte testing to the genetic genealogy testing community. With this buyout, Thomas and Astrid Krahn, who had owned DNA-Fingerprint, moved to Houston, Texas, and helped open the Genomics Research Center.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Genomics Research Center initially did testing for many of the same products that had been sold by DNA-Fingerprint. They began to offer individual and panels of Y-chromosome SNP tests using Sanger testing methods. They also offered the mtDNA full genome test and upgrades to it using the Sanger testing method.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Soon came the launch of the ''Walk Through the Y'' (WTY) test. The WTY test offered the most adventurous of citizen scientists the chance to seek the discovery of new Y-chromosome SNPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familytreedna.com/walk-y-application.aspx Walk Through the Y (WTY)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, most testing continued to be done at the University of Arizona lab. The demand for additional test types led Greenspan and Blankfeld to move all testing to their own testing lab in Houston, Texas under the Genealogy by Genetics, Ltd. parent company.&lt;ref name=HBJ2008 /&gt;

=== Partnerships ===
Between 2007 and 2010, Family Tree DNA forged several new partnerships that allowed them to access additional international markets.

'''iGENEA'''

The first of Family Tree DNA's new partnerships was with the Switzerland-based iGENEA company. It was formed alongside the closing of DNA-Fingerprint and Thomas Krahn's helping open the Genomic Research Center in Houston. Their website is available in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name=iGENEA&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/12/11/daily18.html |work=Houston Business Journal |location=Houston, TX |title=Family Tree DNA takes root in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igenea.com/de/impressum iGENEA web site], accessed February 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''African DNA'''

In late 2007, [[Henry Louis Gates]], PhD created African DNA in partnership with Family Tree DNA to help promote genetic testing for personal ancestry among African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Joins Forces With Family Tree DNA To Launch africandna.com |url=http://www.prleap.com/pr/103721/ |accessdate=June 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DNA Ancestry &amp; Family Origin'''

DNA Ancestry &amp; Family Origin DNA Ancestry &amp; Family Origin is a genetic genealogy testing partnership between Family Tree DNA and Eastern Biotech &amp; Life Sciences. Their website is available in both English and Arabic.&lt;ref name=DNAAAE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaancestry.ae/ |title=DNA Ancestry Website, Homepage |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MyHeritage'''

In November 2008, a dynamic partnership with [[MyHeritage]] was launched, allowing users to incorporate DNA testing and advanced family tree technologies into their family history research. MyHeritage is a website offering online, mobile and software platforms for discovering, preserving and sharing family history worldwide.&lt;ref name=MHBlog2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myheritage.com/blogs/companyblog/2008/11/press-release/try-our-family-offer-to-trace#more |title=Try our family offer to trace your ancestors using genetics and FamilyTreeDNA |publisher=MyHeritage |date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DNA testing products ==
{{expand section|date=July 2015}}

=== Autosomal DNA testing ===
In May 2010, Family Tree DNA launched an autosomal [[DNA microarray|microarray]] chip based DNA test. They called the new product Family Finder. The initial product used an [[Affymetrix]] microarray chip, but Family Tree DNA changed to the Illumina OmniExpress chip and retested all customers who had results from the Affymetrix chip for forward compatibility.&lt;ref name="ftdna_products"&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA Testing Kits for Ancestry &amp; Finding Relatives|url=https://www.familytreedna.com/products.aspx|website=familytreedna.com|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family Finder allows customers to match relatives as distant as about fifth cousins. Family Finder also includes a component called myOrigins.  The results of this test provide percentages of a DNA associated with general regions or specific ethnic groups (e.g. Western Europe, Asia, Jewish, Native American, etc.). Notably, unlike other testing companies, they chose to strip out markers for mendelian medical issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Roberta Estes|title=Promethease – Genetic Health Information Alternative|url=https://dna-explained.com/2013/12/30/promethease-genetic-health-information-alternative/|website=DNAeXplained - Genetic Genealogy|accessdate=11 June 2017|language=en|date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=firemylasers|title=SNP coverage analysis/comparisons (23andme v3/v4, AncestryDNA, FTDNA) • r/23andme|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/3dd3lp/snp_coverage_analysiscomparisons_23andme_v3v4/|website=reddit|accessdate=11 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I hate the way they delete data from autosomal test - Family Tree DNA Forums|url=http://forums.familytreedna.com/showthread.php?t=35167|website=forums.familytreedna.com|accessdate=11 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA results, and Y-DNA SNP results.

=== Y DNA testing ===
The company markets a range of [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA]] tests. the Y-chromosome is inherited from father to son, so testers can discover relatives with the same patrilineage. In many cultures these relatives will often share the same surname, since surnames are also inherited father to son. These tests cover 37-111 STR markers depending on the test, and vary in price according to the number of markers covered.&lt;ref name="ftdna_products"/&gt; Once an individual has tested at least 12 STR markers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dnatestingchoice.com/forum/showthread.php?1245-Is-BIG-Y-the-ONLY-Y-DNA-TEST-That-You-Will-Ever-Need|title=Is BIG Y the only Y-DNA test That You Will Ever Need?|last=|first=|date=2015|website=DNA Testing Choice|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; he may take the "Big Y" test. Big Y tests approximately 20,000 SNPs.

=== mtDNA testing ===
Family Tree DNA also sells [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] testing, offering the choice of either a limited [[hypervariable region]] test, or a full sequence test of the entire mitochondrial DNA chromosome.&lt;ref name="ftdna_products"/&gt;

{{Classical mechanics|expanded=Fundamental concepts}}
In [[physics]], a '''force''' is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the [[motion (physics)|motion]] of an [[Physical body|object]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nave|first1=C. R.|title=Force|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/force.html|website=Hyperphysics|publisher=Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State University|accessdate=15 August 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A force can cause an object with [[mass]] to change its [[velocity]] (which includes to begin moving from a [[Newton's first law|state of rest]]), i.e., to [[accelerate]]. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both [[Euclidean vector#Length|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]], making it a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] quantity.  It is measured in the [[SI unit]] of [[newton (unit)|newtons]] and represented by the symbol '''F'''.

The original form of [[Newton's second law]] states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the [[time derivative|rate]] at which its [[momentum]] changes with time. If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the [[acceleration]] of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the [[mass]] of the object.

Concepts related to force include: [[thrust]], which increases the velocity of an object; [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which decreases the velocity of an object; and [[torque]], which produces [[angular acceleration|changes in rotational speed]] of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal [[stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]]. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another. [[Pressure]], the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of solid materials, or flow in [[fluid]]s.

==Development of the concept==
Philosophers in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] used the concept of force in the study of [[statics|stationary]] and [[dynamics (physics)|moving]] objects and [[simple machine]]s, but thinkers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]] retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of [[friction]], and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion.&lt;ref name="Archimedes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Heath, T.L. |url=https://archive.org/details/worksofarchimede029517mbp |title=''The Works of Archimedes'' (1897). The unabridged work in PDF form (19&amp;nbsp;MB) |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Sir Isaac Newton]]. With his mathematical insight, [[Sir Isaac Newton]] formulated [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] that were not improved for nearly three hundred years.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt; By the early 20th century, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] developed a [[theory of relativity]] that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and [[inertia]].

With modern insights into [[quantum mechanics]] and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light, [[particle physics]] has devised a [[Standard Model]] to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The [[Standard Model]] predicts that exchanged particles called [[gauge boson]]s are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: [[strong force|strong]], [[electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]], [[weak force|weak]], and [[gravitational force|gravitational]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–10}}&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;{{rp|79}} [[High energy physics|High-energy particle physics]] [[observation]]s made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental [[electroweak]] interaction.&lt;ref name="final theory"/&gt;

==Pre-Newtonian concepts==
{{see also|Aristotelian physics|Theory of impetus}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristotle]] famously described a force as anything that causes an object to undergo "unnatural motion"]]
Since antiquity the concept of force has been recognized as integral to the functioning of each of the [[simple machine]]s. The [[mechanical advantage]] given by a simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of [[work (physics)|work]]. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of [[Archimedes]] who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of [[buoyant force]]s inherent in [[fluid]]s.&lt;ref name="Archimedes"/&gt;

[[Aristotle]] provided a [[philosophical]] discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotelian cosmology]]. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four [[Classical element|elements]] that come to rest at different "natural places" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their "natural place" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Helen S.|title=The order of nature in Aristotle's physics : place and the elements|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521624534|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of [[projectile]]s, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.&lt;ref name="Hetherington"&gt;{{cite book |first=Norriss S. |last=Hetherington |title=Cosmology: Historical, Literary, Philosophical, Religious, and Scientific Perspectives |page=100 |publisher= Garland Reference Library of the Humanities |year=1993 |isbn=0-8153-1085-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotelian physics]] began facing criticism in [[Science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]], first by [[John Philoponus]] in the 6th century.

The shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of [[Galileo Galilei]], who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of [[impetus theory|impetus]]. Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the [[Aristotelian theory of gravity|Aristotelian theory of motion]]. He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their [[velocity]] unless acted on by a force, for example [[friction]].&lt;ref name="Galileo"&gt;Drake, Stillman (1978).

==Newtonian mechanics==
{{main article|Newton's laws of motion}}
Sir Isaac Newton described the motion of all objects using the concepts of [[inertia]] and force, and in doing so he found they obey certain [[conservation laws]]. In 1687, Newton published his thesis ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Principia"&gt;{{Cite book

|title=The Principia Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
|publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |location=Berkeley
|isbn=0-520-08817-4}} This is a recent translation into English by I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, with help from Julia Budenz.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work Newton set out three laws of motion that to this day are the way forces are described in physics.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;

===First law===
{{main article|Newton's first law}}
Newton's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external [[net force]] (resultant force).&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see [[#Dynamic equilibrium|a more detailed description of this below]]). Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate [[inertia]] that functions as the fundamental equilibrium "natural state" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the "natural state of rest". That is, Newton's empirical First Law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making ''rest'' physically indistinguishable from ''non-zero constant velocity'', Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of [[Galilean relativity|relative velocities]]. Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is "in motion" and which object is "at rest". The laws of physics are the same in every [[inertial frame of reference]], that is, in all frames related by a [[Galilean transformation]].

For instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a [[wikt:Constant|constant]] [[velocity]], the laws of physics do not change as a result of its motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by, would observe the ball follow a curving [[parabola|parabolic path]] in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be [[Galilean equivalence|physically indistinguishable]]. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.

[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|right|thumb|Though [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s most famous equation is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\vec{F}=m\vec{a}}&lt;/math&gt;, he actually wrote down a different form for his second law of motion that did not use [[differential calculus]].]]

===Second law===
{{main article|Newton's second law}}
A modern statement of Newton's Second Law is a vector equation:&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Newton's ''Principia Mathematica'' actually used a finite difference version of this equation based upon ''impulse''. See ''[[Newton's laws of motion#Impulse|Impulse]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \vec{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum]] of the system, and &lt;math&gt; \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the net ([[Vector (geometric)#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]]) force. If a body is in equilibrium, there is zero ''net'' force by definition (balanced forces may be present nevertheless). In contrast, the second law states that if there is an ''unbalanced'' force acting on an object it will result in the object's momentum changing over time.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;

By the definition of [[Momentum#Linear momentum of a particle|momentum]],
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\left(m\vec{v}\right)}{\mathrm{d}t},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the [[mass]] and &lt;math&gt; \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|9-1,9-2}}

If Newton's second law is applied to a system of [[Newton's Laws of Motion#Open systems|constant mass]],&lt;ref name=Halliday group=Note&gt;"It is important to note that we ''cannot'' derive a general expression for Newton's second law for variable mass systems by treating the mass in '''F''' = ''d'''''P'''/''dt'' = ''d''(''M'''''v''') as a ''variable''. [...] We ''can'' use '''F''' = ''d'''''P'''/''dt'' to analyze variable mass systems ''only'' if we apply it to an ''entire system of constant mass'' having parts among which there is an interchange of mass." [Emphasis as in the original] {{harv|Halliday|Resnick |Krane|2001|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''m'' may be moved outside the derivative operator. The equation then becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;
By substituting the definition of [[acceleration]], the algebraic version of [[Newton's Second Law]] is derived:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} =m\vec{a}.&lt;/math&gt;
Newton never explicitly stated the formula in the reduced form above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howland|first=R. A.|title=Intermediate dynamics a linear algebraic approach|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9780387280592|pages=255&amp;ndash;256|edition=Online-Ausg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through [[kinematic]] measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through [[frame of reference|reference frame]] analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass. [[General relativity]] offers an equivalence between [[space-time]] and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of [[quantum gravity]], it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of ''mass'' by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.

The use of Newton's Second Law as a ''definition'' of force has been disparaged in some of the more rigorous textbooks,&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;{{rp|12-1}}&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;{{rp|59}}&lt;ref&gt;One exception to this rule is: {{Cite book |last=Landau |first=L.

Translated by: J. B. Sykes, A. D. Petford, and C. L. Petford. Library of Congress Catalog Number 67-30260. In section 7, pages 12–14, this book defines force as ''dp/dt''.&lt;/ref&gt; because it is essentially a mathematical [[truism]]. Notable physicists, philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of force include [[Ernst Mach]] and [[Walter Noll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jammer|first=Max|title=Concepts of force : a study in the foundations of dynamics|year=1999|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=9780486406893|pages=220–222|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Walter |last=Noll |title=On the Concept of Force |url=http://www.math.cmu.edu/~wn0g/Force.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |date=April 2007 |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's Second Law can be used to measure the strength of forces. For instance, knowledge of the masses of [[planet]]s along with the accelerations of their [[orbit]]s allows scientists to calculate the gravitational forces on planets.

===Third law===
{{main article|Newton's third law}}
Whenever one body exerts a force on another, the latter simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. In vector form, if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{F}_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; is the force of body 1 on body 2 and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\vec{F}_{2,1}&lt;/math&gt; that of body 2 on body 1, then
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{1,2}=-\vec{F}_{2,1}.&lt;/math&gt;
This law is sometimes referred to as the ''action-reaction law'', with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; called the ''action'' and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -\vec{F}_{2,1}&lt;/math&gt; the ''[[Reaction (physics)|reaction]]''.

Newton's Third Law is a result of applying [[symmetry]] to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are ''interactions'' between different bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In a system composed of object 1 and object 2, the net force on the system due to their mutual interactions is zero:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{1,2}+\vec{F}_{\mathrm{2,1}}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
More generally, in a [[closed system]] of particles, all internal forces are balanced. The particles may accelerate with respect to each other but the [[center of mass]] of the system will not accelerate. If an external force acts on the system, it will make the center of mass accelerate in proportion to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;{{rp|19-1}}&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

Combining Newton's Second and Third Laws, it is possible to show that the [[Conservation of momentum|linear momentum of a system is conserved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dr. Nikitin |title=Dynamics of translational motion |year=2007 |url=http://physics-help.info/physicsguide/mechanics/translational_dynamics.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a system of two particles, if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{p}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the momentum of object 1 and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{p}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; the momentum of object 2, then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}_1}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}_2}{\mathrm{d}t}= \vec{F}_{1,2} + \vec{F}_{2,1} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Using similar arguments, this can be generalized to a system with an arbitrary number of particles. In general, as long as all forces are due to the interaction of objects with mass, it is possible to define a system such that net momentum is never lost nor gained.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

==Special theory of relativity==
In the [[special theory of relativity]], mass and [[energy]] are equivalent (as can be seen by calculating the work required to accelerate an object). When an object's velocity increases, so does its energy and hence its mass equivalent (inertia). It thus requires more force to accelerate it the same amount than it did at a lower velocity. Newton's Second Law
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
remains valid because it is a mathematical definition.&lt;ref name=Cutnell&gt;{{harvnb|Cutnell|Johnson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|855–876}} But for relativistic momentum to be conserved, it must be redefined as:
:&lt;math&gt; \vec{p} = \frac{m_0\vec{v}}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[rest mass]] and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]].

The relativistic expression relating force and acceleration for a particle with constant non-zero [[rest mass]] &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; moving in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction is:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \left(\gamma^3 m a_x, \gamma m a_y, \gamma m a_z\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
is called  the [[Lorentz factor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Seminar: Visualizing Special Relativity
|work=The Relativistic Raytracer
|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/Physics/Searle/Obsolete/Seminar.html
|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early history of relativity, the expressions &lt;math&gt;\gamma^3 m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma m&lt;/math&gt; were called [[Mass in special relativity#Transverse and longitudinal mass|longitudinal and transverse mass]]. Relativistic force does not produce a constant acceleration, but an ever-decreasing acceleration as the object approaches the speed of light. Note that &lt;math&gt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; approaches asymptotically an infinite value and is [[Division by zero|undefined]] for an object with a non-zero [[Invariant mass|rest mass]] as it approaches the speed of light, and the theory yields no prediction at that speed.

If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is very small compared to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is very close to 1 and 
:&lt;math&gt;F = m a&lt;/math&gt;
is a close approximation. Even for use in relativity, however, one can restore the form of
:&lt;math&gt;F^\mu = mA^\mu \,&lt;/math&gt;

through the use of [[four-vectors]]. This relation is correct in relativity when &lt;math&gt;F^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-force]], &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[invariant mass]], and &lt;math&gt;A^\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[four-acceleration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Freebodydiagram3 pn.svg|thumb|right|[[Free body diagram]]s of a block on a flat surface and an [[inclined plane]]. Forces are resolved and added together to determine their magnitudes and the net force.]]
Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt; As with other physical concepts (e.g. [[temperature]]), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise [[operational definition]]s that are consistent with direct [[sensory perception|observations]] and [[measurement|compared to a standard measurement scale]]. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the [[conceptual definition]] of force offered by [[#Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]].

Forces act in a particular [[direction (geometry)|direction]] and have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|sizes]] dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as "[[Euclidean vector|vector quantities]]". This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the [[resultant|result]]. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in [[tug of war]] or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple [[one-dimensional]] example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.

Historically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of [[static equilibrium]] where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive [[Vector (geometric)|vector quantities]]: they have [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and direction.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt; When two forces act on a [[point particle]], the resulting force, the ''resultant'' (also called the ''[[net force]]''), can be determined by following the [[parallelogram rule]] of [[vector addition]]: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt; The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.

[[Free-body diagram]]s can be used as a convenient way to keep track of forces acting on a system. Ideally, these diagrams are drawn with the angles and relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that [[Vector (geometric)|graphical vector addition]] can be done to determine the net force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components at [[right angle]]s to each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of [[basis vector]]s is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because, for [[orthogonal]] components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Equilibrium===
[[Mechanical equilibrium|Equilibrium]] occurs when the resultant force acting on a point particle is zero (that is, the vector sum of all forces is zero). When dealing with an extended body, it is also necessary that the net torque be zero.

There are two kinds of equilibrium: [[static equilibrium]] and [[#Dynamic equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]].

Static equilibrium was understood well before the invention of classical mechanics. Objects that are at rest have zero net force acting on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019054156/http://www.uvi.edu/Physics/SCI3xxWeb/Structure/StaticEq.html |archivedate=October 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest case of static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object on a level surface is pulled (attracted) downward toward the center of the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a [[normal force]]). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt;

Pushing against an object that rests on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by [[static friction]], generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force ''exactly'' balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt;

A static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as [[weighing scale]]s and [[spring balance]]s. For example, an object suspended on a vertical [[spring scale]] experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the "spring reaction force", which equals the object's weight. Using such tools, some quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant [[density]] (widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights); [[Archimedes' principle]] for buoyancy; Archimedes' analysis of the [[lever]]; [[Boyle's law]] for gas pressure; and [[Hooke's law]] for springs. These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Three Laws of Motion]].&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===={{anchor|Dynamical equilibrium|Dynamic equilibrium}}Dynamic====
{{main article|Dynamics (physics)}}
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo Galilei]] was the first to point out the inherent contradictions contained in Aristotle's description of forces.]]
Dynamic equilibrium was first described by [[Galileo]] who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and [[logic]]. Galileo realized that [[Galilean relativity|simple velocity addition]] demands that the concept of an "absolute [[rest frame]]" did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant [[velocity]] was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a "natural state" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.&lt;ref name="Galileo"/&gt;

Moreover, any object traveling at a constant velocity must be subject to zero net force (resultant force). This is the definition of dynamic equilibrium: when all the forces on an object balance but it still moves at a constant velocity.

A simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with [[kinetic friction]]. In such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Forces in quantum mechanics===
{{main article|Quantum mechanics|Pauli exclusion principle}}
The notion "force" keeps its meaning in [[quantum mechanics]], though one is now dealing with operators  instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the [[Schrödinger equation]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian equations]]. This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes "quantized", i.e. they appear in discrete portions. This is, of course, difficult to imagine in the context of "forces". However, the [[potential]]s ''V''(''x'',''y'',''z'') or [[field (physics)|field]]s, from which the forces generally can be derived, are treated similarly to classical position variables, i.e., &lt;math&gt;V(x,y,z)\to {\hat V}(\hat x,\hat y,\hat z)&lt;/math&gt;.

This becomes different only in the framework of [[quantum field theory]], where these fields are also quantized.

However, already in quantum mechanics there is one "caveat", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete  intrinsic [[angular momentum|angular momentum-like]] variable called the "[[Spin (physics)|spin]]", and there is the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] relating the space and the spin variables. Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s.  If two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a ''symmetric'' spin function (e.g.  parallel spins) the spatial variables must be ''antisymmetric'' (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel ''spins'' the ''position variables'' must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.

Thus the notion "force" loses already part of its meaning.

===Feynman diagrams===
{{main article|Feynman diagrams}}
[[File:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|right|Feynman diagram for the decay of a neutron into a proton. The [[W boson]] is between two vertices indicating a repulsion.]]
In modern [[particle physics]], forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying [[gauge boson]]s. With the development of [[quantum field theory]] and [[general relativity]], it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from [[conservation of momentum]] ([[4-momentum]] in relativity and momentum of [[virtual particle]]s in [[quantum electrodynamics]]). The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of [[space]] and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. Thus the currently known [[fundamental forces]] are considered more accurately to be "[[fundamental interactions]]".&lt;ref name="final theory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg |first=S. |year=1994 |title=Dreams of a Final Theory |publisher=Vintage Books USA |isbn=0-679-74408-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|199–128}} When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B. This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see [[world line]]) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines. Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex.&lt;ref name=Shifman&gt;{{cite book |first=Mikhail |last=Shifman |title=ITEP lectures on particle physics and field theory |publisher=World Scientific |year=1999 |isbn=981-02-2639-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utility of Feynman diagrams is that other types of physical phenomena that are part of the general picture of [[fundamental interaction]]s but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a [[neutron]] [[beta decay|decays]] into an [[electron]], [[proton]], and [[neutrino]], an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the [[weak nuclear force]].&lt;ref name="Shifman"/&gt;

==Fundamental forces==
{{main article|Fundamental interaction}} 

All of the known forces of the universe are classified into four [[fundamental interaction]]s. The [[strong force|strong]] and the [[weak force|weak]] forces are [[nuclear force]]s that act only at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between [[subatomic particle]]s, including [[nucleon]]s and compound [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. The [[electromagnetic force]] acts between [[electric charge]]s, and the [[gravitational force]] acts between [[mass]]es. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, [[friction]] is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between [[atoms]] of two surfaces, and the [[Pauli exclusion principle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Pauli Exclusion Principle |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pauli.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in [[spring (device)|springs]], modeled by [[Hooke's law]], are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Pauli exclusion principle acting together to return an object to its [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] position. [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|Centrifugal forces]] are [[acceleration]] forces that arise simply from the acceleration of [[rotation|rotating]] [[frames of reference]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|12-11}}&lt;ref name=Kleppner/&gt;{{rp|359}}

The fundamental theories for forces developed from the [[Unified field theory|unification]] of different ideas. For example, Sir. [[Isaac Newton]] unified, with his universal theory of [[gravitation]], the force responsible for objects falling near the surface of the [[Earth]] with the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the [[Moon]]) and around the Sun (the planets). [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter ([[fermion]]s) interacting by exchanging [[virtual particle]]s called [[gauge boson]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fermions &amp; Bosons |work=The Particle Adventure |url=http://particleadventure.org/frameless/fermibos.html |accessdate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218074732/http://particleadventure.org/frameless/fermibos.html |archivedate=2007-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[standard model]] of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in [[electroweak]] theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved [[Higgs mechanism]], but observations such as [[neutrino oscillation]]s suggest that the standard model is incomplete. A [[Grand Unified Theory]] that allows for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as [[supersymmetry]] proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding [[unsolved problems in physics]]. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a [[theory of everything]]. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is [[string theory]].&lt;ref name="final theory"/&gt;{{rp|212–219}}

[[File:Falling ball.jpg|upright|thumb|Images of a freely falling basketball taken with a [[stroboscope]] at 20 flashes per second.

What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton. Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the [[acceleration]] of every object in [[free-fall]] was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]] towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{g}&lt;/math&gt; and has a magnitude of about 9.81 [[meter]]s per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=A. H. |journal=Nature |title=A New Absolute Determination of the Acceleration due to Gravity at the National Physical Laboratory |date=1965|doi=10.1038/208279a0 |page=279 |volume=208 |bibcode=1965Natur.208..279C |issue=5007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass. Thus an object that has a mass of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; will experience a force:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m\vec{g}&lt;/math&gt;

For an object in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, the force of gravity is opposed by the reaction forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a [[normal force]] (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

Newton's contribution to gravitational theory was to unify the motions of heavenly bodies, which Aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth. He proposed a [[Newton's law of gravity|law of gravity]] that could account for the celestial motions that had been described earlier using [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch4 /&gt;

Newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances. In particular, Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an [[inverse square law]]. Further, Newton realized that the acceleration of a body due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the other attracting body.&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch4 /&gt; Combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_\oplus&lt;/math&gt;) and the radius (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_\oplus&lt;/math&gt;) of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{g}=-\frac{Gm_\oplus}{{R_\oplus}^2} \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where the vector direction is given by &lt;math&gt;\hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[unit vector]] directed outward from the center of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;

In this equation, a dimensional constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is used to describe the relative strength of gravity. This constant has come to be known as [[Newton's Universal Gravitation Constant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Sir Isaac Newton: The Universal Law of Gravitation

|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its value was unknown in Newton's lifetime. Not until 1798 was [[Henry Cavendish]] able to make the first measurement of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; using a [[torsion balance]]; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the Earth since knowing &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; could allow one to solve for the Earth's mass given the above equation. Newton, however, realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same [[Kepler's laws|laws of motion]], his law of gravity had to be universal. Succinctly stated, [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]] states that the force on a spherical object of mass &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; due to the gravitational pull of mass &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=-\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2} \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the two objects' centers of mass and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector pointed in the direction away from the center of the first object toward the center of the second object.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;

This formula was powerful enough to stand as the basis for all subsequent descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century. During that time, sophisticated methods of [[perturbation analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit, however, did not match that predicted by Newton's Law of Gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet ([[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]]) that would explain the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When [[Albert Einstein]] formulated his theory of [[general relativity]] (GR) he turned his attention to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|a correction, which could account for the discrepancy]]. This was the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Ethan|title=When Did Isaac Newton Finally Fail?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/05/20/when-did-isaac-newton-finally-fail/#6fdc279675f5|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=Forbes|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in [[geodesic|straight lines]] through [[curved space-time]] – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ''[[external ballistics|ballistic]] [[trajectory]]'' of the object. For example, a [[basketball]] thrown from the ground moves in a [[parabola]], as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] of the order of few [[light-year]]s). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as "gravitational force".&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Electromagnetic===
{{main article|Electromagnetic force}}
The [[electrostatic force]] was first described in 1784 by Coulomb as a force that existed intrinsically between two [[electric charge|charges]].&lt;ref name=Cutnell/&gt;{{rp|519}} The properties of the electrostatic force were that it varied as an [[inverse square law]] directed in the [[polar coordinates|radial direction]], was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic [[Electrical polarity|polarity]]), was independent of the mass of the charged objects, and followed the [[superposition principle]]. [[Coulomb's law]] unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.&lt;ref name="Coulomb"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Coulomb |journal=Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |year=1784 |title=Recherches théoriques et expérimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l'élasticité des fils de metal |pages=229–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent mathematicians and physicists found the construct of the ''[[electric field]]'' to be useful for determining the electrostatic force on an electric charge at any point in space. The electric field was based on using a hypothetical "[[test charge]]" anywhere in space and then using Coulomb's Law to determine the electrostatic force.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol2/&gt;{{rp|4-6 to 4-8}} Thus the electric field anywhere in space is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = {\vec{F} \over{q}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the hypothetical test charge.

Meanwhile, the [[Lorentz force]] of [[magnetism]] was discovered to exist between two [[electric current]]s. It has the same mathematical character as Coulomb's Law with the proviso that like currents attract and unlike currents repel. Similar to the electric field, the [[magnetic field]] can be used to determine the magnetic force on an electric current at any point in space. In this case, the magnitude of the magnetic field was determined to be
:&lt;math&gt;B = {F \over{I \ell}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the hypothetical test current and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length of hypothetical wire through which the test current flows. The magnetic field exerts a force on all [[magnet]]s including, for example, those used in [[compass]]es. The fact that the [[geomagnetism|Earth's magnetic field]] is aligned closely with the orientation of the Earth's [[rotation|axis]] causes compass magnets to become oriented because of the magnetic force pulling on the needle.

Through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge, a rule of [[Cross product|vector multiplication]] called [[Lorentz force|Lorentz's Law]] describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol2/&gt; The connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified ''electromagnetic force'' that acts on a charge. This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force (due to the magnetic field). Fully stated, this is the law:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the electromagnetic force, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the charge of the particle, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity]] of the particle that is [[cross product|crossed]] with the magnetic field (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;).

The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when [[James Clerk Maxwell]] unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be "self-generating" through a [[wave]] that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the [[speed of light]]. This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with [[optics]] and led directly to a complete description of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;

However, attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the [[photoelectric effect]], and the nonexistence of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], proved troublesome. Through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to [[quantum electrodynamics]] (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as [[photon]]s. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;For a complete library on quantum mechanics see [[Quantum mechanics#References|Quantum mechanics – References]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strong nuclear===
{{main article|Strong interaction}}
There are two "[[nuclear force]]s", which today are usually described as interactions that take place in quantum theories of particle physics. The [[strong nuclear force]]&lt;ref name=Cutnell/&gt;{{rp|940}} is the force responsible for the structural integrity of [[atomic nuclei]] while the [[weak nuclear force]]&lt;ref name=Cutnell/&gt;{{rp|951}} is responsible for the decay of certain [[nucleon]]s into [[lepton]]s and other types of [[hadron]]s.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

The strong force is today understood to represent the [[interaction]]s between [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s as detailed by the theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong force is the [[fundamental force]] mediated by [[gluons]], acting upon quarks, [[antiparticle|antiquarks]], and the [[gluon]]s themselves. The (aptly named) strong interaction is the "strongest" of the four fundamental forces.

The strong force only acts ''directly'' upon elementary particles. However, a residual of the force is observed between [[hadron]]s (the best known example being the force that acts between [[nucleon]]s in atomic nuclei) as the [[nuclear force]]. Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho [[meson]]s, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more). The failure of many searches for [[free quark]]s has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called [[color confinement]].

===Weak nuclear===
{{Main article|Weak interaction}}
The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy [[W and Z bosons]]. Its most familiar effect is [[beta decay]] (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated [[radioactivity]]. The word "weak" derives from the fact that the field strength is some 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; times less than that of the [[strong force]]. Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]s. Such temperatures have been probed in modern [[particle accelerator]]s and show the conditions of the [[universe]] in the early moments of the [[Big Bang]].

==Non-fundamental forces==
Some forces are consequences of the fundamental ones. In such situations, idealized models can be utilized to gain physical insight.

===Normal force===
[[File:Incline.svg|right|thumb|''F&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the [[normal force]] exerted on the object.]]
{{main article|Normal force}}
The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to [[fermion]]ic nature of [[electron]]s) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the surface interface between two objects.&lt;ref name=Cutnell/&gt;{{rp|93}} The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Friction===
{{main article|Friction}}
Friction is a surface force that opposes relative motion. The frictional force is directly related to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: [[static friction]] and [[kinetic friction]].

The static friction force (&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{sf}}&lt;/math&gt;) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface contact up to the limit specified by the [[coefficient of static friction]] (&lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{sf}}&lt;/math&gt;) multiplied by the normal force (&lt;math&gt;F_N&lt;/math&gt;). In other words, the magnitude of the static friction force satisfies the inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \le F_{\mathrm{sf}} \le \mu_{\mathrm{sf}} F_\mathrm{N}.&lt;/math&gt;

The kinetic friction force (&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{kf}}&lt;/math&gt;) is independent of both the forces applied and the movement of the object. Thus, the magnitude of the force equals:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{kf}} = \mu_{\mathrm{kf}} F_\mathrm{N},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\mathrm{kf}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coefficient of kinetic friction]]. For most surface interfaces, the coefficient of kinetic friction is less than the coefficient of static friction.

===Tension===
{{main article|Tension (physics)}}
Tension forces can be modeled using [[ideal string]]s that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal [[pulley]]s, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an [[mechanical advantage|increase in force]], there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the [[conservation of energy|conservation of mechanical energy]] since the [[#Kinematic integrals|work done on the load]] is the same no matter how complicated the machine.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Elastic force===
{{main article|Elasticity (physics)|Hooke's law}}
[[File:Mass-spring-system.png|upright|thumb|''F&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the force that responds to the load on the spring]]
An elastic force acts to return a [[Spring (device)|spring]] to its natural length. An [[ideal spring]] is taken to be massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and infinitely stretchable. Such springs exert forces that push when contracted, or pull when extended, in proportion to the [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement]] of the spring from its equilibrium position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Elasticity |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/permot2.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This linear relationship was described by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1676, for whom [[Hooke's law]] is named. If &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement, the force exerted by an ideal spring equals:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=-k \Delta \vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the spring constant (or force constant), which is particular to the spring. The minus sign accounts for the tendency of the force to act in opposition to the applied load.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Continuum mechanics===
[[File:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|upright|When the drag force (&lt;math&gt;F_d&lt;/math&gt;) associated with air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to the force of gravity on a falling object (&lt;math&gt;F_g&lt;/math&gt;), the object reaches a state of [[#Dynamic equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]] at [[terminal velocity]].]]
{{main article|Pressure|Drag (physics)|Stress (mechanics)}}
Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized [[point particle]]s rather than three-dimensional objects. However, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object. For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow, contract, expand, or otherwise change shape, the theories of [[continuum mechanics]] describe the way forces affect the material. For example, in extended [[fluid mechanics|fluids]], differences in [[pressure]] result in forces being directed along the pressure [[gradient]]s as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\vec{F}}{V} = - \vec{\nabla} P&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the object in the fluid and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar function]] that describes the pressure at all locations in space. Pressure gradients and differentials result in the [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] for fluids suspended in gravitational fields, winds in [[atmospheric science]], and the [[lift (physics)|lift]] associated with [[aerodynamics]] and [[flight]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

A specific instance of such a force that is associated with [[dynamic pressure]] is fluid resistance: a body force that resists the motion of an object through a fluid due to [[viscosity]]. For so-called "[[Drag (physics)#Very low Reynolds numbers—Stokes' drag|Stokes' drag]]" the force is approximately proportional to the velocity, but opposite in direction:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_\mathrm{d} = - b \vec{v} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a constant that depends on the properties of the fluid and the dimensions of the object (usually the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]]), and
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

More formally, forces in [[continuum mechanics]] are fully described by a [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]–[[tensor]] with terms that are roughly defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated. This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the [[matrix diagonal]]s of the tensor) as well as [[Shear stress|shear]] terms associated with forces that act [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all [[strain (physics)|strains]] (deformations) including also [[tensile stress]]es and [[compression (physical)|compressions]].&lt;ref name=uniphysics_ch2&gt;''University Physics'', Sears, Young &amp; Zemansky, pp.18–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner&gt;{{harvnb|Kleppner|Kolenkow|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–134}}&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol2&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman volume 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38-1–38-11}}

===Fictitious forces===
{{main article|Fictitious forces}}
There are forces that are [[frame dependent]], meaning that they appear due to the adoption of non-Newtonian (that is, [[non-inertial frame|non-inertial]]) [[Frame of reference|reference frames]]. Such forces include the [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] and the [[Coriolis force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mallette |first=Vincent |title=Inwit Publishing, Inc. and Inwit, LLC – Writings, Links and Software Distributions – The Coriolis Force |work=Publications in Science and Mathematics, Computing and the Humanities |publisher=Inwit Publishing, Inc. |date=1982–2008 |url=http://www.algorithm.com/inwit/writings/coriolisforce.html |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forces are considered fictitious because they do not exist in frames of reference that are not accelerating.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt; Because these forces are not genuine they are also referred to as "pseudo forces".&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;{{rp|12-11}}

In [[general relativity]], [[gravity]] becomes a fictitious force that arises in situations where spacetime deviates from a flat geometry. As an extension, [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] and [[string theory]] ascribe electromagnetism and the other [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] respectively to the curvature of differently scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.

==Rotations and torque==
[[File:Torque animation.gif|frame|right|Relationship between force (F), torque (τ), and [[angular momentum|momentum]] vectors (p and L) in a rotating system.]]
{{main article|Torque}}
Forces that cause extended objects to rotate are associated with [[torque]]s. Mathematically, the torque of a force &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is defined relative to an arbitrary reference point as the [[cross-product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[position vector]] of the force application point relative to the reference point.

Torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that [[angle]] is the rotational equivalent for [[position (vector)|position]], [[angular velocity]] for [[velocity]], and [[angular momentum]] for [[momentum]]. As a consequence of Newton's First Law of Motion, there exists [[rotational inertia]] that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque. Likewise, Newton's Second Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous [[angular acceleration]] of the rigid body:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = I\vec{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the angular acceleration of the body.

This provides a definition for the moment of inertia, which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the [[Moment of inertia tensor|tensor]] that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including [[precession]] and [[nutation]].

Equivalently, the differential form of Newton's Second Law provides an alternative definition of torque:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{L}}{\mathrm{dt}},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Newton's 2nd Law: Rotation |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/n2r.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the angular momentum of the particle.

Newton's Third Law of Motion requires that all objects exerting torques themselves experience equal and opposite torques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Richard |title=Newton's third law of motion |date=2007-01-07 |url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336k/lectures/node26.html |accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore also directly implies the [[conservation of angular momentum]] for closed systems that experience rotations and [[revolution]]s through the action of internal torques.

===Centripetal force===
{{main article|Centripetal force}}
For an object accelerating in circular motion, the unbalanced force acting on the object equals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Centripetal Force |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/cf.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = - \frac{mv^2 \hat{r}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the center of the circular path and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit vector]] pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the [[speed]] of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

==Kinematic integrals==
{{main article|Impulse (physics)|l1=Impulse|Mechanical work|Power (physics)}}
Forces can be used to define a number of physical concepts by [[integration (calculus)|integrating]] with respect to [[kinematics|kinematic variables]]. For example, integrating with respect to time gives the definition of [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
|title=Engineering Mechanics, 12th edition

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{I}=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}{\vec{F} \mathrm{d}t},&lt;/math&gt;

which by Newton's Second Law must be equivalent to the change in momentum (yielding the [[Impulse momentum theorem]]).

Similarly, integrating with respect to position gives a definition for the [[work (physics)|work done]] by a force:&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|13-3}}
:&lt;math&gt;W=\int_{\vec{x}_1}^{\vec{x}_2}{\vec{F} \cdot{\mathrm{d}\vec{x}}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to changes in [[kinetic energy]] (yielding the [[work energy theorem]]).&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|13-3}}

[[Power (physics)|Power]] ''P'' is the rate of change d''W''/d''t'' of the work ''W'', as the [[trajectory]] is extended by a position change &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {d}\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; in a time interval d''t'':&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1/&gt;{{rp|13-2}}
:&lt;math&gt;
  \text{d}W\, =\, \frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}\vec{x}}\, \cdot\, \text{d}\vec{x}\, =\, \vec{F}\, \cdot\, \text{d}\vec{x},
  \qquad \text{ so } \quad
  P\, =\, \frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}t}\, =\, \frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}\vec{x}}\, \cdot\, \frac{\text{d}\vec{x}}{\text{d}t}\, =\, \vec{F}\, \cdot\, \vec{v},
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;{\vec{v}\text{ }=\text{ d}\vec{x}/\text{d}t}&lt;/math&gt; the [[velocity]].

==Potential energy==
{{main article|Potential energy}}
Instead of a force, often the mathematically related concept of a [[potential energy]] field can be used for convenience. For instance, the gravitational force acting upon an object can be seen as the action of the [[gravitational field]] that is present at the object's location. Restating mathematically the definition of energy (via the definition of [[Mechanical work|work]]), a potential [[scalar field]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{U(\vec{r})}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as that field whose [[gradient]] is equal and opposite to the force produced at every point:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}=-\vec{\nabla} U.&lt;/math&gt;

Forces can be classified as [[Conservative force|conservative]] or nonconservative. Conservative forces are equivalent to the gradient of a [[potential]] while nonconservative forces are not.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Conservative forces===
{{main article|Conservative force}}
A conservative force that acts on a [[closed system]] has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] or [[potential energy|potential]] forms. This means that for a closed system, the net [[mechanical energy]] is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last=Singh
|first=Sunil Kumar
|title=Conservative force

|date=2007-08-25
|url=http://cnx.org/content/m14104/latest/
|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the [[contour map]] of the elevation of an area.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

Conservative forces include [[gravity]], the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] force, and the [[Hooke's law|spring]] force. Each of these forces has models that are dependent on a position often given as a [[radius|radial vector]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt; emanating from [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetric]] potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For gravity:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_g = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]], and &lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of object ''n''.

For electrostatic forces:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_e = \frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r^2} \hat{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{0}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Permittivity|electric permittivity of free space]], and &lt;math&gt;q_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electric charge]] of object ''n''.

For spring forces:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_x = - k \vec{r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[spring constant]].&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

===Nonconservative forces===
For certain physical scenarios, it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the [[atom]]s, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other [[contact force]]s, [[Tension (physics)|tension]], [[Physical compression|compression]], and [[drag (physics)|drag]]. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with [[statistical mechanics]]. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the [[internal energy|internal energies]] of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as [[entropy]] increases.&lt;ref name=FeynmanVol1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleppner /&gt;

==Units of measurement==
The [[SI]] unit of force is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (symbol N), which is the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared, or {{math|kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name= metric_units&gt;{{cite book |first=Cornelius |last=Wandmacher |first2=Arnold |last2=Johnson |title=Metric Units in Engineering |page=15 |year=1995 |publisher=ASCE Publications |isbn=0-7844-0070-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding [[CGS]] unit is the [[dyne]], the force required to accelerate a one gram mass by one centimeter per second squared, or {{math|g·cm·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A newton is thus equal to 100,000&amp;nbsp;dynes.

The gravitational [[foot-pound-second]] [[English unit]] of force is the [[pound-force]] (lbf), defined as the force exerted by gravity on a [[pound-mass]] in the [[Standard gravity|standard gravitational]] field of {{math|9.80665&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=metric_units/&gt; The pound-force provides an alternative unit of mass: one [[slug (unit)|slug]] is the mass that will accelerate by one foot per second squared when acted on by one pound-force.&lt;ref name=metric_units/&gt;

An alternative unit of force in a different foot-pound-second system, the absolute fps system, is the [[poundal]], defined as the force required to accelerate a one-pound mass at a rate of one foot per second squared.&lt;ref name=metric_units/&gt; The units of [[slug (unit)|slug]] and [[poundal]] are designed to avoid a constant of proportionality in [[Newton's Second Law]].

The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less commonly used than the newton: the [[kilogram-force]] (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass.&lt;ref name= metric_units/&gt; The kilogram-force leads to an alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the [[metric slug]] (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at {{math|1&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} when subjected to a force of 1&amp;nbsp;kgf. The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the [[sthène]], which is equivalent to 1000&amp;nbsp;N, and the [[kip (unit)|kip]], which is equivalent to 1000&amp;nbsp;lbf.

'''Genetic admixture''' occurs when two or more previously isolated and genetically differentiated populations begin [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rius, M. and Darling, J.A. |title=How important is intraspecific genetic admixture to the success of colonising populations? |year=2014 |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=233−242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admixture results in the introduction of new [[Lineage (genetic)|genetic lineages]] into a population. It has been known to slow local adaptation by introducing foreign, unadapted [[genotype]]s (known as [[genetic pollution]]). It also prevents [[speciation]] by homogenizing populations and increasing [[heterozygosity]].

==Examples==
Climatic cycles facilitate genetic admixture in cold periods and genetic diversification in warm periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lv, X., Cheng, J., Meng, Y., Chang, Y., Xia, L., Wen, Z., Ge, D., Liu, S. and Yang, Q. |year=2018 |title=Disjunct distribution and distinct intraspecific diversification of ''Eothenomys melanogaster'' in South China |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Natural [[flood]]ing can cause genetic admixture within populations of migrating fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Jaisuk, C. and Senanan, W. |year=2018 |title=Effects of landscape features on population genetic variation of a tropical stream fish, Stone lapping minnow, ''Garra cambodgiensis'', in the upper Nan River drainage basin, northern Thailand |journal=PeerJ |volume=6 |page=e4487}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic admixture may have an important role for the success of populations that colonise a new area and [[interbreed]] with individuals of native populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Kolbe, J.J., Larson, A., Losos, J.B. and de Queiroz, K. |year=2008 |title=Admixture determines genetic diversity and population differentiation in the biological invasion of a lizard species |journal=Biology Letters |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=434−437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mapping==
Admixture mapping is a method of [[gene mapping]] that uses a [[population]] of mixed ancestry (an admixed population) to find the genetic [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] that contribute to differences in diseases or other [[phenotypes]] found between the different ancestral populations. The method is best applied to populations with recent admixture from two populations that were previously genetically isolated for tens of thousands of years, such as [[African Americans]] (admixture of African and European populations). The method attempts to correlate the degree of ancestry near a genetic locus with the phenotype or disease of interest. Genetic markers that differ in frequency between the ancestral populations are needed across the genome.&lt;ref name="Shriver"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shriver |first1=MD |display-authors=etal |title=Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping |journal=Human Genetics |date=April 2003 |volume=112 |issue=4 |pages=387–99 |doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y |pmid=12579416|doi-broken-date=2018-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admixture mapping is based on the assumption that differences in disease rates or phenotypes are due in part to differences in the frequencies of disease-causing or phenotype-causing genetic variants between populations. In an admixed population, these causal variants occur more frequently on chromosomal segments inherited from one or another ancestral population. The first admixture scans were published in 2005 and since then genetic contributors to a variety of disease and trait differences have been mapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-genom-082509-141523| last1 = Winkler  | first1 = C. A. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = G. W. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. W. | title = Admixture mapping comes of age | journal = Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet | volume =  11 | pages =  65–89 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20594047}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[hypertension]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Body mass index|BMI]], and [[prostate cancer]] in African Americans. By 2010, high-density mapping panels had been constructed for African Americans, Latino/Hispanics, and [[Uyghurs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6940">'''H.M. Krishna Murthy''' is a former researcher from the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="HansenJeff"&gt;Hansen, Jeff. "Ex-UAB researcher's work may be fake". The Birmingham News. Retrieved 14 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, several of his publications were retracted from scientific journals after accusations of [[scientific misconduct]] surfaced. UAB  began investigating claims of fraud in January 2007 after the validity of the proteins came into question.  The University’s probe produced ten publications that were shown not to be valid. These publications have since been retracted from their respective journals.&lt;ref name="Statementon"&gt;"UAB Statement on Protein Data Bank Issues". UAB. Retrieved 14 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Murthy’s publications dealt with the crystal structures of several proteins that he  had claimed to have determined using crystallographic methods. It was found that these [[protein structure]]s were never properly determined and the primary crystallographic data for at least some of them have been fabricated by Murthy.

==Professional career==
In 1981, Murthy began his work with [[protein crystallography]] as a post doctoral researcher at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=nature /&gt;  While he was researching there, Murthy worked under renowned crystallographer [[Thomas Steitz]]. The research Murthy did while at Yale is regarded as genuine. In 1998, Murthy began working at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. There, he was a research assistant professor in the Center for Biophysical Sciences and Engineering.

==Protein structure fabrication scandal==

In 2007, H.M. Krishna Murthy was working as a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham when questions regarding the authenticity of his work surfaced.&lt;ref name="HansenJeff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Statementon" /&gt; European crystallographers were looking into some of the structures that Dr. Murthy had claimed to have solved and began to see issues.&lt;ref name="Statementon" /&gt; Graduate students in the Netherlands working under Dr. [[Piet Gros]] also spotted problems throughout Murthy’s work. Gros pointed out the many missing layers throughout the structure of C3B. When asked to provide further information about the structures, Dr. Murthy could not provide enough information to prove their validity.&lt;ref name="HansenJeff" /&gt; Gros and several other scientists decided to check the work and discovered unrealistic and physically impossible data. After receiving this information, the university decided to launch an investigation of their own.&lt;ref name="GrantBob"&gt;Grant, Bob. "Crystallographer faked data". The Scientist. Retrieved 13 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A committee of experts (appointed by the University of Alabama at Birmingham) in the field with no conflicting interests looked into the case and determined that the structures were more than likely fabricated. The group discovered that these structures defied many physical and chemical laws, further proving that these protein structures were fictitious. The team looking into the fraud suggested that the structures be removed from the public record. 

In total, twelve of H.M. Krishna Murthy’s structures and ten of his papers were affected by this scandal.&lt;ref name="Statementon" /&gt; The papers were retracted by their respective journals and upon retraction. However, not all of the structures have been removed from the [[Protein Data Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;wwPDB Statement on Retraction of PDB Entries". World Wide Protein Database. Retrieved 15 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The protein structures in question were 1BEF, 1CMW, 1DF9, 2QID, 1G40, 1G44, 1L6L, 2OU1, 1RID, 1Y8E, 2A01, and 2HR0. Only 1BEF, 1CMW, 1DF9 and 2QID have been removed. &lt;ref name="Citationsmaybe"&gt;449 Citations maybe Affected by Retracted Structures". Retrieved 14 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Murthy's falsified data ended up affecting 449 papers. These papers covered a range of topics; everything from [[dengue]] to [[Taq DNA polymerase]]. 

The UAB investigation turned up significant amounts of data proving Murthy falsified these protein structures. In multiple instances, they found impossible electron densities and highly unlikely geometries.&lt;ref name=Statementon /&gt;  Furthermore, they found inconsistencies in the data indicative of computer generated information. In some cases, the information Murthy cited as proof of the structures was not a piece of original work. This confirmed the fictitious nature of his structures by showing that he had used another protein as a model for his creation. Specifically, Murthy tried to pass some elements of a known structure of TAQ polymerase (PDB entry 1TAQ) as a new structure (PDB entry 1CMW). When the misconduct inquiry looked for Murthy's work on several of these proteins, no experimental data was made available to them. Most significantly, no one has been able to experimentally support any of Murthy's structures.

Murthy’s most famous fraudulent structure was 1BEF. Published in 1999 and retracted in 2009, 1BEF was cited in over ninety publications.&lt;ref name="Citationsmaybe" /&gt; 1BEF was first mentioned in a now retracted article from The [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishna Murthy, H.M.; S. Clum, R. Padmanabhan. "Dengue virus NS3 serine protease. Crystal structure and insights into interaction of the active site with substrates by molecular modeling and structural analysis of mutational effects.". The Journal of Biological Chemistry. Retrieved 15 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Murthy claimed 1BEF could be used as a potential treatment option for patients with [[dengue]] and other flaviviral proteases. The UAB team that investigated Murthy’s publications said that 1BEF is “an improbable structure…[with] an unacceptable level of inter-atomic clashing.” &lt;ref name="Statementon" /&gt;

==Aftermath==

Murthy still claims he did not commit any misconduct.,&lt;ref name= "nature"&gt;]Borrell, Brendan. "Fraud rocks protein community". Nature. Retrieved 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GrantBob" /&gt; However, most scientists agree that the evidence against him indicates otherwise. Murthy’s contract with the University of Alabama at Birmingham expired in February 2009, shortly after his fabrication of data became known to the university. The university chose not to renew the contract, ending their involvement with Murthy. Murthy’s current whereabouts are not known and no one has been able to reach him.&lt;ref name="HansenJeff" /&gt; Murthy has not published since the scandal was uncovered.

Medawar was born in [[London, England]], the daughter of Katherine Leslie (''née'' Paton) and Charles Henry Shinglewood Taylor. Her father was a physician working in Cambridge. Her mother was an American from [[St Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="medawar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medawar|first1=Peter|title=Memoir of a Thinking Radish : An Autobiography|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=180–195|isbn=0-19-217737-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgVrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Memoir+of+a+Thinking+Radish+:+An+Autobiography&amp;dq=Memoir+of+a+Thinking+Radish+:+An+Autobiography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended [[Benenden School]] in Kent and she won a scholarship to study [[zoology]]. She joined [[Somerville College, Oxford]], and earned her BSc in zoology in 1935.  She continued to work on the origin and development of [[lymphocyte]]s under [[Howard Florey]] (who later won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1945) until her marriage in 1937. In 1954, she met [[Margaret Pyke]], Chair of the Family Planning Association, and joined the organisation. She became a member of its executive in 1960.&lt;ref name="rich"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richmond|first1=C.|title=Lady Jean Medawar|journal=BMJ|date=2005|volume=330|issue=7504|pages=1392–1392|doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7504.1392|pmc=558304}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 she became Joint Editor of the journal ''Family Planning'' (continued as ''Family Planning Today'') alongside David Pyke, Pyke's son, and remained till 1979.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jean Medawar: Writer and family-planning campaigner|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jean-medawar-221085.html|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=Independent|date=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked with the [[Citizens Advice|Citizens' Advice Bureau]], the [[Relate|National Marriage Guidance Council]] and also with young offenders at [[HM Prison Holloway]] at Hampstead. She was appointed chairman of the FPA in 1966, owing to the death of Margaret Pyke, and held the post till 1970. She co-founded the Margaret Pyke Centre for Study and Training in Family Planning and the Margaret Pyke Memorial Trust in 1968,&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt; becoming its Director in 1976 until her death.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

==Life with Peter Medawar==

Medawar published her memoir ''A Very Decided Preference: Life with Peter Medawar'' in 1990 in which she gives an account of her personal life. She met Peter Medawar in Oxford, with the first impression that he looked 'mildly diabolical'.&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt; She approached him for the meaning of "[[heuristic]]", which led to a continued tutorial and lasting friendship. Her family did not want her to marry him because Peter Medawar was of a Lebanese descent and was not financially well-to-do. Her mother asked her, "What will you do if you have black babies?" Her aunt described Medawar as having 'no background, no money', and eventually disinherited her.&lt;ref name="medawar"/&gt; They were married on 27 February 1937. They had two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise.&lt;ref name="NewSci"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.robert-temple.com/articles/NewScientist_PMedawar.pdf &lt;!--or https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd_RDty8ft0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false --&gt; | title=Sir Peter Medawar | author=[[Robert K.

Her husband won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1960. Together they wrote ''The Life Science : Current Ideas of Biology'' in 1977, and ''Aristotle to Zoos : A Philosophical Dictionary of Biology'' in 1984.&lt;ref name="medawar"/&gt;

'''Knowledge inertia'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liao|first=Shu-hsien|date=2002-01-01|title=Problem solving and knowledge inertia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741740100046X|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–31|doi=10.1016/S0957-4174(01)00046-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ('''KI''') is a concept in [[knowledge management]]. The term initially proposed by Liao (2002)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; constitutes a two dimensional model of knowledge inertia which incorporates experience inertia and learning inertia. Later, another dimension—the dimension of [[thinking]] inertia has been added based on the theoretical exploration of the existing concepts of experience inertia and learning inertia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the central problems in knowledge management related to [[organizational learning]] is to deal with “[[inertia]]”. Besides, individuals may also exhibit a natural tendency of inertia when facing problems during utilization of knowledge. Inertia in technical jargon means inactivity or torpor. Inertia in [[organizational learning]] context may be referred to as a slowdown in organizational learning-related activities. In fact, there are many other kinds of organizational inertia; e.g., innovation inertia, workforce inertia, productivity inertia, decision inertia, emotional inertia besides others that have different meanings in their own individual contexts. Some organization theorists have adopted the definition proposed by Liao (2002)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to extend its further use in organizational learning studies.

== Definition ==

Knowledge inertia (KI) may be defined as a [[problem solving]] strategy using old, redundant, stagnant knowledge and past experience without recourse to new knowledge and [[experience]]. Inertia is a concept in physics that is used to explain the state of an object either remaining in stationary or uniform motion. Organizational theorists adopted this concept of inertia and applied it to different contexts which resulted in the emergence of diverse concepts—such as, for example, [[organizational inertia]], consumer inertia, outsourcing inertia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mol|first=Michael J.|last2=Kotabe|first2=Masaaki|date=2011-06-01|title=Overcoming Inertia: Drivers of the Outsourcing Process|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024630110000737|journal=Long Range Planning|volume=44|issue=3|pages=160–178|doi=10.1016/j.lrp.2010.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cognitive inertia]]. Some organization theorists{{who|date=November 2018}} have adopted the definition proposed by Liao (2002) to extend its further use in organizational learning studies. Not every instances of knowledge inertia result in gloomy of negative outcome: one study suggested that knowledge inertia could positively affect a firm's product innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xie|first=Xuemei|last2=Fang|first2=Liangxiu|last3=Zeng|first3=Saixing|last4=Huo|first4=Jiage|date=2016-05-01|title=How does knowledge inertia affect firms product innovation?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315004506|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Designing implementable innovative realities|volume=69|issue=5|pages=1615–1620|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.10.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The concept ==
Knowledge inertia stems from the use of routine [[problem solving]] procedures that involves the utilization of redundant, stagnant knowledge and past experience without any recourse to new knowledge and thinking processes.  Different methodologies exist for diverse types of knowledge that could be applied to manage knowledge efficiently. Since KI is a component of knowledge management, it is essential to consider the circulation of various knowledge types in avoiding inertia. The theory of KI supposedly studies the extent to which an organization's ability on problem solving is inhibited. Numerous factors could be attributed as enablers or inhibitors of the abilities on problem solving of an individual or an [[organization]]. Knowledge inertia applicable in the context of problem solving, therefore, may require inputs from all these diverse knowledge types, or it may require learning, new thinking, and experience. Emergence of new ideas to supplement the existing knowledge and assimilation of the same could be of help in avoiding the use of stagnant, outdated information while attempting to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Ping|last2=Yang|first2=Xue-wei|date=2013-10-15|title=A Review of Knowledge Inertia:How can we explain the hindrance on individual innovation|url=http://www.atlantis-press.com/php/paper-details.php?id=9351|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 International Academic Workshop on Social Science (IAW-SC-13)|publisher=Atlantis Press|doi=10.2991/iaw-sc.2013.67|isbn=9789078677840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafchehi|first=Parviz|last2=Zamani|first2=Arash|last3=Ebrahimabadi|first3=Farhad|date=2012-09-25|title=A Model of Influential Factors on Knowledge Inertia|url=http://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alDetailedMesh?docid=20418752-201209-201508130023-201508130023-386-391|journal=Asian Journal of Business Management|volume=4|issue=4|issn=2041-8752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10926">The '''Koide formula''' is an unexplained [[Empirical relationship|empirical equation]] discovered by [[Yoshio Koide]]&lt;!--Koide Yoshio 小出 義雄--&gt; in 1981. In its original form, it relates the masses of the three charged [[leptons]]; later authors have extended the relation to neutrinos, quarks, and other families of particles.

==Formula==
The Koide formula is:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{m_e + m_{\mu} + m_{\tau}}{(\sqrt{m_e}+\sqrt{m_{\mu}}+\sqrt{m_{\tau}})^2} \approx 0.6666617 \approx \frac{2}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

where the masses of the [[electron]], [[muon]], and [[tau (particle)|tau]] are measured respectively as ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|0.510998946|(3)|ul=MeV/c2}}, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|105.6583745|(24)|u=MeV/c2}}, and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|1776.86|(12)|u=MeV/c2}}, and the digits in parentheses are the [[measurement uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the last figures.&lt;ref name="AmslerDoser2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amsler|first1=C. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=Particle Data Group |title=Review of Particle Physics|journal=Physics Letters B |volume=667 |issue=1–5 |year=2008 |pages=1–6 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.07.018 |bibcode=2008PhLB..667....1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives ''Q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|0.666661|(7)}}.&lt;ref&gt;Since the uncertainties in ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; are much smaller than that in ''m''&lt;sub&gt;τ&lt;/sub&gt;, the uncertainty in ''Q'' was calculated as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\Delta Q = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial m_\tau}\Delta m_\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is clear that {{nowrap|{{frac|1|3}} &lt; Q &lt; 1}}. The superior bound follows if we assume that the square roots cannot be negative. By [[Cauchy-Schwarz]], the value &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3Q}&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the squared cosine of the angle between the vector &lt;math&gt;(\sqrt{m_e},\sqrt{m_{\mu}},\sqrt{m_{\tau}})&lt;/math&gt; and the vector
&lt;math&gt;(1,1,1)&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[dot product]]).

The mystery is in the physical value. Not only is this result odd in that three apparently random numbers should give a simple fraction, but also that ''Q'' is exactly halfway between the two extremes of {{frac|1|3}} (should the three masses be equal) and 1 (should one mass dominate). 

While the original formula appeared in the context of [[preon]] models, other ways have been found to produce it (both by Sumino and by Koide, see references below). As a whole, however, understanding remains incomplete. Similar matches have been found for triplets of quarks depending on running masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodejohann |first1=W. |last2=Zhang |first2=H. |year=2011 |title=Extension of an empirical charged lepton mass relation to the neutrino sector |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=698 |issue=2 |pages=152–156 |arxiv=1101.5525 |bibcode=2011PhLB..698..152R |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2011.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosen |first=G. |year=2007 |title=Heuristic development of a Dirac-Goldhaber model for lepton and quark structure  |url=http://home.comcast.net/~gerald-rosen/heuristicmpla.pdf |journal=[[Modern Physics Letters A]] |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=283–288 |bibcode=2007MPLA...22..283R |doi=10.1142/S0217732307022621}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Kartavtsev |first=A. |year=2011 |title=A remark on the Koide relation for quarks |eprint=1111.0480 |class=hep-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; With alternating quarks, chaining Koide equations for consecutive triplets, it is possible to reach a result of 173.263947(6) GeV for the mass of the [[top quark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Rivero |first1=A. |year=2011 |title=A new Koide tuple: Strange-charm-bottom |eprint=1111.7232 |class=hep-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar formulae in literature==
There are similar empirical formulae which relate other masses. 
Quark masses depend on the energy scale used to measure them, which makes an analysis more complicated.

Taking the heaviest three quarks, [[charm quark|charm]] (1290 MeV), [[bottom quark|bottom]] (4180 MeV) and [[top quark|top]] (172440 MeV), gives the value:&lt;ref name=Cao/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{heavy} = \frac{m_C + m_{B} + m_{T}}{(\sqrt{m_C}+\sqrt{m_B}+\sqrt{m_T})^2} \approx  0.668 \approx \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

The possibility that ''Q'' equals exactly 2/3 lies within the experimental uncertainties of the masses ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}{{cn|date=August 2018}}). This was noticed by Rodejohann and Zhang in the first version of their 2011 paper&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite arXiv&lt;!-- Do not convert to cite journal --&gt;

 |arxiv=1101.5525
 |class=hep-ph
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the observation was removed in the published version,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the first published mention is in 2012 from F. G. Cao.&lt;ref name=Cao&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the masses of the lightest quarks, [[up quark|up]] (2.3 MeV), [[down quark|down]] (4.8 MeV), and [[strange quark|strange]] (95 MeV) yield:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{light} = \frac{m_{U} + m_{D} + m_{S}}{(\sqrt{m_{U}}+\sqrt{m_{D}}+\sqrt{m_{S}})^2} \approx 0.56&lt;/math&gt;

a value also cited by Cao.&lt;ref name=Cao/&gt;

==Running of particle masses==
In [[quantum field theory]], quantities like [[coupling constant]] and [[mass]] "run" with the energy scale. That is, their value depends on the energy scale at which the observation occurs, in a way described by a [[Exact renormalization group equation|renormalization group equation]] (RGE). One usually expects relationships between such quantities to be simple at high energies (where some [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] is [[symmetry breaking|unbroken]]) but not at low energies, where the RG flow will have produced complicated deviations from the high energy relation. The Koide relation is exact (within experimental error) for the [[pole mass]]es, which are low-energy quantities defined at different energy scales. For this reason, many physicists regard the relation as [[Numerology#.22Numerology.22 in science|"numerology"]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |work=The Reference Frame
 |accessdate=2014-07-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the Japanese physicist [[Yukinari Sumino]] has constructed an [[effective field theory]] in which a new [[gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] causes the pole masses to exactly satisfy the relation.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goffinet's doctoral thesis gives a discussion on pole masses and how the Koide formula can be reformulated without taking the square roots of masses.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Kosmos 133''' ({{lang-ru|Космос 133}}, meaning "Cosmos 133"; [[International Designator|COSPAR ID]]: 1966-107A), was the first unmanned test flight of the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]], and first mission of the [[Soyuz programme]], as part of the [[Soviet space program]]me.

Launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] aboard the maiden flight of the [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]] carrier rocket, Kosmos 133 was planned "all up" test, to include an automated docking with a second Soyuz ([[Soyuz 7K-OK No.1]]), which was scheduled for launch the day after Kosmos 133. Problems found during ground testing of the second spacecraft resulted in its launch being delayed, and it was destroyed when its carrier rocket exploded on its launch pad following a scrubbed launch attempt in December.

Before this, the attitude control system of Kosmos 133 malfunctioned, resulting in rapid consumption of orientation fuel, leaving it spinning at 2 rpm. After large efforts by ground control and 5 attempts at retrofire over two days, the craft was finally coming down for a landing. Due to the inaccuracy of the reentry burn, it was determined that the capsule would land in [[China]]. The self-destruct command was given and the satellite exploded 30 November 1966 at 10:21 GMT.

The fireball passed over west [[Japan]] and was recorded by photos and a sketch. [[Kōichirō Tomita]] identified that it was the Kosmos 133 spacecraft.

Lanner Group continued to develop the WITNESS platform further in parallel to developing its mainstay product of the same name, and since 2002 has introduced new systems providing niche simulation packages for police and healthcare organisations called ''PRISM'' and ''PX-Sim'' respectively.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; In 2006 the company unveiled a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] based simulation engine called ''L-SIM'' which is embedded in [[Business Process Management]] (BPM) solutions software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Waller AP, Clark MF, Enstone LR |title=L-SIM : Simulating BPMN Diagrams with a Purpose Built Engine | journal=Proceedings of the 2006 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC 06)|year=2006 | pages=591–597 | publisher=Winter Simulation Conference | isbn=1-4244-0500-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May the same year, a technology partnership with BPM solution provider [[IDS Scheer]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ids-scheer.com/en/News/IDS_Scheer_and_Lanner_announce_partnership_for_Java_based_business_process_simulation/1680.html?referer=23380 | title=IDS Scheer and Lanner announce partnership for Java based business process simulation | publisher=IDS-Sheer.com | accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L-SIM product is now the simulation engine of IDS Scheer's ARIS Business Simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bob Violino | url=http://www.ciozone.com/index.php/Management/BPM-3-Vendors-To-Watch.html | title=BPM: 3 Vendors To Watch | publisher=CIO Zone | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's WITNESS platform technology is therefore embedded into current [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], and [[IBM]] [[Business Analysis|BPA]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lanner.com/en/business-partners.cfm | title=Lanner Group company website 'Business Partners' page | accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Link_log_diagram.jpg|thumb|alt=Format of a link log record]]

A '''linklog''' is a type of [[blog]] which is meant to act as a linked list.  Common practice is for the post titles to link directly to an external [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s, and the content of the post includes information to complement the associated URL.&lt;ref name="octopress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/linklog/|title=Writing a Linklog|date=2012-02-12|last1=Mathis|first1=Brandon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linklogs existed as a feature of computing systems before the internet as well.  In distributed file systems a link log was a method of recording data in which a record is created and added to the proper log when updating a transaction.  The format of a log record closely matches the specification of the transaction type it corresponds to.  Link log records consisted of two parts in such a system:  a set of type-independent fields, and a set of type-specific fields.  The former set consists of pointers to the preceding and succeeding records of the log.&lt;ref name="kistler"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disconnected Operation in a Distributed File System|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540606277|archive-url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coda/docdir/jjk-thesis.pdf|archive-date=1993-05-01|format=PDF|last1=Kistler|first1=James|date=1993-05-01|location=School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/3-540-60627-0|isbn=9783540606277|issn=0302-9743|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In PBX systems such as [[AUDIX]] link-logs were a collection of data collecting to assist operators in maintaining the system.&lt;ref name="audix"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/003676390|format=PDF|page=35|publisher=Lucent Technologies|title=DEFINITY AUDIX System Release 3.2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limes, lindens and basswoods''' (''[[Tilia]]'' species) are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including:

==[[phagy|Monophagous]]==
Species which feed exclusively on ''Tilia''

*[[Bucculatricidae]]
** ''[[Bucculatrix improvisa]]'' &amp;ndash; only on [[American linden]] (''T. americana'')
* [[Coleophoridae]]
** ''[[Coleophora tiliaefoliella]]''

==[[phagy|Polyphagous]]==
Species which feed on ''Tilia'' among other plants

*[[Bucculatricidae]]
** ''[[Bucculatrix thoracella]]''
* [[Coleophoridae]]
** Several ''[[Coleophora]]'' case-bearers, such as:
*** ''[[Coleophora albovanescens|C. albovanescens]]''
*** ''[[Coleophora anatipennella|C. anatipennella]]''
* [[Geometridae]]
** ''[[Alcis repandata]]'' (mottled beauty)

** ''[[Acronicta psi]]'' (grey dagger)
** ''[[Amphipyra pyramidea]]'' (copper underwing)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The zoologist: a popular miscellany of natural history, Volumen 13|last=|first=|publisher=Biblioteca Estatal de Baviera|year=1855|isbn=|location=|pages=4555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- polyphagous, but has it been recorded on Tilia? --&gt;
** ''[[Cosmia trapezina]]'' (dun-bar)
** ''[[Eupsilia transversa]]'' (satellite)
** ''[[Orthosia gothica]]'' (Hebrew character) &amp;ndash; recorded on large-leaved lime (''T. platyphyllos'')
* [[Notodontidae]]

This '''list of circle topics''' includes things related to the geometric shape, either abstractly, as in idealizations studied by geometers, or concretely in physical space. It does not include metaphors like "inner circle" or "circular reasoning" in which the word does not refer literally to the geometric shape.

{{Calculus |Integral}}

[[Integral|Integration]] is the basic operation in [[integral calculus]].  While [[derivative|differentiation]] has [[Differentiation rules|easy rules]] by which the derivative of a complicated [[Function (mathematics)|function]] can be found by differentiating its simpler component functions, integration does not, so tables of known integrals are often useful. This page lists some of the most common [[antiderivative]]s.

==Historical development of integrals==
A compilation of a list of integrals (Integraltafeln) and techniques of integral calculus was published by the German mathematician {{Interlanguage link multi|Meier Hirsch|de}} (aka {{Interlanguage link multi|Meyer Hirsch|de}}) in 1810. These tables were republished in the United Kingdom in 1823. More extensive tables were compiled in 1858 by the Dutch mathematician [[David Bierens de Haan]] for his ''[[Tables d'intégrales définies]]'', supplemented by ''[[Supplément aux tables d'intégrales définies]]'' in ca. 1864&lt;!-- no visible date indication by itself. Google books entry states 1864, foreword states 1861, English WP article formely stated 1862 --&gt;. A new edition was published in 1867 under the title ''[[Nouvelles tables d'intégrales définies]]''. These tables, which contain mainly integrals of elementary functions, remained in use until the middle of the 20th century. They were then replaced by the much more extensive tables of [[Gradshteyn and Ryzhik]]. In Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, integrals originating from the book by Bierens de Haan are denoted by BI.

Not all [[closed-form expression]]s have closed-form antiderivatives; this study forms the subject of [[differential Galois theory]], which was initially developed by [[Joseph Liouville]] in the 1830s and 1840s, leading to [[Liouville's theorem (differential algebra)|Liouville's theorem]] which classifies which expressions have closed form antiderivatives. A simple example of a function without a closed form antiderivative is {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}}, whose antiderivative is (up to constants) the [[error function]].

Since 1968 there is the [[Risch algorithm]] for determining indefinite integrals that can be expressed in term of [[elementary function]]s, typically using a [[computer algebra system]]. Integrals that cannot be expressed using elementary functions can be manipulated symbolically using general functions such as the [[Meijer G-function]].

{{anchor|Prudnikov-Brychkov-Marichev}}[[Izrail Solomonovich Gradshteyn|Gradshteyn]], [[Iosif Moiseevich Ryzhik|Ryzhik]], [[Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus|Geronimus]], [[Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin|Tseytlin]], Jeffrey, Zwillinger, Moll's (GR) ''[[Table of Integrals, Series, and Products]]'' contains a large collection of results. An even larger, multivolume table is the ''Integrals and Series'' by [[Anatoli Prudnikov|Prudnikov]], Brychkov, and [[Oleg Igorevich Marichev|Marichev]] (with volumes 1–3 listing integrals and series of [[elementary function|elementary]] and [[special functions]], volume 4–5 are tables of [[Laplace transform]]s). More compact collections can be found in e.g. Brychkov, Marichev, Prudnikov's ''Tables of Indefinite Integrals'', or as chapters in Zwillinger's ''CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae'' or [[Bronshtein and Semendyayev]]'s ''[[A Guide Book to Mathematics|Guide Book to Mathematics]]'', ''[[Handbook of Mathematics]]'' or ''[[Oxford Users' Guide to Mathematics|Users' Guide to Mathematics]]'', and other mathematical handbooks.

Other useful resources include [[Abramowitz and Stegun]] and the [[Bateman Manuscript Project]]. Both works contain many identities concerning specific integrals, which are organized with the most relevant topic instead of being collected into a separate table. Two volumes of the Bateman Manuscript are specific to integral transforms.

There are several web sites which have tables of integrals and integrals on demand. [[Wolfram Alpha]] can show results, and for some simpler expressions, also the intermediate steps of the integration. [[Wolfram Research]] also operates another online service, the [http://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator/ Wolfram Mathematica Online Integrator].

==Integrals of simple functions==
''C'' is used for an [[arbitrary constant of integration]] that can only be determined if something about the value of the integral at some point is known. Thus each function has an infinite number of [[Antiderivative|antiderivatives]].

These formulas only state in another form the assertions in the [[table of derivatives]].

===Integrals with a singularity===
When there is a [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularity]] in the function being integrated such that the antiderivative becomes undefined or at some point (the singularity), then ''C'' does not need to be the same on both sides of the singularity. The forms below normally assume the [[Cauchy principal value]] around a singularity in the value of ''C'' but this is not in general necessary. For instance in

:&lt;math&gt;\int {1 \over x}\,dx = \ln \left|x \right| + C&lt;/math&gt;

there is a singularity at 0 and the [[antiderivative]] becomes infinite there. If the integral above were to be used to compute a definite integral between −1 and 1, one would get the wrong answer 0. This however is the Cauchy principal value of the integral around the singularity. If the integration is done in the complex plane the result depends on the path around the origin, in this case the singularity contributes −''i''{{pi}} when using a path above the origin and ''i''{{pi}} for a path below the origin. A function on the real line could use a completely different value of ''C'' on either side of the origin as in:
: &lt;math&gt; \int {1 \over x}\,dx = \ln|x| + \begin{cases} A &amp; \text{if }x&gt;0; \\ B &amp; \text{if }x &lt; 0. \end{cases}  &lt;/math&gt;

===Rational functions===
:''More integrals: [[List of integrals of rational functions]]''

:&lt;math&gt;\int a\,dx = ax + C&lt;/math&gt;

The following function has a non-integrable singularity at 0 for {{math|''a'' ≤ −1}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int x^a\,dx = \frac{x^{a+1}}{a+1} + C \qquad\text{(for } a\neq -1\text{)}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]])
:&lt;math&gt;\int (ax + b)^n \, dx= \frac{(ax + b)^{n+1}}{a(n + 1)} + C \qquad\text{(for } n\neq -1\text{)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int {1 \over x}\,dx = \ln \left|x \right| + C&lt;/math&gt;

===Products of functions proportional to their second derivatives===
:&lt;math&gt;\int \cos ax\, e^{bx}\, dx = \frac{e^{bx}}{a^2+b^2}\left( a\sin ax + b\cos ax \right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin ax\, e^{bx}\, dx = \frac{e^{bx}}{a^2+b^2}\left( b\sin ax - a\cos ax \right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \cos ax\, \cosh bx\, dx = \frac{1}{a^2+b^2}\left( a\sin ax\, \cosh bx+ b\cos ax\, \sinh bx \right) + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \sin ax\, \cosh bx\, dx = \frac{1}{a^2+b^2}\left( b\sin ax\, \sinh bx- a\cos ax\, \cosh bx \right) + C&lt;/math&gt;

===Absolute-value functions===
Let {{math|''f''}} be a function which has at most one root on each interval on which it is defined, and {{math|''g''}} an antiderivative of {{math|''f''}} that is zero at each root of {{math|''f''}} (such an antiderivative exists if and only if the condition on {{math|''f''}} is satisfied), then
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| f(x)\right|\,dx = \sgn(f(x))g(x)+C,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|sgn(''x'')}} is the [[sign function]], which takes the values −1, 0, 1 when {{math|''x''}} is respectively negative, zero or positive. This gives the following formulas (where {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| (ax + b)^n \right|\,dx = \sgn(ax + b) {(ax + b)^{n+1} \over a(n+1)} + C \quad [\,n\text{ is odd, and } n \neq -1\,] \,.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \tan{ax} \right|\,dx = -\frac{1}{a}\sgn(\tan{ax}) \ln(\left|\cos{ax}\right|) + C&lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;ax \in \left( n\pi - \frac{\pi}{2}, n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt; for some integer {{math|''n''}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \csc{ax} \right|\,dx = -\frac{1}{a}\sgn(\csc{ax}) \ln(\left| \csc{ax} + \cot{ax} \right|) + C &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;ax \in \left( n\pi, n\pi + \pi \right) &lt;/math&gt; for some integer {{math|''n''}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \sec{ax} \right|\,dx = \frac{1}{a}\sgn(\sec{ax}) \ln(\left| \sec{ax} + \tan{ax} \right|)  + C &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;ax \in \left( n\pi - \frac{\pi}{2}, n\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt; for some integer {{math|''n''}}.
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \cot{ax} \right|\,dx = \frac{1}{a}\sgn(\cot{ax}) \ln(\left|\sin{ax}\right|) + C &lt;/math&gt;
when &lt;math&gt;ax \in \left( n\pi, n\pi + \pi \right) &lt;/math&gt; for some integer {{math|''n''}}.

If the function {{math|''f''}} does not have any continuous antiderivative which takes the value zero at the zeros of {{math|''f''}} (this is the case for the sine and the cosine functions), then {{math|sgn(''f''(''x'')) ∫ ''f''(''x'') ''dx''}} is an antiderivative of {{math|''f''}} on every [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] on which {{math|''f''}} is not zero, but may be discontinuous at the points where {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}}. For having a continuous antiderivative, one has thus to add a well chosen [[step function]]. If we also use the fact that the absolute values of sine and cosine are periodic with period {{pi}}, then we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \left| \sin{ax} \right|\,dx = {2 \over a} \left\lfloor \frac{ax}{\pi} \right\rfloor - {1 \over a} \cos{\left( ax - \left\lfloor \frac{ax}{\pi} \right\rfloor \pi \right)} + C&lt;/math&gt; {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
:&lt;math&gt;\int \left|\cos {ax}\right|\,dx = {2 \over a} \left\lfloor \frac{ax}{\pi} + \frac12 \right\rfloor + {1 \over a} \sin{\left( ax - \left\lfloor \frac{ax}{\pi} + \frac12 \right\rfloor \pi \right)} + C&lt;/math&gt; {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Special functions===
Ci, Si: [[Trigonometric integral]]s,  Ei: [[Exponential integral]],  li: [[Logarithmic integral function]], erf: [[Error function]]
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{Ci}(x) \, dx = x \operatorname{Ci}(x) - \sin x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{Si}(x) \, dx = x \operatorname{Si}(x) + \cos x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{Ei}(x) \, dx = x \operatorname{Ei}(x) - e^x&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{li}(x) \, dx = x \operatorname{li}(x)-\operatorname{Ei}(2 \ln x) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\operatorname{li}(x)}{x}\,dx = \ln x\, \operatorname{li}(x) -x &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname{erf}(x)\, dx = \frac{e^{-x^2}}{\sqrt{\pi }}+x \operatorname{erf}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

==Definite integrals lacking closed-form antiderivatives==

There are some functions whose antiderivatives ''cannot'' be expressed in [[Closed-form expression|closed form]]. However, the values of the definite integrals of some of these functions over some common intervals can be calculated. A few useful integrals are given below.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \sqrt{x}\,e^{-x}\,dx = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt \pi&lt;/math&gt;  (see also [[Gamma function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty e^{-a x^2}\,dx = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt \frac {\pi} {a} &lt;/math&gt;  for {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}} (the [[Gaussian integral]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty{x^2 e^{-a x^2}\,dx} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt \frac {\pi} {a^3} &lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^{2n} e^{-a x^2}\,dx
= \frac{2n-1}{2a} \int_0^\infty x^{2(n-1)} e^{-a x^2}\,dx
= \frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^{n+1}} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a^{2n+1}}}
= \frac{(2n)!}{n! 2^{2n+1}} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a^{2n+1}}}
&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}, {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer and !! is the [[double factorial]].

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty{x^3 e^{-a x^2}\,dx} = \frac{1}{2 a^2} &lt;/math&gt; when {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^{2n+1} e^{-a x^2}\,dx
= \frac {n} {a} \int_0^\infty x^{2n-1} e^{-a x^2}\,dx
= \frac{n!}{2 a^{n+1}}
&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}}, {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, ....}}

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{x}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^2}{6}&lt;/math&gt;  (see also [[Bernoulli number]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{x^2}{e^x-1}\,dx = 2\zeta(3) \approx 2.40&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin{x}}{x}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[sinc function]] and [[Sine integral]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty\frac{\sin^2{x}}{x^2}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\sin^n{x}\,dx = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \cos^n{x}\,dx = \frac{(n-1)!!}{n!!}\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (if {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer and !! is the [[double factorial]].

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\pi}^\pi \cos(\alpha x)\cos^n(\beta x) dx = \begin{cases}
\frac{2 \pi}{2^n} \binom{n}{m} &amp; |\alpha|= |\beta (2m-n)| \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''m'', ''n''}} integers with {{math|''β'' ≠ 0}} and {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}}, see also [[Binomial coefficient]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-t}^t \sin^m(\alpha x) \cos^n(\beta x) dx = 0&lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''α'', ''β''}} real, {{math|''n''}} a non-negative integer, and {{mvar|m}} an odd, positive integer; since the integrand is [[Odd function|odd]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\pi}^\pi \sin(\alpha x) \sin^n(\beta x) dx = \begin{cases}
(-1)^{\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)} (-1)^m \frac{2 \pi}{2^n} \binom{n}{m} &amp; n \text{ odd},\ \alpha = \beta (2m-n) \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''m'', ''n''}} integers with {{math|''β'' ≠ 0}} and {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}}, see also [[Binomial coefficient]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \cos(\alpha x) \sin^n(\beta x) dx = \begin{cases}
(-1)^{\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)} (-1)^m \frac{2 \pi}{2^n} \binom{n}{m} &amp; n \text{ even},\ |\alpha| = |\beta (2m-n)| \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''m'', ''n''}} integers with {{math|''β'' ≠ 0}} and {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}}, see also [[Binomial coefficient]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-(ax^2+bx+c)}\,dx = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}\exp\left[\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a}\right]&lt;/math&gt;  (where {{math|exp[''u'']}} is the [[exponential function]] {{math|e&lt;sup&gt;''u''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}})

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty  x^{z-1}\,e^{-x}\,dx = \Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt;  (where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamma function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \left(\ln\frac{1}{x}\right)^p\,dx = \Gamma(p+1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1} dx = \frac{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)} &lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|Re(''α'') &gt; 0}} and {{math|Re(''β'') &gt; 0}}, see [[Beta function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2 \pi} e^{x \cos \theta} d \theta = 2 \pi I_{0}(x)&lt;/math&gt;  (where {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is the modified [[Bessel function]] of the first kind)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^{2 \pi} e^{x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta} d \theta = 2 \pi I_{0} \left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{x^2}{\nu}\right)^{-\frac{\nu + 1}{2}}\,dx = \frac { \sqrt{\nu \pi} \ \Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)} {\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu + 1}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt; (for {{math|''ν'' &gt; 0}} , this is related to the [[probability density function]] of [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]])

If the function {{math|''f''}} has [[bounded variation]] on the interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}, then the [[method of exhaustion]] provides a formula for the integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b{f(x)\,dx} = (b - a) \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\sum\limits_{m = 1}^{2^n  - 1} {\left( { - 1} \right)^{m + 1} } } 2^{ - n} f(a + m\left( {b - a} \right)2^{-n} ).&lt;/math&gt;

The "[[sophomore's dream]]":
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_0^1 x^{-x}\,dx &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n}        &amp;&amp;(= 1.29128\,59970\,6266\dots)\\
\int_0^1 x^x   \,dx &amp;= -\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-n)^{-n} &amp;&amp;(= 0.78343\,05107\,1213\dots)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3746">A '''Master of Mathematics''' (or '''MMath''') [[academic degree|degree]] is a specific integrated [[Masters degree|master's degree]] for courses in the field of [[mathematics]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the MMath is the internationally recognized standard qualification after a four-year course in mathematics at a [[university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2008-09/weekly/6133/13.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The MMath programme was set up by most leading universities after the ''[[Neumann Report]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter M. Neumann]]. The Future for Honours Degree Courses in Mathematics and Statistics, Final report
of a group working under the auspices of the [[London Mathematical Society]], London:
February 1992, reproduced also in  [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] Vol. 155, No. 2, p185-189,  1992  [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2982954 JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt; It is classed as a level 7 qualification in the [[Frameworks of Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies]]. The [[UCAS]] course codes for the MMath degrees start at ''G100'' upwards, most courses taking the codes ''G101 - G104''.

Universities which offer MMath degrees include:
*[[Aberystwyth University]]
*[[University of Bath]]
*[[University of Bristol]] (MSci)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/prospectus/undergraduate/2010/prog_index#M&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Cardiff University]]
*[[University of Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;In Cambridge the MMath was first awarded in 2011 after a four year course. The fourth year is identical with the Master of Advanced Study in Mathematics, which was formerly known as the [[Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics]] and is open to students from other universities. Everyone who completed Part III since 1962 became eligible for the appropriate Masters degree, retrospectively. [http://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/mathiii/retrospective]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1977">In a [[dynamical system]], '''multistability''' is the property of having multiple [[Stability theory|stable equilibrium points]] in the [[vector space]] spanned by the states in the system. By mathematical necessity, there must also be unstable equilibrium points between the stable points. Points that are stable in some dimensions and unstable in others are termed unstable, as is the case with the first three [[Lagrangian points]].

== Bistability ==
{{main|Bistability}}
Bistability is the special case with two stable equilibrium points. It is the simplest form of multistability, and can occur in systems with only one state variable, as it only takes a one-dimensional space to separate two points.

== Initial instability ==
{{see also|Path dependence}}
Near an unstable equilibrium, any system will be sensitive to noise, initial conditions and system parameters,
which can cause it to develop in one of multiple divergent directions. 
In economics and social sciences, path dependence gives rise to divergent directions of development.
Some path dependent processes are adequately described by multistability,
by being initially sensitive to input, before reaching a stagnant state – 
for example [[market share]] instability, which can develop into a stable [[monopoly]] for one of multiple possible vendors.

== Multistable perception ==
[[Image:Multistability.svg|right|thumb|260px|Ambiguous images]]
{{main|Multistable perception}}
In vision science, [[multistable perception]] characterizes the wavering percepts that can be brought about by certain visually ambiguous pattern such as the [[Necker cube]], [[monocular rivalry]] or [[binocular rivalry]].
Through lateral inhibition, a pattern in which one image, when stimulated, inhibit the activity of neighboring images.

The '''national parks of England and Wales''' are areas of relatively undeveloped and scenic landscape that are designated under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act (2016). Despite their similar name, national parks in [[England]] and [[Wales]] are quite different from [[national park]]s in many other countries, which are usually owned and managed by the government as a protected community resource, and which do not usually include permanent human communities. In England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership.

There are currently thirteen national parks ({{lang-cy|parciau cenedlaethol}}) in England and Wales. Each park is operated by its own [[national park authority]], with two "statutory purposes":
# to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, [[wildlife]] and cultural heritage of the area, and
# to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the park's special qualities by the public.

When national parks carry out these purposes they also have the duty to:
# seek to foster the economic and social well-being of local communities within the national parks.

An estimated 110 million people visit the national parks of England and Wales each year. Recreation and tourism bring visitors and funds into the parks, to sustain their [[conservation ethic|conservation]] efforts and support the local population through jobs and businesses. These visitors also bring problems, such as [[erosion]] and [[traffic congestion]], and conflicts over the use of the parks' resources. Access to cultivated land is restricted to [[bridleway]]s, [[Right-of-way (transportation)|public footpath]]s, and permissive paths, with most (but not all) uncultivated areas in England and Wales having right of access for walking under the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]].

==Origins==
[[Image:brecon beacons arp.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the [[Brecon Beacons|Brecon Beacons National Park]], looking from the highest point of [[Pen y Fan]] (886&amp;nbsp;m/2907&amp;nbsp;feet) to Cribyn (795&amp;nbsp;m/2608&amp;nbsp;feet).]]
[[File:Wastwater, Yewbarrow and Great Gable - geograph.org.uk - 1546772.jpg|thumb|The head of Wasdale - this view appears on the logo of the Lake District National Park Authority]]
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence from [[prehistoric Britain]] shows that the areas now designated as national parks have been occupied by humans since the [[Stone Age]], at least 5,000 years ago and in some cases much earlier.

Before the 19th century, relatively wild, remote areas were often seen simply as uncivilised and dangerous. In 1725 [[Daniel Defoe]] described the [[Peak District|High Peak]] as "the most desolate, wild and abandoned country in all England".&lt;ref&gt;Defoe, Daniel. ''A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, Divided into Circuits or {{sic|hide=y|Journies}}.'' (1724–26) "There is indeed an extended angle of this county, which runs a great way north west by Chappel in the Frith, and which they call High Peak. This, perhaps, is the most desolate, wild, and abandoned country in all England; The mountains of the Peak, of which I have been speaking, seem to be but the beginning of wonders to this part of the country, and but the beginning of mountains, or, if you will, as the lower rounds of a ladder. The tops of these hills seem to be as much above the clouds, as the clouds are above the ordinary range of hills."&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the early 19th century, [[Romantic Poetry|romantic poets]] such as [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] wrote about the inspirational beauty of the "untamed" countryside.&lt;ref name="natparks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/filex_01.pdf |title=Our National Parks - Filex 1 |accessdate=3 December 2007 |format=PDF |work=Exmoor National Park |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228002224/http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/filex_01.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wordsworth described the [[Lake District|English Lake District]] as a "sort of national property in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy" in 1810. This early vision, based in the [[Picturesque]] movement, took over a century, and much controversy, to take legal form in the UK with the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].

The idea for a form of national parks was first proposed in the [[List of areas in the United States National Park System|United States]] in the 1860s, where [[national park]]s were established to protect [[wilderness]] areas such as [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]]. This model has been used in many other countries since, but not in the United Kingdom.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

After thousands of years of human integration into the landscape, Britain lacks any substantial areas of wilderness. Furthermore, those areas of natural beauty so cherished by the romantic poets were often only maintained and managed in their existing state by human activity, usually agriculture.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

===Government support is established===
By the early 1930s, increasing public interest in the countryside, coupled with the growing and newly mobile urban population, was generating increasing friction between those seeking access to the countryside and landowners. Alongside of direct action trespasses, such as the [[mass trespass of Kinder Scout]], several voluntary bodies took up the cause of public access in the political arena.

In 1931, [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Christopher Addison]] (later Lord Addison) chaired a government committee that proposed a 'National Park Authority' to choose areas for designation as national parks.&lt;ref name="UKNPhistory"/&gt; A system of national reserves and nature sanctuaries was proposed:

:"(i) to safeguard areas of exceptional natural interest against (a) disorderly development and (b) spoliation; (ii) to improve the means of access for pedestrians to areas of natural beauty; and (iii) to promote measures for the protection of [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]]."

However, no further action was taken after the intervention of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 General Election]].

The voluntary Standing Committee on National Parks first met on 26 May 1936 to put the case to the government for national parks in the UK. After World War II, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] proposed the establishment of national parks as part of the post-war reconstruction of the UK. A report by [[John Gordon Dower|John Dower]], secretary of the Standing Committee on National Parks,&lt;ref name="FAQS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/faqs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=5 December 2007 |work=National Parks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915022355/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/faqs.htm |archivedate=15 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1945 was followed in 1947 by a Government committee, this time chaired by Sir [[Arthur Hobhouse]], which prepared legislation for national parks, and proposed twelve national parks. Sir Arthur had this to say on the criteria for designating suitable areas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The essential requirements of a National Park are that it should have great natural beauty, a high value for open-air recreation and substantial continuous extent. Further, the distribution of selected areas should as far as practicable be such that at least one of them is quickly accessible from each of the main centres of population in [[England and Wales]]. Lastly there is merit in variety and with the wide diversity of landscape which is available in England and Wales, it would be wrong to confine the selection of National Parks to the more rugged areas of mountain and moorland, and to exclude other districts which, though of less outstanding grandeur and wildness, have their own distinctive beauty and a high recreational value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949===
[[Image:Northumberland National Park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hadrian's Wall]] crosses [[Northumberland National Park]]]]

The [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] was passed with all party support. The first ten national parks were designated as such in the 1950s under the Act in mostly poor-quality agricultural [[upland (geology)|upland]]. Much of the land was still owned by individual landowners, often private estates, but there was also property owned by public bodies such as [[the Crown]], or charities which allow and encourage access such as the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. Accessibility from the [[City status in the United Kingdom#List of cities|cities]] was also considered important.

Other areas were also considered: for example, parts of the coast of [[Cornwall]] were considered as a possible national park in the 1950s but were thought to be too disparate to form a single coherent national park and were eventually designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) instead. The north [[Pennines]] were also considered for designation as a national park in the 1970s but the proposal was thought to be administratively too difficult because the area was administered by five different [[county council]]s.

===Later additions===
[[The Broads]] in [[East Anglia]] are not in the strictest sense a national park, being run by a separately constituted Broads Authority set up by a special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1988&lt;ref name="UKNPhistory"/&gt; and with a structure in which conservation is subordinate to navigational concerns (see [[Sandford Principle]] below), but it is generally regarded as being "equivalent to" a national park.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

The [[New Forest]], which includes the largest remaining tracts of unenclosed pasture land, [[heath (habitat)|heathland]] and old-growth [[forest]] in the heavily populated [[South East England|south east]] of the country was designated as a national park on 1 March 2005.&lt;ref name="NFfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/index/aboutus/frequently_asked_questions/faq-designation.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=New Forest National Park|accessdate=17 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905082742/http://www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/index/aboutus/frequently_asked_questions/faq-designation.htm|archivedate=5 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2009, [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]] [[Hilary Benn]] announced that the [[South Downs]] would be designated a national park. The [[South Downs National Park]] came into effect on 31 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southdowns.gov.uk/|title=South Downs Park website|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
Following the [[Environment Act 1995]], each national park has been managed by its own [[national park authority]] since April 1997.&lt;ref name="UKNPhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/history.htm |title=History of the National Parks |publisher=National Parks: Britain's Breathing Space |accessdate=16 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010064743/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/history.htm |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, all but the [[Peak District]] and the [[Lake District]] were governed by the local [[county council]]s. The [[Peak District]] and the [[Lake District]], the first two national parks to be designated, were under the control of planning boards that were independent of the local county councils.

Each authority is required to carry out two "statutory purposes":&lt;ref name="natparks"/&gt;
# to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the area; and
# to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the parks' special qualities by the public.
These purposes can conflict: in such cases, under the "[[Sandford Principle]]", conservation comes first. This principle was given [[statute|statutory]] force by section 62 of the [[Environment Act 1995]], although there are no explicit provisions as to how wildlife is to be preserved. In pursuing these purposes, national park authorities also have a duty to foster the social and economic well-being of their local communities.

Slightly over half the members of each national park authority are appointees from the principal local authorities covered by the park; the remainder are appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (in England) or the [[Welsh Ministers]] (in Wales), some to represent local [[civil parish|parish]] or [[community (Wales)|community]] councils, others selected to represent the "national interest".&lt;ref name="natparks"/&gt; The Broads Authority also has members appointed by [[Natural England]], [[Great Yarmouth]] Port Authority and the [[Environment Agency]]. The national park authorities and the Broads Authority are covered by similar regulatory controls to those applied to local councils.

Funding for national parks is complex, but the full cost of each park authority is funded from central government funds. In the past this was partly paid for by local authorities, and refunded to them from the government to varying degrees. In 2003/2004, the park authorities received around £35.5 million of central government funding.&lt;!-- needs updating --&gt;

[[Natural England]] is the statutory body responsible for designating new national parks in England, subject to approval by the Secretary of State; [[Natural Resources Wales]] designates new national parks in Wales, subject to approval by the Welsh Ministers. The [[Association of National Park Authorities]] exists to provide the park authorities with a single voice when dealing with government and its agencies. The [[Campaign for National Parks]] (formerly Council for National Parks) is a charity that works to protect and enhance the national parks of England and Wales.

==Development and land use planning in national parks==
National park authorities are the strategic and local planning authorities for their areas, so that the local district or unitary councils do not exercise planning control in an area covered by a national park. Consequently, they have to perform all the duties of a [[local planning authority]].

They are responsible for maintaining the [[local development framework]] &amp;mdash; the [[spatial planning]] guide for their area. They also grant planning consent for development, within the constraints of the Framework. This gives them very strong direct control over residential and industrial development, and the design of buildings and other structures; as well as strategic matters such as mineral extraction.

The national park authorities' planning powers vary only slightly from other authorities, but the policies and their interpretation are stricter than elsewhere. This is supported and encouraged by the government who regard:
:"National Park designation as conferring the highest status of protection as far as landscape and scenic beauty are concerned." The Countryside &amp;mdash; Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development (1997)&lt;!-- needs full biblio ref --&gt;

==Contribution to the local economy==
Tourism is an important part of the economy of the regions which contain national parks. Through attractions, shops and accommodation, visitors provide an income and a livelihood to local employers and farmers. This income provides jobs for the park. For example, within the Peak District National Park the estimate in 2004 for visitor spending is £185 million, which supports over 3,400 jobs, representing 27% of total employment in the national park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/tourism.pdf|title=Tourism in the Peak District National Park: fact sheet 2|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530101439/http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/tourism.pdf|archivedate=30 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts in national parks==
The national park authorities have two roles: to conserve and enhance the park, and to promote its use by visitors. These two objectives cause frequent conflicts between the needs of different groups of people. It is estimated that the national parks of England and Wales receive 110 million visitors each year. Most of the time it is possible to achieve both the original two purposes by good management. Occasionally a situation arises where access for the public is in direct conflict with conservation. Following the ethos of the [[Sandford Principle]], the [[Environment Act 1995]] sets down how a priority may be established between conservation and recreational use. Similar provision has been made for Scottish national parks.

Although recreation and tourism brings many benefits to an area, it also brings a number of problems. The national funding offered to national park authorities is partly in recognition of the extra difficulties created in dealing with these conflicts.
; '''Congestion of villages and beauty spots''' : Some of the most popular "[[honeypot (geography)|honeypot]]" areas attract large numbers of visitors, resulting in overcrowded [[car park]]s, blocked roads, and overstretched local facilities, particularly on Sundays in the summer and on [[bank holiday]]s. Examples include the areas near [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] in the Lake District and [[Buxton]] and [[Bakewell]] in the Peak District.
; '''Erosion''' : [[Hill-walking]] and use of other public [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights-of-way]] is an extremely popular use of all the national parks. Heavy use of the most popular paths leads to considerable erosion, but strengthening of paths can be unsightly. Particularly heavy wear is caused by sponsored walks, walks promoted by national books and magazines, by [[Trail riding|horse riding]] on unsurfaced [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]]s, [[mountain biking]] and use of [[off-road vehicle]]s on [[green lane (road)|green lane]]s. Examples include [[Dovedale]] in the Peak District. [[Over-grazing]], for example, by sheep on hill and moorland areas, can also reduce vegetation, leading to increased erosion.
; '''Damage and disturbance to wildlife''' : [[Wildlife]] may be disturbed by the level of use on some of the areas of the parks that are open to the public. [[Moorland]] and [[chalk downland]] is easily damaged by regular use, and takes many years to recover. Moorland birds in particular nest and roost on the ground and are therefore especially sensitive. [[Orienteering]], [[mountain biking]] and [[hang gliding]] are typical activities which are likely to cause disturbance to nesting birds.
; '''Litter''' : Litter of all kinds is both unsightly and can cause pollution and damage to livestock and wild animals. Broken glass is a danger to people and, by [[Focus (optics)|focus]]ing the rays of the sun, a possible cause of fire, particularly in areas of moorland such as [[Exmoor]], parts of the [[Peak District]] and the [[North York Moors]].
; '''Damage to farmland''' : Trampling of grass [[meadow]]s reduces the amount of winter feed for farm animals. Walkers who stray from footpaths may climb over fences or [[dry stone wall]]s rather than looking out for the [[stile]]s that mark the course of footpaths across farmland. Sheep can be injured or even killed by dogs not under proper control, especially at lambing time.
; '''Local community displacement''' : Gift shops and [[café]]s which cater for the needs of tourists are often more profitable than shops selling everyday goods for local people (such as butchers or bakers). In some villages where tourist shops are in the majority and there are few shops catering for the local people, the local community may feel pushed out by the tourists. Houses are often very expensive in tourist villages as there is demand for them as [[Vacation property|second homes]] or [[holiday home]]s by [[holiday cottage]] firms or well-off people who live elsewhere, or who move to a local home from which they commute to work, making them unaffordable for local people. This is a particular problem in areas within easy commuting distance of large cities, such as the [[Peak District]], the [[Lake District]], the [[Yorkshire Dales]], and the [[New Forest]] and [[South Downs]].
; '''Conflict between recreational users''' : Some forms of use of national parks interfere with other uses. For example, use of high-speed [[boat]]s causes [[noise pollution]], and conflicts with other uses such as boat trips, yachting, canoeing, and swimming. A controversial [[bylaw]] imposing a 10&amp;nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knot]] speed limit came into force on [[Windermere]] on 29 March 2005. The new speed limit for Windermere effectively prohibits [[motorboat|speedboats]] and [[water skiing]] in the Lake District (of the 16 larger lakes in the [[Lake District]], only Windermere, [[Coniston Water]], [[Derwent Water]] and [[Ullswater]] have a public right of [[navigation]]; speed limits were imposed on the three lakes other than Windermere in the 1970s and 1980s).

At the beginning of 2005, some 9.3% of the area of England and Wales lay within national parks; the addition of South Downs and the New Forest would increase this proportion to 10.7%. The three Welsh national parks cover around 20% of the land area of Wales.

[[File:Nonio originale.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Pedro Nunes]] '''Nonius''' model]]

'''Nonius''' is a measuring tool used in navigation and astronomy named in honour of its inventor, [[Pedro Nunes]] (Latin: Petrus Nonius),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infopedia.pt/$pedro-nunes|title=Pedro Nunes|publisher=Infopédia [em linha]. Porto: Porto Editora|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Portuguese author, mathematician and navigator. The nonius was created in 1542 as a system for taking finer measurements on circular instruments such as the [[astrolabe]]. The system was eventually adapted into the [[vernier scale]] in 1631 by the French mathematician [[Pierre Vernier]].&lt;ref name="Poelje"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poelje|first1=Otto van|title=Diagonals and Transversals: Magnifying the Scale|journal=Journal of the Oughtred Society|date=July 25, 2004|pages=22–28|url=https://eeuwen.home.xs4all.nl/images/Pics/Kombuispraat/Pleinschaal/200410%20Diagonals%20and%20Transversals%20V13-2.pdf|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical features ==
[[File:Nónio.gif|thumb|right|Nonius method of measuring an angle with higher precision]]
The nonius was used to improve the [[astrolabe]]'s accuracy. This consisted of a number of [[concentric]] circles traced on an instrument and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle. On a standard scale of 90 degrees, there are an additional 44-45 concentric circles with each divided into a specific unit size such that a scale unit on position &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; had an arc of &lt;math&gt;90/n&lt;/math&gt; degrees.&lt;ref name="Poelje"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisele"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eisele|first1=Margarete|title=Mathematics In Europe - The Nonius|url=http://www.maths-in-europe.eu/ru/2-uncategorised/684-the-nonius|website=www.maths-in-europe.eu|accessdate=May 2, 2017|language=ru-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the outermost [[Quadrant (circle)|quadrant]] would comprise 90° in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on. When an angle was measured, the circle and the division on which the [[alidade]] fell was noted. A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciaviva.pt/latlong/anterior/nonio2.asp|title=O conceito de nónio|author=António Estácio dos Reis|publisher=Ciência Viva|trans-title=The concept of Nonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The [[astronomer]] [[Tycho Brahe]] applied the nonius to the astronomic [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciaviva.pt/latlong/anterior/nonio3.asp|title=Tycho Brahe recorre ao nónio de Pedro Nunes|author=António Estácio dos Reis|publisher=Ciência Viva|trans-title=Tycho Brahe betakes Pedro Nunes' Nonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisele"/&gt;

In [[Numeric control|numerically controlled machines]], the nonius is part of several [[Linear encoder#Absolute code|absolute encoders]], that measure linear or rotational displacements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/position-presence-proximity/the-vernier-scale-goes-digital-1541|title=Nonius interpolation provides excellent differential linearity and higher resolution for linear displacement measurement systems or rotary encoders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology''' or '''S.P.I.N. Tech''' is a fictional type of nanotechnology appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==History==
S.P.I.N. Tech was first mentioned in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #3, when [[War Machine]] described it to cadet [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]] in a mission briefing. During the earlier [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], the pro-registration side had created special technology to inhibit and/or remove the super powers of those who opposed registration. This was widely known and publicized. However, what wasn't known to the public was that they had managed to miniaturize the technology into nanobots. It could be fired in special [[adamantium]]-tipped ammunition which could pierce the skin of any known individual, and thus render them unable to use their powers, causing them to no longer be a threat. [[Iron Man]] successfully used S.P.I.N. Tech to strip [[She-Hulk]] of her powers when she learned of her cousin [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]]'s fate at the hands of the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]] and vowed to punish those responsible. In the first known field mission where S.P.I.N. Tech is used, the villains [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Hydro-Man]] were all successfully hit with it, though as it was not targeted to their DNA, they were not affected. [[Spider-Man]] (who was the target of the mission) managed to clog one of War Machine's guns with his webbing, and the nanomachines entered his suit's systems and shut them down, which would seem to indicate that this technology can be used against other technological devices as well. However, their effects seem to be temporary; War Machine recovered soon afterwards.

Iron Man later used S.P.I.N. Tech against Hulk when he returned to Earth to seek revenge on the Illuminati,&lt;ref&gt;''[[World War Hulk]]'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; but at Stark's own admission there was no telling how long the technology would keep the Hulk weakened, which would seem to further indicate that S.P.I.N. Tech is not permanent, or at least not against individuals whose power levels can increase, such as Hulk. It was, however, later revealed that the container that Stark had with him to infect the Hulk was actually empty, having previously been stolen by Initiative recruit [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]''#4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amadeus Cho]] also managed to help She-Hulk regain her powers after they had been stripped, which implies that S.P.I.N. Tech may be able to be deactivated even after initial exposure; this is confirmed when She-Hulk reveals that Stark temporarily disabled the nanobots in her body to allow her to aid in the defense against the Hulk's return.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' (2005 series) #20''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also mentioned that all the nanomachines used in S.P.I.N. Tech can be targeted to specific individuals, negating any chances of [[friendly fire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Though in use by S.H.I.E.L.D., the S.P.I.N. Tech has gotten into the hands of several villains and terrorist groups when it was revealed that the man who hired Hardball to steal the S.P.I.N. Tech, Congressman Woodman, is in fact a high-ranking member of [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' Annual #1&lt;/ref&gt; During an encounter in [[Madripoor]] between HYDRA agents and members of the [[Shadow Initiative]], HYDRA employs modified S.P.I.N. Tech that their agents claim is effective against any superhuman target, and uses it to negate Komodo's abilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #23&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Shadow Initiative infiltrated their headquarters, Hardball had destroyed all the S.P.I.N. Tech, except for his own, which was stolen by [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|Carmilla Black]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24&lt;/ref&gt;

When a group of super villains used the technology to inhibit one of [[Hank Pym]]'s drug-created superheroes, [[The Order (comics)#Mulholland|Mulholland]], the removal of this [[Decimation (comics)|former mutant's]] drug-made powers somehow allowed her true mutant powers to resurface.&lt;ref&gt;''The Order'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sensu''''' is a [[Latin]] word meaning "in the [[word sense|sense]] of". It is used in a number of fields including [[biology]], [[geology]], [[linguistics]], [[semiotics]], and [[law]]. Commonly it refers to how strictly or loosely an expression is used in describing any particular concept, but it also appears in expressions that indicate the convention or context of the usage.

==Common qualifiers==
''Sensu'' is the [[ablative case]] of the [[noun]] ''sensus'', here meaning "sense". It is often accompanied by an [[adjective]] (in the same case). Three such phrases are:
*''sensu stricto'' – "in the strict sense", abbreviation ''s.s.'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=sensu+stricto&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |publisher=[[FishBase]] |title=Definition of Term &amp;mdash; sensu stricto |website=www.fishbase.org |version=06/2017 |date=2017 |access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''sensu lato'' – "in the broad sense", abbreviation ''s.l.'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=sensu+lato&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |publisher=[[FishBase]] |title=Definition of Term &amp;mdash; sensu lato |website=www.fishbase.org |version=06/2017 |date=2017 |access-date=2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''sensu amplo'' – "in a relaxed, generous (or 'ample') sense", a similar meaning to ''sensu lato''.

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] uses the phrase ''sensu eminenti'' to mean "in the pre-eminent [or most important or significant] sense".&lt;ref&gt;''The Journals of Søreen Kierkegaard'', edited by Alexander Dru, Harper Torchbooks, New York, 1959, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

When appropriate, [[Comparison (grammar)|comparative]] and [[superlative]] adjectives may also be used to convey the meaning of "more" or "most". Thus ''sensu stricto'' becomes ''sensu strictiore'' ("in the stricter sense" or "more strictly speaking") and ''sensu strictissimo'' ("in the strictest sense" or "most strictly speaking").

Current definitions of the [[plant|plant kingdom]] (Plantae) offer a biological example of when such phrases might be used. One definition of Plantae is that it consists of all [[Viridiplantae|green plants]], all [[Rhodophyta|red algae]] and all [[Glaucophyta|glaucophyte algae]]. A stricter definition excludes the red and glaucophyte algae; the group defined in this way could be called Plantae ''sensu stricto''. An even stricter definition excludes green algae, leaving only land plants; the group defined in this way could be called Plantae ''sensu strictissimo''.&lt;ref&gt;Spichiger, R-E; Savolainen, Vincent V.; Figeat, Murielle:  Systematic Botany of Flowering Plants. Publisher: Science Publishers  2004 {{ISBN|978-1-57808-373-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, where convenient, some authors derive expressions such as "''sensu non strictissimo''", meaning "not in the narrowest possible sense".&lt;ref&gt;Villiger, Mark E. "Customary International Law and Treaties (Developments in International Law, 7)" Publisher: Springer 1985 {{ISBN|978-90-247-2980-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar form is in use to indicate the sense of a particular context, such as "Nonmonophyletic groups are ... nonnatural (sensu cladistics) in that..."&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Quentin &amp;  Blackwell, Meredith. Fungus-Insect Relationships: Perspectives in Ecology and Evolution. Publisher: Columbia Univ 1984 {{ISBN|978-0-231-05695-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "...computation of a cladogram (sensu phenetics)..."&lt;ref name= "PAL"/&gt;

Also the expression ''sensu [[auctorum]]'' (abbreviation: ''sensu auct.'') is used to mean "in the sense of certain authors", who can be designated or described.  It normally refers to a sense which is considered invalid and may be used in place of the author designation of a taxon in such a case (for instance, ''"Tricholoma amethystinum'' sensu auct." is an erroneous name for a mushroom which should really be "''Lepista personata'' (Fr.) Cooke").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=462465 |title=''Tricholoma amethystinum'' page |work=Species Fungorum |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifiers and contexts==
A related usage is in a concept-author citation ("''[[List of Latin abbreviations|sec]].'' Smith", or "''sensu'' Smith"), indicating that the intended meaning is the one defined by that author.&lt;ref name= "PAL"&gt;Panchen, Alec L. "Classification, Evolution, and the Nature of Biology" Publisher: Cambridge University Press 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-521-31578-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Bradley J. The Systematics of New World Clinocera. Publisher: National Research Council (Canada) Research Press  2008. {{ISBN|978-0-660-19800-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Here "''sec''." is an abbreviation of "''secundum''", meaning "following" or "in accordance with".) Such an author citation is different from the citation of the nomenclatural [[Author citation (botany)|"author citation" or "authority citation"]]. In biological taxonomy the author citation following the name of a taxon simply identifies the author who originally published the name and applied it to the [[Type (biology)|type]], the specimen or specimens that one refers to in case of doubt about the definition of a species. Given that an author (such as Linnaeus, for example) was the first to supply a definite [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] and to describe it, it is to be hoped that his description would stand the tests of time and criticism, but even if it does not, then as far as practical the name that he had assigned will apply. It still will apply in preference to any subsequent names or descriptions that anyone proposes, whether his description was correct or not, and whether he had correctly identified its [[Affinity (taxonomy)|biological affinities]] or not. This does not always happen of course; all sorts of errors occur in practice. For example, a collector might scoop a netful of small fish and describe them as a new species; it then might turn out that he had failed to notice that there were several (possibly unrelated) species in the net. It then is not clear what he had named, so his name can hardly be taken seriously, either ''s.s. or s.l''.

After a species has been established in this manner, specialist [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] may work on the subject and make certain types of changes in the light of new information. In modern practice it is greatly preferred that the collector of the specimens immediately passes them to specialists for naming; it is rarely possible for non-specialists to tell whether their specimens are of new species or not, and in modern times not many publications or their referees would accept an amateur description.

In any event, the person who finally classifies and describes a species has the task of [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|taxonomic circumscription]]. '''''Circumscription''''' means in essence that anyone competent in the matter can tell ''which creatures are included in the species described, and which are excluded''. It is in this process of [[species description]] that the question of the '''''sense''''' arises, because that is where the worker produces and argues his view of the proper circumscription. Equally, or perhaps even more strongly, the arguments for deciding questions concerning [[Taxonomy (biology)|higher taxa]] such as [[Family (biology)|families]] or [[Order (biology)|orders]], require very difficult circumscription, where changing the ''sense'' applied could totally upset an entire scheme of classification, either constructively or disastrously.

Note that the principles of circumscription apply in various ways in non-biological senses. In biological taxonomy the usual assumption is that circumscription reflects the shared ancestry perceived as most likely in the light of the currently available information; in geology or legal contexts far wider and more arbitrary ranges of logical circumscription commonly apply, not necessarily formally uniformly. However, the usage of expressions incorporating ''sensu'' remains functionally similarly intelligible among the fields. In geology for example, in which the concept of ancestry is looser and less pervasive than in biology, one finds usages such as:
*"This ambiguity ... has led to a ... dual interpretation of the Kimmeridgian Stage; the longer ''sensu anglico'' meaning, or the shorter ''sensu gallico'' meaning." Here the "''anglico''" or English meaning referred to interpretations by English geologists, derived from English materials and conditions, whereas "''gallico''" referred to interpretations by French and German geologists, derived from continental materials and conditions.&lt;ref name="Brenchley2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. J. Brenchley|title=The Geology of England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6gqvAbdS-MC&amp;pg=PA331|date=2006|publisher=Geological Society of London|isbn=978-1-86239-200-7|pages=331–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"...genetic stratigraphic sequences ''sensu'' Galloway (1989)" meaning those sequences so referred to by Galloway, much as in the biological usage in referring to the terminology of particular authorities.&lt;ref name="Brenchley2006"/&gt;
*"The second progradational unit plus PAN-4 are correlatable to the Pontian ''sensu stricto'' (''sensu'' Sacchi 2001)."&lt;ref name="McCann2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom McCann|title=The Geology of Central Europe: Mesozoic and Cenozoic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZe24VMp6_UC&amp;pg=PA1102|date=2008|publisher=Geological Society of London|isbn=978-1-86239-265-6|pages=1102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here the we have a meta-reference: the [[Messinian|Pontian]] in the sense that Sacchi had applied as it as ''sensu stricto''.

==Circumscription==
{{tone|section|date=December 2011}}
Readers unfamiliar with technical aspects of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] might find it helpful first to think of everyday examples of the principles. When dealing with groups and parts of groups (subgroups) of different types of things, taxonomists sometimes wish to speak of the full set under consideration, and sometimes just a subset, but almost always want to refer to some particular part, to the exclusion of other elements; in issuing an instruction to poll the opinions of twenty-one members of a village community, a competent pollster would not accept the reactions of two heads of households, three infants, four dogs, five cats, six rats, and a tramcar. That would be taking ''sensu lato'' beyond good sense.

Instead the instruction should specify which ''sense'' should apply, such as ''sensu stricto'' (or ''strictiore''):

:* "...all the heads of households on the north side of the stream," or "...all the children in hospital with mumps", or "...the men the district attorney questioned this morning," or "Zachiariah Quenton Horton of 221b Baker Street".

or ''sensu lato'' (or ''latiore''): 

:* "... five of the school football team", or "the first few friendly-looking people you find in the street," or "...some of the people in the district."

The important thing is that in each example the instruction '''''circumscribed''''' the appropriate subjects; that means that the interviewer could tell ''which people were wanted'' and correspondingly, ''which were to be left out''.
 
The circumscription could be in terms of very specific [[Problem of the criterion|criteria]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(...of all the possible people, only those the DA questioned, and of those, only the adult males, or one specific person only)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

or the criterion could be very casual, even vague: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;(...as many as you like of the people that looked friendly to you in the street, even if it turns out that the appearance was misleading.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However simple that may sound, it is fundamental both in formal science and in everyday affairs. Circumscription amounts to the basis for telling things apart, which in turn is the rational basis for all diagnoses, formal or informal.

In biological taxonomy, as the next section describes, the same principles apply, but they deal in various ways with circumscribing living things according to any relevant [[Problem of the criterion|criterion]]. In modern biology the criterion usually has something to do with which creature descended from which kind of ancestor, in which ways it changed in the process, and by how much. However, in more general [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomies]], although the principles of circumscription are fundamentally similar, the criteria could be largely different in type as well as in detail.

In short, in every discipline the sense of circumscription in taxonomy must reflect the nature of the subject matter.

==Examples in practical taxonomy==
{{tone|section|date=December 2011}}
'''''Sensu''''' is used in the taxonomy of living creatures to specify which [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of a given [[taxon]] is meant, where more than one circumscription can be defined.

Examples:

* "The family [[Malvaceae]] ''s.s.'' is cladistically [[monophyletic]]."
:: This means more or less that the members of the entire family of plants going under the name Malvaceae (''strictly speaking''), which comprises over 1000 species, including the closest relatives of [[cotton]] and [[hibiscus]], all descend from a shared ancestor, specifically, that they, and no other extant plant [[taxon|taxa]], share a notional [[most recent common ancestor]] ([[Most recent common ancestor|MRCA]]).&lt;ref name="JWMS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Judd |first1=Walter S. |last-author-amp=yes |last2=Manchester |first2=Steven R. |title=Circumscription of Malvaceae (Malvales) as determined by a preliminary cladistic analysis |journal=Brittonia |date=1997 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=384-405 |issn=0007-196X |doi=10.2307/2807839}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If this is correct, that ancestor might have been a single species of plant, or even ''possibly'' a single individual plant. Conversely the assertion also means that the family includes all surviving species descended from that ancestor. Other species of plants that some people might (''broadly speaking'' or ''s.l.'') have included in the family would not have shared that MRCA (or ''[[ipso facto]]'' they too would have been members of the family Malvaceae s.s. In short, the circumscription ''s.s.'' includes all and only plants that have descended from that particular ancestral stock.

* "In the broader [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group|APG]] circumscription the family Malvaceae ''s.l.'' includes Malvaceae ''s.s.'' and also the families [[Bombacaceae]], [[Sterculiaceae]] and [[Tiliaceae]]." 
:: Here the circumscription is broader, stripped of some of its constraints by saying ''sensu lato''; that is what speaking more ''broadly'' amounts to. Discarding such constraints might be for historical reasons, for example when people usually speak of the [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] taxon because the members were long believed to form a "true" taxon and the standard literature still refers to them together. Alternatively a taxon might include members simply because they form a group that is convenient to work with in practice. In the current example, by adding other groups of plants to the family Malvaceae ''s.l.'', including those related to [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], [[kola nut|cola]], [[durian]], and [[jute]], the circumscription omits some of the criteria by which the new members previously had been excluded.&lt;ref name="JWMS"/&gt; Now it is no longer clear that all members of the circumscription descended from that one ancestor. Consequently, we say that Malvaceae ''s.l.'' form a [[polyphyletic]] group, one that does not share any single ancestor that had no other descendants. Then their most recent common ancestor could have lived perhaps tens of millions of years earlier than the most recent common ancestor of the Malvaceae ''s.s.'' alone; also there may be other extant species that are ''not'' included in the modern Malvaceae ''s.l.''.

* "The 'clearly non-monophyletic' series ''[[Cyrtostylis]]'' ''sensu'' A.S. George has been virtually dismantled..."&lt;ref name="OPMMNR"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olde |first1=Peter M. |last-author-amp=yes |last2=Marriott |first2=Neil R. |title=One new Banksia and two new Grevillea species (Proteaceae: Grevilleoideae) from Western Australia |journal=Nuytsia |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=85–99 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: This remark specifies [[Alex George]]'s particular description of that series. It is a different kind of circumscription; it does not refer directly to the biological nature of the common features of the plants, but to the fact that A.S. George referred to them as a series. "Sensu A.S. George" means that A.S. George discussed the ''Cyrtostylis'' in that series, and that members of that series are the ones under discussion in the same sense—''how A. S. George saw them''; the current author might or might not ''approve'' George's circumscription, but George's is the circumscription currently under consideration.

'''Shaun M. Hughes''' was an Australian [[astronomer]] at [[Siding Spring Observatory]].

He co-discovered the periodic [[comet]] [[130P/McNaught-Hughes]].

Shaun Hughes left Siding Spring Observatory in 1992 for a fellowship at the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he joined one of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] Key Project teams, to measure the expansion rate of the universe, also known as the [[Hubble constant]]. This was achieved by observing [[Cepheid]] variable stars to measure distances to about 20 galaxies, then using these distances to tie together various other methods for measuring distances to thousands of galaxies.

He also pursued his research on [[Mira]] variables, also known as [[Long period variable]] stars. These are stars that are similar mass as the sun, only older, after they have become red giants, just prior to becoming planetary nebulae.

In 1994 he joined the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in [[Cambridge]], England, where he continued his research and supported UK astronomers observe at the [[La Palma Observatory]].

In 1998 the UK government, on the advice of some university astronomers, decided to close the Royal Greenwich Observatory. He then had a choice of moving his family back to the United States and stay working in astronomy, or change careers and stay in Cambridge. He chose the latter, and is now a [[business analyst]] with [[Convergys]].

{{Sociology}}
'''Social studies of finance''' is an interdisciplinary research area that combines perspectives from [[anthropology]], [[economic sociology]], [[science and technology studies]], [[international political economy]], [[behavioral finance]], [[cultural studies]] and/or [[economics]] in the study of [[financial markets]]. Work in social studies of finance emphasises the social and cultural dimensions of financial activities, but focuses also on technical and economic dimensions such as pricing and trading.

==History==
Financial markets have been an object for sociological inquiry since, at least, [[Max Weber]]’s ''[[Die Börse]]''. The raise of quantitative financial theory in [[financial economics]] from the 1950s onwards has led to an academic specialization on financial markets rather focused on economic modeling, and poorly attentive to sociological aspects. In the 1980s, a number of economic sociologists developed empirical investigation on the social structure and cultural characteristics of financial markets, especially in the US. Such pioneering researcher included contributions from Wayne E. Baker, Mitchel Y. Abolafia and Charles W. Smith, and was based on methods such as ethnographic observation or [[social network analysis]]. In the 1990s, a number of researchers from the field of [[science and technology studies]] such as [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]] and [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]] started also developing empirical research in this area, with close attention to the role of expert knowledge and technology in financial activities.

==Main topics==
Research topics in social studies of finance include the cultural world and work habits of [[Trader (finance)|traders]] and other professionals in financial markets, the [[globalization]] and [[regulation]] of financial services, the processes of [[innovation]] in the financial industry and the problems of [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] that characterize such processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">'''Team Plan B''' is the only [[Canadians|Canadian]] entry in the [[Google Lunar X Prize|Google Lunar XPRIZE]], a $30 million competition to land a spacecraft on the Moon, travel 500 metres and transmit high definition video back to earth before the contest deadline of December 2017.  Team Plan B aims to be the First Privately Funded Canadian Mission to the Moon.

The Google Lunar XPRIZE entry was first submitted by current team CTO Alex Dobrianski in early 2011 right before the last days of the entry deadline.  Before moving to Canada with his family, Alex wrote the emulator for the mainframe IBM 360 EC-1032 (cert. 38) for the Mozhaisky Space Acedamy.  Team lead Alex emigrated from Ukraine in 1995, starting fresh in Canada with his family.

"In the Ukraine, Alex developed software. He made a sale to the Russian Space Agency before immigrating to Canada in 1995 with his wife, Luda, and their three children, settling in Vancouver. “With 700 bucks to start a new life,” Sergei says, his father found work fixing parking lot lighting. Because he was tall and didn’t require a ladder, he was able to work three times faster than his shorter co-workers, he says."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/vancouver-father-and-son-have-their-eyes-on-the-google-lunar-xprise/article29236938/|title=Vancouver father and son have their eyes on the Google Lunar XPRIZE|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergei Dobrianski, Alex's son has stepped in as full-time CEO in 2015, adding to the unique family team dynamic with the goal to break perceptions of what is possible in the space industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-google-moon-rover-competion-1.3579205|title=Vancouverites on Canadian team competing for Google's $20-million moon rover competition|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First 3D Printing on the Moon ==
Team Plan B has developed a procedure for the first use of [[3D printing]] using [[Lunar soil|Lunar Soil]]. The Team Plan B vision is to develop lunar 3D printing rapid manufacturing of metallurgy, parts and components, fuel composition or whatever the human mind can conceive to negate prohibitively expensive launch costs restrictive to earth launch payloads.

== Google Lunar XPRIZE Moon Shot ==
Created by [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated director [[Orlando von Einsiedel]], Executive Producer [[J. J. Abrams|J.J. Abrams]], [[Bad Robot Productions|Bad Robot]] and [[Epic Digital]] have joined forces with [[Google]] and the [[X Prize Foundation|XPRIZE]] to create a documentary web series about the teams competing for the Google Lunar XPRIZE.  Team Plan B was featured as one of the 9 episodes in the Google Lunar XPRIZE Moon Shot short documentary series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Google Lunar XPRIZE|title=Moon Shot {{!}} Episode 4 {{!}} Canada: Team Plan B|date=2016-03-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKIwpWs5d5k|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Why Why Family''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Les Kikekoi'''}} and also known as '''''Saban's The Why Why Family''''') is a [[France|French]] [[cartoon]] television series for children, which originally aired in 1996, written by [[Annabelle Perrichon]] and [[François-Emmanuel Porché]] and produced by [[Saban International Paris]]. Later, in 1998, the show was broadcast in the [[United States]] by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. Character designs and comedy elements emulate [[retro style|vintage]] cartoons.

==Synopsis==
:Prior to the intro, the baby Victor (off screen) summarizes what his family members will teach him in the episode.
:There are 5 part-episodes in which he asks a popular scientific question, following an extensive answer by the family member with a particular expertise in the field of science involved in the question. Each of these part-episodes has its own short intro and ''The End'' sketches for the specific characters. Each sketch title is &lt;(character name/s) in (episode title vis-a-vis topic)&gt;.
:Prior to the end credits, Max asks Victor "Well Victor, what did you learn today?" to which he starts with "Tons of neat stuff", summarizing what his family members taught him. Max answers, "Sounds like a real big day." and Victor concludes, "It was, but I still have plenty of questions left for next time."

==Characters==
*'''Victor'''
**A baby and the protagonist of the series. All the time he has questions (though these are smarter ones) to ask his family members like any other kid.
*'''Max''' &amp;mdash; ''[[Technology]]'' and ''[[electronics]]''
**The young father of Victor and a stereotypical mechanic/handyman. He is Vanilla's husband, Eartha and Matik's son and Micro and Scopo's brother. He seems to be the closest to Victor compared to the others. Resembles his mother Eartha and is never seen without his cap.
*'''Vanilla''' and birds '''Kwik and Kwak''' &amp;mdash; ''[[Botany]]'' and ''[[zoology]]''
**Vanilla is Max's wife, Eartha and Matik's daughter-in-law, Micro and Scopo's sister-in-law, and Victor's mother who he resembles. Kwik and Kwak are running gags of their episodes and usually bicker.
*'''Eartha''' (as her name suggests) and '''[[Basalt]]''' the dragon &amp;mdash; ''[[Geography]]'', ''[[geology]]'' and ''[[meteorology]]''
**Eartha is Matik's wife, Max, Micro and Scopo's mother, Vanilla's mother-in-law, and Victor's grandmother who occasionally loses her cool. Basalt is green with orange polka dots, has a British accent, can be greedy and transforms into different modes of transport. Eartha is also the one who cooks for their family.
*'''Micro and Scopo''' &amp;mdash; ''[[Biology]]'' of the human body
**Victor's uncles and Max's brothers who are running gags. Micro is stubby and wears a white cowboy hat (is sometimes seen without it), does most of the explanations in their episodes. Scopo is the larger and goofier of the brothers, sometimes being the test subject yet expresses his own knowledge. They both have what look like glasses/masks, and 'dog ears' like their father Matik.
*'''Matik''' and dog '''Zygo''' &amp;mdash; [[Astronomy]] and the [[Universe]]
**Matik is Victor's grandfather, Max, Micro and Scopo's father, and Eartha's husband who has 'dog ears' and is never seen without his pilot hat. Zygo sounds like [[Daffy Duck]] and has webbed limbs.

      <comment>I only changed the way the vector \mathbf{r} was written in terms of the unit radial vector. That is, I only made the text clearer, following the standard convention. Before, it was written (r,0,0) leading to a possible misunderstanding, since it leads someone to think about cartesian components of a vector.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12924">In [[mathematics]], '''vector spherical harmonics (VSH)''' are an extension of the scalar [[spherical harmonics]] for use with [[vector field]]s. The components of the VSH are [[complex-valued]] functions expressed in the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinate basis vectors]].

==Definition==
Several conventions have been used to define the VSH.&lt;ref&gt;
R.G. Barrera, G.A. Estévez and J. Giraldo, ''Vector spherical harmonics and their application to magnetostatics'', Eur. J. Phys. '''6''' 287-294 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Carrascal, G.A. Estevez, P. Lee and V. Lorenzo '' Vector spherical harmonics and their application to classical electrodynamics'', Eur. J. Phys., '''12''', 184-191 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
E. L. Hill, ''The theory of Vector Spherical Harmonics'', Am. J. Phys. '''22''', 211-214 (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
E. J. Weinberg, ''Monopole vector spherical harmonics'', Phys. Rev. D. '''49''', 1086-1092 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Morse and H. Feshbach, ''Methods of Theoretical Physics, Part II'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1898-1901 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; 
We follow that of Barrera ''et al.''. Given a scalar [[spherical harmonic]] {{math|''Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓm&lt;/sub&gt;''(''θ'', ''φ'')}}, we define three VSH:

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm} = Y_{lm}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm} = r\nabla Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm} = \mathbf{r}\times\nabla Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[unit vector]] along the radial direction in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; the vector along the radial direction with the same norm as the radius, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;. The radial factors are included to guarantee that the dimensions of the VSH are the same as those of the ordinary spherical harmonics and that the VSH do not depend on the radial spherical coordinate.

The interest of these new vector fields is to separate the radial dependence from the angular one when using spherical coordinates, so that a vector field admits a [[multipole expansion]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\sum_{l=0}^\infty\sum_{m=-l}^l\left(E^r_{lm}(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}+E^{(1)}_{lm}(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}+E^{(2)}_{lm}(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The labels on the components reflect that &lt;math&gt;E^r_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; is the radial component of the vector field, while &lt;math&gt;E^{(1)}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{(2)}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; are transverse components (w.r.to the radius vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Main Properties==

===Symmetry===
Like the scalar spherical harmonics, the VSH satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{Y}^*_{lm}\qquad\mathbf{\Psi}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{lm}\qquad\mathbf{\Phi}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

which cuts the number of independent functions roughly in half. The star * indicates [[complex conjugate]].

===Orthogonality===

The VSH are [[orthogonal functions|orthogonal]] in the usual three-dimensional way at a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}=0\qquad\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}=0\qquad\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}=0&lt;/math&gt;

They are also orthogonal in the Hilbert space

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{Y}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = \delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = l(l+1)\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = l(l+1)\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An additional result at a single point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; (not reported in Barrera et al, 1985) is (for all &lt;math&gt;l,m,l',m'&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Psi}_{l'm'}=0\qquad\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{l'm'}=0&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector multipole moments===
The orthogonality relations allow one to compute the spherical multipole moments of a vector field as

:&lt;math&gt;E^r_{lm} = \int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{Y}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^{(1)}_{lm} = \frac{1}{l(l+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^{(2)}_{lm} = \frac{1}{l(l+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

===The gradient of a scalar field===
Given the [[multipole expansion]] of a scalar field

: &lt;math&gt;\phi = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \phi_{lm}(r) Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

we can express its gradient in terms of the VSH as

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r} \mathbf{Y}_{lm}+
\frac{\phi_{lm}}{r}\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence===
For any multipole field we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}f\right)Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right) = -\frac{l(l+1)}{r}fY_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

By superposition we obtain the [[divergence]] of any vector field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E^r_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}E^r_{lm}-\frac{l(l+1)}{r}E^{(1)}_{lm}\right)Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

we see that the component on {{math|'''Φ'''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓm''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is always [[solenoidal]].

===Curl===
For any multipole field we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\right) =-\frac{1}{r}f\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}f\right)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right) = -\frac{l(l+1)}{r}f\mathbf{Y}_{lm}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}f\right)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

By superposition we obtain the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of any vector field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l
\left(-\frac{l(l+1)}{r}E^{(2)}_{lm}\mathbf{Y}_{lm}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{(2)}_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+
\frac{1}{r}E^{(2)}_{lm}\right)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}+
\left(-\frac{1}{r}E^r_{lm}+\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{(1)}_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}E^{(1)}_{lm}\right)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Laplacian===
Action of the [[Laplace operator]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta = \nabla\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt; separates as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\left(f(r)\mathbf{Z}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right)\mathbf{Z}_{lm}
+ f(r)\Delta \mathbf{Z}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_{lm} = \mathbf{Y}_{lm}, \mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}, \mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{Y}_{lm} = -\frac{1}{r^2}(2+l(l+1))\mathbf{Y}_{lm} +\frac{2}{r^2}\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm} = \frac{2}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{Y}_{lm} -\frac{1}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm} = -\frac{1}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also note that this action becomes [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]], i.e. the off-diagonal coefficients are equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{r^2}\sqrt{l(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;, for the properly [[Unit vector|normalized]] VSH.

==Examples==

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{22}= \sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}}\,\sin\theta\,e^{2i\varphi}\,\left(-\mathrm{i}\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}+\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for negative values of m are obtained applying the symmetry relations.

==Applications==

===Electrodynamics===
The VSH are especially useful in the study of [[Electromagnetic wave equation#Multipole expansion|multipole radiation fields]]. For instance, a magnetic multipole is due to an oscillating current with angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and complex amplitude

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{J}}= J(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding electric and magnetic fields can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{E}}= E(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{B}}= B^r(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}+B^{(1)}(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into Maxwell equations, Gauss' law is automatically satisfied

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\hat{\mathbf{E}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

while Faraday's law decouples in

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\hat{\mathbf{E}}=-\mathrm{i}\omega\hat{\mathbf{B}}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
\left\{\begin{array}{l}\displaystyle \frac{l(l+1)}{r}E = \mathrm{i}\omega B^r \\ \ \\ 
\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}r} +\frac{E}{r}= \mathrm{i}\omega B^{(1)}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Gauss' law for the magnetic field implies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\hat{\mathbf{B}} = 0\quad\Rightarrow \quad\frac{\mathrm{d}B^r}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}B^r - \frac{l(l+1)}{r}B^{(1)}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and Ampère-Maxwell's equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\hat{\mathbf{B}} = \mu_0 \hat{\mathbf{J}} + \mathrm{i}\mu_0\varepsilon_0\omega \hat{\mathbf{E}} \quad\Rightarrow\quad -\frac{B^r}{r}+\frac{\mathrm{d}B^{(1)}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{B^{(1)}}{r} = \mu_0J+\mathrm{i}\omega\mu_0\varepsilon_0E&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, the partial differential equations have been transformed into a set of ordinary differential equations.

===Fluid dynamics===

In the calculation of the [[Stokes' law]] for the drag that a viscous fluid exerts on a small spherical particle, the velocity distribution obeys [[Navier-Stokes equations]] neglecting inertia, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \mathbf{v} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0} = -\nabla p + \eta \nabla^2\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

with the boundary conditions

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\quad (r=a)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{U}_0\quad (r\to\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

being '''U''' the relative velocity of the particle to the fluid far from the particle. In spherical coordinates this velocity at infinity can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_0 = U_0\left(\cos\theta\, \hat{\mathbf{r}} - \sin\theta \,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right) = U_0 \left(\mathbf{Y}_{10} + \mathbf{\Psi}_{10}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The last expression suggest an expansion on spherical harmonics for the liquid velocity and the pressure

:&lt;math&gt;p=p(r)Y_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v^r(r) \mathbf{Y}_{10} + v^{(1)}(r) \mathbf{\Psi}_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution in the Navier-Stokes equations produces a set of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients.
