'''''1000 Meisterwerke (1000 Masterpieces)''''' was a [[Germany|German]] art series. It followed the highly successful German ''[[100 Great Paintings|100 Meisterwerke]]''. From 1981 through 1994, the German broadcaster [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] produced the series (originally aired from 1980 and named ''100 Meisterwerke aus den großen Museen der Welt''; "100 Masterworks from the Great Museums of the World"), which was broadcast by [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] and [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]]. In each of the 10-minute broadcasts, a single painting was presented and analyzed by an art historian. The Sunday evening broadcasts had five million viewers.

'''Actors Theatre of Louisville''' is a non-profit [[performing arts]] [[theater]] located in [[Downtown Louisville|downtown]] [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

Actors Theatre was founded in 1964 following the merging of two local companies, Actors, Inc. and Theatre Louisville, operated by Louisville natives Ewel Cornett and Richard Block.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://actorstheatre.org/about/history/|title=Actors Theatre History - Actors Theatre of Louisville|work=Actors Theatre of Louisville|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designated as the "State Theater of Kentucky" in 1974, the theatre has been called{{by whom?|date=January 2018}} one of America's most consistently innovative professional theatre companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/article/actors-theatre-louisville-louisville-ky|title=Actor's Theatre of Louisville (Louisville, KY) {{!}} NEA|website=www.arts.gov|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an annual attendance of 150,000.

The theatre presents almost 400 performances annually, including classics and contemporary work through the [[Brown-Forman]] Series, holiday plays, a series of free theatrical events produced by the Professional Training Company, and the [[Humana Festival of New American Plays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://actorstheatre.org/humana-festival-of-new-american-plays/history/|title=The Humana Festival of New American Plays - Actors Theatre of Louisville|work=Actors Theatre of Louisville|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the theatre provides arts experiences to students across the region through its education department and supports a pre-professional resident training program, the Professional Training Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/entertainment/theater/2016/09/16/actors-theatre-intensifies-apprentice-program/90043288/|title=Actors Theatre beefs up training program|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre has been the recipient of a Tony Award for Distinguished Achievement, the James N. Vaughan Memorial Award for Exceptional Achievement and Contribution to the Development of Professional Theatre, and the Margo Jones Award for the Encouragement of New Plays.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The theater has toured to 29 cities and 15 countries.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Currently, there are more than 50 published books of plays and criticism from the theater in circulation—including anthologies of Humana Festival plays, volumes of ten-minute plays and monologues, and essays, scripts and lectures from the Brown-Forman Classics in Context Festival. Numerous plays first produced at the theatre have also been published as individual acting editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://actorstheatre.org/about/history/|title=Actors Theatre History - Actors Theatre of Louisville|work=Actors Theatre of Louisville|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humana Festival of New American Plays==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The Humana Festival has introduced nearly 450 plays into the American and international theatre's general repertoire, including three Pulitzer Prize winners—''The Gin Game'' by D. L. Coburn, ''Crimes of the Heart'' by Beth Henley and ''Dinner with Friends'' by Donald Margulies—as well as Marsha Norman's ''Getting Out'', John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God'', Charles Mee's ''Big Love'', Naomi Iizuka's ''Polaroid Stories'' and ''At the Vanishing Point'', Jane Martin's ''Anton in Show Business'', Rinne Groff's ''The Ruby Sunrise'', Theresa Rebeck's ''The Scene'', Gina Gionfriddo's ''After Ashley'' and ''Becky Shaw'', UNIVERSES' ''Ameriville'', Rude Mechs' ''The Method Gun'', Jordan Harrison's ''Maple and Vine'', Will Eno's ''Gnit'', Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' ''Appropriate'', and Lucas Hnath's ''Death Tax'' and ''The Christians''.  More than 380 Humana Festival plays have been published in anthologies and individual acting editions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/11/15/actors-theatre-of-louisville-announces-2018-humana-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Humana Festival draws theater lovers, journalists, and film and stage producers from around the world. About 36,000 patrons attend the five weeks of plays and associated events, which includes a dedicated weekend for college students, which annually attracts students from more than 40 colleges and universities. The Festival culminates in two Industry Weekends which bring together a collection of amazing new plays with one-of-a-kind panels, cocktail parties, discussions and networking events. &lt;ref&gt;https://actorstheatre.org/humana-festival-of-new-american-plays/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
In May 1969, [[Jon Jory]], the son of stage and screen star [[Victor Jory]] was appointed the theater's new producing director. During this three decades in Louisville he produced more than 1,300 plays, increased Actors Theatre's budget from $244,000 to $8.3 million.{{cn|date=January 2018}} His Louisville debut was in October 1969 with [[Dylan Thomas]]' ''[[Under Milk Wood]]''. Former Executive Director, Alexander Speer, whose tenure of forty years began in 1965, became Jory's partner and led the theater's administration and operations until his retirement in the spring of 2006.

Marc Masterson was appointed the company's new Artistic Director in 2000. He had previously served as producing director of [[City Theatre (Pittsburgh)|City Theatre]] in Pittsburgh. During his tenure at Actors Theatre, Masterson produced more than 200 plays and expanded and established an Education Department consisting of public outreach programs including classroom workshops, artists in the schools, increased weekday student matinées, backstage tours and professional development for teachers and community center leaders. Masterson left Actors Theatre in 2011 to become artistic director at [[South Coast Repertory]] in California.

Following a national search, Obie Award-winning director [[Les Waters]] was named artistic director on November 29, 2011, and assumed full-time duties at the theater in January 2012. A strong proponent of contemporary work and imaginative adaptations of classic materials, Waters is widely regarded{{by whom?|date=January 2018}} as one of the most influential directors working in America today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stage-directions.com/news/31-changing-roles/3794-les-waters-new-artistic-director-at-actors-theatre-of-louisville.html|title=Les Waters New Artistic Director at Actors Theatre of Louisville - Stage Directions|last=Coakley|first=Jacob|date=2011-11-29|work=Stage Directions|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Waters announced that the season would be his last. He left Louisville in summer 2018 to pursue his freelance directing career. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.americantheatre.org/2018/05/23/les-waterss-vision-of-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
The original home of Actors Theatre was an open loft—the former Egyptian Tea Room—above the Taylor Trunk Company on Fourth Street in downtown Louisville. In 1965, the theater relocated to the former site of the Illinois Central Railway Station on Seventh Street and River Road. The space was transformed by Architect Jasper Ward into a 350-seat theatre. In the fall of 1969, the city announced that the train station was to be demolished to make way for a connector highway.  In October 1972, the theater relocated to the newly renovated Old Bank of Louisville building on Main Street, where it remains to this day. The building that became Actors Theatre was a merging of two buildings: the 1837 [[James H. Dakin]]-designed [[Old Bank of Louisville]] (which is a [[National Historic Landmark]]) and the Myers-Thompson Display Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Putting Down Roots: The Actors Theatre of Louisville Builds a Stage to Call Home | url=http://www.nea.gov/about/40th/actors.html | publisher=National Endowment for the Arts | date=February 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 28, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517071016/http://www.nea.gov/about/40th/actors.html | archivedate=May 17, 2008 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the theatre acquired a production studio at 9th and Magnolia Streets in the [[Old Louisville]] neighborhood.

'''Alicia Harding''' (also&lt;!-- Please do not change to née, characters are not born, they are created by writers. --&gt; '''Metcalfe''' and '''Gallagher''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Natalie Anderson]]. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 11 August 2010. Alicia was introduced as the sister of established character [[Leyla Harding]] ([[Roxy Shahidi]]). On 24 May 2015, it was announced that Anderson had quit the show and Alicia made her final on-screen appearance on 10 September 2015.

==Casting==
On 23 May 2010, it was announced that Anderson had joined the cast of ''Emmerdale'' as Alicia, the estranged sister of established character [[Leyla Harding]] ([[Roxy Shahidi]]).&lt;ref name="Wicked"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a221329/wicked-actress-joins-emmerdale.html|title='Wicked' actress joins 'Emmerdale'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=23 May 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of her casting, Anderson commented "I'm absolutely thrilled to be joining the show. It'll be wonderful to be working back home in Yorkshire again. I'm a Yorkshire girl so a part in ''Emmerdale'' is a dream come true!"&lt;ref name="Wicked"/&gt; Anderson revealed that she had known the series producer for a long time and had previously auditioned for a role in another soap opera in front of him, so when the part of Alicia came up he thought of her and asked her to audition.&lt;ref name="AndersonDS"/&gt; Series producer [[Gavin Blyth]] stated that Anderson was "a wonderful addition to the cast" and said Alicia would stir things up in Leyla's life from the minute she arrives.&lt;ref name="Wicked"/&gt; Anderson initially signed a six-month contract and began filming in June.&lt;ref name="Wicked"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendry"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wicked+switch+to+the+Dales%3b+Natalie+Anderson+on+how+landing+soap+role...-a0234473502|title=Wicked switch to the Dales|last=Hendry|first=Steve|date=15 August 2010|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her screen debut as Alicia in August.&lt;ref name="Wicked"/&gt;

==Development==

===Characterisation===
Upon her introduction, Alicia was described as being "in-your-face" and "trashy" by Steve Hendry from the ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]''.&lt;ref name="Hendry"/&gt; Anderson told the reporter, "She's bold and she's brassy and she does have quite a hard exterior. She is an extremely protective alpha-female. She is like a lioness of her pride, she will protect her family from anything."&lt;ref name="Hendry"/&gt; The actress said Alicia can display a vulnerable side and she was hoping that after a few episodes, viewers would get to see why she is the way she is.&lt;ref name="Hendry"/&gt; She also explained that there are many levels to Alicia and despite her initial appearance, she is anything but a [[bimbo]].&lt;ref name="Begley"/&gt; Alicia was not happy to see her estranged sister, Leyla, but Anderson did not think Alicia hated Leyla. She said "Alicia is the older, more dominant sister who has the potential to spoil everything Leyla has created in the village."&lt;ref name="Begley"/&gt; A writer for the show's official website described Alicia as being spontaneous, hard-working and driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/characters/alicia-metcalfe|title=Alicia Metcalfe|date=10 October 2013|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[What's on TV]]'' writer called Alicia "a brazen, spiteful, mouthy barmaid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/emmerdale/characters/alicia-gallagher |title=Alicia Gallagher |work=[[What's on TV]] |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |accessdate=6 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228074844/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/emmerdale/characters/alicia-gallagher |archivedate=28 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson worked closely with the make-up and wardrobe teams to make Alicia look "as extreme as possible."&lt;ref name="Hendry"/&gt; Alicia's distinctive look is made up of fake tan, long nails, hair extensions and lots of gold jewellery.&lt;ref name="Hendry"/&gt; She also wears a lot of high heels and mini skirts.&lt;ref name="Begley"/&gt; Anderson commented that she also wears extra-padded bras to make her breasts look bigger.&lt;ref name="Begley"/&gt; Anderson thought Alicia saw herself as glamorous, but said that her idea of glamorous and Alicia's was very different.&lt;ref name="Hendry"/&gt; The actress told Hendry that Alicia was not based on anyone in particular, but a type of girl who is often seen hanging around the city centre. She added that Alicia was quite unlike herself and she was excited to be seen in a different light.&lt;ref name="Hendry"/&gt; Katie Begley from the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' observed that Alicia was a wannabe [[WAGs|WAG]].&lt;ref name="Begley"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/147829/Alicia-Gallagher-s-sexy-new-look|title=Alicia Gallagher's sexy new look|last=Begley|first=Katie|date=6 August 2010|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Alicia was introduced along with her husband, [[Justin Gallagher|Justin]] ([[Andrew Langtree]]), and their son, [[Jacob Gallagher|Jacob]] (Joe Warren-Plant).&lt;ref name="AndersonDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/interviews/a254703/natalie-anderson-alicia-gallagher-emmerdale.html|title=Natalie Anderson (Alicia Gallagher, 'Emmerdale')|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=3 August 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson told [[Digital Spy]]'s Daniel Kilkelly that Alicia dotes on her son and "loves him to pieces", but things between her and her husband were strained when they first arrived. Anderson called Alicia "a strong family woman", who wanted to be a good wife and mother.&lt;ref name="AndersonDS"/&gt; Alicia came to the village to warn her sister, Leyla, not to attend their recently deceased mother's funeral. Anderson thought her character would be disliked straight away because of her introduction.&lt;ref name="AndersonDS"/&gt; Leyla ignored Alicia's warning and turned up at the funeral, where the two sisters had "a screaming match" at each other. Alicia was annoyed with Leyla, but Anderson said she respected that it was Leyla's mother too and she had a right to be there.&lt;ref name="AndersonDS"/&gt; When asked what had caused the issue, Anderson explained "All I can really say is that something has definitely gone on between them! What it is will be revealed in the next few weeks. The biggest clue I can give is that Alicia is fiercely protective of her family unit and she doesn't want anything to come between that. So you can read into that what you want!"&lt;ref name="AndersonDS"/&gt;

Anderson added that Alicia does not want to cause trouble, but she does not want her sister around. The actress hoped that viewers could see that despite the bad blood between them, the sisters were close and that they did love each other.&lt;ref name="AndersonDS"/&gt; It later emerged that Leyla was the biological mother of Jacob, not Alicia.&lt;ref name="LeylasSecret"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/scoop/a277301/rokhsaneh-ghawam-shahidi-chats-leylas-secret.html|title=Rokhsaneh Ghawam-Shahidi chats Leyla's secret|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=16 September 2010|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahidi thought Leyla just wanted to be Jacob's aunt and treat him like anyone would treat their nephew.&lt;ref name="LeylasSecret"/&gt; The actress also believed that Alicia would definitely be worried that Leyla would want to play a bigger part in Jacob's life because she is his biological mother.&lt;ref name="LeylasSecret"/&gt; Shahidi said that it is something the two sisters would have to sort out for themselves.&lt;ref name="LeylasSecret"/&gt; In October 2013, Alicia was forced to tell Jacob that she was not his mother, as she believed [[Priya Sharma]] ([[Fiona Wade]]) was going to do it instead.&lt;ref name="Break"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/emmerdale/news/emmerdale-s-natalie-anderson-alicia-breaks-jacob-s-heart|title=Emmerdale's Natalie Anderson: 'Alicia breaks Jacob's heart!'|date=24 October 2013|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending a Halloween party, Alicia noticed Priya getting drunk and became worried, so she decided to tell Jacob the truth.&lt;ref name="Break"/&gt; Speaking to a ''What's on TV'' reporter, Anderson admitted that the scene was heartbreaking for her to film. She continued "This woman has looked after this little boy for 10 years and has to tell him she's not his mum. He cries his eyes out."&lt;ref name="Break"/&gt; Alicia's worst fear then came true when Jacob ran away.&lt;ref name="Break"/&gt;

===Andy Sugden===
Following a brief fling with [[Declan Macey]] ([[Jason Merrells]]), Alicia had a relationship with [[Andy Sugden]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]).&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woodward|first=Kate|date=5–11 March 2011|title=I'd love Andy and Alicia to have a big wedding!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=9|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alicia learned all about Andy's troubled past and told her sister that it was ancient history as far as she was concerned. Anderson told Kate Woodward from ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that Alicia could pack a punch and Andy had one chance, so if he blew it, Alicia would be off.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Anderson explained that Alicia really liked that Andy was down-to-earth and just wanted to have a family, work on the farm and come home for his tea. She said Alicia shared the same sentiments and did not have big ambitions.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Fletcher and Anderson came up with the idea of Alicia being a fan of pop group [[Take That]] and so Andy buys Alicia tickets to see them live. Anderson said Alicia was flattered by the gift and loved that Andy had thought of her.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Andy and Alicia's relationship went through a rough patch when Andy offered to loan Alicia some money and then tried to get her a job at the local veterinary surgery.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

Anderson told Woodward, "Alicia is an incredibly proud person and thinks she's confided in Andy alone about her situation. So the fact he's gone behind her back and talked about her problems with other people makes her absolutely furious."&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Alicia was hurt that Andy had taken her confidential worries to someone else. Anderson hoped the couple would be able to work out their issues and get their relationship back on track.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Alicia later became involved in the show's saviour sibling storyline, which saw Andy agree to have another baby with [[Debbie Dingle]] ([[Charley Webb]]) in a bid to save his sick daughter [[List of Emmerdale characters (2005)#Sarah Sugden|Sarah Sugden Jr.]] (Sophia Amber Moore).&lt;ref name="Huge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a352017/emmerdale-star-natalie-anderson-teases-huge-alicia-decision.html|title='Emmerdale' star Natalie Anderson teases "huge" Alicia decision|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=21 November 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alicia tried to be supportive, but her feelings surrounding her own infertility made it hard for her to deal with her boyfriend having a baby with someone else.&lt;ref name="Huge"/&gt; Anderson stated that Alicia was aware of ill Sarah was, but there was a point at which she would have to "a huge decision" about her relationship with Andy.&lt;ref name="Huge"/&gt;

===Financial problems===
When Justin began spoiling Jacob, Alicia felt that like she could not compete, which upset her. Alicia did not have enough money coming in to meet the demands of a seven-year-old.&lt;ref name="Moon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moon|first=Katy|date=26 March – 1 April 2011|title=Alicia steals from her sister!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=12|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding that she needed to give Jacob the perfect birthday, Alicia began stealing from Leyla's shop. Alicia stole cigarettes and alcohol from the stockroom and sold them on.&lt;ref name="Moon"/&gt; Anderson explained that Alicia resorts to stealing because of a gift Justin sent to Jacob, which she knows will be great. During the burglary, [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden (actor)|Matthew Wolfenden]]) and Leyla hear a noise, but Alicia has gone by the time they investigate.&lt;ref name="Moon"/&gt; Alicia's financial worries affected her relationship with her sister and things became strained between them.&lt;ref name="Moon"/&gt; Alicia was forced to admit to stealing from the shop when Leyla accused employee [[Amy Wyatt]] ([[Chelsea Halfpenny]]) of committing the thefts. Alicia begged Leyla for forgiveness and admitted to stealing so she could buy Jacob presents. However, Leyla was "furious" and ordered her sister to pack her bags and leave her house.&lt;ref name="Clean"&gt;{{cite journal|date=9–15 April 2011|title=Alicia comes clean!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=14|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alicia and Jacob went to stay with Andy, who made it clear that it was not a permanent arrangement. He was also shocked that Alicia had resorted to stealing from the shop.&lt;ref name="Clean"/&gt; The sisters eventually called a truce, after Leyla asked Andy to convince Alicia to come back home.&lt;ref name="Reunited"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woodward|first=Kate|date=16–22 April 2011|title=Alicia and Leyla reunited!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|issue=15|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leyla missed Jacob and found it hard to cope without him around. Andy became curious about Alicia and Leyla's relationship and he pressed Alicia for more information. A show spokesperson commented "She really struggles to talk openly about the situation with Andy. But he's insistent – they can't have any secrets if their relationship has a hope in hell of working."&lt;ref name="Reunited"/&gt; Alicia then admitted that she was not Jacob's biological mother. Andy was shocked by the news, but glad that she had confided in him.&lt;ref name="Reunited"/&gt; Alicia also revealed that she felt huge pressure to compete with Leyla and Justin to be a good parent and Andy realised how much Alicia had been hurting.&lt;ref name="Reunited"/&gt; Meanwhile, David was unhappy that Leyla had apologised to Alicia about their argument and worried that if Alicia moved back in, there could be trouble and they could fall out again.&lt;ref name="Reunited"/&gt;

===Temporary departure===
On 19 March 2012, Anderson announced that she was four-and-a-half months pregnant, and joked that she would have to conceal her bump on-screen with large handbags and by standing behind the bar, before going on maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201203197467/natalie-anderson-pregnancy/|title='Emmerdale' star Natalie Anderson reveals exciting baby news|date=19 March 2012|work=[[Hello (magazine)|Hello]]|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alicia was temporarily written out of the show and her exit storyline saw her sent to prison, after she punched [[Val Pollard]] ([[Charlie Hardwick]]) in the face.&lt;ref name="SHendry"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/emmerdale-star-natalie-anderson-prepares-858109|title=Emmerdale star Natalie Anderson prepares to leave the show to have a baby in real life|last=Hendry|first=Steve|date=27 May 2012|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of learning about the storyline, Anderson said "When I told the show I was pregnant I had no idea what they were going to do. I had absolutely no say and, to be honest, I really thought they would say, 'She's gone off in a taxi to see her sister', something really normal, and that would be that. Then this elaborate story came about with a previous conviction and I was going, 'thank you'. I just thought it was brilliant. It's really good fun and comic in a lot of ways. I felt privileged they had thought of it that way."&lt;ref name="SHendry"/&gt; The actress was six-and-a-half months pregnant when she filmed Alicia's exit.&lt;ref name="SHendry"/&gt; The storyline began with Alicia declaring her love for [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]). After Val interrupted, Alicia ended up punching her. When Val reported her to the police, it emerged that Alicia had broken the terms of a previous suspended sentence and she was sent to prison.&lt;ref name="SHendry"/&gt; Before she went, Alicia married David, so he could look after Jacob for her.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/288180/Emmerdale-Beauty-Natalie-Anderson-is-busting-to-return-to-The-Woolpack|title=Emmerdale Beauty Natalie Anderson is busting to return to The Woolpack|last=Hill|first=Susan|date=16 December 2012|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alicia returned on 18 December 2012, while Anderson signed a new one-year contract.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

===Dom Andrews===
In June 2013, Alicia began dating village newcomer [[Dominic Andrews|Dom Andrews]] ([[Wil Johnson]]), despite still harbouring feelings for David.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/scoop/a486811/emmerdale-wil-johnson-teases-new-pregnancy-storyline.html|title='Emmerdale': Wil Johnson teases new pregnancy storyline|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=4 June 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson told [[Digital Spy]]'s Daniel Kilkelly that Dom liked Alicia "a lot" and wanted to make a go of things with her. He was unaware of how deep Alicia's feelings were for David, as he did not know about her history.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; He commented "It's been quite a slow process with Dom and Alicia, and I think that's because Dom also has to protect himself because of his own history."&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; Dom's teenage daughter [[Gemma Andrews|Gemma]] (Tendai Rinomhota) did not approve of Alicia, who quickly realised that she was "a daddy's girl".&lt;ref name="Bombshell"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1–7 June 2013|title=Baby bombshell!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|issue=22|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dom found a positive pregnancy test in his home, he assumed it belonged to Gemma. However, Alicia surprised them both when she claimed the pregnancy test belonged to her.&lt;ref name="Bombshell"/&gt; Dom later asked Alicia to move in with him and Gemma, but she did not react well.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; When asked if Dom and Alicia should be together, Johnson replied that they should as they are right for other. He added "Time will tell if their hearts are truly committed to each other."&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
&lt;!--===Lachlan White===
In late 2014, [[Lachlan White]] (Thomas Atkinson) developed an unhealthy obsession with Alicia while she was being friendly to him to befriend his mother, [[Chrissie White|Chrissie]] (Louise Marwood). He got a tattoo to become more like Alicia's husband, David, and bought her expensive gifts, which David began to notice. The storyline eventually saw Lachlan sexually assault Alicia when she was asleep. The soap opera's executive producer, Kate Oates, announced that the show initially were going to make Lachlan rape Alicia, but decided against this plot twist as sexual assault is just as common as rape.--&gt;

===Departure===
On 24 May 2015, it was announced that Anderson would leave ''Emmerdale'' at the end of her contract in the latter half of 2015.&lt;ref name=DSExit/&gt; On-screen, Alicia had been sexually attacked by teenager [[Lachlan White]] (Thomas Atkinson) and he had only recently confessed to the crime.&lt;ref name=DSExit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a648990/natalie-anderson-is-leaving-emmerdale-now-is-the-right-time-to-say-bye-to-alicia.html#~pdNzI5slGH2UeR|title=Natalie Anderson is leaving Emmerdale: 'Now is the right time to say bye to Alicia'|last=Davies|first=Megan|date=24 May 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alicia persisted on a new start with David and Jacob in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=DSExit/&gt; Speaking of her decision, Anderson said "I've had the most incredible five years at ''Emmerdale'' and made some wonderful friends. I'm so grateful to the writers, directors, producers and everyone I've worked with. This year has been such a highlight and so amazing that I felt now was the right time to say bye to Alicia and see what the future holds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-05-24/emmerdale-star-natalie-anderson-to-leave-alicia-metcalfe-role|title=Emmerdale spoilers: Natalie Anderson to leave Alicia Metcalfe role|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June, Alicia, David and Jacob were seen leaving the village for Portugal, but it was later confirmed that this was not Alicia's final exit scenes.

I went back to work really early after I had him... he was 11 weeks old when I went back to work."&lt;ref name=ExitReason&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a667422/natalie-anderson-on-her-decision-to-leave-emmerdale-it-was-a-year-in-the-making.html#~pnHLpVyDgheutN&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to state how the show's filming schedule proved too much for her, especially when she would "go a week" without seeing her son.&lt;ref name=ExitReason/&gt; It had also recently been revealed that Alicia would leave without her husband David. Alicia's exit scenes aired on 10 September 2015.

==Storylines==
Alicia comes to the village to warn her sister Leyla to stay away from their mother's funeral. Leyla attends anyway and Alicia tells her not to expect a reconciliation. Alicia returns when her marriage to Justin breaks down and she argues with Leyla, revealing that she adopted Leyla's son, Jacob. Their mother had persuaded Leyla to allow Alicia to adopt him as Alicia is infertile. Leyla asks Alicia and Jacob to move in with her and her boyfriend, David Metcalfe, and Alicia gets a job in The Woolpack. When Jacob has an allergic reaction to some nuts, Alicia accuses Leyla of neglecting him. She also feuds with [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]) and [[Eve Jenson]] ([[Suzanne Shaw]]). Alicia flirts with [[Nathan Wylde]] ([[Lyndon Ogbourne]]) and Leyla warns Alicia not to trust him. Alicia also flirts with [[Declan Macey]] ([[Jason Merrells]]) and he invites her to a housewarming party at Home Farm. Alicia and Declan flirt as he shows her around and he invites her upstairs, but his ex-wife and his daughter arrive and Alicia leaves. After an argument with her ex-husband, Alicia meets Declan at The Woolpack and they have a drink together, before she goes home with him.

Leyla and Alicia argue about Jacob and her going out at night, but Jacob overhears them. Alicia soon discovers that Jacob has run away and blames Leyla, but Justin blames her. The police are called in and Alicia gives a press conference. Justin tells Alicia that he is Jacob's biological father and Leyla admits they had a one-night stand. David finds Jacob in an abandoned building and comforts him as he is taken to hospital. Alicia refuses to give Justin access to Jacob and he threatens to go for custody, but Leyla defends Alicia. Alicia is furious when Justin collects Jacob from school without informing her. She reveals her fear that Jacob will hate her as a result of Justin spoiling him. Leyla tells Alicia that she should not stop Justin seeing Jacob, as Jacob misses him. Alicia later calls Justin and agrees that he can have access to their son. Alicia begins dating Andy Sugden. When she suffers financial problems, Andy offers her a loan, but she refuses to take his money. Andy then tries to get her a job at the veterinary surgery, but she tells him not to interfere in her life.

When Andy and Debbie Dingle find out that their daughter needs a bone marrow transplant, they decide to conceive a saviour sibling. Alicia supports Andy, but is dismayed when he and Debbie have sex to conceive the baby. Alicia struggles with the situation and she and Andy break up. Alicia turns to David for support and she moves back in with him. Although David views their friendship as platonic, Alicia finds herself developing feelings for him. When Val Pollard berates David for allowing her husband to begin a new relationship, Alicia becomes angry and punches Val. Val reports her to the police and Alicia is charged with assault. It emerges that Alicia has a prior conviction for assault and has a suspended sentence. Worried that Justin will take Jacob, David suggests to Alicia that they marry so he can be Jacob's guardian. Alicia agrees and they marry. She then admits her true feelings to David, but he tells her he does not feel the same. Alicia is then sentenced to a year in prison.

When Alicia is released from prison, she is upset to learn that David is now dating Priya Sharma. Weeks later Alicia begins dating Dominic Andrews, although his daughter, Gemma, does not like her. Alicia realises her true feelings for David and goes to his house to tell him, but Priya answers the door and tells a stunned Alicia that the couple are now engaged. This devastates Alicia, but she soon has to concentrate on her new family with Dom when he discovers that Gemma is pregnant. Gemma confides in Alicia about her mother walking out on her and Dom, the pregnancy and her feud with [[Belle Dingle]] ([[Eden Taylor-Draper]]). During a siege in The Woolpack, Cameron Murray holds several residents hostage, including Alicia, David and Priya. Alicia is accidentally shot by Cameron and she starts to succumb to her injury, before Cameron allows David to take her out of the pub. Alicia is rushed to hospital where she is treated and later resuscitated. David and Alicia admit their feelings for one another and they begin a relationship, which devastates Priya and Dom. Believing Priya will tells Jacob that she is not his mother, Alicia and David sit him down and tell him the truth. Jacob is upset and runs away to stay with Priya. Alicia and David soon get engaged and immediately book a Christmas wedding. After a few incidents before the wedding, Alicia and David marry. On the same day, Leyla returns and the sisters argue. Leyla tells Alicia that her boss is calling her and is working as a recruitment consultant. Alicia doesn't believe the story and finds out that Leyla is actually impersonating her as a stripper. Leyla and Alicia have a heart to heart and with the realisation that Leyla isn't coping, she lets her sister stay in her house.

The following year, Alicia is [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] by [[Lachlan White]] (Thomas Atkinson), after he misunderstands her friendliness for affection. The ordeal causes Alicia to breakdown. When Val's son, Paul, offers her and David to run a bar with him in [[Lisbon]], they accept. David and Alicia leave the village. David makes a return when Eric has a heart attack. Alicia joins him, after Val is killed in an explosion. Alicia and David try to console a grieving Eric, but Alicia tells David that she wants to return to Portugal. However, David refuses and reveals that he bought the shop and needs to be there for his father. Realising they want different things, Alicia and David break up and she leaves to Portugal the next day. Alicia then files for a divorce.

==Reception==
In 2015, Anderson was nominated for Best Actress at the ''[[British Soap Awards]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a644158/eastenders-tops-british-soap-awards-2015-shortlist.html#~pdQETrzymB8AIx|title=EastEnders tops British Soap Awards 2015 shortlist|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=27 April 2015|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alicia arrived, Katie Begley from the ''Daily Star'' commented "If ''Emmerdale'' suddenly finds itself facing a shortage of push-up bras, fake tan and hair extensions then we know exactly who to blame – brassy newcomer Alicia Gallagher."&lt;ref name="Begley"/&gt; Kerry Barrett from ''[[All About Soap]]'' branded Alicia a "mouthy mum" and said she could not help feel sorry for her, as she is "desperately" in love with David.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutsoap.co.uk/blog/emmerdale-hurrah-to-hostage-hell-heartbreak/|title=Emmerdale: Alicia hits out!|last=Barrett|first=Kerry|date=28 May 2012|work=[[All About Soap]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alicia was shot, Barrett's colleague Mark James Lowe quipped "Our hearts were in our mouths as we watched the docs desperately trying to resuscitate poor Alicia.

[[File:Amarakosha.jpg|thumb|Cover of a modern copy of Amara kosha]]
{{italic title}}
The '''Amarakosha''' ([[Devanagari]]: अमरकोशः, [[IAST]]: Amarakośa) is the popular name for ''Namalinganushasanam'' ([[Devanagari]]: नामलिङ्गानुशासनम्,  [[IAST]]: Nāmaliṅgānuśāsanam) a [[thesaurus]] in [[Sanskrit]] written by the ancient Indian scholar [[Amarasimha]]. It is the oldest extant kosha.{{cn|date=July 2016}} The author himself mentions 18 prior works, but they have all been lost. There have been more than 40 commentaries on the ''Amarakosha''.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Etymology==
The word "Amarakosha" derives from the Sanskrit words ''amara'' ("immortal") and ''kosha'' ("treasure, casket, pail, collection, dictionary").
The actual name of the book "Namalinganushasanam" means "instruction concerning nouns and gender".{{cn|date=July 2016}}

== Author ==
{{main article|Amara Sinha}}
Amarasimha is said to have been one of the [[Navaratnas]] ("nine gems") at the court of [[Chandragupta II]], a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] king who reigned around AD 400. Some sources indicate that he belonged to the period of [[Vikramaditya]] of 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Amarakosha'' compiled by [[Benjamin L. Rice|B.L.Rice]], edited by N.Balasubramanya, 1970, page X&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirashi examines the question of the date of composition of ''Amarakosha''. He finds the first reliable mention in Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of [[Amoghavarsha]](814-867CE)&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=X0JUwf2BXVAC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=amarakosha+date&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zeylMxatYp&amp;sig=3uYsj8UjCcHDA_KTzRGYGX7HU7A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUwJHki4fKAhXKKyYKHYScB1EQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=amarakosha%20date&amp;f=false   Literary and Historical Studies in Indology, Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi, , Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1975, p. 50-51]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual organisation==
The ''Amarakosha'' consists of verses that can be easily memorized. It is divided into three {{IAST|khāṇḍa}}s or chapters. The first, ''{{IAST|svargādi-khāṇḍa}}'' ("heaven and others") has words pertaining to gods and heavens. The second, ''{{IAST|bhūvargādi-khāṇḍa}}'' ("earth and others") deals with words about earth, towns, animals and humans. The third, ''{{IAST|sāmānyādi-khāṇḍa}}'' ("common") has words related to grammar and other miscellaneous words.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

''Svargadhikanda'', the first Kanda of the ''Amarakosha'' begins with the verse 'Svaravyam swarganakathridivatrishalaya..' describing various names of Heaven viz. Sva, Avya, swarga, Naka, Tridiva, Tridasalaya etc. The second verse 'Amara, nirjara, deva,’ describes various words that are equivalent to word God. The fifth and sixth verses give various names of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The following verses give the different names of Brahma, Vishnu, Vasudeva, Balarama, etc. All these names are treated with great reverence which makes it difficult to ascertain Amara Sinha's theological bent.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

The second Kanda, ''Bhuvargadhikanda'', of the ''Amarakosha'' is divided into ten Vargas or parts. The ten Vargas are ''Bhuvarga'' ([[Earth]]), ''Puravarga'' (Towns or Cities), ''Shailavarga'' (Mountains), ''Vanoshadivarga'' (Forests and medicines), ''Simhadivarga'' (Lions and other animals), ''Manushyavarga'' (Mankind), ''Bramhavarga'' ([[Brahmin]]), ''Kshatriyavarga'' ([[Kshatriya]]s), ''Vysyavarga'' ([[Vysya]]s) and ''Sudravarga'' ([[Shudra|Sudra]]s).{{cn|date=July 2016}}

The Third Kanda, ''Samanyadhikanda'' contains Adjectives, Verbs, words related to prayer and business etc. The first verse ''Kshemankaroristatathi Shivathathi Shivamkara'' gives the Nanarthas of the word Shubakara or propitious as Kshemankara, Aristathathi, Shivathathi and Shivamkara.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

'''Angelique Bouchard''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] from the [[gothic horror]]-[[soap opera]] and [[Dark Shadows (film)|film]] ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', in which she is the main [[antagonist]]. She is primarily portrayed as a powerful [[witch]] driven by her vacillating love and hatred for [[Barnabas Collins]].

In the original TV series, the character was portrayed by [[Lara Parker]], and appeared within several storylines of the series which aired from June 1966 through April 1971. Angelique was originally introduced to explain how Barnabas Collins became a vampire, but she proved popular enough in her own right to make many return appearances. She is portrayed by English actress [[Lysette Anthony]] in the 1991 [[Dark Shadows (1991 TV series)|revival TV series]], and French actress [[Eva Green]] in the 2012 [[Dark Shadows (film)|feature film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]].

==Original history==

Angélique was born as Miranda DuVal during the 17th century in the West Indies of Martinique. During her early teen years, Angélique travelled to America, where she became a faithful and loyal follower of a warlock named Judah Zachary. Judah took Angélique under his wing, and taught her the sacred arts of magic and witchcraft. One year later, both Angélique and Judah were captured and exposed as witches by the Catholic Church. Fearing her fate of death, Angélique betrayed Judah by testifying against him in exchange for her freedom.

Miranda was later reincarnated as Angélique Bouchard. She was raised by Theodore Bouchard, who she believed to be her father, before coming to work for the duPres family.  She is Countess Natalie duPres' servant, she follows her to Collinsport, Maine. However, after having a brief affair with Barnabas Collins, Angélique was heartbroken after Barnabas declared his love to another woman - Josette du Prés. After countless failed attempts to rekindling her romance with Barnabas, Angélique hexed a powerful spell to manipulate Josette’s love for Jeremiah Collins, Barnabas’ uncle. After Josette eloped with Jeremiah, Angelique coerced Barnabas into marrying her. However, after the discovery of her practices in witchcraft, Barnabas supposedly murdered Angélique. Before her "death", Angélique cursed Barnabas as a species of the undead and fell into a coma where she was presumed to die. Later, after her surprising survival, Angélique was devastated about what she did to Barnabas, and tried to reverse her spell. She is the first victim of her own curse, being in love with Barnabas. He strangles her in the secret room of the mausoleum. Her soul is claimed by The Dark Lord in exchange for letting Barnabas continue existing as a vampire through her curse rather than perish.

During the early spring of 1968, Angélique changed her name to Cassandra Blair, and became the second wife of Roger Collins. Roger introduced his new bride to his family. She received a lukewarm welcome and Barnabas (who immediately recognized his former estranged wife) never doubted her true identity. Later, throughout the first year of their marriage, the happily married couple grow further and further apart. As Roger begins to realize his mistake in marrying "Cassandra", Angélique has affairs with multiple men - most notably Tony Peterson - of whom Elizabeth Collins Stoddard finds in the middle of one such affair and threaten to tell Roger. However, before having the chance to expose "Cassandra", Angélique hexes Elizabeth with a spell that surrenders her into a deathlike state. Believing her to be dead, the Collins family unknowingly buries Elizabeth alive.

She is destroyed by the Ghost of Reverend Trask, but is brought back from the dead and cursed as a vampire by Nicolas Blair. She attacks Joe Haskell on orders from Nicolas, and turns him into her slave. Then when Nicolas tells her she can have Barnabas, she no longer wants Joe and quits summoning him. She then turns on Barnabas and she bites him several times and turns him into her slave.

Angelique traveled back to 1897 in order to further torment a time-traveling Barnabas. Initially a villain once more, she falls in love with Quentin Collins, and eventually becomes a firm ally in the enduring war against Andreas Petofi.

Angelique's next storyline comes when she is discovered retired from witchcraft in 1970. After her marriage to Skyler Rumson, Angelique desired to live a normal life by renouncing her powers. After her encounter with Julia Hoffman, she claimed not be interested in the Collins family any longer. However, after the rise of the Leviathans, Barnabas sought her assistance and begged her for help. Though hesitant to practice magic again, Angelique reluctantly agreed. After the discovery of her husband’s allegiance to the Leviathans, Angelique abandoned Sky and took refuge in Collinsport at The Old House.

A post-1795 Angelique is encountered in 1840 by Barnabas during his final TV storyline, where she has no knowledge of future events. Initially once more an antagonist, she eventually aids Barnabas against the threat of Judah Zachary and Lamar Trask, losing her powers in the process. Mortally wounded, she dies in Barnabas' arms, moments before he declares his love for her.

==Books==
In 1998, Lara Parker made her writing debut with the novel ''Angelique's Descent'', which focused on Angelique’s early years in Martinique and her love affair with Barnabas Collins.

In 2006, she released a sequel, ''The Salem Branch''. She also wrote the introduction to the novel ''Dark Shadows: Dreams of the Dark'' (1999), written by [[Stephen Mark Rainey]] and [[Elizabeth Massie]].

Lara released ''Wolf Moon Rising'' in 2013 and noted there would be a fourth book in the series that focuses on Victoria Winters coming back to Collinwood after her return to 1795.

==2012 film==
In the 2012 ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' film, Angelique (portrayed by French actress [[Eva Green]]) is an amazingly powerful and resilient witch, and a successful local businesswoman and community symbol. Her interest in Barnabas, after he is unwittingly released from her imprisonment, is again inflamed and she immediately seeks him out.

In a single brief childhood scene establishing Angelique's early interest in Barnabas, the young Angelique (played by [[Raffey Cassidy]]) is shown with her mother, a servant, departing from [[Liverpool]] for "the New World" along with the Collins family. The childhood scene establishes, more intensively than the television series did, Angelique's class-based resentment of the Collins clan's privileges, for she is cautioned by her mother that she must accept her place, servitude, in the social structure of the time and not even gaze freely upon her "betters", including Barnabas. It is later learned that Angelique had caused the fatal accident that claimed Barnabas' parents' lives.

The '''Apobates Base''' is a marble statue base featuring the scene of an Apobates competition or [[chariot race]]. The base, which is part of the collection at the [[Acropolis Museum]] in [[Athens]], stands at {{convert|42|cm|in}} in height and {{convert|86|cm|in}} in width. A charioteer, armed athlete or warrior, and four horse-drawn chariot are depicted in profile relief. Named for the Greek “Apobatai” – literally the “Dismounters” – the base’s relief depicts the racing event or Apobates race, which was a ceremonial part of the [[Panathenaic Games]]. In this event athletes would race against other athletes by dismounting and remounting moving chariots for prizes and renown.

==Sculptural style==
The base dates to the [[Hellenistic period]], ca. 300 B.C.E. While the base dates to the Hellenistic era, [[periodization]] is not an exact science. In this case, although made during the Hellenistic era, the artistry of the base actually falls into the categorization of Late [[Classical sculpture]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Athens,+Acropolis+1326&amp;object=Sculpture|title=Athens, Acropolis 1326 (Sculpture)|website=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not entirely uncommon for styles to bleed over into other periods simply because specific artistic and stylistic changes are not the sole consideration for the division of periods like Classical and Hellenistic eras. Artistic styles, including that of the Apobates Base, can fall categorically into a style entirely different from the era to which they date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/antiquity/greek-sculpture-hellenistic-period.htm|title=Hellenistic Greek Sculpture|website=Visual-arts-cork.com|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Base’s Classical style is characterized by a great amount of dynamic movement, realistic and defined musculature, and greater sense of depth and dimension in sculptural figures. While a great deal of the base is damaged, the Classical style is most obvious in the dynamic pose of the athlete and figural depth of the horses.

==Depictions in art==
This event became entrenched as part of the ritual of the [[Panathenaic Games]]. Among the various athletic competitions of the Panathenaic Festival, chariot racing came to prominence - though no research to date can provide a full picture of the event. However, the event is construed to be representative of past military spectacles and was integrated into a sporting event in which athletes would dismount and remount moving chariots during a race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah17321/abstract|title=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History|first=Martha C.|last=Taylor|date=7 December 2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah17321/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contestants who won the Apobates race would commemorate their victory in the Panathenaia by constructing monuments and dedicatory statues. The Apobates base is one such dedication. The victors would place them in sanctuaries and Panhellenic sites. These victory monuments became artistic expressions in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/british_museum_olympic_games.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Olympic Games in Ancient Greece |website=Britishmuseum.org\accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of charioteers and chariot racing became popular thematic elements to include in [[votive]] and victory dedications, as well as grave markers and sculptural decoration. The chariot became a symbol of wealth and, as a result, contributed to conspicuous consumption in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalsporting.org/nslm/exhibition_details/619|title=National Sporting Library &amp; Museum|website=Nationalsporting.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chariot became a prominent feature of Greek art and an important part of festivals like the Panathenaia. It was because of the connotations which chariots and charioteers held in Greek society that it became such a popular subject for Greek art.

==Discovery==
Found on the west side of the Athenian Acropolis, the base supported an athletic or military victory dedication, similar to a votive dedication.  Unfortunately only the base survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqxzGnGzjl8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=Apobates+base&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0OxHKbT791&amp;sig=SzTxTgOgnkPdEmGygM7qzpyump4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnd6I8YfXAhVG8IMKHaLzDUcQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Apobates+base&amp;f=false|title=The Iconography of Sculptured Statue Bases in the Archaic and Classical Periods|first=Angeliki|last=Kosmopoulou|date=7 December 2017|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
The chariot was introduced to the Greeks through trade and interaction with the Near East ca. 1400 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/chariot/|title=Chariot|website=Ancient.eu|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the chariot became adopted and integrated into Greek iconography. The same motif is found in some of the earliest sculpture from mainland Greece, namely the sandstone Grave Stele at [[Mycenae]] found in [[Grave Circle A]] which dates to the 16th Century B.C.E. In ancient Greek culture, the chariot and charioteer became a symbol of power and wealth because horses were very expensive and chariots themselves extremely impracticable for Greek terrain.

The '''Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming''' is a [[British Army]] training establishment that provides instructions of [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[bagpipe]] music to military pipers, drummers and [[pipe bands]].

==History==

Founded in 1910 as the '''Army School of Piping''' (later renamed the '''Army School of Bagpipe Music'''), the School is located at Inchdrewer House near [[Redford Barracks]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] and is administered by the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]], it is also affiliated with the [[Corps of Army Music]].  Generally regarded as the smallest unit in the British Army, the School is now commanded by a Director who is a qualified army [[Pipe Major]] and who usually holds the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] or [[Major]] (usually being commissioned from [[Warrant Officer]] rank on appointment).  The Director is assisted by a Chief Instructor, who is the Senior Pipe Major of the British Army.

The School provides courses at different levels to pipers and drummers of the [[British Armed Forces]] throughout the year, and qualified instructors are drawn from the [[pipes and drums]] of various units in the [[British Army]].  The School accepts students from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces, but not civilians.  It has in the past provided instruction to various [[police]] band members, but this has not taken place for a number of years.

The School forms part of the Piping and Drumming Qualifications Board, which is a collaboration among the [[Piobaireachd Society]], the [[Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association]], the [[College of Piping in Glasgow, Scotland|College of Piping]], and the [[Piping Centre]]. Together, the Institute sets a standardised piping certificate programme for students from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdqb.org/|title=The Piping and Drumming Qualifications Board|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beatriz Guido''' (13 December 1924 – 4 March 1988) was an [[Argentine]] novelist and screenwriter.

== Biography ==
Guido was born in [[Rosario]], [[Santa Fe Province]], the daughter of architect [[Ángel Guido]] (renowned as the creator of the [[National Flag Memorial (Argentina)|National Flag Memorial]]) and of [[Uruguayan people|Uruguayan]] actress Berta Eirin. She studied at the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of the [[University of Buenos Aires]].

She wrote her first novel, ''La casa del ángel'', in 1954. She also wrote a short story named ''Usurpacion''. Because of her outspoken anti-[[Peronism]], she was branded a "right-wing writer" and a "false aristocrat" by the government of [[Juan Perón]]. In 1959 she married film director and screenwriter [[Leopoldo Torre Nilsson]]. She started working with her husband, who took several of her works to the screen.

In 1984 she won the [[Konex Award|Konex]] Merit Diploma on Letters. That year she was appointed [[cultural attaché]] of the Argentine Embassy in Spain. She died of a heart attack in [[Madrid]] four years later, at the age of 63.

The '''Birmingham Artists Committee''' was an [[England|English]] [[artist collective]] that organised exhibitions of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]] in [[Birmingham]] between 1947 and 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stevenson, Diana|editor1=Watkins, Jonathan |editor2=Stevenson, Diana |title=Some of the best things in life happen accidentally: the beginning of Ikon|year=2004|publisher=Ikon Gallery|location=Birmingham|isbn=1-904864-02-3|pages=113|chapter=Interview - Trevor Denning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee was organised by the art critic [[Robert Melville (art critic)|Robert Melville]] and artists including [[Oscar Mellor]] and [[Trevor Denning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Silvano|title=The Scandalous Eye: The Surrealism of Conroy Maddox|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Os0K27XUlnwC&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=2008-03-08|year=2003|publisher=Liverpool University Press|location=Liverpool|isbn=0-85323-559-7|pages=96|chapter=Birmingham Years 1933-1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; to break the stranglehold of the conservative [[Royal Birmingham Society of Artists]] on the exhibition of work by living artists in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Denning|first=Trevor|authorlink=Trevor Denning|editor=Sidey, Tessa|title=Surrealism in Birmingham 1935-1954|year=2001|publisher=[[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]]|location=Birmingham|isbn=0-7093-0235-5|pages=86|chapter=Birmingham Artists Committee|quote=Our purpose since the committee's formation in 1947 has been to exhibit the works of what we consider to be the best local artists. If any bias is shown at all it is in favour of those artists whose work is otherwise denied a public showing because of its failure to conform to the somewhat conservative standards of the older established societies here - in brief, the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and its offshoots. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its exhibitions were an important post-war outlet for the [[Birmingham Surrealists]], showing the work of [[Conroy Maddox]], [[John Melville]], [[Emmy Bridgwater]] and the young [[Desmond Morris]]. Other notable artists represented included [[CoBrA]] member [[William Gear]] and the sculptor [[Gordon Herickx]].

Although there was no organisational link, The Birmingham Artists Committee was acknowledged as a catalyst by the artists who founded the [[Ikon Gallery]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Watkins, Jonathan|editor1=Watkins, Jonathan |editor2=Stevenson, Diana |title=Some of the best things in life happen accidentally: the beginning of Ikon|year=2004|publisher=Ikon Gallery|location=Birmingham|isbn=1-904864-02-3|pages=36–38|chapter=Some of the best things in life happen accidentally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bishop Lloyd's House''' (or '''Bishop Lloyd's Palace''') is at 41&amp;nbsp;Watergate Street, and 51/53&amp;nbsp;Watergate Row, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England. It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376439|desc= Number 41 street numbers 51 and 53 Row Bishop Lloyds House, Chester|access-date= 8 April 2012|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] considered it to be "perhaps the best" house in Chester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Pevsner | first =Nikolaus | authorlink =Nikolaus Pevsner | last2 = Hubbard | first2 = Edward | author2-link=Edward Hubbard | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2003| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| page = 169| isbn =0-300-09588-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house is built on two stone [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[undercroft]]s with [[timber framing]] above. Its first floor incorporates a section of the [[Chester Rows]]. The house is now used as shops and meeting rooms and it includes the headquarters of Chester Civic Trust.

==History==

The house originated as two town houses which were built on medieval undercrofts. It was rebuilt during the 17th&amp;nbsp;century when the two buildings were converted into one.  The rebuilt house broke with the medieval fashion of having the main residential accommodation in a great hall at the row level; instead the principal living accommodation was in two "elegant chambers" in the floor above the row.  The house has been associated with [[George Lloyd (bishop of Chester)|George Lloyd]], who was [[Bishop of Chester]] from 1605 to 1615.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century the east (left) house bore a panel inscribed "EDGAR'S ACADEMY".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_image.php?id=114| title = Bishop Lloyd's Palace, c. 1728| accessdate = 18 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 19th&amp;nbsp;century it had become run down, the carvings on its frontage had been covered with plaster, the house had been split into [[Apartment building|tenements]], and it was becoming derelict.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morris| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Dover|  publisher = Alan Sutton| page = 21| isbn = 0-7509-0255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1890s the house was heavily restored by [[Thomas Meakin Lockwood|Thomas Lockwood]].  He re-fronted the east house to more closely match the west house and added a flight of steps from the street to the level of the row on the east side.  He also re-positioned the posts holding the structure above the row&lt;ref name=images/&gt; and replaced the 18th-century [[sash window]]s with [[mullion]]ed windows.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; A further restoration was carried out between 1973 and 1977.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;
[[File:Rayner Watergate.jpg|thumb|alt=A street in the 19th century with buildings on the left, the first of which is timber-framed and highly decorated. In front of the house is a horse and cart|Bishop Lloyd's House before&lt;br&gt;[[Thomas Meakin Lockwood|Lockwood's]] restoration]]

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The building has the appearance of two houses, each under a [[gable]], with three storeys, and an attic in each gable.  At the street level the east (left) house has a stone staircase with a [[wrought iron]] railing.  At the row level is an oak handrail on [[baluster]]s, behind which is a shop front.  The [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] supporting the storey above are carved with bearded giants, beasts and an owl; there are also lighter brackets shaped as figures. On the outside, between the beam over the row and the windows above are ten square panels.  The windows are divided into three bays by oak [[pilaster]]s carved in [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] style, and further divided in each bay by two [[mullion]]s and two [[transom (architectural)|transom]]s making a total of 27.  Above the windows is a plaster band and in the attic is a three-light window surrounded by more square panels.  The [[bargeboard]]s have carved [[cornice]]s with an ornate post between them.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;
[[File:Bishop Lloyd Row.jpg|thumb|alt=An elevated covered walkway with the fronts of premises on the right and posts and railings overlooking the street on the left|[[Chester Rows|Row]] in front of Bishop Lloyd's House in 2008 showing the walkway and stallboard]]
The ground floor of the west house includes a shop with a central entrance.  On each side are two [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and an 18-light [[bow window]]. At the row level is a wooden balustrade, and brackets with carvings similar to the east house.  Above this level are eight recessed carved panels.  The two centre panels contain the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|coat of arms]] of [[James I of England|James&amp;nbsp;I]] with an inscription, and the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Sodor and Man]] (George Lloyd was [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] before he became Bishop of Chester) with the date 1615.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  To the left of these are three panels containing carvings of [[Adam and Eve]], [[Cain and Abel]], and [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham and Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Ward | first =Simon | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Chester: A History |edition= | publisher =Phillimore | year = 2009 | location =Chichester | page = 62|  isbn =978-1-86077-499-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To the right are another three panels, two of which contain carvings of [[Bible|biblical]] scenes.  In the storey above are four oak pilasters dividing the windows into three bays, with two mullions and a transom further separating the windows - of which there is a total of 18.  Above the windows is a carved beam and over this are ten arched panels which contain carvings of [[heraldry|heraldic]] beasts.  In the attic is a three-light window to each side of which are three panels containing carvings, and above the window are three plain panels.  Again the bargeboards are carved with a post between them.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
The two undercrofts have walls of red [[sandstone]] [[rubble]], with brick [[barrel vault]]s which were probably added in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  Leading from the row level to the third storey is a [[Thomas Chippendale|Chinese Chippendale]] staircase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartwell | first = Clare |last2 = Hyde | first2 = Matthew |last3 = Hubbard | first3 = Edward | author3-link=Edward Hubbard | last4 =Pevsner | first4 =Nikolaus | author4-link =Nikolaus Pevsner | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2011| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| pages = 265–266|  isbn =978-0-300-17043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the third storey are two rooms.  The larger room has an ornate 17th-century plaster ceiling and a massive fireplace; it is thought that these were moved from the Bishop's Palace in Abbey Square after this was damaged in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].  The smaller room also has a plaster ceiling, less ornate than in the other room.  This includes motifs including [[Tudor rose]]s, horses, and starfish.  Around the room is a [[frieze]] containing sea-monsters.  In this room is a smaller fireplace in the [[Fireplace mantel|overmantel]] of which is a carving of [[Cupid]] riding on a lion.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=30| title = Bishop Lloyd's Palace| accessdate = 16 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

There are shops on the ground floor level and at the level of the row. The house above is open free of charge to visitors at advertised times. It has two large meeting rooms which are available to hire.&lt;ref name=cct&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chestercivictrust.org.uk/blp/| title = Hire Bishop Lloyd's Palace| accessdate = 16 February 2011| publisher = Chester Civic Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building contains the headquarters of the Chester Civic Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chestercivictrust.org.uk/| title = The Chester Civic Trust Organisation | accessdate = 16 February 2011| publisher = Chester Civic Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bjarke Ingels Group''', often referred to as '''BIG''', is a [[Copenhagen]] and [[New York City|New York]] based group of [[architects]], [[designers]], and [[Construction worker|builders]] operating within the fields of [[architecture]], [[urbanism]], [[research]] and [[Land development|development]]. The office is currently involved in a large number of projects throughout [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]]. As of 2016, the office has over 400 employees from 25 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://big.dk/#contact |title=BIG {{!}} Bjarke Ingels Group|website=big.dk|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Bjarke Ingels]] and [[Julien De Smedt]] established PLOT in Copenhagen in January 2001, as a focus for their architectural practice. Ingels established BIG in late 2005 after he and De Smedt closed down PLOT.  This drew acclaim for its first completed commission, the Mountain, a residential project in Copenhagen which had been started by PLOT. Over the next couple of years, BIG's projects included a [[Amager Bakke|waste-to-energy plant which doubles as a ski-slope]] in Copenhagen, Denmark; the West 57th Street mixed-use tower in midtown Manhattan for Durst Fetner Residential; the National Art Gallery of Greenland in Nuuk; the headquarters for the Shenzhen Energy Company in [[Shenzhen, China|Shenzhen]]; and the [[Kimball Art Center]] in [[Utah (state)|Utah]].

In December 2009, the company's partnership was expanded to include Thomas Christoffersen, Jakob Lange, Finn Nørkjaer, Andreas Klok Pedersen, David Zahle, CEO Sheela Maini Søgaard, and Kai-Uwe Bergmann.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/091210big.asp |title=Young Danes Think Big|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, they opened a branch office in [[New York City]], where they were commissioned to design the W57 courtscraper for Durst Fetner Residential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=15828 |title=NYC design with a twist|publisher=World Architecture News|accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, BIG added four new partners: Beat Schenk and Daniel Sundlin in New York and Brian Yang and Jakob Sand in Copenhagen.

In May 2016, BIG partnered with [[Hyperloop One]], [[Deutsche Bahn]], and [[SYSTRA]] to develop a test of the high-speed, low friction [[Hyperloop]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://gizmodo.com/heres-what-tomorrows-first-full-scale-test-of-the-hyper-1775857086 |title=Here's What the First Full-Scale Test of the Hyperloop Will Look Like [Updated]|author=Alissa Walker|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BIG IDEAS Lab ===
Launched in 2014, the division is part R&amp;D lab, part incubator for BIG design concepts that can be spun off into independent products or companies.

The lab was founded to build the steam-ring generator for the [[Amager Bakke]] - the Copenhagen power plant with a ski slope on its roof - which will "puff" every time it emits a tonne of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/107682946&lt;/ref&gt; It is now working on numerous BIG collaborations and spin-off projects, including a smart internet-connected lock named Friday,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fridaylock.com&lt;/ref&gt; "a company that creates water from super-efficient dehumidification", and Urban Rigger&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urbanrigger.com/&lt;/ref&gt; - floating student housing for coastal cities built from repurposed shipping containers. The first are scheduled to be built in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/architect-bjarke-ingels&lt;/ref&gt;

Other projects include Fingerprint Façade,&lt;ref&gt;http://big.dk/#projects-hum&lt;/ref&gt; Window Garden, and a gigantic Tesla coil for the Battersea Power Station in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archdaily.com/780533/jakob-lange-on-founding-big-ideas-and-the-diverse-future-of-architectural-practice&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3322">The '''Cambridge Ritualists''' were a recognised group of [[classical scholar]]s, mostly in [[Cambridge]], England, including [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], [[F.M. Cornford]], [[Gilbert Murray]] (actually from the [[University of Oxford]]), [[A. B. Cook]], and others. They earned this title because of their shared interest in [[ritual]], specifically their attempts to explain [[mythology|myth]] and early forms of [[classical drama]] as [[myth and ritual|originating in ritual]], mainly the ritual seasonal killings of ''eniautos daimon'', or the [[Year-King]].&lt;ref&gt;R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also sometimes referred to as the '''myth and ritual school''', or as the [[Classical Anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/2152/24%282%29%2090-92.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Folklore Forum|last=|first=|date=|website=scholarworks.iu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacrifice and drama==
Inspired by ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', Gilbert Murray in 1913 proclaimed the killing of the year spirit as the "orthodox view of the origins of tragedy.  The year Daimon waxes proud and is slain by his enemy, who becomes thereby a murderer, and must in turn perish".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, however, the excessively rigid application of Frazer's thesis to Greek tragedy had already begun to be challenged;&lt;ref&gt;R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Sixties [[Robert Fagles]] could state that "The ritual origins of tragedy are totally in doubt, often hotly debated".&lt;ref&gt;R Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

Through their work in classical [[philology]], they exerted profound influence not only on the Classics, but on literary critics, such as [[Stanley Edgar Hyman]] or [[Northrop Frye]].&lt;ref&gt;N Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 108-9 and p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly affected by [[Émile Durkheim]] was [[F. M. Cornford]], who used the French sociologist's notion of collective representations to analyze social forms of religious, artistic, philosophical, and scientific expression in [[classical Greece]]. Other significant influences on the group were [[Charles Darwin]], [[Freud]], [[James Frazer]], and [[William Robertson Smith]].

'''Carrère and Hastings''', the firm of John Merven Carrère (November 9, 1858 – March 1, 1911) and [[Thomas Hastings (architect)|Thomas Hastings]] (March 11, 1860 – October 22, 1929), was one of the outstanding [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[list of architecture firms|architecture firms]] in the United States. It was located in New York City. The partnership operated from 1885 until 1911, when Carrère was killed in an automobile accident. Thomas Hastings continued on his own, using the same firm name, until his death in 1929.

Both men studied at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in [[France]] and worked at the firm of [[McKim, Mead, and White]] before they established their firm in the same building. The partnership's first success was the [[Ponce de León Hotel]] in St. Augustine, Florida, which they designed for [[Henry Flagler]]. They went on to establish a successful practice during the 1880s and early 1890s, and rose to national prominence by winning the competition for the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]] in 1897. The firm designed commercial buildings, elaborate residences, and prominent public buildings in New York, Washington and as far afield as Toronto, London, Paris, Rome, and Havana.

== Carrère ==
[[File:Pan-American Exposition - The Triumphal Bridge.jpg|thumb|Carrère was Chairman of the Board of Architects for the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]], and designed the Triumphal Bridge and the landscape features throughout the fairgrounds]]
'''John Merven Carrère''' was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, the son of John Merven Carrère, a Baltimore native and Anna Louisa Maxwell, a Scots/Brazilian native of Rio who was the daughter of Joseph Maxwell, a prosperous coffee trader. The architect's father entered Maxwell's coffee business and later developed other business interests of his own in Brazil. As a boy Carrère was sent to Switzerland for his education until 1880, when he entered the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where he was in the atelier of Leon Ginian until 1882. He returned to New York where his family had resettled after leaving Brazil and worked as draughtsmen for the architectural firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]]. He and his Paris acquaintance, Thomas Hastings, worked there together before striking out on their own in 1885. During this period Carrère independently designed several circular panorama buildings in New York and Chicago. After he married Marion Dell in 1886 they lived in Staten Island and had three daughters, one of whom died as an infant. In 1901 they moved to East 65th Street in Manhattan, and built a country house in Harrison, New York.

Carrère was noted for his generous enthusiasm and his unflinching honesty. His organizational skill, artistic judgment, and energy were essential to the establishment and success of the Carrère and Hastings firm. He was most active in the firm's large civic and commercial projects, including the House and Senate office buildings on Capitol Hill, the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and its approaches, and the [[New York Public Library]]. He was interested in civic affairs in New York, where, with the help of [[Elihu Root]], he was instrumental in establishing the [[Art Commission of New York City]]. Later his public service extended to the national arena. In the 1890s he worked with other leaders of the [[American Institute of Architects]] to persuade the US Treasury Department to implement the [[McKinley Monument#Tarsney Act|Tarsney Act]], which had been passed by Congress in 1893 to allow the federal government to award architectural commissions for its buildings through open design competitions. During the extended Tarsney controversy [[Jeremiah O'Rourke]], the Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department resigned, and Carrère was offered his job, an offer which he very publicly considered, but ultimately declined, writing, "the system, not the man, should be changed." 
[[File:John M Carrere architect.jpeg|thumb|left|175px|John Merven Carrère]]
Carrère was engaged in the development of city planning in the United States. He wrote pamphlets and lectured at universities and to civic groups on the subject. He collaborated with [[Daniel H. Burnham]] and [[Arnold Brunner]] on the [[Group Plan]] for [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (1903), and again with Brunner on a plan for [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] (1909). Then, in 1910, he worked with Brunner and [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] on a plan for a Baltimore civic center (1910). In 1908, Carrère was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1910. Later, Carrère and Hastings produced a plan for the City of [[Hartford, Connecticut]], which was completed in 1911, just prior to his tragic, early death, which occurred when a streetcar collided with the taxi in which he was riding. He suffered a brain concussion and never regained consciousness.

== Hastings ==
'''Thomas S. Hastings''' was born in New York City on March 11, 1860. His father, also Thomas S. Hastings (1827–1911), was a noted Presbyterian minister, homiletics professor, and dean of the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. His grandfather, Thomas Samuel Hastings (1784–1872), was one of America's leading church musicians of the 19th century: he composed hymns, including '[[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|Rock of Ages]],' and published the first musical treatise by a native-born composer in 1822. Hastings was educated in private schools in New York, and began his architectural apprenticeship at [[Herter Brothers]], the premier New York furnishers and decorators. He attended the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1880–1883 as a student in the atelier of [[Louis-Jules André]].  There he met his future partner, and both maintained ties to Europe throughout their lives (Hastings earning the French Legion of Honor as well as the Gold Medal of the RIBA). 
[[File:Carrere and Hastings workshop1.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Architects at work at Carrère and Hastings studio, 1905, with a model of the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]], designed by the firm, behind them]]
Upon returning to New York, Hastings entered the office of McKim, Mead &amp; White, the leading American firm of the [[American Renaissance]]. Renewing his friendship with Carrère, who was also in the office, he remained there for two years. A referral through his father to [[Henry Morrison Flagler]] resulted in the commission first for a library extension to Flagler's Mamaroneck estate and then for the [[Ponce de Leon Hotel|Ponce de Leon]] and later Alcazar hotels in St. Augustine, Florida. Further ties to wealthy patrons, who were also members of his father's mid-town congregation, propelled the rapid success of the young architects. His brother Frank's ties to E. C. Benedict, a leading financier, introduced him not only to patrons but also to his future wife. In 1900, at the age of 40, he married Benedict's daughter Helen at the Presbyterian church in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. The ceremony was attended by many of New York's wealthy citizens. [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles F. McKim]] was the best man, [[Stanford White]] designed the church decorations, and White's son was a page.

Hastings is credited with many of the firm's designs and, in part because he survived Carrère by eighteen years, he is the often cited as the leader of the firm. He lectured widely and wrote a number of influential articles, later collected by David Gray in his brief biography of the architect.&lt;ref&gt;David Gray, ''Thomas Hastings, architect: collected writings, with a short biography'' (Boston, Houghton Mifflin), 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife enjoyed riding, and they built a country house in [[Old Westbury, New York|Old Westbury, Long Island]]. Following Carrère's death in 1911, Hastings maintained the firm's name and continued his role as principal in the firm, but shared responsibility in large commissions with trusted associates such as [[Richmond Shreve]], Theodore Blake and others. Owen Brainard, an engineer, was a junior partner in the firm during Carrère's lifetime and continued to consult with the firm thereafter. Eventually this collaborative arrangement would result in the formation of [[Shreve, Lamb and Blake]] (later Shreve, Lamb and Harmon), the noted builders of skyscrapers.

Hastings died of complications of an [[appendectomy]] on October 23, 1929. Some of his papers were given to the American Academy of Arts &amp; Letters, where he was a member and treasurer for many years. He was survived by his wife but left no heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Lemos, Morrison, Warren, ''Carrère and Hastings Architects.'' (New York, Acanthus Press: 2006): 1–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collaboration and beyond ==
[[File:Flagler College - Detail of Ponce de Leon Hotel.JPG|thumb|250px|Detail of the [[Ponce de Leon Hotel]], 1885–88 (now Flagler College)]]
The firm's first major commission came from a parishioner of Rev. Hastings, Henry Morrison Flagler, the Florida developer and railway tycoon, for whom the partners built the [[Ponce de León Hotel]] (1885–1888) in [[St. Augustine, Florida]] (now part of [[Flagler College]]). This was followed by the Alcazar Hotel (1887–88 now the [[Lightner Museum]]), as well as the Flagler [[Memorial Presbyterian Church]] (1887), both in St. Augustine, and a house for Henry Flagler nearby. In 1901 they designed a second house for Flagler, [[Flagler Museum|Whitehall]], in the resort he developed, [[Palm Beach, Florida]]. Whitehall was completed in 1902.  Whitehall is a Mediterranean-flavored house faced with white stucco, with palatial interiors in various styles ranged round a grand entrance hall with double staircase.

Carrère and Hastings were among the best-connected New York architects, and benefited from associations with the richest and most powerful of the city's citizens. Clients included [[Elihu Root]], the noted attorney and cabinet secretary under Theodore Roosevelt, [[Edward Harriman|Edward H. Harriman]], the railroad tycoon, [[Thomas Fortune Ryan]], one of Wall Street's notorious capitalists, and several members of the Blair family of New Jersey. The early work of the firm was eclectic but always succinctly organized, an inheritance of their École des Beaux-Arts training. Following the [[World Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, and its influential classical themes, the firm's style began to exhibit modern French and Renaissance revival attributes. The attention to sculpture and surface embellishment in their work was always closely tied to the axial planning that ensured the functionality of the interior spaces and circulation. They were among the earliest users of new technologies, from structural steel to electrification, even employing passive air conditioning systems. But their major interest was in the adaptation of the classical language of architecture developed in Europe to the American scene, creating a modern American architecture out of centuries-old traditions.

One of the largest contributions of the firm was in the realm of urban design, a result of Carrère's abiding interest in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] "[[City Beautiful]]" movement. An early advocate of comprehensive planning, he designed downtown plans for Baltimore, Hartford, Cleveland and Atlantic City. In collaboration with Hastings, he was largely responsible for carrying out the firm's major public commissions: the New York Public Library (1897–1912), the [[Cannon House Office Building|House]] and [[Russell Senate Office Building|Senate Office Buildings]] in Washington (1908–09), the planning of the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in Buffalo (1901), the [[McKinley Monument|McKinnley Memorial]] in Buffalo, [[Staten Island Borough Hall|Richmond Borough Hall]] on Staten Island (1904–06), and the Paterson (New Jersey) City Hall (1896). 
[[File:Bust Thomas Hastings architect.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Bust of [[Thomas Hastings (architect)|Thomas Hastings]], [[New York Public Library]]]]
[[Image:Bellefontaine, Lenox, MA.jpg|thumb|''Bellefontaine'' in 1912]]he architects were also noted for their contributions to the country house and garden movement of the early 1900s, where they introduced both stylistic and compositional ideas that shaped domestic architecture for decades to come. Their garden designs were extensively published, and they created a comprehensive staff to handle interior design in large houses, one of the first offices to offer these services. Their largest and most notable country houses included [[Blairsden (house)|Blairsden]] (1898) in [[Peapack, New Jersey]], [[Bellefontaine (Lenox, Massachusetts)|Bellefontaine]] (1897, altered) in Lenox, Massachusetts, [[Arden House|Arden]] (1905–09) in [[Harriman, New York]], and [[Nemours Mansion and Gardens|Nemours]] (1910) in Wilmington, Delaware.

The office's significant [[skyscraper]]s were not designed until the late 1910s and early 1920s when, in association with other architects, Hastings' office worked on the [[Cunard Building (New York City)|Cunard Building]] (1917–21) and the [[26 Broadway|Standard Oil Building]] (1920–28), which stand across the street from each other on Broadway at Bowling Green. Hastings was a critic of tall buildings in cities, warning that buildings over six stories (the height of Parisian [[Hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]) produced alienation by removing references to human scale, and destroyed the urban streetscape.

Changing styles and the rise of [[International style (architecture)|International Modernism]] led architectural historians to neglect the work of Carrère and Hastings for half a century after the firm closed. Today the firm is recognized as one of the most important in the U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their contributions to civic design and classicism are of continued importance today.

'''''Country Justice''''' (also known as '''''Family Rescue''''') is a 1997 American [[Television movie|made for TV]] crime drama film.

==Plot==
Emma ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]) is a 15-year-old girl who was raised in a [[West Virginia]] mining town by her miner grandfather, Clayton Hayes ([[George C. Scott]]). She wants to know about her mother Angie Baker ([[Ally Sheedy]]), who abandoned her when she was a baby. She decides to go visit her mother in [[Tennessee]] despite her grandfather's insistence against it, leaving him a note. 

When she arrives at the trailer where her mother lives, she is greeted by her mother's partner Ray Wilcox ([[Don Diamont]]) who is attracted to her the minute he meets her. He keeps complimenting her using [[superficial charm]] until one night she goes out to dinner with him. He gives her too much [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] before taking her to an abandoned trailer on the same lot that her mother Angie and Ray live on and [[rapes]] her.

After the rape, Emma returns home to her grandfather, who threatens to murder Ray, only barely being talked out of it by Emma. Emma soon finds out that she is pregnant and after some contemplation, she decides to keep the baby. However, Ray begins [[stalking]] her, which in turn causes her to go into [[Childbirth|labor]] and she gives birth to a son named Matthew Baker. Ray sues for sole custody of their son, easily winning the case due to his age and financial income, but Clayton kidnaps the baby.

After becoming a fugitive, the police arrive at Emma's house along with Ray to get the baby. Emma tells them she doesn't have the baby and after persistent questioning and threats from Ray, they leave. Clayton is assisted by various friends while on the run, including a minister.

Clayton is forced to come out of hiding and seek a hospital when the baby's health starts to decline causing him to stop breathing. He is eventually found and Emma wins the custody fight on appeal and Clayton is granted [[Child custody|custody]] of the baby. Ray comes back and tries to talk to Angie, but Clayton sends him away. At the end of the movie Angie, Clayton, and Emma wind up living together and taking care of Matthew and Emma still going to school, able to maintain a scarred but peaceful life as a teenager and mother.

[[File:Fairy ring on a suburban lawn 100 1851.jpg|thumb|A fairy ring (possibly ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'') on a suburban lawn in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]]]

A '''fairy ring''', also known as '''fairy circle''', '''elf circle''', '''elf ring'''&lt;ref&gt;'Chambers's Edinburgh journal, Volume 9'' by William Chambers, Robert Chamber, W. Orr, 1841, Page. 55&lt;/ref&gt; or '''pixie ring''', is a naturally occurring ring or arc of [[mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name=WIF&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Fungus?|website=Australian National Botanic Gardens|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/fungi/what-is-fungus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rings may grow to over {{convert|10|m}} in diameter, and they become stable over time as the fungus grows and seeks food underground. They are found mainly in [[forest]]ed areas, but also appear in [[grassland]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Fairy Ring |volume=10 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rangelands. Fairy rings are detectable by [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarp]]s (fungal spore pods) in rings or arcs, as well as by a necrotic zone (dead grass), or a ring of dark green grass. Fungus [[mycelium]] is present in the ring or arc underneath.

[[Fairy]] rings are the subject of much [[folklore]] and myth worldwide—particularly in Western Europe. While they are often seen as hazardous or dangerous places, they can sometimes be linked with good fortune.

==Genesis==
The [[mycelium]] of a [[fungus]] growing in the ground absorbs nutrients by secretion of [[enzyme]]s from the tips of the [[hyphae]] (threads making up the mycelium).&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt; This breaks down larger molecules in the soil into smaller molecules that are then absorbed through the walls of the hyphae near their growing tips.&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt; The mycelium will move outward from the center, and when the nutrients in the center are exhausted, the center dies, thereby forming a living ring, from which the fairy ring arises.&lt;ref name=WIF/&gt;

There are two theories regarding the process involved in creating fairy rings. One states that the fairy ring is begun by a [[spore]] from the sporocarpus. The underground presence of the fungus can also cause withering or varying colour or growth of the grass above. The second theory, which is presented in the investigations of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] scientists on the ''[[Tricholoma matsutake]]'' species, shows that fairy rings could be established by connecting neighbouring oval [[Genet (biology)|genet]]s of these mushrooms. If they make an arc or a ring, they continuously grow about the centre of this object.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Necrotic or rapid growth zones==
[[File:FairyRingSchoolField.jpg|thumb|Two fairy rings marked by uneven grass growth (small one in foreground, much bigger one in background). The lush green arcs of grass betray the presence of underground fungal [[mycelium|mycelia]].]]
[[File:Hexenring auf einer Wiese, Sperrberg, Niedergailbach.JPG|thumb|Fairy ring on a meadow]]
One of the manifestations of fairy ring growth is a necrotic zone—an area in which grass or other plant life has withered or died. These zones are caused by the mycelia which, during a very dry year, coat the roots of grasses and other herbs in [[meadow]]s. After some time they are removed by [[biotic factor]]s from the ground, at which stage a zone on the surface soil becomes visible. Patterns other than the basic ring or arc are also possible: circles, doubled arcs, sickle-shaped arcs, and other complicated formations are also formed by this process.  Fungi can deplete the soil of readily available nutrients such as [[nitrogen]], causing plants growing within the circle to be stressed which leads to plant discoloration.  Some fungi also produce chemicals which act like [[plant hormone|hormones]] called [[gibberellin]]s, which affect plant growth, causing rapid luxuriant growth.

Long-term observations of fairy rings on [[Bell Hill, Dorset|Shillingstone Hill]] in Dorset, England, further suggested that the cycle depended on the continuous presence of rabbits. Chalky soils on higher elevations in the counties of Wiltshire and Dorset in southern England used to support many meadow-type fairy rings. Rabbits crop grass very short in open areas and produce nitrogen-rich droppings. Mushrooms need more soil nitrogen than grass does. A ring can start from only a few spores from which the mycelium develops; the fruiting bodies of the mushrooms only appearing later, when sufficient mycelial mass has been generated to support them. Subsequent generations of fungi grow only outwards, because the parent generations have depleted their local nitrogen levels. Meanwhile, rabbits keep cropping the grass, but do not eat the fungi, allowing them to grow through their competition to tower, relatively, above the grass. By the time a circle of mushrooms reaches about {{convert|6|m}} in diameter, rabbit droppings have replenished the nitrogen levels near the centre of the circle, and a secondary ring may start to grow inside the first. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Soil analysis of soil containing mycelium from a wood blewit (''[[Clitocybe nuda]]'') fairy ring under Norway spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'') and Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'') in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen [[Halogenation|halogenated]] low molecular weight organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi.&lt;ref name=hjelm96/&gt;

== Types ==
There are two generally recognised types of fairy ring fungus. Those found in the woods are called ''tethered'', because they are formed by [[mycorrhizal]] fungi living in [[symbiosis]] with trees. Meadow fairy rings are called ''free'', because they are not connected with other organisms. These mushrooms are [[saprotrophic]].
The effects on the grass depend on the type of fungus that is growing; when ''[[Calvatia cyathiformis]]'' is growing in the area grass will grow more abundantly; however, ''[[Leucopaxillus giganteus]]'' will cause the grass to wither.&lt;ref&gt;Böttcher, Helmuth M. ''Miracle Drugs'' William Henemann Ltd. London 1963 p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 60 mushroom species which can grow in the fairy ring pattern.&lt;ref name=Kirk2008/&gt; The best known is the edible Scotch bonnet (''[[Marasmius oreades]]''), commonly known as the fairy ring champignon.

One of the largest rings ever found is near [[Belfort]] in France.  Formed by ''[[Infundibulicybe geotropa]]'', it is thought to be about {{convert|600|m}} in diameter and over 700&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref name=gregory82&gt;{{cite journal | author=

[[File:Plucked from the Fairy Circle.png|thumb|"Plucked from the Fairy Circle"&lt;br /&gt;A man saves his friend from the grip of a fairy ring]]
A great deal of folklore surrounds fairy rings.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} Their names in European languages often allude to supernatural origins; they are known as ''ronds de sorcières'' ("witches' circles") in French, and ''Hexenringe'' ("witches' rings") in German.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=13}} In German tradition, fairy rings were thought to mark the site of witches' dancing on [[Walpurgis Night]],{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} and Dutch superstition claimed that the circles show where the [[Devil]] set his milk churn. In [[State of Tyrol|Tyrol]], folklore attributed fairy rings to the fiery tails of flying dragons; once a dragon had created such a circle, nothing but toadstools could grow there for seven years. European superstitions routinely warned against entering a fairy ring. French tradition reported that fairy rings were guarded by giant bug-eyed toads that cursed those who violated the circles. In other parts of Europe, entering a fairy ring would result in the loss of an eye.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=13}} Fairy rings are associated with diminutive spirits in the [[Philippines]].{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=12}}

[[Western Europe]]an traditions, including English, Scandinavian and Celtic, claimed that fairy rings are the result of [[elf|elves]] or [[fairy|fairies]] dancing. Such ideas dated to at least the mediæval period; The [[Middle English]] term ''elferingewort'' ("elf-ring"), meaning "a ring of daisies caused by elves' dancing" dates to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''History of the Goths'' (1628), [[Olaus Magnus]] makes this connection, saying that fairy rings are burned into the ground by the dancing of elves.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} British folklorist [[Thomas Keightley (historian)|Thomas Keightley]] noted that in Scandinavia in the early 20th century, beliefs persisted that fairy rings (''elfdans'') arose from the dancing of elves. Keightley warned that while entering an ''elfdans'' might allow the interloper to see the elves—although this was not guaranteed—it would also put the intruder in thrall to their illusions.{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=81}}&lt;ref&gt;The term for ''fairy ring'' in modern Norwegian is ''alvedans''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fairy ring on Iceland.jpg|thumb|Fairy rings in moss in Iceland]]
The [[folklore]]s of  [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] contain a wealth of fairy lore, including the idea from which fairy rings take their name: the phenomena result from the dancing of fairies.&lt;ref name="Ripley and Dana 402"&gt;Ripley and Dana 402.&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th-century Wales, where the rings are known as ''cylch y Tylwyth Teg'', fairies were almost invariably described as dancing in a group when encountered,&lt;ref name="Sikes 70"&gt;Sikes 70.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Scotland and Wales in the late 20th century, stories about fairy rings were still common;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyndaf 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bennett 110"&gt;Bennett 110.&lt;/ref&gt; some Welshmen even claimed to have joined a fairy dance.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"&gt;Gwyndaf 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian folklorists regarded fairies and witches as related, based in part on the idea that both were believed to dance in circles.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 175.&lt;/ref&gt; These revels are particularly associated with moonlit nights, the rings only becoming visible to mortals the following morning.{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=297}}&lt;ref&gt;McPherson 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Local variants add other details. An early 20th-century Irish tradition says that fairies enjoy dancing around the [[Crataegus|hawthorn tree]] so that fairy rings often centre on one.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde 39.&lt;/ref&gt; One resident of [[Balquhidder]], Scotland, said that the fairies sit on the mushrooms and use them as dinnertables,&lt;ref name="Bennett 110"/&gt; and a Welsh woman claimed that fairies used the mushrooms as parasols and umbrellas.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt; [[Olaus Magnus]] in ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'' wrote that the brightness of the fairy ring comes not from the dancing of the fairies, who harm it with their feet, but from [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]], who refreshes the grass.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hazlitt 230.&lt;/ref&gt; A Devon legend says that a black hen and chickens sometimes appear at dusk in a large fairy ring on the edge of [[Dartmoor]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxhead, J. R. W., ''The Devil in Devon'', p. 39-40. Quoted in Briggs 328.&lt;/ref&gt; A Welsh and Manx variant current in the 1960s removes dancing from the picture and claims that fairy rings spring up over an underground fairy village.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"&gt;Radford and Radford 157.&lt;/ref&gt; These associations have become linked to specific sites. For example, "The Pixies' Church" was a rock formation in Dartmoor surrounded by a fairy ring,&lt;ref&gt;Bray 149.&lt;/ref&gt; and a stone circle tops [[Cader Idris]] in northern Wales, believed to be a popular spot for fairy dances. Guernsey Fairy Ring is also a popular spot for fairie dancing and known for having evil fairies living there.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels and Stevens 1300.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many folk beliefs generally paint fairy rings as dangerous places, best avoided.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cielo 73"&gt;Cielo 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Sikes traces these stories of people trespassing into forbidden territory and being punished for it to the tale of [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche and Eros]]. In it, Psyche is forbidden to view her lover, and when she does so, her palace disappears and she is left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Sikes 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Superstition calls fairy circles sacred and warns against violating them lest the interloper (such as a farmer with a plough) anger the fairies and be [[curse]]d.&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheviot 398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bray 150.&lt;/ref&gt; In an Irish legend recorded by [[Lady Wilde|Wilde]], a farmer builds a barn on a fairy ring despite the protests of his neighbours. He is struck senseless one night, and a local "fairy doctor" breaks the curse. The farmer says that he dreamed that he must destroy the barn.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Even collecting dew from the grass or flowers of a fairy ring can bring bad luck. Destroying a fairy ring is unlucky and fruitless; superstition says it will just grow back.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt;

A traditional Scottish rhyme sums up the danger of such places:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;He wha tills the fairies' green
Nae luck again shall hae :
And he wha spills the fairies' ring
Betide him want and wae.
For weirdless days and weary nights
Are his till his deein' day.
But he wha gaes by the fairy ring,
Nae dule nor pine shall see,
And he wha cleans the fairy ring
An easy death shall dee.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Popular Rhymes'', 324; quoted in McPherson 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Numerous legends focus on mortals entering a fairy ring—and the consequences. One superstition is that anyone who steps into an empty fairy ring will die at a young age.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"&gt;Franklin 87.&lt;/ref&gt; A 20th-century tradition from [[Somerset]] calls the fairy ring a "galley-trap" and says that a murderer or thief who walks in the ring will be hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs and Tongue 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, someone who violates a fairy perimeter becomes invisible to mortals outside and may find it impossible to leave the circle. Often, the fairies force the mortal to dance to the point of exhaustion, death, or madness.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sikes 71.&lt;/ref&gt; In Welsh tales, fairies actively try to lure mortals into their circles to dance with them.&lt;ref name="Sikes 70"/&gt; A tale from the [[Cambrian Mountains]] of Wales, current in the 19th century, describes a mortal's encounter with a fairy ring:

{{quote|... he saw the Tylwyth Teg, in appearance like tiny soldiers, dancing in a ring. He set out for the scene of revelry, and soon drew near the ring where, in a gay company of males and females, they were footing it to the music of the harp. Never had he seen such handsome people, nor any so enchantingly cheerful. They beckoned him with laughing faces to join them as they leaned backward almost falling, whirling round and round with joined hands. Those who were dancing never swerved from the perfect circle; but some were clambering over the old cromlech, and others chasing each other with surprising swiftness and the greatest glee. Still others rode about on small white horses of the most beautiful form&amp;nbsp;... All this was in silence, for the shepherd could not hear the harps, though he saw them. But now he drew nearer to the circle, and finally ventured to put his foot in the magic ring. The instant he did this, his ears were charmed with strains of the most melodious music he had ever heard.&lt;ref&gt;Howells, W. (1831). ''Cambrian Superstitions'', p. 148; translated in Sikes 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Entering the ring on [[May Eve]] or [[Halloween]] night was especially dangerous.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt; One source near Afon fach Blaen y Cae, a tributary of the Dwyfach, tells of a shepherd accidentally disturbing a ring of rushes where fairies are preparing to dance; they capture him and hold him captive, and he even marries one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In variants from Scotland recorded by [[Edwin Sidney Hartland]] in 1891, the ring is replaced by a cavern or an old mill.&lt;ref&gt;Hartland 165-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom from a fairy ring often requires outside intervention. A tactic from early 20th-century Wales is to cast wild [[marjoram]] and [[thyme]] into the circle and befuddle the fairies;&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan and Hartland 97.&lt;/ref&gt; another asks the rescuer to touch the victim with iron.&lt;ref name="Hartland 163"&gt;Hartland 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories require that the enchanted victim simply be plucked out by someone on the outside,&lt;ref name="Sikes 75"&gt;Sikes 75.&lt;/ref&gt; although even this can be difficult: A farmer in a tale from the [[Llangollen]] region has to tie a rope around himself and enlist four men to pull him from the circle as he goes in to save his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Other folk methods rely on Christian faith to break the enchantment: a stick from a [[rowan]] tree (thought to be the wood from which the cross of [[Jesus Christ]] was built) can break the curse,&lt;ref name="Gwyndaf 163"/&gt; as can a simple phrase such as "what, in Heaven's name", as in a 19th-century tale from [[Carmarthenshire]].&lt;ref name="Sikes 72"&gt;Sikes 72.&lt;/ref&gt; A common element to these recoveries is that the rescuer must wait a year and a day from when the victim entered the ring.&lt;ref name="Hartland 163"/&gt;

Mortals who have danced with the fairies are rarely safe after being saved from their enthrallment. Often, they find that what seemed to be but a brief foray into fairyland was indeed much longer in the mortal realm, possibly weeks or years.&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartland 166-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The person rescued from the fairy ring may have no memory of their encounter with the sprites, as in a story from Anglesea recorded in 1891.&lt;ref name="Hartland 164"&gt;Hartland 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In most tales, the saved interlopers face a grim fate. For example, in a legend from [[Carmarthenshire]], recorded by Sikes, a man is rescued from a fairy ring only to crumble to dust.&lt;ref name="Sikes 72"/&gt; In a tale from Mathavarn, Llanwrin Parish, a fairy-ring survivor moulders away when he eats his first bite of food.&lt;ref name="Sikes 75"/&gt; Another vulnerability seems to be iron; in a tale from the [[Aberystwyth]] region, a touch from the metal causes a rescued woman to disappear.&lt;ref name="Hartland 164"/&gt;

Some legends assert that the only safe way to investigate a fairy ring is to run around it nine times. This affords the ability to hear the fairies dancing and frolicking underground.&lt;ref name="Cielo 73"/&gt; According to a 20th-century tradition of [[Northumberland]], this must be done under a full moon, and the runner must travel in the direction of the sun; to go [[widdershins]] allows the fairies to place the runner under their sway. To circle the ring a tenth time is foolhardy and dangerous.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R 157"/&gt; Keightley recorded a similar tradition from [[Northumberland]] in 1905: "The children constantly run this number [nine times], but nothing will induce them to venture a tenth run."{{sfn|Keightley|1905|p=310}} A story from early 20th century England says that a mortal can see the sprites without fear if a friend places a foot on that of the person stepping beyond the circle's perimeter.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels and Stevens 1406.&lt;/ref&gt; Another superstition says that wearing a hat backwards can confuse the fairies and prevent them from pulling the wearer into their ring.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they have strong associations with doom, some legends paint fairy circles as places of fertility and fortune. Welsh folk belief is that mountain sheep that eat the grass of a fairy ring flourish, and that crops sown from such a place will prove more bountiful than those from normal land.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}} A folk belief recorded in the ''Athenian Oracle'' claims that a house built on a fairy circle will bring prosperity to its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a legend from Pont y Wern says that in the 13th or 14th century, the inhabitants of the town of Corwrion watched fairies dancing in a ring around a [[glow worm]] every Sunday after church at a place called Pen y Bonc. They even joined the sprites in their revels. The legend survives in a rhyme: "With the fairies nimbly dancing round / The glow-worm on the Rising Ground."&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A Welsh tale recorded by Rhys in 1901 tells of a man who supposedly lived on the side of the [[Berwyn range|Berwyn]], above Cwm Pennant, in the early 19th century. The man destroyed a nest of [[rook (bird)|rook]]s in a tree surrounded by a fairy ring. In gratitude, the fairies gave him a half crown every day but stopped when he told his friends, "for he had broken the rule of the fair folks by making their liberality known".&lt;ref&gt;Rhys 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, fairy boons are not without their curses, and tales often tell of the sprites exacting their revenge.{{sfn|Morgan|1995|p=30}}

=== Literature ===
[[File:Rackham fairy ring.jpg|thumb|"Come, now a roundel." One of [[Arthur Rackham]]'s illustrations to Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.]]
Fairy rings have featured in the works of European authors, playwrights, and artists since the 13th century. In his [[Arthurian romance]] ''Meraugis de Portlesguez'', [[Raoul de Houdenc]] describes a scene clearly derived from Celtic fairy-ring lore: The title character visits the Château des Caroles and sees a circle of women and a knight dancing around a pine in the castle courtyard. Meraugis is unable to fight the intense desire to join in, thus freeing the previous knight from the spell. Meraugis is helpless to leave the dance until, ten weeks later, another knight joins it and frees him.&lt;ref&gt;Paton 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairy circles feature in works by several [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] poets and playwrights. [[William Shakespeare]] alludes to them in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Act II, Scene I&lt;ref name="Franklin 87"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 230"&gt;Hazlitt 230.&lt;/ref&gt; ("And I serve the fairy queen, / To dew her orbs upon the green" and "To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind"),&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Act II, Scene I.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Tempest]]'', Act V, Scene I:&lt;ref name="Ripley and Dana 402"/&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;... you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''The Tempest'', Act V, Scene I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Shakespeare's contemporary [[Thomas Randolph (poet)|Thomas Randolph]] speaks of fairy rings in his ''Amyntas, or the Impossible Dowry'' (1638), and [[Michael Drayton]] describes one in ''Nymphidia: The Court of Fairy'':&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 230"/&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And in their courses make that round
In meadows and in marshes found,
Of them so called the Fairy Ground,
{{in5|3}}Of which they have the keeping.&lt;ref&gt;Drayton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Fairy imagery became especially popular in the [[Victorian era]]. [[Thomas Hardy]] uses a fairy ring as a symbol of lost love in ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886); the character Michael Henchard passes a fairy ring and remembers that he last saw his wife Susan there when he sold her to a sailor in a drunken rage.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian poets who have referred to fairy rings in their works include [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Eliza Cook]], [[Robert Stephen Hawker]], [[Felicia Hemans]], [[Gerald Massey]], and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;See Browning, "The Deserted Garden"; Cook, "'Don't You Remember?'"; Hawker, "The Fairy Vision" and "Chorus of Fairies"; Hemans, "Canto III"; Massey, "Love's Fairy-ring"; and Tennyson, "Guinevere".&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. H. Cummings]] composed the cantata ''The Fairy Ring'', and [[William Butler Yeats]] wrote of them in ''[[The Land of Heart's Desire]]'' (1894).&lt;ref&gt;Skelton 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
Fairy circles have appeared in European artwork since at least the 18th century. For example, [[William Blake]] painted ''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'', depicting a scene from Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', around 1785,&lt;ref&gt;Silver 26.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daniel Maclise]] painted ''Faun and the Fairies'' around 1834. Images of fairies dancing in circles became a favourite trope of [[fairy painting|painters]] in the Victorian period. On the one hand, artists were genuinely interested in the culture such imagery represented, and on the other, fairies could be depicted as titillating nudes and semi-nudes without offending [[Victorian morality|Victorian mores]], which made them a popular subject of art collectors. Examples of Victorian fairy-ring paintings include ''Come unto these Yellow Sands'' (1842) by [[Richard Dadd]] and ''Reconciliation of Titania and Oberon'' (1847) by [[Joseph Noel Paton]].&lt;ref&gt;Silver 230, note 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garghabazar caravanserai''' ({{lang-az|Qarğabazar karvansarayı}}) is a historic monument of XVII century. It is located in [[Qarğabazar, Fuzuli|Garghabazar village]], of [[Fuzuli District]], in [[Azerbaijan]].

==History==
The caravanserai was built in 1681 on a hill. It is known as Garghabazar caravanserai as it was built in Garghabazar village. The historic monument is sometimes referred as Shah Abbas caravansary. The architect of the monument is unknown, since inscription on the caravanserai is destroyed.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Qarğabazar karvansarayı (Füzuli)|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/museum/8ed5c332d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the occupation of Garghabazar village, the monument was ruined by Armenian forces.&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"&gt;{{cite web|title= Qarğabazar karvansarası - Füzuli rayonunun əsir abidələri|url= http://karabakhmedia.az/main/7072-qargabazar-karvansarasi-fuzuli-rayonunun-esir-abideleri-foto.html|publisher= karabakhmedia.az|language= az|accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural features==

 [[File:Qarğabazar karvansarasının planı və kəsiyi.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Plan and cross-section of the caravanserai]]
According to its architectural style, Garghabazar caravanserai is similar to architectural traditions of Albanian  period.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

The plan and architectural style of the caravanserai is made obedient to the general design by solving centered axis symmetrically. It consists of two large-sized [[Animal stall|camel stall]]s, two small rooms for guards on the right and left sides, 6 square-shaped rooms for caravanserai owner and merchants. The importance of these rooms is also reflected in the fact that they are built at the highest point of relief. Two high pavements were planted in front of these rooms according to their functions and relief.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

The width of the caravanserai is 23.67 meters in width and 34.70 meters in length. The main mass of the monument was built of unhewn stone. It is in a rectangular shape with a corner cut. On left and right sides of the entrance, in front of guard rooms, there are two large flagstones. It is considered that guards used to stand on those flagstones. The doors of the rooms are opening to a medium-sized balcony. The balcony is decorated 3 semicircular piers.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

There are special sewer lines in both halls of the caravanserai where camels were kept. This proves once again that in the Karabakh monarchy, sewage issues were still very much focused since ancient times.&lt;ref name="karabakhmedia"/&gt;

'''''Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Politics''''' is a 6x60 minutes [[documentary film|documentary]] TV-series about the relationship between singers and politics in the USA, the UK, Germany and France from the 1960s until 2003. It was made in 2003 by [[Rudi Dolezal]], [[Hannes Rossacher]] and Simon Witter as a joint production between German [[ZDF]] and the French-German culture channel [[Arte]]. It has since been shown by a number of other broadcasters in Europe, but also by Australia's [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/TV--Radio/Crying-freedom/2005/04/13/1113251640013.html|title=Crying freedom|date=2005-04-13|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series features interviews with well known singers and songwriters including [[Joan Baez]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Bono]], [[David Bowie]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Ice-T]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Roger Waters]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[Neil Young]].

A much shorter, two-hour version, called '''''Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Protest''''', aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in September 2005, hosted and narrated by co-founder of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] [[Chuck D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/getupstandup/index.html|title=Get Up, Stand Up: The Story of Pop and Protest|date=2005-09-01|work=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PBS version focuses mainly on the American history of [[protest songs]].

The title is borrowed from the [[reggae]] protest song ''[[Get Up, Stand Up]]'' by [[Bob Marley]] and [[Peter Tosh]].

The '''Havana Biennial Art Exhibition''' takes place in [[Havana]] ([[Cuba]]) every two years. It principally aims at promoting the developing world in''' '''[[contemporary art]] circles, giving priority to Latin American and Caribbean artists, although artists from all over the world submit works.

Since its first edition in 1984, the Biennial event has had central themes, among them tradition and contemporary times, challenges, art, society and reflection, man and memory, life with art and urban life. Works emphasize mainly paintings and other two-dimensional displays, using a variety of techniques.

==History==
The event was established in 1984. This edition exhibited artists only from [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 11th Havana Biennial Attracts Americans|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/arts/design/11th-havana-biennial-attract-americans.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2012-05-18|access-date = 2015-04-22|issn = 0362-4331|first = Victoria|last = Burnett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1986 event included art from [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] and became the most important meeting place for artists from "non-Western" countries.

Lapses in the schedule were due to funding challenges. The 8th Biennial of 2002 was delayed an entire year, resuming in November 2003. This event showcased art within the social landscape, outside of traditional institutions. Artists normally unable or unwilling to participate with large institutions engaged diverse audiences by bringing art out of the museum and into the streets. Noteworthy artists to have "activated" the urban space include Mitchell Sipus and [[Fabiana de Barros]].

The first two Biennial events included an awards ceremony, but the organizing committee then made it a non-competitive event.

===10th Havana Biennial===
With a central theme called "''Integration and resistance in the Globalization Era''", the 10th Havana Biennial Art Exhibition took place from March 27 to April 30, 2009. Experts from the Wifredo Lam Contemporary Art Center reviewed more than 400 proposals submitted by artists from 44 nations. For the first time, the organisers decided to include western countries.

The 10th edition added conferences, workshops, master classes, documentaries and video screenings. The artists transformed the city into a showcase of [[contemporary art]], taking over all available urban spaces and municipal galleries.

Common topics included the tensions between tradition and contemporary reality, challenges to the historical processes of colonization, the relationships between art and society, individuals and memory, the effects of technological development on human communication and the dynamics of urban culture.

The curators for this 2009 Biennial were Margarita González, Nelson Herrera Ysla, José Manuel Noceda, Ibis Hernández Abascal, Margarita Sánchez Prieto, José Fernández Portal and Dannys Montes de Oca Moreda.

The '''International Association of Empirical Aesthetics''' ('''IAEA''') is a [[psychology|psychological]] [[organization]] founded to scientifically investigate the nature of [[aesthetic experience]] and aesthetic behavior. The group has members in over 25 countries. IAEA was founded at the first international congress in Paris in 1965 by [[Daniel Berlyne]], [[Robert Francés]], [[Carmelo Genovese]], and [[Albert Wellek]]. 

==Background==
Although IAEA has been active for half a century, the domain of experimental aesthetics is much older. It is the second-oldest branch of scientific psychology, traditionally dating from 1876, the year Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887) published his ''Vorschule der Aesthetik'' (Preschool of Aesthetics). Fechner, who also is credited with founding psychophysics, established methods for examining aesthetic response to a variety of visual forms, including an exploration of the venerable Golden Section hypothesis. Since the inception of IAEA in 1965, research on empirical aesthetics has continued to progress, with many pioneers prominent in its membership: witness, for instance, such classic books such as Daniel Berlyne’s (1971) ''Aesthetics and Psychobiology'', Colin Martindale’s (1990) ''The Clockwork Muse: The Predictability of Artistic Change'', or a variety of more recent contributions from IAEA’s current members.

==Current situation==
The International Association of Empirical Aesthetics (IAEA) is an organization of researchers who use scientific methods to investigate aesthetic experience and aesthetic behavior in a wide variety of domains, including encounters with beauty, visual art, music, literature, film, theater, philosophy, and museum behavior. Our membership includes individuals from psychology, neuroscience, sociology, museology, art history, philosophy, musicology, and other domains.

Currently, the officers of IAEA are President [[Helmut Leder]] (Vienna), Secretary Stefano Mastandrea (Rome) and Treasurer Thomas Jacobsen (Hamburg). A list of former officers can be found on the IAEA webpage.

IAEA organizes bi-annual conferences. IAEA is closely associated with the journal ''[[Empirical Studies in the Arts]]''. IAEA gives several awards to recognize excellence in empirical research on aesthetics and creativity:  The [[Gustav Theodor Fechner Award]] for Outstanding Contributions to [[Empirical Aesthetics]].  The Sir Francis Galton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Study of Creativity. The Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten Award for Outstanding Contributions of Young Scientists.

==Plot==
Anna has been rejected by her college, her girlfriend broke up with her, and her big sister is getting married. She meets Sadie, who invites her to join Clits In Action, or C(i)A, a [[Far-left politics|radical]] [[Third-wave feminist]] group. Anna soon gets in touch with her political side.&lt;ref name="AfterEllen.com"&gt;[http://www.afterellen.com/movies/2007/5/ittybitty Review of "Itty Bitty Titty Committee" by Danielle Riendeau] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120720012750/http://www.afterellen.com/movies/2007/5/ittybitty |date=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She takes part in illegal activism with the group and becomes more aggressive in her daily life.

Anna starts falling for Sadie, who has been involved for years with an older woman named Courtney. Courtney works with a more mainstream feminist organization and disagrees with the C(i)A's method of creating awareness through public art, which usually involves vandalism.

The group travels to take part in a [[gay marriage]] protest – instead of being for or against it, they argue that marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism. Despite being warned by another member of the C(i)A, Meat, that Sadie uses people, Anna shares a night of passion with her while they stay in a hotel. At the rally the next day, the outspoken Shulamith ends up nearly coming to blows with a protester. The fight is caught by a local news crew and the group's message is misconstrued as violent and [[homophobia|homophobic]]. Meat also reveals that their website – which they considered the center of their activism – has not received hits from anyone besides themselves.

C(i)A attempts to have a meeting at Courtney's home, but personal conflicts come to a head. Anna believes Sadie is going to leave Courtney to be with her, but Sadie remains dependent on her partner. Meat and Shulamith announce that they're giving up on the group, Sadie stays behind with Courtney, and Aggie (a [[transgender]] man who's part of the C(i)A) comforts Anna, who is heartbroken over Sadie's rejection and the loss of the C(i)A. They end up partying together and having a one-night stand. In the morning, Aggie has prepared breakfast and procured a flower for Anna, who only considers him a friend. Sadie arrives to talk about what happened the night before. Anna tries to explain that her night with Aggie meant nothing. He overhears and is deeply hurt. Sadie leaves and Anna finds herself truly alone.

In an attempt to fix things, Anna formulates a master plan to get C(i)A national attention. Meat and Shulamith like her idea, but insist she must make things right with Aggie. Anna apologizes, Aggie forgives her, and the four carry out the plan, without Sadie. 

Anna attends her sister's wedding, bringing joy to her family, but leaves early to execute her part of the plan – sneaking into the studio of a popular talk show with Aggie and Meat. Courtney is appearing on the show to argue about the appropriateness of a celebration over the (arbitrary) anniversary of the construction of the Washington Monument, which she feels is a distraction from real issues. When the host requests a live shot of the monument, the C(i)A feeds their footage in. With the expert help of one of Shulamith's lovers, Calvin (who was discharged from the military for being a lesbian under [[Don't Ask Don't Tell]]), and Meat's prowess with sculpture, a giant phallus has been erected atop the [[Washington Monument]] and is blown off with explosives. Back at the studio, Aggie pulls the fire alarm and the group escapes.

In the getaway car waiting for Anna, she is surprised to see Sadie, who has finally broken it off with Courtney. Sadie apologizes for her behavior, and the two agree to just be friends, but then kiss. Through text in the epilogue, it is revealed that Shulamith and Calvin volunteered to take the fall for the explosion, and received a reduced sentence because no one was hurt. Aggie started hormone therapy, started a new feminist group for men and got a girlfriend. Meat's sculpture appearing on TV launched her art career. Courtney took the talk show host, Marcy, out to dinner after fleeing the building together. Marcy subsequently left her husband to move in with Courtney. Anna and Sadie remain together, and Anna now attends college, where she has created a group focused on positive body image called the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

==Reception==
While the writing was considered better than ''[[But I'm A Cheerleader]]'', ''Itty Bitty Titty Committee'' was still criticized as weak and overly cliched.&lt;ref name ="LA Weekly"&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/film+tv/film-reviews/film-reviews-angels-in-the-dust-hannah-takes-the-stairs-trade/17320/?page=2 Film Reviews: Angels in the Dust, Hannah Takes the Stairs, Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boxoffice.com"/&gt;  Also, the humor has been criticized as "juvenile", with the comment that the humor is probably intended to draw in a teenage girl audience.&lt;ref name= variety/&gt;&lt;ref name="TV Guide"/&gt;

Characterization was also criticized as being two-dimensional,&lt;ref name="Boxoffice.com"&gt;[http://boxoffice.com/reviews/2007/09/itty-bitty-titty-committee.php Review of Itty Bitty Titty Committee at Boxoffice.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shadows&gt;[http://www.shadowsonthewall.co.uk/07/i-a.htm#itty Shadows on the Wall review]&lt;/ref&gt; but the portrayal of Anna's family as accepting of her [[homosexuality]] was considered refreshing.&lt;ref name="AfterEllen.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boxoffice.com"/&gt;

Some critics felt that the treatment of radical feminism could have pushed into more daring political territory.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932750.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Review of Itty Bitty Titty Committee at Variety.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shadows/&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' opined that the foray into [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] was "embarrassingly obvious," and wouldn't be understood by people who didn't already like activism.&lt;ref name="TV Guide"&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/itty-bitty-titty/review/289327 TVGuide.com review of Itty Bitty Titty Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[LA Weekly]]'' said that Anna's "dogmatic, undergrad feminist speeches" needed a "[[satire|satiric]] spark," and that she "often comes off as a pill."&lt;ref name ="LA Weekly"/&gt;

'''John Henry "Jack" "Doc" Bradley''' (July 10, 1923 – January 11, 1994) was a [[United States Navy]] [[Hospital corpsman]] who was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for extraordinary heroism in combat on February 21, 1945 while assigned to a U.S. Marine Corps rifle company during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]].

Bradley was one of the members of the combat patrol that climbed, captured, and helped raise the original [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flags]] on top of [[Iwo Jima|Mount Suribachi]] on the morning of February 23, 1945.  Until June 2016, Bradley was incorrectly identified as being one of the six men raising a second, larger flag about 90 minutes later, though he was still on the mountaintop and witnessed &amp;ndash; but was not part of &amp;ndash; the specific moment of raising the larger flag that was captured in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photo ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]'' taken by [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Joe Rosenthal]].

== Early years ==
John Bradley was born in [[Antigo, Wisconsin]], to James ("Cabbage") and Kathryn Bradley. He was the second eldest of five children. He grew up in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], graduating from [[Appleton West High School|Appleton Senior High School]] in 1941. His younger sister Mary Ellen died of pneumonia at a young age. He  had an interest in entering the funeral business from an early age, because he felt those were the men everyone looked up to, and later got a job at his local funeral home. He then completed an 18-month apprenticeship course with a local funeral director before he entered the U.S Navy during World War II.

== U.S. Navy ==
Bradley enlisted the U.S. Navy on January 13, 1943 when his father suggested it as a way to avoid ground combat. Following his completion of Navy recruit training at the [[Farragut Naval Training Station]] at [[Bayview, Idaho]], he was assigned to the Hospital Corps School at Farragut, Idaho in March 1943. After completing the [[Hospital corpsman]] course, he was assigned to [[Naval Hospital Oakland]] in [[Oakland, California]]. In January 1944, he was assigned to the [[Fleet Marine Force]] and sent to one of the "field medical service schools" at a  Marine Corps base for training to serve with Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ww2gyrene.org/role_corpsman.htm|title=The Navy Hospital Corpsman|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the course, he was assigned to the [[5th Marine Division]] on April 15, a newly activated infantry division which was then being formed at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]], [[California]]. He was reassigned there to Easy Company, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marines|2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]] of the division.

=== Battle of Iwo Jima ===

[[James Michels]] (holding [[M1 carbine]]), and Cpl. [[Charles W. Lindberg]] (standing above Michels).]]

On February 19, 1945, the 5th Marine Division which included Bradley took part in the assault on [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] which was one of the most bitterly fought battles of the [[Pacific War]]'s [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping]] campaign.

Bradley was assigned to Third Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines before and when they landed on the beach with the ninth wave of assault Marines at the south end of Iwo Jima near Mount Suribachi. After Bradley and PhM3c. Clifford Langley, the other E Company corpsman assigned to Third Platoon, aided American casualties on the beach, they continued on with E Company as the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines advanced towards Mount Suribachi, which was their objective on the southwest end of the island. On February 21, Bradley risked his life under fire to save the life of a Marine at the base of the mountain who was caught in the open under heavy Japanese fire. While still under and exposed to enemy fire, and in order to save the lives of other Marines who were willing to expose themselves under fire to bring back the wounded Marine, Bradley brought the wounded Marine to safety himself. He was awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] for his actions.

====First flag-raising====
At 8 AM on February 23, Bradley and Navy corpsman, PhM2c. Gerald Ziehme (replaced PhM3c. Langley who was wounded in action on February 21),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Imnie, Associated Press, March 17, 2004: "Veteran closer to clearing his name after book cast doubt on his role at Iwo Jima" {{cite web |url=http://www.legacy.utsandiego.com/news/military/20040317-0049-upsetwwiivet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222073739/http://www.legacy.utsandiego.com/news/military/20040317-0049-upsetwwiivet.html |archivedate=December 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; were part of the 40-man combat patrol (mostly from Third Platoon, Easy Company) that was sent to climb up the east slope of Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest. E Company's executive officer, First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]] who volunteered to lead the patrol, was to raise an American flag to signal that the mountaintop was captured.

Lt. Schrier and his men reached the top after a small number of Japanese sniper shots, then there was brief skirmish at the rim of the crater. On top, the Marines found a steel pipe to attach the flag unto. The flagstaff was taken to the highest position on the crater. Schrier, Platoon Sgt. [[Ernest Ivy Thomas|Ernest Thomas]] and Sgt. [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]], raised the flag, planting the steel pipe into the ground approximately 10:20 AM.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living. CBS Radio interview by Dan Pryor with flag raiser Ernest "Boots" Thomas on February 25, 1945 aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''"&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the raising of the [[National colours|national colors]] immediately caused loud cheering from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the beach below and from the men on the ships near the beach. After the flag was raised, Bradley, who was with the group of Marines near the flagstaff, pitched in to help the flagstaff stay vertical in the terrific winds on the volcano.

====Second flag-raising====
[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima (color).ogg|thumb|right|Sgt. [[William Genaust|Bill Genaust]]'s film shot of the second flag raising excerpted from the 1945 "Carriers Hit Tokyo" newsreel]]
In order for the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land off and around Mount Suribachi, it was decided that another larger flag should be flown on Mt. Suribachi. Marine Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] a squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, was ordered to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the replacement flag. He then ordered Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]], and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up Suribachi. Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the company's runner (messenger), was ordered to take the replacement flag up the mountain and return with the first flag that was flying on top.

Once all five Marines were on top, another pipe was found and the replacement flag was attached to it. At approximately 1 PM, Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the replacement flag and the lowering of the original flag. The flag was raised by Block (misidentified as Sgt. Hansen until January 1947), Gagnon, Hayes, Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]] (misidentified as Bradley until June 23, 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/05/02/report-marine-corps-investigating-photo-of-iconic-flag-raising-on-iwo-jima/|title=Marine Corps investigating photo of iconic flag-raising on Iwo Jima|website=washingtonpost.com|date=May 2, 2016|first1=Thomas|last1=Gibbons-Neff|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marines.mil"&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/06/23/marines-man-in-iwo-jima-flag-raising-photo-misidentified.html?intcmp=hplnws|title=Marines: Man in Iwo Jima flag raising photo misidentified|date=June 23, 2016|accessdate=June 23, 2016|website=FoxNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sousley and Strank.  Both men originally misidentified as flag raisers had helped raise the earlier flag, and were both still on the mountaintop and witnessed &amp;ndash; but were not part of &amp;ndash; the specific moment of raising the larger flag that was captured in [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photo ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.

====Subsequent events====

On March 4, Bradley shot a Japanese soldier charging him with a bayonet with his pistol as he treated a wounded Marine in a shell hole.&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt;

On March 12, Bradley and three Marines received [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] wounds from an enemy mortar round explosion. All four were quickly attended to by other corpsmen. Bradley was wounded in the legs and feet and was evacuated from the combat zone to the battalion aid station, field hospital, and was flown to [[Guam]], Hawaii, and [[Naval Hospital Oakland|Oakland Naval Hospital]]. He was awarded the Purple Heart Medal. On March 14, General [[Holland Smith]] ordered an American flag raised at Kitano Point on the northern end of the island, and the flag flying on the summit of Mount Suribachi be taken down. The battle of Iwo Jima was officially over on March 26.

On March 30, 1945, President Roosevelt ordered that the three flag-raisers in [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s photograph be sent immediately to Washington, D.C. to appear as a public morale factor.&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="navalhistory.org"&gt;[https://www.navalhistory.org/2016/07/01/john-bradleys-account-of-the-iwo-flag-raising] Naval History Blog, US Naval Institute, July 1, 2016, ''John Bradley's Account of the Iwo Flag Raising''. May 9, 1945, US Navy interview of John Bradley&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, the Marine Corps announced that Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley were the three surviving flag-raisers in the picture and that Sgt. Hansen, Sgt. Strank, and Pfc. Sousley were killed in action. On April 19, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley's services were requested to participate in the [[Series E bond|Seventh War Loan drive]]. On May 9, a flag-raising by Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley at the Nation's capital kicked off the bond-selling tour which began on May 11 in New York and ended on July 4 with Gagnon and Bradley's return to Washington, D.C. (Hayes left the bond tour on May 25 after he was ordered back to E Company in Hawaii). The bond tour was held in 33 American cities that raised over $26 billion to help pay for and win the war (the war was over in Europe on May 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |title=The Mighty Seventh War Loan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406193329/http://www.bucknell.edu/x36352.xml |archivedate=April 6, 2013|website=bucknell.edu|accessdate=June 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

=== Discharge ===
Bradley was medically discharged from the Navy in November 1945.

== Marriage and family life ==
Bradley married Betty Van Gorp (1924–2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradleyfh.com/obituary/118623/Elizabeth-Bradley/|title=Elizabeth M.  Bradley Online Obituary, January 23, 1924 - September 12, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; settled in Antigo, had eight children, and was active in numerous civic clubs, rarely taking part in ceremonies celebrating the flag-raising &amp;mdash; and by the 1960s avoiding them altogether. He subsequently purchased and managed a funeral parlor.  Bradley's wife later said he was tormented by memories of the war, wept in his sleep for the first four years of their marriage and kept a large knife in a dresser drawer for "protection". He also had flashbacks of his best friend Iggy, [[Ralph Ignatowski]], who was captured and tortured by Japanese soldiers. Bradley could not forgive himself for not being there to try and save his friend's life.&lt;ref name="flags"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=James|last2=Powers|first2=Ron|title=Flags of Our Fathers|year=2000|publisher=Bantam |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marine Corps War Memorial ==
[[File:USMC War Memorial Night.jpg|thumb|right|The [[USMC War Memorial|U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], [[Virginia]]]]

The Marine Corps War Memorial (also known as the Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington, Virginia, which was inspired by Rosenthal's photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi was dedicated on November 10, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barracks.marines.mil/History/MarineCorpsWarMemorial.aspx The Marine Corps War Memorial] Marine Barracks Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until June 23, 2016, Bradley was incorrectly depicted on the memorial as the third bronze statue from the base of the flagstaff with the 32-foot (9.8 M) bronze statues of the other five flag-raisers on the monument.&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; [[Franklin Sousley]] is now depicted as the third bronze statue from the base of the flagstaff ([[Harold Schultz]] in place of Sousley is now depicted as the fifth statue).

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] attended the dedication of the memorial and sat upfront with [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert B. Anderson|Robert Anderson]], and General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr.]], the 20th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the Marine Corps. Also in attendance were two of the three surviving flag-raisers, Ira Hayes and Rene Gagnon, who were seated together with Bradley (who was incorrectly believed to be a  surviving second flag-raiser)&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; in the front rows of seats along with relatives of those who were killed in action on the island.&lt;ref name=mhmd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vgwrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jZoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4987%2C3731941 |newspaper=Reading Eagle|location=Pennsylvania|agency=Associated Press|title=Memorial honoring Marines dedicated |date=November 10, 1954|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speeches were given by Richard Nixon, Robert Anderson who dedicated the memorial, and General Shepherd who presented the memorial to the American people.&lt;ref name=hpdrms&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cPNXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mfYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5563%2C2418577 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Marine monument seen as symbol of hopes, dreams |date=November 10, 1954 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:

== Death ==
Bradley had a [[heart attack]], but died of a [[stroke]] at 2:12 am in an Antigo hospital on January 11, 1994, at the age of 70. He is buried in Queen of Peace Cemetery, [[Antigo, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt;

== Flag raising views ==
On June 23, 2016, the Marine Corps announced after reviewing new information in regard to the identities of the six second flag-raisers atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, that Marine Harold Schultz not Bradley is in [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s photograph of the second flag-raising (Franklin Sousley is now where Bradley was thought to be in the photo and Schultz is now where Sousley was in the picture). The Marine Corps stated Bradley was involved with the first flag-raising on Mount Suribachi the same day.&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; A previous Marine Corps investigation into the identities of the six second flag-raisers was held in December 1946 and January 1947 that determined Marines Michael Strank, Ira Hayes, Franklin Sousley, Rene Gagnon, Harlon Block and Navy corpsman John Bradley were in the photograph, and Marine [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] was not. Bradley is no longer identified as one of the six flag-raisers on the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]].

On April 3, 1945, Gagnon was the first second flag-raiser ordered to report to Washington, D.C. which he did on April 7, 1945. On April 8, after Gagnon was interviewed by a lieutenant colonel about who the second flag-raisers were, the Marine Corps incorrectly named Bradley (and incorrectly named Hansen) publicly as one of the six flag-raisers. While Bradley was recovering from his wounds at the [[Naval Hospital Oakland]] after the battle, he was shown the famous flag-raising photograph which appeared in the newspapers and was told he was in it. Bradley was then ordered to Washington, D.C. He arrived in Washington on crutches on April 19 as did Ira Hayes. Both men were interviewed by the same lieutenant colonel about who the flag-raisers were in the photograph. Bradley agreed with Gagnon and his naming Hansen and himself as flag-raisers. Hayes also named Bradley, and claimed he told the interviewer in charge who was the same lieutenant colonel, that Harlon Block was in the picture and Hansen was not. The interviewer told Hayes a list of the names of the six flag-raisers were already released publicly and he should stick only with these six names since Block was killed in action (in 1946, the lieutenant colonel denied Hayes ever mentioned Block to him).

On April 20, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley met Truman at the White House and each showed him their positions in the flag-raising picture. A press conference was also held that day and Gangon, Hayes, and Bradley were questioned about the flag-raising. On May 9, 1945, Bradley did an oral interview for the Navy by a captain about the famous flag-raising on Mount Suribachi, and incorrectly said he was in the second flag-raising picture,&lt;ref name="navalhistory.org"/&gt; and when questioned about the first flag-raising, he said Platoon Sgt. Ernest Thomas raised that flag.&lt;ref name="navalhistory.org"/&gt; In 1985, he did another interview about the flag-raising (second raising) at the urging of his wife, who had told him to do it for the sake of their grandchildren. During that interview, Bradley &lt;ref name="suribachi"/&gt; said that he would not have raised the flag if he had known how famous the photo (Rosenthal photograph) would become.&lt;ref name="suribachi"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley|first=James|title=Iwo Jima Flag Raising on Mount Suribachi|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Museum}} Viewed March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he did not want to live with the pressures of the media and desired to live a normal life.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, James. "Americas Battle: A Speech Given by James Bradley".&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, during the interview, that anyone on the island could have raised the flag and that he was just there at the right time &lt;ref name="suribachi"/&gt;

Bradley rarely did an interview for the newspapers, he refused to talk to and avoided reporters as much as possible. Throughout his life, the press would contact his home to ask for interviews and he trained his wife and children to give excuses such as he "was on a fishing trip in Canada." Even during the filming of the movie the ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' in 1949, Bradley told his wife to tell the townspeople that he was "on a business trip" in order to avoid attention that would be drawn to him."&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; Despite his reluctance to talk to the media, family, and friends about the incident, he told his parents in a letter a few days after the incident that raising the flag was the "happiest moment of my life",&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; though he was most likely referring to the first flag raising where he helped secure the flagstaff into the ground after it was raised and planted.&lt;ref name=three/&gt;

Bradley saw the flag raising(s) as an insignificant event in a devastating battle. He rarely talked to people about it and spent most of his life trying to escape the attention he drew from allegedly raising it. He stated once that he "just happened to be there".&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; He spoke to his wife once about the flag raising during their 47-year marriage. That was on their first date, and he seemed very uninterested with it during the conversation.&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; His daughter Barbara said that "Reading a book on Iwo Jima at home would have been like reading a playgirl magazine…it would have been something I had to hide."&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; He told his children more than once that the only real heroes on Iwo Jima were those that did not survive.

His son [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] speculated that his father's determined silence and discomfort on the subject of his role in the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] was largely due to memories of Bradley's wartime buddy, Marine [[Ralph Ignatowski|Ralph "Iggy" Ignatowski]].&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; In his own words, and only once, he briefly told his son what happened with "Iggy":

{{quote|I have tried so hard to block this out. To forget it. We could choose a buddy to go in with. My buddy was a guy from Milwaukee. We were pinned down in one area. Someone elsewhere fell injured and I ran to help out, and when I came back my buddy was gone. I couldn't figure out where he was. I could see all around, but he wasn't there. And nobody knew where he was. A few days later someone yelled that they'd found his body. They called me over because I was a corpsman. The Japanese had pulled him underground and tortured him. His fingernails... his tongue... It was absolutely terrible. I've tried hard to forget all this.|John Bradley&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt;}} 

Official reports revealed Ignatowski was captured, dragged into a tunnel by Japanese soldiers during the battle, and was later found with his eyes, ears, fingernails, and tongue removed, his teeth smashed, the back of his head caved in, multiple bayonet wounds to the abdomen, and his arms broken.&lt;ref name="flags"/&gt; Bradley's recollections of discovering and taking care of Ignatowski's remains haunted him until his death, and he suffered for many years from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

===Navy Cross citation===
[[File:Navycross.jpg|left|50px]] 
{{quotation|For extraordinary heroism in action against the enemy at Iwo Jima on Feb. 21, 1945 as a hospital corpsman attached to a Marine Rifle platoon. During a furious assault by his company upon a strongly defended enemy zone at the base of Mt. Suribachi, Bradley observed a Marine infantryman fall wounded in an open area under a pounding barrage by mortars, interlaced with a merciless crossfire from Machine guns. With complete disregard for his own safety, he ran through the intense fire to the side of the fallen Marine, examined his wounds and ascertained that an immediate administration of plasma was necessary to save the man's life. Unwilling to subject any of his comrades to the danger to which he had so valiantly exposed himself, he signaled would-be assistants to remain where they were. Placing himself in a position to shield the wounded man, he tied a plasma unit to a rifle planted upright in the sand and continued his life saving mission. The Marine's wounds bandaged and the condition of shock relieved by plasma, Bradley pulled the man thirty yards through intense enemy fire to a position of safety. His indomitable spirit, dauntless initiative, and heroic devotion to duty were an inspiration to those with whom he served and were in keeping with the highest tradition of the United States Naval Service.}}

'''''Laughing Boy with a Flute''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in the early 1620s.

==Painting ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote "31. A LAUGHING BOY WITH A FLUTE. M. 240. Half-length, in profile to the left. The head is three-quarters left. The long hair falls in disorder. The lips are parted, showing the teeth. On the left the flute is held upright in the right hand. The eyes look to the 
left and slightly upward. Lifelike colour in the face. Circular panel, n| inches across the grain of the wood running diagonally. A copy is in the [[Museum Boucher de Perthes|Boucher de Perthes Museum]], [[Abbeville]]. In the collection of the late [[Alfred Beit]], London. In the collection of [[Otto Beit]], London."&lt;ref&gt;* [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/12/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on A Laughing Boy with a Flute; catalog number 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstede de Groot noted several laughing boys by Hals along with this one (catalogue numbers 11 through to 39). This painting was also documented by [[W.R. Valentiner]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/franshalsdesmeis00valeuoft#page/34/mode/1up Laughing boy with Flute, number 34 right]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30003">'''Lettrism''' is a French [[avant-garde]] movement, established in Paris in the mid-1940s by [[Romania]]n immigrant [[Isidore Isou]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/lettrism-1992 "Lettrism"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In a body of work totaling hundreds of volumes, Isou and the Lettrists have applied their theories to all areas of art and culture, most notably in poetry, film, painting and political theory. The movement has its theoretical roots in [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]. Isou viewed his fellow countryman [[Tristan Tzara]] as the greatest creator and rightful leader of the Dada movement, and dismissed most of the others as plagiarists and falsifiers.&lt;ref&gt;See Isou, ''Les véritables créateurs et les falsificateurs de dada, du surréalisme et du lettrisme'' (1973), and Maurice Lemaître, ''Le lettrisme devant dada et les nécrophages de dada'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Surrealists, [[André Breton]] was a significant influence, but Isou was dissatisfied by what he saw as the stagnation and theoretical bankruptcy of the movement as it stood in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;See Isou, ''Réflexions sur André Breton'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the movement is called '''''Lettrisme''''', from the French word for ''letter'', arising from the fact that many of their early works centred on letters and other visual or spoken symbols. The ''Lettristes'' themselves prefer the spelling ''''Letterism'''' for the Anglicised term, and this is the form that is used on those rare occasions when they produce or supervise English translations of their writings: however, 'Lettrism' is at least as common in English usage. The term, having been the original name that was first given to the group, has lingered as a blanket term to cover all of their activities, even as many of these have moved away from any connection to letters. But other names have also been introduced, either for the group as a whole or for its activities in specific domains, such as 'the Isouian movement', 'youth uprising', '[[hypergraphics]]', 'creatics', 'infinitesimal art' and 'excoördism'.

== History ==
'''1925.'''&lt;ref&gt;For fuller chronological details, see Curtay, ''La poésie lettriste''; Foster, ''Lettrisme: Into the Present'';  Sabatier, ''Le lettrisme''.&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore Goldstein is born at [[Botoşani]], [[Romania]], on January 31, to an [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish family. During the early 1950s, Goldstein would be signing himself 'Jean-Isidore Isou'; otherwise, it has always been '[[Isidore Isou]]'. 'Isou' is standardly taken to be a pseudonym, but Isou/Goldstein himself resists this interpretation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;My name is Isou. My mother called me Isou, only it's written differently in Romanian. And Goldstein: I'm not ashamed of my name. At Gallimard, I was known as Isidore Isou Goldstein. Isou, it's my name! Only in Romanian it's written Izu, but in French it's Isou.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Roland Sabatier, 15 November 1999, in ''La Termitière'', no. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 1940s ===
*'''1942–1944.''' Isou develops the principles of Lettrism, and begins writing the books that he would subsequently publish after his relocation to [[Paris]].
*'''1945.''' Aged twenty, Isou arrives in Paris on August 23 after six weeks of clandestine travel. In November, he founds the Letterist movement with [[Gabriel Pomerand]].
*'''1946.''' Isou and Pomerand disrupt a performance of Tzara's ''La Fuite'' at the Vieux-Colombier. Publication of ''La Dictature Lettriste: cahiers d'un nouveau régime artistique'' (''The Letterist Dictatorship: notebooks of a new artistic regime''). Although announced as the first in a series, only one such notebook would appear. A subtitle proudly boasts of Letterism that it is 'the only contemporary movement of the artistic avant-garde'.
*'''1947.''' Isou's first two books are published by [[Gallimard]]: ''Introduction à une nouvelle poésie et à une nouvelle musique'' (''Introduction to a New Poetry and a New Music'') and ''L'Agrégation d'un nom et d'un messie'' (''Aggregation of a Name and a Messiah''). The former sets out Isou's theory of the 'amplic' and 'chiselling' phases, and, within this framework, presents his views on both the past history and the future direction of '''poetry''' and '''music'''. The latter is more biographical, discussing the genesis of Isou's ideas, as well as exploring [[Judaism]]. Isou and Pomerand are joined by François Dufrêne.
*'''1949.''' Isou publishes ''Isou, ou la mécanique des femmes'' (''Isou, or the mechanics of women''), the first of several works of '''[[erotology]]''',  wherein he claims to have bedded 375 women in the preceding four years, and offers to explain how (p.&amp;nbsp;9). The book is banned and Isou is briefly imprisoned. Also published, the first of several works on '''political theory''', Isou's ''Traité d'économie nucléaire: Le soulèvement de la jeunesse'' (''Treatise of Nuclear Economics: Youth Uprising'').

=== 1950s ===
*'''1950.''' [[Maurice Lemaître]], [[Jean-Louis Brau]], [[Gil J. Wolman]] and [[Serge Berna]] join the group. Isou publishes first [[metagraphy|metagraphic]] '''novel''', ''Les journaux des dieux'' (''The Gods' Diaries''), followed soon afterwards by Pomerand's ''Saint Ghetto des Prêts'' (''Saint Ghetto of the Loans'') and Lemaître's ''Canailles'' (''Scoundrels''). Also, the first manifestos of Letterist '''painting'''. Some of the younger Letterists [[Notre-Dame Affair|invade Nôtre Dame cathedral at Easter mass]], aired live on national TV, to announce to the congregation that God is dead. In a Letterist [[FAQ]] published in the first issue of Lemaître's journal, ''Ur'', CP-Matricon explains: 'The letterists do not create scandals: they break the [[Conspiracy of silence (expression)|conspiracy of silence]] set up by pusillanimous show-offs (journalists) and smash the faces of those who don't please them.' (p.&amp;nbsp;8).
*'''1951.''' Isou completes his first '''film''', ''[[Traité de bave et d'éternité]]'' (''Treatise on Slime and Eternity''), which will soon be followed by Lemaître's ''Le film est déjà commencé?'' (''Has the film already started?''), [[Gil J. Wolman|Wolman]]'s ''L'Anticoncept'' (''The Anticoncept''), [[François Dufrêne|Dufrêne]]'s ''Tambours du jugement premier'' (''Drums of the First Judgment'') and [[Guy Debord]]'s ''[[Hurlements en faveur de Sade]]'' (''Howls for de Sade''). Debord joins the group in April when they travel down to [[Cannes]] (where he was then living) to show ''Traité de bave et d'éternité'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Under the auspices of [[Jean Cocteau]], a prize for 'best avant-garde' is specially created and awarded to Isou's film.
*'''1952.''' Publication of the first (and only) issue of ''Ion'', devoted to Letterist film. This is significant for including Debord's first appearance in print, alongside work from Wolman and Berna who, following an intervention at a [[Charlie Chaplin]] press conference at the Hotel Ritz in October, would join him in splitting from Isou's group to form the '''Letterist International'''.
{{Main|Letterist International}}
*'''1953.''' Isou moves into '''photography''' with ''Amos, ou Introduction à la métagraphologie'' (''Amos, or Introduction to Metagraphology''), '''theatre''' with ''Fondements pour la transformation intégrale du théâtre'' (''The Foundations of the Integrated Transformation of the Theatre''), '''painting''' with ''Les nombres'' (''The Numbers''), and '''dance''' with ''Manifeste pour une danse ciselante'' (''Manifesto for Chiselling Dance'').
*'''1955.''' Dufrêne develops his first ''Crirhythmes''.
*'''1956.''' Isou introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
*'''1958.''' [[Columbia Records]] release the first audio recordings of Letterist poetry, ''Maurice Lemaître presente le lettrisme''.

=== 1960s ===
*'''1960.''' Isou introduces the concept of supertemporal art in ''L'Art supertemporel''. [[Asger Jorn]] publishes a critique of Letterism, ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/originality.html Originality and Magnitude (on the system of Isou)]'' in issue 4 of ''Internationale Situationniste''. Isou replies at length in ''L'Internationale Situationniste, un degré plus bas que le jarrivisme et l'englobant''. This is only the first of many works that Isou will write against Debord (his former protégé) and the [[Situationist International]], which Isou regards as a neo-Nazi organisation. However, as Andrew Hussey reports, his attitude does eventually mellow: 'Now Isou forgave them and he saw (it was crucial, Isou said, that I should understand this!) that they were all on the same side after all.'&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hussey, ''The Game of War'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2001), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the sixties, several new members join group, including [[Jacques Spacagna]] (1961), [[Aude Jessemin]] (1962), [[Roberto Altmann]] (1962), [[Roland Sabatier]] (1963), [[Alain Satié]] (1964), [[Micheline Hachette]] (1964), [[Francois Poyet]] (1966), [[Jean-Paul Curtay]] (1967),  [[Anton Perich]] (1967), [[Gérard-Philippe Broutin]] (1968).
*'''1964.''' Definitive split with Dufrêne and the [[ultra-lettrist|Ultraletterists]], as well as with Wolman who, despite his participation from 1952 to 1957 with the Letterist International (who were forbidden by internal statute from any involvement in Isouian activities), had retained links with Isou's group. Dufrêne and Wolman with Brau form the Second Letterist International (''Deuxième internationale lettriste'').
*'''1967.''' Lemaître stands for election to the local Parisian legislature, representing the 'Union of Youth and Externity'. He loses.
*'''1968.''' First work on '''architecture''', Isou's ''Manifeste pour le bouleversement de l'architecture'' (''Manifesto for the Overhaul of Architecture'').

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
General continuation of existing currents, together with new research into psychiatry, mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
*'''1972''' [[Mike Rose (painter)]], a German painter, set designer, and writer made acquaintance with the Lettrists and became part of them. He participated in their exhibitions until the 1980s.
Other members to join the lettrism during the seventies : [[Woody Roehmer]], [[Anne-Catherine Caron]], and during the eighties : Frédérique Devaux, Michel Amarger ...

=== 1990s ===
Development of excoordism. Uncomfortable with the direction the group is going in, Lemaître—Isou's right-hand man for nearly half a century—begins to distance himself from it.&lt;ref&gt;See Satié, ''Le lettrisme, la creation ininterrompue'' (Paris: Jean-Paul Rocher, 2003), 56n34.&lt;/ref&gt; He still continues to pursue traditional Letterist techniques, but now in relative isolation from the main group.

=== 2000s ===
* '''2007''' Isou dies  and [http://antisystemic.org/DAMTP/TheEndOfTheAgeOfDivinity-Enkutatach409.pdf The End of the Age of Divinity] is published.

== Key concepts ==

=== The Amplic (''amplique'') and the Chiselling (''ciselante'') phases ===
Isou first invented these phases through an examination of the history of poetry, but the conceptual apparatus he developed could very easily be applied to most other branches of art and culture. In poetry, he felt that the first amplic phase had been initiated by [[Homer]]. In effect, Homer set out a blueprint for what a poem ought to be like. Subsequent poets then developed this blueprint, investigating by means of their work all of the different things that could be done within the Homeric parameters. Eventually, however, everything that ''could be'' done within that approach ''had been'' done. In poetry, Isou felt that this point was reached with [[Victor Hugo]] (and in painting with [[Eugène Delacroix]], in music with [[Richard Wagner]].). When amplic poetry had been completed, there was simply nothing to be gained by continuing to produce works constructed according to the old model. There would no longer be any genuine creativity or innovation involved, and hence no aesthetic value. This then inaugurated a chiselling phase in the art. Whereas the form had formerly been used as a tool to express things outside its own domain—events, feelings, etc.--it would then turn in on itself and become, perhaps only implicitly, its own subject matter. From [[Charles Baudelaire]] to [[Tristan Tzara]] (as, in painting, from [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] to [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]; or, in music, from [[Debussy]] to [[Luigi Russolo]]), subsequent poets would deconstruct the grand edifice of poetry that had been developed over the centuries according to the Homeric model. Finally, when this process of deconstruction had been completed, it would then be time for a new amplic phase to commence. Isou saw himself as the man to show the way. He would take the rubble that remained after the old forms had been shattered, and lay out a new blueprint for reutilising these most basic elements in a radically new way, utterly unlike the poetry of the preceding amplic phase. Isou identified the most basic elements of poetic creation as ''letters''—i.e. uninterpreted visual symbols and acoustic sounds—and he set out the parameters for new ways of recombining these ingredients in the name of new aesthetic goals.

=== The ''Lettrie'' ===
Isou's idea for the poem of the future was that it should be purely formal, devoid of all semantic content. The Letterist poem, or ''lettrie'', in many ways resembles what certain [[Futurism (art)|Italian Futurists]] (such as [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]), [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]] (such as [[Velimir Khlebnikov|Velemir Chlebnikov]], [[Iliazd]], or [[Aleksei Kruchenykh|Alexej Kručenych]]—cf. [[Zaum]]), and [[Dada]] poets (such as [[Raoul Hausmann]] or [[Kurt Schwitters]]) had already been doing, and what subsequent [[sound poetry|sound poets]] and [[concrete poetry|concrete poets]] (such as [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Eduard Ovčáček]] or [[Henri Chopin]]) would later be doing. However, the Letterists were always keen to insist on their own radical originality and to distinguish their work from other ostensibly similar currents.

=== Metagraphics/Hypergraphics ===
On the visual side, the Letterists first gave the name '[[metagraphy|metagraphics]]' (''metagraphie'') and then '[[hypergraphics]]' (''hypergraphie'') to their new synthesis of writing and visual art. Some precedents may be seen in [[Cubist]], [[Dada]] and Futurist (both [[Futurism (art)|Italian]] and [[Russian Futurism|Russian]]) [[painting]] and [[typography|typographical]] works, such as [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti's]] [[Zang Tumb Tumb|Zang Tumb Tuum]], or in poems such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Apollinaire's]] ''Calligrammes'' but none of them were a full system like hypergraphy.

=== Letterist film ===
Notwithstanding the considerably more recent origins of film-making, compared to poetry, painting or music, Isou felt in 1950 that its own first amplic phase had already been completed. He therefore set about inaugurating a chiselling phase for the cinema. As he explained in the voiceover to his first film, ''Treatise of Slime and Eternity'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe firstly that the cinema is too rich. It is obese. It has reached its limits, its maximum. With the first movement of widening which it will outline, the cinema will burst! Under the blow of a congestion, this ''greased pig'' will tear into a thousand pieces. I announce the ''destruction of the cinema'', the first apocalyptic sign of disjunction, of rupture, of this corpulent and bloated organization which calls itself film.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two central innovations of Letterist film were: (i) the carving of the image (''la ciselure d'image''), where the film-maker would deliberately scratch or paint onto the actual film stock itself. Similar techniques are also employed in Letterist still photography. (ii) Discrepant cinema (''le cinéma discrépant''), where the soundtrack and the image-track would be separated, each one telling a different story or pursuing its own more abstract path. The most radical of the Letterist films, Wolman's ''The Anticoncept'' and Debord's ''Howls for Sade'', went even further, and abandoned images altogether. From a visual point of view, the former consisted simply of a fluctuating ball of light, projected onto a large balloon, while the latter alternated a blank white screen (when there was speech in the soundtrack) and a totally black screen (accompanying ever-increasing periods of total silence). In addition, the Letterists utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of '[[détournement]]') in Situationist film. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience.

=== Supertemporal art (''L'art supertemporel'') ===
The supertemporal frame was a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.

=== Infinitesimal art (''Art infinitesimal'') ===
Recalling the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the Letterists developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Also called ''Art esthapériste'' ('infinite-aesthetics'). Cf. [[Conceptual Art]]. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

=== Youth uprising (''Le soulèvement de la jeunesse'') ===
Isou identified the amplic phase of political theory and economics as that of [[Adam Smith]] and [[free trade]]; its chiselling phase was that of [[Karl Marx]] and [[socialism]]. Isou termed these 'atomic economics' and 'molecular economics' respectively: he launched 'nuclear economics' as a corrective to both of them. Both currents, he felt, had simply failed to take into account a large part of the population, namely those young people and other 'externs' who neither produced nor exchanged goods or capital in any significant way. He felt that the creative urge was an integral part of human nature, but that, unless it was properly guided, it could be diverted into crime and anti-social behaviour. The Letterists sought to restructure every aspect of society in such a way as to enable these externs to channel their creativity in more positive ways.

== Major developments of Lettrism ==
* The [[Letterist International]] was formed in 1952 by Lettrists [[Guy Debord]], [[Gil J. Wolman]], [[Jean-Louis Brau]] and [[Serge Berna]]. In 1957, it fused with the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] to create the [[Situationist International]]. During its five years, the Letterist International continued to practice the Lettrist technique of [[metagraphy|metagraphics]], although they were quite against [[hypergraphics]], instead developing metagraphics into [[détournement]].&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick Straram, ''La veuve blanche et noire un peu détournée'' (Paris [[Sens &amp; Tonka]], 2006), 21–22, 81–82; ''Figures de la négation'' (Saint-Etienne Métropole: Musée d'Art Moderne, 2004), 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ultra-Lettrist|Ultra-Lettrism]] arose in 1958, its manifesto appearing in the second issue of ''Grammes'' in that year, signed by the Lettrists François Dufrêne, Robert Estivals, and Jacques Villeglé. Its members practiced [[hypergraphics]] and, with Dufrêne's crirhythmes and a greater interest in tape-recording, they sought to push Letterist sound-poetry further than Isou's group had done.&lt;ref&gt;''Figures de la négation'', 118; [[Henri Chopin]], ''Poésie sonore'' (Paris: Jean-Michel Place, 1979), 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Second Letterist International was an ephemeral group formed in 1964 by Wolman, Dufrêne and Brau.&lt;ref&gt;''Figures de la négation'', 76; [[Gil J. Wolman]], ''Défense de mourir'' (Paris: Editions Allia, 2001), 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[New Lettrist International]], unknown form the original lettrists themselves, was formed in the late 1990s. Although it has no direct connection with the original Letterist group, it has drawn influences both from them and from the [[Letterist International]], as well as from [[Hurufi]]sm (Arabic for 'Letterism').

== Key members ==
* [[Isidore Isou]] (Jan 29, 1925–July 28, 2007).
* [[Gabriel Pomerand]] (1926–1972), member from 1945.
* [[François Dufrêne]] (1930–1982), member from 1947 to 1964. Split to form [[Ultra-Lettrist|Ultra-letterism]] and the Second Letterist International.
* [[Jan Kubíček]] (1927–2013), significantly contributing member during the early 1960s.
* [[Maurice Lemaître]] (1926–), member since 1950, and still actively pursuing his own approach to Letterism.
* [[Gil J Wolman]] (1929–1995), member from 1950 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]] 1952-1957], but then returned to occasional participation with Isouian group from 1961 to 1964, before splitting again to form the Second Letterist International.
* [[Jean-Louis Brau]] (1930–1985), member from 1950 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]] 1952-1957], but then returned to occasional participation with Isouian group from 1961 to 1964, before splitting again to form the Second Letterist International.*
* [[Guy Debord]] (1931–1994), member from 1951 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]].
* [[Anton Perich]] (1945-), member from 1967 to 1970.

== Influences ==
* [[Fluxus]] artist [[Ben Vautier]] has openly avowed his indebtedness to Isou: "Isou, I don't deny it, was very important for me around 1958 when I first theorized about art. It was thanks to Isou that I realized that what was important in art was not the beautiful, but the new, the creation. In 1962, while reading ''L'agrégation d'un nom et d'un messie'', I was fascinated by his ego, his megalomania, his pretences. I said to myself then: there is no art without ego, and this is where my work on the ego is rooted."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Art Tribes'', ed. Achille Bonito Oliva (Milan: Skira, 2002), 274n2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German painter, set designer, and writer, [[Mike Rose (painter)|Mike Rose]], developed techniques close to Letterism during the 1970s and 1980s, and had some contact with the Parisian group.
* The film ''Irma Vep'' (1996) contains a sequence that evokes the Lettrist aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arkepix.com/kinok/DVD/ASSAYAS_Olivier/dvd_noise.html (French site)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michael Jacobson's novella ''The Giant's Fence'' [http://www.ubu.com/vp/Jacobson.html] (2006) is a hypergraphic work, apparently inspired by the Letterists.

[[File:Portrait of James I of England and James VI of Scotland.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[James I of England|James VI]] in 1585, aged 19. A major patron of poetry as well as a poet and commentator, his accession to the English throne in 1603 had profound effects on the patronage of Scottish literature and the Scots language]]
'''Literature in early modern Scotland''' is [[Scottish literature|literature]] written in Scotland or by [[List of Scottish writers|Scottish writers]] between the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century and the beginnings of the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution]] in mid-eighteenth century. By the beginning of this era [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]] had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the [[Highlands and Islands]], but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived. [[Middle Scots]] became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. The establishment of a printing press in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.

[[James IV of Scotland|James IV]]'s creation of a [[Renaissance]] court included the patronage of poets, or [[makar]]s, who were mainly clerics. These included [[Gavin Douglas]], whose ''[[Eneados]]'' (1513) was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an [[Old English|Anglian]] language. [[James V of Scotland|James V]] was also a major patron of poets. [[George Buchanan]] founded a tradition of neo-Latin poetry. In the reign of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and the [[Minority reign|minority]] of her son [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. [[Church of Scotland|The Kirk]] discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature but secular poetry survived. In the 1580s and 1590s James VI promoted literature in Scots. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish court poets and musicians, later called the [[Castalian Band]]. David Lyndsay's ''[[A Satire of the Three Estates|The Thrie Estaitis]]'' (1540) is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. There were isolated Scottish plays, but the system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland.

The accession of James VI to the English throne in 1603 meant a loss of the court as a centre of patronage and he increasingly favoured the language of southern England. A number of Scottish poets accompanied the king to London, where they began to [[anglicise]] their written language. As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge, often undertaken by women. The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the ''Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum'' (1637). This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets, such as [[Elizabeth Melville]], whose ''Ane Godlie Dream'' (1603) was the first book published by a woman in Scotland. This was the period when the [[ballad]] emerged as a significant written form in Scotland. From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors.

After the Union in 1707, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] led a "vernacular revival" that laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature. He also led the trend for [[pastoral]] poetry and his pastoral opera ''[[The Gentle Shepherd]]'' was one of the most influential works of the era. Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English. [[Tobias Smollett]] was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but is best known for his [[picaresque novel]]s, for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist. The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry that mixed traditional forms with influences from the Lowlands. Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London. In Scotland drama was supplied by visiting English players and actors, but there were clashes with the Kirk. Ramsay was instrumental in establishing a small theatre in Edinburgh, but it closed soon after the passing of the [[Licensing Act 1737|1737 Licensing Act]]. A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s.

===Background===
[[File:Device_of_Androw_Myllar.png|upright|thumb|The device of the printer [[Androw Myllar|Andrew Myllar]] from ''The Porteous of Nobleness'']]
By the early modern era [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]] had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the [[Highlands and Islands]].&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp60-1&gt;J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp. 60–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland, with the last fully competent member of the [[MacMhuirich bardic family|MacMhuirich dynasty]], who were hereditary poets to the [[Lords of the Isles]] and then the [[Clan Donald|Donalds of Clanranald]], still working in the early eighteenth century. Nevertheless, interest in the sponsorship of [[panegyric]] Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2001pp255-7&gt;J. MacDonald, "Gaelic literature" in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;255–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by [[Middle Scots]], which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Middle Scots was derived substantially from [[Old English]], with Gaelic and French influences. It was usually called ''Inglyshe'' and was very close to the language spoken in northern England,&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp60-1/&gt; but by the sixteenth century it had established [[orthography|orthographic]] and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England.&lt;ref&gt;J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, "A Brief History of Scots" in J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, eds, ''The Edinburgh Companion to Scots'' (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1596-2}}, p. 9ff.&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing [[Standard English]] of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, "A Brief History of Scots", p. 10ff.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.&lt;ref name="Scots' 2003 p. 11"&gt;Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, "A Brief History of Scots", p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of a printing press under royal patent in 1507 would begin to make it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.&lt;ref name=Bawcutt&amp;Williams2006pp26-9&gt;P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, ''A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry'' (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), {{ISBN|1-84384-096-0}}, pp. 26–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Scottish press was established in [[Cowgate|Southgait]] in Edinburgh by the merchant [[Walter Chepman]] (c. 1473–c. 1528) and the bookseller [[Androw Myllar|Andrew Myllar]] (fl. 1505–08). Although the first press was relatively short lived, beside law codes and religious works, the press also produced editions of the work of Scottish [[makar]]s before its demise, probably about 1510. The next recorded press was that of [[Thomas Davidson (printer)|Thomas Davidson]] (f. 1532–42), the first in a long line of "king's printers", who also produced editions of works of the makars.&lt;ref name=MacQuarrie2001pp491-3&gt;A. MacQuarrie, "Printing and publishing", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;491–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Makars===
{{Main|Makar}}
[[James IV of Scotland|James IV]]'s (r. 1488–1513) creation of a [[Renaissance]] court included the patronage of poets. These court poets, or makars, who were mainly clerics included [[Robert Henryson]] (c. 1450-c. 1505), who re-worked Medieval and Classical sources, such as [[Chaucer]] and [[Aesop]] in works such as his ''Testament of Cresseid'' and ''The Morall Fabillis''. [[William Dunbar]] (1460–1513) produced satires, lyrics, invectives and dream visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind. [[Gavin Douglas]] (1475–1522), who became [[Bishop of Dunkeld]], injected [[Humanism|humanist]] concerns and classical sources into his poetry.&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp129-30&gt;T. van Heijnsbergen, "Culture: 9 Renaissance and Reformation: poetry to 1603", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;129–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Douglas's version of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the ''[[Eneados]]''. It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]] that brought the reign to an end.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', pp. 60–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal of Gavin Douglas.jpg|thumb|left|The seal of [[Gavin Douglas]] as [[Bishop of Dunkeld]]]]
As a patron of poets and authors [[James V of Scotland|James V]] (r. 1513–42) supported William Stewart and [[John Bellenden]], who translated the Latin ''History of Scotland'' compiled in 1527 by [[Hector Boece]], into verse and prose.&lt;ref name=Brownetalpp256-7/&gt; [[David Lyndsay]] (c. 1486–1555), diplomat and the head of the [[Lyon Court]], was a prolific poet. He wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires.&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp129-30/&gt; [[George Buchanan]] (1506–82) had a major influence as a Latin poet, founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=Mason2001pp120-3&gt;R. Mason, "Culture: 4 Renaissance and Reformation (1460–1660): general", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;120–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary [[John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane|John Maitland]] (1537–95), reformer [[Andrew Melville]] (1545–1622), [[John Johnston (poet)|John Johnston]] (1570?–1611) and [[David Hume of Godscroft]] (1558–1629).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/research/historyresearch/researchprojects/delitiaepoetarumscotorum/ "Bridging the Continental divide: neo-Latin and its cultural role in Jacobean Scotland, as seen in the ''Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum'' (1637)"], ''University of Glasgow'', retrieved 23 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1550s, in the reign of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (r. 1542–67) and the [[Minority reign|minority]] of her son [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] (r. 1567–1625), cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. The [[Church of Scotland|Kirk]], heavily influenced by [[Calvinism]], also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature. Nevertheless, poets from this period included [[Richard Maitland]] of Lethington (1496–1586), who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar; [[John Rolland]] (fl. 1530–75), who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister [[Alexander Hume]] (c. 1556–1609), whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and [[Epistolary poem|epistolary verse]]. [[Alexander Scott (16th-century poet)|Alexander Scott]]'s (?1520–82/3) use of short verse designed to be sung to music, opened the way for the Castalian poets of James VI's adult reign.&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp129-30/&gt;

Unlike many of his predecessors, James VI actively despised Gaelic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1580s and 1590s he strongly promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots. His treatise, ''[[Reulis and Cautelis|Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody]]'', published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, to which he applied Renaissance principles.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. S. Jack, "Poetry under King James VI", in C. Cairns, ed., ''The History of Scottish Literature'' (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, {{ISBN|0-08-037728-9}}, pp. 126–7.&lt;/ref&gt; He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] court poets and musicians, later called the [[Castalian Band]], which included [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]] (c. 1560–1612), [[John Stewart of Baldynneis]] (c. 1545–c. 1605), and [[Alexander Montgomerie]] (c. 1550–98).&lt;ref&gt;R. D. S. Jack, ''Alexander Montgomerie'' (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1985), {{ISBN|0-7073-0367-2}}, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including [[sonnet]]s and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed in this vein included [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] (c. 1567–1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567–1627) and [[Robert Aytoun|Robert Ayton]] (1570–1627).&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp129-30/&gt; By the late 1590s the king's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, "Poetry under King James VI", p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dramatists===

Lyndsay produced an interlude at [[Linlithgow Palace]] for the king and queen thought to be a version of his play ''[[A Satire of the Three Estates|The Thrie Estaitis]]'' in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation.&lt;ref name=Brownetalpp256-7&gt;I.

==Seventeenth century==

===Poetry===
Having extolled the virtues of Scots "poesie", after his accession to the English throne, James VI increasingly favoured the language of southern England. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the English [[Authorised King James Version]] of the Bible. In 1617 interpreters were declared no longer necessary in the port of London because Scots and Englishmen were now "not so far different bot ane understandeth ane uther". [[Jenny Wormald]] described James as creating a "three-tier system, with Gaelic at the bottom and English at the top".&lt;ref name=Wormald1991pp192-3&gt;Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625'', pp. 192–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the court as a centre of patronage in 1603 was a major blow to Scottish literature. A number of Scottish poets, including William Alexander, John Murray and Robert Aytoun, accompanied the king to London, where they continued to write,&lt;ref name=Brown2003pp253-4&gt;K. M. Brown, "Scottish identity", in B. Bradshaw and P. Roberts, eds, ''British Consciousness and Identity: The Making of Britain, 1533–1707'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-521-89361-5}}, pp. 253–3.&lt;/ref&gt; but they soon began to [[anglicise]] their written language.&lt;ref&gt;M. Spiller, "Poetry after the Union 1603–1660" in C. Cairns, ed., ''The History of Scottish Literature'' (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, {{ISBN|0-08-037728-9}}, pp. 141–52.&lt;/ref&gt; James's characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the English court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign,&lt;ref&gt;N. Rhodes, "Wrapped in the Strong Arm of the Union: Shakespeare and King James" in W. Maley and A. Murphy, eds, ''Shakespeare and Scotland'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7190-6636-0}}, pp. 38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; but his patronage for the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|high style]] in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, "Poetry under King James VI", pp. 137–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The only significant court poet to continue to work in Scotland after the king's departure was [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] (1585–1649).&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp127-8/&gt;

[[File:William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]], statesman and author]]
As the tradition of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely fixed in the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used [[Syllabic verse|syllabic metre]], vernacular poets tended to use [[Accentual verse|stressed metre]]. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women,&lt;ref&gt;K. Chedgzoy, ''Women's Writing in the British Atlantic World'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|1-139-46714-X}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2001pp255-7/&gt;

The tradition of neo-Latin poetry reached its fruition with the publication of the anthology of the ''Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum'' (1637), published in Amsterdam by [[Arthur Johnston (poet)|Arthur Johnston]] (c.1579–1641) and [[Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet]] (1585–1670) and containing work by the major Scottish practitioners since Buchanan.&lt;ref name=Mason2001pp120-3/&gt; This period was marked by the work of the first named female Scottish poets.&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp127-8&gt;T. van Heijnsbergen, "Culture: 7 Renaissance and Reformation (1460–1660): literature", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-211696-7}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;127–8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Melville]]'s (f. 1585–1630) ''Ane Godlie Dream'' (1603) was a popular religious allegory and the first book published by a woman in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;I. Mortimer, ''The Time Traveller's Guide to Elizabethan England'' (Random House, 2012), {{ISBN|1-84792-114-0}}, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Hume]], daughter of David Hume of Godscroft, adapted [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Triumphs]]'' as ''Triumphs of Love: Chastitie: Death'' (1644).&lt;ref name=vanHeijnsbergen2001pp127-8/&gt;

This was the period when the [[ballad]] emerged as a significant written form in Scotland. Some ballads may date back to the late medieval era and deal with events and people that can be traced back as far as the thirteenth century, including "[[Sir Patrick Spens]]" and "[[Thomas the Rhymer]]", but which are not known to have existed until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lyle, ''Scottish Ballads'' (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2001), {{ISBN|0-86241-477-6}}, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; They were probably composed and transmitted orally and only began to be written down and printed, often as [[broadside ballad|broadsides]] and as part of [[chapbooks]], later being recorded and noted in books by collectors including [[Robert Burns]] and [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Crawford, ''Scotland's Books: a History of Scottish Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-538623-X}}, pp. 216–9.&lt;/ref&gt; From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including [[Robert Sempill the younger|Robert Sempill]] (c. 1595-c. 1665), [[Elizabeth, Lady Wardlaw|Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw]] (1627–1727) and [[Grizel Baillie|Lady Grizel Baillie]] (1645–1746).&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, ''Scotland's Books'', pp. 224, 248 and 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of a royal court also meant there was no force to counter the Kirk's dislike of theatre, which struggled to survive in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Brown2003pp253-4/&gt; However, it was not entirely extinguished. The Kirk used theatre for its own purposes in schools and was slow to suppress popular [[folk drama]]s.&lt;ref name=Brown2011pp1-3/&gt; Surviving plays for the period include William Alexander's ''Monarchicke Tragedies'', written just before his departure with the king for England in 1603. They were [[closet drama]]s, designed to be read rather than performed, and already indicate Alexander's preference for southern English over the Scots language.&lt;ref name=Carpenter2011p15/&gt; There were some attempts to revive Scottish drama. In 1663 Edinburgh lawyer William Clerke wrote ''Marciano or the Discovery'', a play about the restoration of a legitimate dynasty in Florence after many years of civil war. It was performed at the Tennis-Court Theatre at [[Holyrood Palace]] before the parliamentary high commissioner [[John Leslie, 1st Duke of Rothes|John Leslie, Earl of Rothes]].&lt;ref&gt;C.

==Early eighteenth century==

===Vernacular revival===
{{Main|Allan Ramsay (poet)}}
After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Union in 1707]] and the shift of political power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education.&lt;ref&gt;C. Jones, ''A Language Suppressed: The Pronunciation of the Scots Language in the 18th Century'' (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1976, 1993), {{ISBN|0-85976-427-3}}, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, "A Brief History of Scots", p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686–1758) was considered the most important literary figure of the era, often described as leading a "vernacular revival". He laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, publishing ''The Ever Green'' (1724), a collection that included many major poetic works of the Stewart period.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Hogg, ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), {{ISBN|0-521-26478-2}}, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He led the trend for [[pastoral]] poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]], which would be later be used by Robert Burns as a [[poetic form]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius:  Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Tea-Table Miscellany'' (1724–37) contained poems old Scots folk material, his own poems in the folk style and "gentilizings" of Scots poems in the English neo-classical style.&lt;ref&gt;D. Dachies, "Poetry in Scots: Brus to Burns" in C. R. Woodring and J. S. Shapiro, eds, ''The Columbia History of British Poetry'' (Columbia University Press, 1994), {{ISBN|0-585-04155-5}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; His pastoral opera ''[[The Gentle Shepherd]]'' was one of the most influential works of the era.&lt;ref name=Brown2011bpp28-9/&gt; He would also play a leading role in supporting drama in Scotland and the attempt to found a permanent theatre in the capital.&lt;ref name=Bell2007p288&gt;B. Bell, "The national drama, Joanna Baille and the national theatre", in I. Brown, ''The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire, 1707–1918'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2007), {{ISBN|0-7486-2481-3}}, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse and prose===
Ramsay was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English. These included [[William Hamilton (comic poet)|William Hamilton of Gilbertfield]] (c. 1665–1751), Robert Crawford (1695–1733), [[Alexander Ross (poet)|Alexander Ross]] (1699–1784), the Jacobite [[William Hamilton (Jacobite poet)|William Hamilton]] of Bangour (1704–54), socialite [[Alison Rutherford|Alison Rutherford Cockburn]] (1712–94), and poet and playwright [[James Thompson (poet)|James Thompson]]'s (1700–48), most famous for the nature poetry of his ''Seasons''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Maclachlan, ''Before Burns'' (Canongate Books, 2010), {{ISBN|1-84767-466-6}}, pp. ix–xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tobias Smollett]] (1721–71) was a poet, essayist, satirist and playwright, but is best known for his [[picaresque novel]]s, such as ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]]'' (1748) and ''[[The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]]'' (1751) for which he is often seen as Scotland's first novelist.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Beasley, ''Tobias Smollett: Novelist'' (University of Georgia Press, 1998), {{ISBN|0-8203-1971-6}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His work would be a major influence on later novelists such as [[Thackeray]] and [[Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, ''Scotland's Books'', p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allan-Ramsay.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Alan Ramsay]], the most influential literary figure in early eighteenth-century Scotland]]
The early eighteenth century was also a period of innovation in Gaelic vernacular poetry. Major figures included [[Rob Donn|Rob Donn Mackay]] (1714–78) and [[Donnchadh Bàn Mac an t-Saoir]] (Duncan Ban MacIntyre) (1724–1812). The most significant figure in the tradition was [[Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair]] (Alasdair MacDonald) (c. 1698–1770). His interest in traditional forms can be seen in his most significant poem ''Clanranald's Gallery''. He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands, including Thompson's ''Seasons'', which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic, which was not focused on their relations to human concerns.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2001pp255-7/&gt;

===Drama===
{{Main|Theatre of Scotland}}
Drama was pursued by Scottish playwrights in London such as [[Catherine Trotter]] (1679–1749), born in London to Scottish parents and later moving to Aberdeen. Her plays and included the verse-tragedy ''Fatal Friendship'' (1698), the comedy ''Love at a Loss'' (1700) and the history ''The Revolution in Sweden'' (1706). David Crawford's (1665–1726) plays included the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration comedies]] ''Courtship A-la-Mode'' (1700) and ''Love at First Sight'' (1704). These developed the character of the stage Scot, often a clown, but cunning and loyal. [[Newburgh Hamilton]] (1691–1761), born in Ireland of Scottish descent, produced the comedies ''The Petticoat-Ploter'' (1712) and ''The Doating Lovers'' or ''The Libertine'' (1715). He later wrote the libretto for Handel's ''[[Samson (Handel)|Samson]]'' (1743), closely based on [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Samson Agonistes]]''. James Thompson's plays often dealt with the contest between public duty and private feelings, included ''Sophonisba'' (1730), ''Agamemnon'' (1738) and ''Tancrid and Sigismuda'' (1745), the last of which was an international success. [[David Mallet (writer)|David Mallet]]'s (c. 1705–65) ''[[Eurydice]]'' (1731) was accused of being a coded Jacobite play and his later work indicates opposition to the [[Robert Walpole|Walpole]] administration. The opera ''[[Masque of Alfred]]'' (1740) was a collaboration between Thompson, Mallet and composer [[Thomas Arne]], with Thompson supplying the lyrics for his most famous work, the patriotic song ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]''&lt;ref name=Brown2011bpp30-31&gt;I. Brown, "Public and private performance: 1650–1800", in I. Brown, ed., ''The Edinburgh Companion to Scottish Drama'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0-7486-4107-6}}, pp. 30–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland a troop of English players came to Edinburgh in 1715 where they performed ''Macbeth'' and a series of Restoration comedies, but they soon left, perhaps because of objections from local kirk presbyteries. By 1725 English actor [[Anthony Aston]], a friend of Ramsay, was performing in Edinburgh, but seems to have fallen foul of the Scottish [[Master of the Revels]], who licensed plays, companies and playhouses, and soon left. In 1727 the Kirk attacked theatres as immoral in the ''Admonition and Exhortation''. The Edinburgh Company of Players were able to perform in Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen and regular performances at the Taylor's Hall in Edinburgh under the protection of a Royal Patent.&lt;ref name=Brown2011bpp28-9/&gt; Ramsay was instrumental in establishing them in a small theatre in Carruber's Close in Edinburgh,&lt;ref name=Garlick2004pp170-1&gt;G. Garlick, "Theatre outside London, 1660–1775", in J. Milling, P. Thomson and J. Donohue, eds, ''The Cambridge History of British Theatre, Volume 2'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0-521-65068-2}}, pp. 170–1.&lt;/ref&gt; but the passing of the [[Licensing Act 1737|1737 Licensing Act]] made their activities illegal and the theatre soon closed.&lt;ref name=Bell2007p288/&gt; A new theatre was opened at Cannongate in 1747 and operated without a licence into the 1760s.&lt;ref name=Garlick2004pp170-1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">[[Image:bse bible.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the ''Bury St Edmunds Bible'' (c. 1135) by Master Hugo]]

'''Master Hugo''' (fl. c.1130-c.1150) was a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] lay and the earliest recorded professional artist in England.

His documented career at [[Bury St Edmunds Abbey]] spans from before 1136 to after 1148. He is most famous for illuminating the first volume of the [[Bury Bible]], which "have led to a general acknowledgement of Master Hugo as the gifted innovator of the main line of English [[Romanesque art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth C. Parker, ''Master Hugo as Sculptor: A Source for the Style of the Bury Bible'', [[GESTA]], XX/1, 1981, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/766832 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was made for the Abbey in about 1135, and is now in the [[Parker Library]] of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]], [[Cambridge]]; it is not known whether he illuminated the second volume, of which only a small fragment is known to survive, now in a private collection in the USA. He is also recorded as making [[bronze]] doors for the western entry of the Abbey church, a great bell and a carved [[crucifix]] with figures of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[John the Evangelist|Saint John]], for the Monk's Choir (probably a [[rood]]). He has been credited with having made the ivory [[Cloisters Cross]] (or "Bury St. Edmunds Cross"), now at [[The Cloisters]], New York,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hoving, ''King of the Confessors: A New Appraisal.'' cybereditions.com. Christchurch, New Zealand: 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known where Master Hugo was born or trained. According to the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], "the magnificent colour patterns of his paintings, the startlingly new Byzantine draperies and the deep-staring eyes of Moses, Aaron and the Jews suggest that he had travelled at least to southern Italy and probably also to Cyprus, Byzantium, and even the Holy Land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/cambridgeilluminations/themes/2.html|title=The Bible and Its Study: From the Cloisters to the University|publisher=[[Fitzwilliam Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memling Triptych of Family Moreel.jpg|thumb|560px|Hans Memling, ''Moreel Triptych'', 1484. [[oil painting|Oil]]-on-wood, 291cm x 121.1cm]]
[[File:Hans Memling - Triptych of the Family Moreel (closed) - WGA14933.jpg|thumb|300px|Exterior panels; [[John the Baptist]] (left) and [[Saint George]] (right)]]
The '''''Moreel Triptych''''' (or the '''''Saint Christopher Altarpiece''''') is the name given to a 1484 panel painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]] (d. 1494). It was [[Donor portrait|commissioned]] by the prominent Bruges politician, merchant and banker Willem Moreel (d. 1501) and his wife Barbara van Vlaenderberch, née van Hertsvelde (d. 1499). It was intended as their [[epitaph]] at the chapel&lt;ref name="b100"&gt;Blum, 100&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[St. James's Church, Bruges]], an extension they paid for, to the funerary church of Willem's family, where the couple intended to be interred in an underground tomb before the altar.

The inner center panel of the [[triptych]] altarpiece show [[Saint Christopher]] holding the [[Christ Child]], with [[Saint Maurus]] to his left and Saint Gills to his right. Willem Moreel kneels in prayer and venerating the saints in the left-hand panel with their five sons. Barbara kneels with eleven of their daughters on the right panel. The exterior panels are probably an early 16th-century addition, completed after the donor's and artist's deaths.

The triptych was installed on the altar of St. James's Church in 1484.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;Pearson, Andrea. ''Envisioning Gender in Burgundian Devotional Art, 1350–1530''. Ashgate, 2005. {{ISBN|978-07-5465-154-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in its original frames, which are each inscribed with the words ''anno Domini 1484'', or a variant containing the year, on their lower borders.&lt;ref name="r352" /&gt; The altarpiece has a strong association with the [[Benedictine]] order; three of the figures are Benedictine monks or saints.&lt;ref name="b101"&gt;Blum, 101&lt;/ref&gt; It is to dedicated to [[Saint Maurus]] and St Giles, the latter a Benedictine hermit. Today the work is located in the [[Groeningemuseum]] in Bruges.

[[File: Hans Memling - Portraits of Willem Moreel and His Wife - WGA14854.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Hans Memling, ''Portrait of the family Moreel'', 1482. Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The family of Willem Moreel are known to have lived in Bruges since the 13th century.&lt;ref name="b97"&gt;Blum, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Willem inherited land and a title lord of Oostcleyhem from his father. During his career he was twice appointed both [[alderman]] and [[burgomaster]] of the city, as well as its [[bailiff]] and later its [[treasurer]]. He was named as one of the fortieth riches men in the city in a 1490 tax list. The couple has eighteen children.  Memling earlier portrayed the couple in 1482, with a pair of panel portraits now in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]].

Saint James's Church was his family's burial ground and was founded in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="b100" /&gt; It underwent a major reconstruction in the late 15th century, which Willem Moreel partly financed along with members of the prominent [[Portinari Altarpiece|Portinari]], Gros and Moor families.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; The couple intended to be buried with the church building, in a chapel they had paid for and dedicated to saints Gills and Maurus, with space left before the altar as burial space for two people. To the same end, they commissioned the triptych from Memling, then a highly prominent, prestigious and sought-after painter, to be placed on the chapel altar, and only interred in the chapel in 1504, at the request of their son John.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; Barbara died in 1899, he followed in 1501.&lt;ref name="b98"&gt;Blum, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moreels did not at first get their wishes as to their burial places. Their standing and political security hamper by the struggles after the deaths of [[Charles the Bold]] in 1477 and [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1482 and the struggle with [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Austria]]. Willem was a prominent adversary of Maximilian, and was imprisoned in October 1481 for six months.&lt;ref name="r356"&gt;Ridderbos et al, 356&lt;/ref&gt; On their deaths, were each buried on exterior church grounds.&lt;ref name="b98" /&gt; They were not moved to their intended resting places in front of the chapel altar until 1504.

==Interior==
The inner panels share a continuous overcast skyline and broad landscape,&lt;ref name="r352"&gt;Ridderbos et all, 352&lt;/ref&gt; which contains two city-scapes, cottages and a meadow with a variety of trees animals and wild strawberries, daisies, daffodils and other recognisable flowers and plants.&lt;ref name="m141"&gt;Michiels, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the sense of harmony, both wing panels are identically composed, excepting the number of children.&lt;ref name="j163"&gt;Jacobs, 163&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen of the couple's eighteen children are shown in total. However, some of the figures are later additions, painted over the first layers of oil and pigment.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

The figures were identified in the mid 19th century by James H. Weale through their facial characteristics and extant established portraits, through the commonality of Christian names from family names to some of the saints, city records, and the examination of headstones in the Saint James graveyard.&lt;ref name="r356" /&gt;

The inner panels are in relatively good condition for late 15th-century oil paintings, but have suffered some damage and paint loss, and have been depreciated by ill-advised restorations and touch-up work.&lt;ref name="m141"&gt;Michiels, 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center panel===
[[File:Hans Memling - Triptych of the Family Moreel (central panel) - WGA14930.jpg|320px|thumb|Center panel with Saint Christopher, and Saint Maurus 
to his left and Saint Gills to the right&lt;ref name="j163" /&gt;]]
The central figure is [[Saint Christopher]], patron saint of travelers, who shares his feast day, July 25, with Saint James, after whom the containing church is named.&lt;ref name="b100" /&gt; He is shown standing in water as he crosses a river or inlet, carrying the [[Child Jesus]] on his shoulders. He is presented with his attributes, including a large staff, a symbol of Christ's miraculous presence,&lt;ref name="b101" /&gt; and is intended as a protector against sudden death.&lt;ref name="vp"&gt;"[http://vlaamseprimitieven.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/collection/moreel-triptych Moreel Triptych]". [[Flemish Art Collection]]. Retrieved 16 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher is dressed in a blue coat, covered with a long red cape folded over his right shoulder. He closely resembles depictions in both [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' and now lost ''[[Saint Christopher (after van Eyck)|Saint Christopher]]'', by whom Memling was deeply influenced by.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kmska.be/en/collectie/Restauratie/Hans_Memling/Over_het_kunstwerk.html The Paintings]". [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]. Retrieved 16 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On the left is Saint Maurus who holds a [[crosier]] and looks at an open book. Saint Gills stands to the right, standing with his attributes, an arrow and a [[deer|doe]].&lt;ref name="r352" /&gt; Both are dressed in long black robes and are holding books.

===Left panel===
[[File:Hans Memling 069.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Left panel, with Willem Moreel, sons, and Saint Wilhemus van Maleval]]
The left interior wing shows Willem Moreel kneeling, his hands clasped in prayer, before an open prayer book. His hair is short in a [[bowl cut]],&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt;  wears a fur-lined dress and black [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]], a very fashionable outfit in the 1480s. Behind him are his five male children, also shown kneeling. Of the sons, two are known to have died in infancy. Willem was the oldest, while John and George are thought to have commissioned the outer panels after their parents' death (see below).

The Moreels are presented by Saint Wilhemus van Maleval,&lt;ref name="vp" /&gt; who stands among them, dressed a fur-lined black coat over army clothing.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt; He places his hand on Willem's shoulder, as he guides and presents him to Christopher in the center panel.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

===Right panel===
[[File:Hans Memling 071.jpg|thumb|180px|Right panel with Barbara Moreel, daughters, and Saint Barbara]]
The right interior wing presents Barbara Moreel with her eleven of her thirteen daughters,&lt;ref name="j163" /&gt; who all also kneel in prayer before an open book. Barbara wears a truncated [[hennin]], a [[damask]] silk dress with a white collar, and a wide red belt with a golden buckle. They are presented by [[Saint Barbara]], patron of the donor's wife,&lt;ref name="r355"&gt;Ridderbos et all, 355&lt;/ref&gt; who is shown standing before the tower where she was, by legend, imprisoned, which through innovative use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], she seems to hold in her hand.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Hans Memling 049.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Hans Membling, ''[[Sibylla Sambetha]]'', 1480]]--&gt;
One of the daughters, Catherine, earlier posed for Memling's 1480 ''[[Sibylla Sambetha]]''.&lt;ref name="m141" /&gt; The eldest daughter, shown directly behind Barbra, and also in a black dress, is known to have become a Dominican nun. The girl in the light brown clothing, black v-neck and transparent [[veil]] has been identified as Maria from her name written in her headband, their second born daughter, given her linear position in the painting. Genealogical research notes that the couple has two daughters named Marie; but is assumed one died in infancy and the second was named after her. Efforts to name other of the daughters have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="r360"&gt;Ridderbos et al, 360&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the daughters were painted by Memling; examination by the art historian Dirk De Vos identifies at least six that are later additions, layered over the original landscape. Some of these additions can be explained by daughters born after the 1484 completion date, and were probably added by members of Memling's workshop. The left-hand panel containing sons underwent similar updated.&lt;ref name="r360" /&gt;

==Exterior==
The outer part of the wings contains [[grisaille]] representations of [[John the Baptist]] with his lamb and staff (left wing) and [[Saint George]] in full [[armour]], slaying the dragon (right wing) with a lance. The panels may have been completed after the deaths of Willem and Barbara, and dated as c 1504 by a number of art historians, probably commissioned by two of their sons,&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Blum considers this "highly likely". See Blum, 102&lt;/ref&gt; Jan (John) and Jaris (George), as the final, successful, effort to have their parents interred within the chapel space.&lt;ref name="b102"&gt;Blum, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osman Nuri Pasha''' (c.1839 in [[Istanbul]] &amp;ndash; 1906 in Istanbul) was a Turkish painter and military officer. While his birth date has not been established, it is on record that he received his education in Istanbul, attending the [[Turkish Military Academy]]. In 1857, he received an appointment as [[court painter]]; serving under Sultans [[Abdülmecid I]] and [[Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire|Abdülaziz]], who gave him paintings by European artists, to serve as examples for his work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vweaF4UgvQ8C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=osman+nuri+pasha+painter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tTZv_0YSB_&amp;sig=2U2EJ-A_JBdBEPlB5gp4pxdFqj8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z46VVZ-lDIWzogSG6a74Dw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=osman%20nuri%20pasha%20painter&amp;f=false Excerpt from ''Ottoman Painting'' by Wendy Shaw] @ GoogleBooks.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a court painter he was eventually promoted to Brigadier General (Tuğgeneral) and became an art teacher at [[Kuleli Military High School]]. Most of Turkey's best-known painters were among his students, including [[Ahmet Ziya Akbulut]], [[Hodja Ali Rıza]] and [[Hüseyin Zekai Pasha]]. In 1877, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]], he served as a military commander.

Although he painted landscapes, most of his paintings deal with military subjects; notably battles and warships. These include his depiction of the [[Battle of Preveza]] (which was one of the first Turkish paintings to use Western-style oil techniques) and the sinking of the frigate ''[[Ottoman frigate Ertuğrul|Ertuğrul]]'', following a good-will mission to Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9000">The '''Photo League''' was a cooperative of photographers in New York who banded together around a range of common social and creative causes. The League was active from 1936 to 1951 and included among its members some of the most noted American photographers of the mid-20th century.

== History ==

The League’s origins traced back to a project of the [[Workers International Relief]] (WIR), which was a communist association based in Berlin. In 1930 the WIR established the Worker’s Camera League in New York City, which soon came to be known as the [[Workers Film and Photo League|Film and Photo League]]. The goals of the Film and Photo League were to “struggle against and expose reactionary film; to produce documentary films reflecting the lives and struggles of the American workers; and to spread and popularize the great artistic and revolutionary Soviet productions.”&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite book|first=Anne|last=Tucker|authorlink=Anne Wilkes Tucker|title=The Photo League: Photography as a Social Force|publisher="Modern Photography"|date=September 1979|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 the still photographers and the filmmakers in the League began having differences of opinion over social and production interests, and by 1936 they had formed separate groups. [[Paul Strand]] and [[Ralph Steiner]] established Frontier Films, to continue promoting the original goals, while at the same time Strand and [[Berenice Abbott]] renamed the original group “The Photo League”.  The two organizations remained friendly, with members from one group often participating in activities of the other. The goal of the newly reformed Photo League was to “put the camera back into the hands of honest photographers who ... use it to photograph America.”&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

The League quickly became active in the new field of socially conscious photography. Unlike other photography organizations, it did not espouse a particular visual style but instead focused on “integrating formal elements of design and visual aesthetics with the powerful and sympathetic evidence of the human condition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Betsi Meissner|title=Original Sources: Art and Archives at the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=2002|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also offered basic and advanced classes in photography when there were few such courses in colleges or trade schools. A newsletter, called ''Photo Notes'', was printed on a somewhat random schedule depending upon who was available to do the work and if they could afford the printing costs. More than anything else, though, the League was a gathering place for photographers to share and experience their common artistic and social interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Wilkes Tucker|Tucker]] (2001), p 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its members were co-founders [[Sol Libsohn]] and [[Sid Grossman]] (director of the Photo League School); [[Walter Rosenblum]], editor of the Photo League ''Photo Notes''; [[Eliot Elisofon]], a [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine photographer; [[Morris Engel]] (since 1936); [[Jerome Liebling]], who joined in 1947; [[Aaron Siskind]]; Jack Manning, a member of the Harlem Document Group of the League and a ''New York Times'' photographer; [[Dan Weiner]]; Bill Witt; [[Martin Elkort]]; [[Lou Bernstein]]; [[Arthur Leipzig]] (since 1942); [[Sy Kattelson]]; [[Louis Stettner]]; Lester Talkington (from 1947); [[Lisette Model]]; and [[Ruth Orkin]], a member from 1947.&lt;ref&gt;These are the names singled out by Time-Life in their volume on the documentary (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual for artist groups at the time, approximately one-third of League members and participants were women and they served in visible leadership roles such as secretary, treasurer, vice president, and president. For example, [[Lucy Ashjian]], who joined the League as early as 1936, served as ''Photos Notes'' editor and board chair of the League's school.&lt;ref name="Klein-Evans"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1=Mason |last2=Evans |first2=Catherine |date=2011 |title= The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951 |chapter=As Good as the Guys: The Women of the Photo League |publisher=Yale University Press and The Jewish Museum |isbn=978-0-300-14687-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the list of notable photographers who were active in the League or supported their activities also included [[Margaret Bourke-White]], [[W. Eugene Smith]], [[Helen Levitt]], FSA photographer [[Arthur Rothstein]], [[Beaumont Newhall]], [[Nancy Newhall]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Weegee]], [[Robert Frank]], [[Harold Feinstein]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Edward Weston]] and [[Minor White]]. The League was the caretaker of the [[Lewis Hine]] Memorial Collection, which Hine's son had given the League in recognition of their role in fostering social activism through photography as his father had done.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Wilkes Tucker|Tucker]] (2001), p 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the members who joined before the end of [[World War II]] were first-generation Americans who strongly believed in progressive political and social causes. Few were aware of the political origins of the movement of the communist "Workers as Photographers" (''Arbeiterfotografen'') in Berlin. This had in fact little to do with what the organization did as it evolved, but helped its downfall after the war, when it was accused by the FBI of being communist and "subversive and anti-American." 
In 1947 the League was formally declared subversive and placed on the U.S. Department of Justice [[blacklist]] by Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]]. At first the League fought back and mounted an impressive ''This Is the Photo League'' exhibition in 1948, but after its member and long-time FBI informer [[Angela Calomiris]] had testified in May 1949 that the League was a front organization for the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], the Photo League was finished. Recruitment dried up and old members left, including one of its founders and former president, [[Paul Strand]], as well as Louis Stettner. The League disbanded in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/art/photo/league/index.html ''Where Do We Go from Here? The Photo League and Its Legacy 1936–2006'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After the League’s demise, and coupled with the return of more women to domestic roles in the Post-War era, the careers of many promising women artists, such as [[Sonia Handelman Meyer]] and [[Rae Russel]], did not continue.&lt;ref name="Klein-Evans"/&gt;

The Photo League was the subject of a 2012 documentary film: ''Ordinary Miracles: The Photo League's New York'' by filmmakers Daniel Allentuck and [[Nina Rosenblum]]. The film traces the rise and demise of the Photo League between 1936 and 1951, and includes interviews with surviving members and a soundtrack including [[Woody Guthrie]], the [[Andrews Sisters]], and the [[Mills Brothers]].  ''[[Cineaste Magazine]]'' calls the film a "fine addition to the library of documentaries dedicated to remembering the cultural work of the old left."&lt;ref&gt;Cineaste, Vol. XXXVII No. 4. Fall 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;80 [See: www.thephotoleaguefilm.com; www.imdb.com/title/tt2123262]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since most forms of Western music can make use of the piano, pianists have a wide [[Piano repertoire|repertoire]] and a wide variery of styles to choose from, among them traditional [[classical music]], [[jazz piano|jazz]], [[blues piano|blues]], and all sorts of [[popular music]], including [[rock music|rock and roll]]. Most pianists can, to an extent, easily play other [[musical keyboard|keyboard]]-related instruments such as the [[synthesizer]], [[harpsichord]], [[celesta]], and the [[organ (music)|organ]].

==Pianists past and present==
Modern [[classical music|classical]] pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching, and learning new works to expand their repertoire. They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century. Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and [[chamber music]], while others (though comparatively few) will perform as full-time soloists.

==Classical ==
[[File:Ian Parker.jpg|thumb|300px|Canadian pianist [[Ian Parker (Canadian pianist)|Ian Parker]] performing [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1]] with the Maui Pops Orchestra in 2016|alt=A man plays a piano with enthusiasm, his left hand raised in preparation for striking keys; behind him, the string section of an orchestra plays accompaniment.]]
[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] could be considered the first "concert pianist" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]] from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era,  [[Liszt]], [[Brahms]], [[Chopin]], [[Mendelssohn]] and [[Rachmaninoff]]. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and [[Hans von Bülow]]. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.

==Jazz ==
[[File:Tord Gustavsen (221258).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tord Gustavsen]] playing piano during a concert at the 2016 [[Oslo Jazzfestival|Oslo Jazz Festival]] in Norway
|alt=A black-and-white photo of a man playing a piano; he is hunched over it and is concentrating deeply.]]Jazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is more free than that of  classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known jazz pianists include [[Art Tatum]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Bud Powell]].

==Pop==
Popular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.), session musicians, arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include [[Victor Borge]] who performed as a comedian; [[Richard Clayderman]], who is known for his covers of popular tunes; and singer and entertainer [[Liberace]], who at the height of his fame, was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world.

==Amateur pianism==
[[File:Johnny_Hahn_January_2012.JPG|thumb|225px|An amateur pianist playing outdoors at [[Pike Place]] market in [[Seattle]].]]
Some people, having received a solid piano training in their youth, decide not to continue their musical careers but choose nonmusical ones. As a result, there are prominent communities of ''amateur pianists'' all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts not to earn money but just for the love of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreas|first1=Møller|title=Professionel pianist leverer dinnermusik til jeres fest af højeste klasse|url=http://www.pianomusic.dk/|website=Pianomusic.dk|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs]], held annually in [[Paris]], attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio.

It is notable that [[Jon Nakamatsu]], the Gold Medal winner of the prestigious [[Van Cliburn International Piano Competition]] for professional pianists in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or majored in music, and worked as a high school German teacher at the time; it was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.

The German pianist [[Davide Martello]] is known for traveling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognised by the European parliament for his “outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values”.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-john-lennon-imagine-pianist-davide-martello-klavierkunst|title=Paris attacks: pianist 'drove 400 miles through the night' to pay tribute|first=Jonathan|last=Bucks|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gramsci 1922.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antonio Gramsci]], depicted in 1922]]
The '''''Prison Notebooks''''' ({{lang-it|Quaderni del carcere}} {{IPA-it|kwaˈdɛrni del ˈkartʃere|}}) were a series of [[essay]]s written by the Italian [[neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] [[Antonio Gramsci]]. Gramsci was imprisoned by the Italian [[Fascist]] regime in 1926. The notebooks were written between 1929 and 1935, when Gramsci was released from prison on grounds of ill-health. He died in April 1937.

He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. Although written unsystematically, the ''Prison Notebooks'' are considered a highly original contribution to 20th century [[political theory]]. Gramsci drew insights from varying sources - not only other Marxists but also thinkers such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Georges Sorel]] and [[Benedetto Croce]]. His notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including [[History of Italy|Italian history]] and [[Italian nationalism|nationalism]], [[the French Revolution]], [[Fascism]], [[Fordism]], [[civil society]], [[folklore]], [[religion]] and [[high culture|high]] and [[popular culture]].

The notebooks were smuggled out of prison in the 1930s. They were not published until the 1950s and were first translated into English in the 1970s, by the Scottish poet and folklorist [[Hamish Henderson]].

Some ideas in [[Marxist theory]], [[critical theory]] and educational theory that are associated with Gramsci's name:
* [[Cultural hegemony]] as a means of maintaining the [[capitalism|capitalist]] state.
* The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the [[working class]].
* The distinction between political society (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) which dominates directly and coercively, and [[civil society]] (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent.
* "Absolute [[historicism]]".
* A critique of [[economic determinism]] that opposes fatalistic interpretations of Marxism.
* A critique of [[materialism|philosophical materialism]].

==Hegemony==
{{details|Cultural hegemony}}
[[Hegemony]] was a concept previously used by Marxists such as [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]] to indicate the political leadership of the [[working-class]] in a democratic revolution, but developed by Gramsci into an acute analysis to explain why the 'inevitable' [[socialist]] revolution predicted by orthodox Marxism had not occurred by the early 20th century. Capitalism, it seemed, was even more entrenched than ever. Capitalism, Gramsci suggested, maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion, but also [[ideology|ideologically]], through a hegemonic culture in which the values of the [[bourgeoisie]] became the '[[common sense]]' values of all. Thus a consensus culture developed in which people in the [[working-class]] identified their own good with the good of the bourgeoisie, and helped to maintain the ''status quo'' rather than revolting.

The working class needed to develop a culture of its own, which would overthrow the notion that bourgeois values represented 'natural' or 'normal' values for society, and would attract the oppressed and intellectual classes to the cause of the proletariat. Lenin held that culture was 'ancillary' to political objectives but for Gramsci it was fundamental to the attainment of power that ''[[cultural hegemony]]'' be achieved first. In Gramsci's view, any class that wishes to dominate in modern conditions has to move beyond its own narrow ‘economic-corporate’ interests, to exert intellectual and moral leadership, and to make alliances and compromises with a variety of forces. Gramsci calls this union of social forces a ‘historic bloc’, taking a term from [[Georges Sorel]]. This bloc forms the basis of consent to a certain social order, which produces and re-produces the hegemony of the dominant class through a nexus of institutions, [[social relations]] and ideas. In this manner, Gramsci developed a theory that emphasized the importance of the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] in both maintaining and fracturing relations of the [[Base (politics)|base]].

Gramsci stated that, in the West, bourgeois cultural values were tied to religion, and therefore much of his polemic against hegemonic culture is aimed at religious norms and values. He was impressed by the power [[Roman Catholicism]] had over men's minds and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between the religion of the learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci believed that it was Marxism's task to marry the purely intellectual critique of religion found in [[Renaissance humanism]] to the elements of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would have to recognize it as an expression of their own experience.

For Gramsci, hegemonic dominance ultimately relied on coercion, and in a "crisis of authority" the "masks of consent" slip away, revealing the fist of force.

==Intellectuals and education==

Gramsci gave much thought to the question of the role of intellectuals in society. Famously, he stated that all men are intellectuals, in that all have intellectual and rational faculties, but not all men have the social function of intellectuals. He claimed that modern intellectuals were not simply talkers, but directors and organisers who helped build society and produce hegemony by means of ideological apparatuses such as education and the [[Mass media|media]]. Furthermore, he distinguished between a 'traditional' [[intelligentsia]] which sees itself (wrongly) as a class apart from society, and the thinking groups which every class produces from its own ranks 'organically'. Such 'organic' intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules, but rather [[articulation (sociology)|articulate]], through the language of culture, the feelings and experiences which the masses could not express for themselves. The need to create a [[working-class culture]] relates to Gramsci's call for a kind of education that could develop working-class intellectuals, who would not simply introduce Marxist ideology from outside the proletariat, but rather renovate and make critical the ''status quo'' of the already existing intellectual activity of the masses. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of [[critical pedagogy]] and [[popular education]] as theorized and practised in later decades by [[Paulo Freire]] in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of [[Frantz Fanon]]. For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day. (For the results of this kind of thought in education, see the latests reports of PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) on the education in Brazil).

==State and civil society==

Gramsci's theory of hegemony is tied to his conception of the capitalist state, which he claims rules through force plus consent. The state is not to be understood in the narrow sense of the government; instead, Gramsci divides it between 'political society', which is the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control, and '[[civil society]]', which is commonly seen as the 'private' or 'non-state' sphere, differentiated from both the state and the economy. The former is the realm of force and the latter of consent. He stresses, however, that the division is purely conceptual and that the two, in reality, often overlap.

Gramsci claims that hegemony lies under modern capitalism and that the [[bourgeoisie]] can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by [[trade unions]] and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere. Thus, the bourgeoisie engages in [[Passive Revolution]] by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change. Gramsci posits that movements such as [[reformism]] and [[fascism]], as well as the '[[scientific management]]' and [[assembly line]] methods of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] and [[Henry Ford]] respectively, are examples of this.

Drawing from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], he argues that 'The Modern Prince' – the revolutionary party – is the force that will allow the working-class to develop organic intellectuals and an alternative hegemony within civil society. For Gramsci, the complex nature of modern civil society means that the only tactic capable of undermining bourgeois hegemony and leading to socialism is a 'war of position' (analogous to [[trench warfare]]); this war of position would then give way to a 'war of movement' (or frontal attack). Gramsci saw 'war of movement' as being exemplified by the storming of the [[Winter Palace]] during the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]].

Despite his claim that the lines between the two may be blurred, Gramsci rejects the state-worship that results from identifying political society with civil society, as was done by the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and Fascists. He believes the proletariat's historical task is to create a 'regulated society' and defines the '[[withering away of the state]]' as the full development of civil society's ability to regulate itself.

==Historicism==

Gramsci, like the early [[Karl Marx|Marx]], was an emphatic proponent of [[historicism]]. In Gramsci's view, all meaning derives from the relation between human practical activity (or "[[praxis (process)|praxis]]") and the "objective" historical and social processes of which it is a part. Ideas cannot be understood outside their social and historical context, apart from their function and origin. The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of the world do not derive primarily from our relation to things, but rather from the social relations between the users of those concepts. As a result, there is no such thing as an unchanging "[[human nature]]", but only an idea of such which varies historically. Furthermore, philosophy and science do not "reflect" a reality independent of man, but rather are only "true" in that they express the real developmental trend of a given historical situation.

For the majority of Marxists, truth was truth no matter when and where it is known, and scientific knowledge (which included Marxism) accumulated historically as the advance of truth in this everyday sense. On this view, Marxism could not be said to not belong to the illusory realm of the superstructure because it is a science. In contrast, Gramsci believed Marxism was "true" in the socially pragmatic sense, in that by articulating the [[class consciousness]] of the [[proletariat]], it expressed the "truth" of its times better than any other theory. This anti-[[scientism|scientistic]] and anti-[[positivism|positivist]] stance was indebted to the influence of Benedetto Croce. However, it should be underlined that Gramsci's was an "absolute historicism" that broke with the Hegelian and idealist tenor of Croce's thinking and its tendency to secure a metaphysical synthesis in historical "destiny". Though Gramsci repudiates the charge, his historical account of truth has been criticised as a form of [[relativism]].

==Critique of "economism"==

In a famous pre-prison article entitled "The Revolution against ''[[Das Kapital]]''", Gramsci claimed that the [[October Revolution]] in Russia had invalidated the idea that socialist revolution had to await the full development of capitalist [[productive forces|forces of production]]. This reflected his view that Marxism was not a [[determinism|determinist]] philosophy. The principle of the causal "primacy" of the [[forces of production]], he held, was a misconception of Marxism. Both economic changes and cultural changes are expressions of a "basic historical process", and it is difficult to say which sphere has primacy over the other. The [[fatalism|fatalistic]] belief, widespread within the [[labour movement|workers’ movement]] in its earliest years, that it would inevitably triumph due to "historical laws", was, in Gramsci's view, a product of the historical circumstances of an oppressed class restricted mainly to defensive action, and was to be abandoned as a hindrance once the working-class became able to take the initiative. Because Marxism is a "philosophy of praxis", it cannot rely on unseen "historical laws" as the agents of social change. History is defined by human praxis and therefore includes human will. Nonetheless, will-power cannot achieve anything it likes in any given situation: when the consciousness of the working-class reaches the stage of development necessary for action, historical circumstances will be encountered which cannot be arbitrarily altered. It is not, however, predetermined by historical inevitability as to which of several possible developments will take place as a result.

His critique of [[Economic determinism|economism]] also extended to that practised by the syndicalists of the Italian trade unions.  He believed that many trade unionists had settled for a reformist, gradualist approach in that they had refused to struggle on the political front in addition to the economic front.  While Gramsci envisioned the trade unions as one organ of a counter-hegemonic force in capitalist society, the trade union leaders simply saw these organizations as a means to improve conditions within the existing structure.  Gramsci referred to the views of these trade unionists as "vulgar economism", which he equated to covert reformism and even liberalism.

==Critique of Materialism==

By virtue of his belief that human history and collective praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not, Gramsci's views run contrary to the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[materialism]] and 'copy' theory of perception advanced by [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] and Lenin, though he does not explicitly state this. For Gramsci, Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself, independent of humanity. The concept of an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] universe outside of human history and human praxis was, in his view, analogous to belief in [[God]]; there could be no objectivity, but only a universal [[intersubjectivity]] to be established in a future communist society. Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history. On his view philosophical materialism, like primitive common sense, resulted from a lack of critical thought, and could not, as Lenin&lt;ref&gt;Lenin: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/index.htm ''Materialism and Empirio-Criticism''].&lt;/ref&gt; claimed, be said to oppose religious superstition. Despite this, Gramsci resigned himself to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism: the proletariat's status as a dependent class meant that Marxism, as its philosophy, could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense. Nonetheless, it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes, and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise, and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents’ views.

'''''Punch; or, The London Charivari''''' was a British weekly magazine of humour and [[satire]] established in 1841 by [[Henry Mayhew]] and engraver [[Ebenezer Landells]]. Historically, it was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s, when it helped to coin the term "[[cartoon]]" in its modern sense as a humorous illustration. 
 
After the 1940s, when its circulation peaked, it went into a long decline, closing in 1992. It was revived in 1996, but closed again in 2002.

== History ==
''Punch'' was founded on 17 July 1841 by [[Henry Mayhew]] and engraver [[Ebenezer Landells]], on an initial investment of £25. It was jointly edited by Mayhew and [[Mark Lemon]]. It was subtitled ''The London Charivari'' in homage to [[Charles Philipon]]'s French satirical humour magazine ''[[Le Charivari]]''.{{sfn|Appelbaum|Kelly|1981|p=14}} Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove puppet, Mr. Punch, of [[Punch and Judy]]; the name also referred to a joke made early on about one of the magazine's first editors, Lemon, that "[[Punch (drink)|punch]] is nothing without lemon". Mayhew ceased to be joint editor in 1842 and became "suggestor in chief" until he severed his connection in 1845. The magazine initially struggled for readers, except for an 1842 "Almanack" issue which shocked its creators by selling 90,000 copies.  In December 1842 due to financial difficulties the magazine was sold to [[Bradbury and Evans]], both printers and publishers. Bradbury and Evans capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies and also were the publishers for [[Charles Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].

The term "cartoon" to refer to comic drawings was first used in ''Punch'' in 1843, when the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and "cartoons" for the mural were displayed for the public; the term "cartoon" then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or {{lang|it|cartone}} in Italian.  ''Punch'' humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the ''Punch'' cartoons led to the term's widespread use.{{sfn|Appelbaum|Kelly|1981|p=15}}

The illustrator [[Archibald Henning]] designed the cover of the magazine's first issues. The cover design varied in the early years, though [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]] designed what became the magazine's [[masthead (publishing)|masthead]] in 1849. Artists who published in ''Punch'' during the 1840s and 50s included [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]], [[John Tenniel]] and [[Charles Keene (artist)|Charles Keene]]. This group became known as "The ''Punch'' Brotherhood", which also included Charles Dickens who joined Bradbury and Evans after leaving [[Chapman and Hall]] in 1843.&lt;ref name=vicweb/&gt; ''Punch'' authors and artists also contributed to another Bradbury and Evans literary magazine called ''[[Once A Week (magazine)|Once A Week]]'' (est.1859), created in response to Dickens' departure from ''[[Household Words]]''.&lt;ref name=vicweb/&gt;

In the 1860s and 1870s, conservative ''Punch'' faced competition from upstart liberal journal ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', but after about 1874, ''Fun''&amp;apos;s fortunes faded. At Evans's café in London, the two journals had "Round tables" in competition with each other.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/NCTF/V30I2/300001.pdf Schoch, Richard, ''Performing Bohemia'' (2004)] (copy downloaded 13 October 2006). {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After months of financial difficulty and lack of market success, ''Punch'' became a staple for British drawing rooms because of its sophisticated humour and absence of offensive material, especially when viewed against the satirical press of the time. ''[[The Times]]'' and the Sunday paper ''[[News of the World]]'' used small pieces from ''Punch'' as column fillers, giving the magazine free publicity and indirectly granting a degree of respectability, a privilege not enjoyed by any other comic publication. ''Punch'' would share a friendly relationship with not only ''The Times'' but journals aimed at intellectual audiences such as the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', which published a fifty-three page illustrated article on ''Punch's'' first two volumes. Historian [[Richard Altick]] writes that "To judge from the number of references to it in the private letters and memoirs of the 1840s...''Punch'' had become a household word within a year or two of its founding, beginning in the middle class and soon reaching the pinnacle of society, [[royal family|royalty]] itself".&lt;ref&gt;See Altick, Richard. ''Punch: The Lively Youth of a British Institution, 1841–1851'' ([[Ohio State University Press]], 1997), 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing in readership and popularity throughout the remainder of the 1840s and 1850s, ''Punch'' was the success story of a [[threepence (British coin)|threepenny]] weekly paper that had become one of the most talked-about and enjoyed periodicals. ''Punch'' enjoyed an audience including [[Elizabeth Barrett]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]], [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[Queen Victoria]], [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], and [[James Russell Lowell]]. ''Punch'' gave several phrases to the [[English language]], including [[The Crystal Palace]], and the "[[Curate's egg]]" (first seen in an 1895 cartoon by [[George du Maurier]]). Several British humour classics were first serialised in ''Punch'', such as the ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' and ''[[1066 and All That]]''. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the artistic roster included [[Harry Furniss]], [[Linley Sambourne]], [[Francis Carruthers Gould]], and [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]].&lt;ref name=vicweb&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/periodicals/punch/pva44.html Punch, or the London Charivari (1841-1992) — A British Institution], Philip V. Allingham; Contributing Editor, [[Victorian Web]]; Faculty of Education, [[Lakehead University]], [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]].&lt;/ref&gt; Among the outstanding cartoonists of the following century were [[Bernard Partridge]], [[H. M. Bateman]], [[Bernard Hollowood]] who also edited the magazine from 1957 to 1968, Kenneth Mahood and [[Norman Thelwell]].

Circulation broke the 100,000 mark around 1910, and peaked in 1947–1948 at 175,000 to 184,000.  Sales declined steadily thereafter; ultimately, the magazine was forced to close in 2002 after 161 years of publication.

''Punch'' was widely emulated worldwide and was popular in the colonies. The colonial experience, especially in India, influenced Punch and its iconography. Tenniel's ''Punch'' cartoons of the 1857 [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] led to a surge in the magazine's popularity. Colonial India was frequently caricatured in ''Punch'' and was an important source of knowledge of India for British readers.&lt;ref&gt;Ritu G. Khanduri.

=== Later years ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Book cover psherick of punch ed david taylor, 1998 I think I will check later.JPG|thumb|100px|A book cover of ''Pick of Punch'' from 1998]] --&gt;

''Punch'' material was collected in book formats from the late nineteenth century, which included ''Pick of the Punch'' annuals with cartoons and text features, ''Punch and the War'' (a 1941 collection of WWII-related cartoons), and ''A Big Bowl of Punch'' – which was republished a number of times. Many Punch cartoonists of the late 20th century published collections of their own, partly based on ''Punch'' contributions.

''Punch'' magazine ceased publishing in 1992.&lt;ref name="mle"&gt;John Morrish, Paul Bradshaw, 
''Magazine Editing: In Print and Online''. Routledge, 2012. {{ISBN|1136642072}} (p.32).&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1996, the Egyptian businessman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] bought the rights to the name, and ''Punch'' was re-launched later that year.&lt;ref name="mle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/18/world/whack-whack-whack-reborn-punch-pounded.html Whack! Whack! Whack! Reborn ''Punch'' Pounded] Warren Hodge, ''[[The New York Times]]'',  18 September 1996. Retrieved 16 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the magazine was intended to be a spoiler aimed at ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'', which had published many items critical of Fayed. The magazine never became profitable in its new incarnation, and at the end of May 2002 it was announced that ''Punch'' would once more cease publication.&lt;ref name="mle" /&gt; Press reports quoted a loss of £16 million over the six years of publication, with only 6,000 subscribers at the end.

Whereas the earlier version of ''Punch'' prominently featured the clownish character [[Pulcinella|Punchinello]] (Punch of [[Punch and Judy]]) performing antics on front covers, the resurrected ''Punch'' magazine did not use this character, but featured on its weekly covers a photograph of a boxing glove, thus informing its readers that the new magazine intended its name to mean "punch" in the sense of a punch in the eye.

===Punch table===
In 2004, much of the archive was acquired by the [[British Library]], including the famous ''Punch'' table.  The long oval Victorian table was used for staff meetings and other occasions, and was brought into the offices sometime around 1855.  The wooden surface is scarred with the carved initials of the magazine's longtime writers, artists and editors, as well as six invited "strangers" including [[James Thurber]] and [[Prince Charles]]. [[Mark Twain]] declined the invitation, saying that the already-carved initials of William Makepeace Thackeray included his own.

*''Punch'' gave its name to the [[Lucknow]]-based satirical [[Urdu]] weekly ''[[Awadh Punch]]'' (1877–1936), which, in turn, inspired dozens of other "Punch" periodicals in [[India]].
*[[University of Pennsylvania]] humor magazine the ''[[Pennsylvania Punch Bowl]]'' derived its name from this magazine.
*Australia's ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'' was inspired by the [[London]] original.
*Charles Wirgman's ''Japan Punch'' (1862–1865, 1865–1887) was based on ''Punch'' and went on to inspire elements of modern [[manga]].

'''''Reel Power: Hollywood Cinema and American Supremacy''''' is a 2010 [[Pluto Press]] book by Matthew Alford, which argues that even many of the most politically critical films, such as ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' and ''[[Three Kings (1999 film)|Three Kings]]'', provide favourable mythology for the United States' government. Alford draws attention to the power of corporate moguls and the role of the government in the production of various films, such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'', ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', and ''[[Transformers]]''.  The foreword is written by [[Michael Parenti]].  A French translation emerged in August 2018, with a new preface.

== Reception ==
In the British ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]'', James Walsh commented that the book "is an engaging look at the innards of the dream factory process" and that although the revelations of film-maker collusion with the Pentagon are not surprising "the details are fascinating" especially in relation to "films traditionally considered nuanced or critical of US foreign policy".&lt;ref&gt;James Walsh [http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/97424 Review: ''Reel Power'',] ''Morning Star'', 9 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]'' called it "One part cultural studies analysis, and another part expose", adding that it "offers a salient critique for those who are concerned about the long term implications of the power of film to act as site of ideological instruction".&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Popular Culture Volume 45, Number 4 (August 2012), p. 908-10&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Sociology called it "an attractive and up-to-date set of tools for the critical literacy that should be mandatory in today’s media-saturated environments".&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews July 2011 vol. 40 no. 4 501&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Kinnear from ''[[Total Film]]'' gave ''Reel Power'' four stars out of five and called it a "laudable study" and "an eye opening expose". "Alford's occasionally guilty of straw-clutching", he said, "but you'll watch the next gung-ho blockbuster a little closer".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Kinnear "Reel Power: Book Review", ''Total Film'', December 2010, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Lobster Magazine]]'', [[Robin Ramsay (editor)|Robin Ramsay]] observes that "If Alford isn’t quite describing the corporations and the state running joint psy-ops, it will do until joint psy-ops come along".  Ramsay reviews the book as "competently done, decently written and, if you’ve seen a lot of American movies – and I have – it is interesting to have the ideological content articulated. I could do it myself, and I’m sort of subliminally aware of it; but most of the time I’m just watching the movie. So the author’s considerable efforts are both useful and entertaining"&lt;ref&gt;Robin Ramsay [http://www.lobster-magazine.co.uk/free/lobster60/lobster60.pdf Book Review: Reel Power,] ''Lobster'', Winter 2010, pp. 148-150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Roy Stafford, former editor of ''In the Picture'' magazine, says that ''Reel Power'' is a "solid introduction" to Hollywood and American politics but one which is a journalistic popularisation of Alford's more overtly academic work and as such, he implies unfortunately, "renders much that Film Studies has tried to do over the last fifty years... as effectively wasted effort."&lt;ref&gt;Roy Stafford [http://itpworld.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/reel-power-hollywood-cinema-and-american-supremacy/ Book Review: ''The Case for Global Film''], 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Scotsman]]'', Hannah McGill, artistic director of the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] opined that ''Reel Power'' "has its valid points to make [and] is at its best when it identifies and analyses cases of direct influence being brought to bear on film production by the US political establishment [...] its stonewalling of more contentious projects [...] or individuals in positions of constant influence" but that "I felt, on frequent occasion, as if I was in the company of the character Jane Horrocks played in Mike Leigh's [[Life Is Sweet (film)|Life is Sweet]]: the moodily self-righteous teen who hurled the word "FASCIST!" at anyone who failed to mirror her every conviction and desire" &lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/books/Book-review-Reel-Power.6572532.jp?articlepage=1 Book Review: Reel Power,] ''The Scotsman'', 9 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further Work==
A 2017 book, ''[[National Security Cinema]]: The Shocking New Evidence of Government Control in Hollywood'', by Matthew Alford and archivist Tom Secker, updates some of the case studies and uses the Freedom of Information Act to establish more specifically how certain films and TV shows have been affected by [[The Pentagon]] and [[CIA]].

The '''S Curve''' is a traditional art concept in [[Ancient Greek sculpture]] and [[Roman sculpture]] where the figure's body and posture is depicted like a sinuous or serpentine "[[S]]". It is related to and is an extension of the art term of [[contrapposto]] which is when a figure is depicted [[Standing (position)|slouching]] or placing one's weight and thus [[center of gravity]] to one side.  However, the S Curve involves more of the body than the contrapposto, and is therefore considered to be a more advanced technical development.
The "S Curve" concept was initiated by famous Greek sculptor [[Praxiteles]], son of Kifissodotos.&lt;ref&gt;"Art Of Ancient Greece, Brief History (1050- 50 b.C.), Georgia Kokkorou- Aleyra&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Art History in Switzerland''' ({{lang-de|Gesellschaft für Schweizerische Kunstgeschichte (GSK)}}, {{lang-fr|Société d'histoire de l'art en Suisse (SHAS)}}, {{lang-it|Società di storia dell' arte in Svizzera (SSAS)}}) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[learned society]] dedicated to promoting the understanding of Swiss [[art history]] and particularly of Swiss [[topography of art]], including the study and maintenance of Swiss [[cultural heritage]] sites.

The society founded in 1880 publishes a wide range of monographies, guides and inventories. These include the series ''Art monuments of Switzerland'' ({{lang-de|Kunstdenkmäler der Schweiz}}, {{lang-fr|Monuments d'art et d'histoire de la Suisse}}), which includes more than hundred volumes, the first of which was published in 1927. It also publishes the quarterly journal ''Kunst und Architektur in der Schweiz''.

==  The origins of the «Gesellschaft für schweizerische Kunstgeschichte» (Society for the history of art in Switzerland)  ==
===  Precursor of the Swiss National Museum and the Federal Commission of Historic Monuments  ===

The ''«Gesellschaft für schweizerische Kunstgeschichte GSK»'' ('''Society for the history of art in Switzerland''' SHAS), named thus since 1934, was founded in June 1880 in [[Zofingen]] under the name of the ''«Vaterländische Gesellschaft für Erhaltung historischer Denkmäler»'' (Patriotic Society for the preservation of historic monuments). Its creation was due to important personalities, members of the Schweizerischer Kunstverein (Swiss society of fine arts), and its first president was the [[Geneva]]n painter, [[Theodore de Saussure]], grandson of the celebrated naturalist [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]]. The vice-presidency was held by the [[Zurich]] art historian Johann Rudolf Rahn. The «Patriotic society for the preservation of historic monuments» had as its aim to preserve and restore architectural [[monument]]s, but also to save scattered works of art by bringing them together in museums, to arouse a better understanding for the «[[fine arts]]» and to support artists, painters and sculptors. In the statutes adopted at the meeting of this committee on 20 June 1880, the name of the society was altered to «Verein für Erhaltung vaterländischer Kunstdenkmäler» (Association for the preservation of artistic monuments of the fatherland). The regulations stipulated that the sums received must be divided and entered in the accounts in two equal shares to be used, on the one hand, to finance publications and, on the other hand, to buy works of art and old objects of value. This second part of the fund was also allocated for the restoration of [[historic monument]]s that were at risk of being destroyed or falling into ruin.

The association changed its name once more at the general meeting in [[Lausanne]] in 1881 to become the ''«Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Erhaltung historischer Kunstdenkmäler»'' (Swiss society for the preservation of historic art monuments). It then dealt mainly with buying items and buildings of national importance, without neglecting its publications. A brief treatise on the [[reliquary]] cross of [[Engelberg]] (end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century) appeared in 1881 from the pen of the art historian Johann Rudolf Rahn. The same author wrote a description of the [[stained glass]] window dating from 1530 in the Reformed Church of St Saphorin ([[Vaud]]), then an article on the Casa Borrani (or Serodine) in [[Ascona]] with its [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] façade.

At the general meeting in 1882, a request was made to set up an inventory of buildings requiring preservation or restoration works and of [[objets d'art]] which were at risk of being destroyed or sold.

In March 1884, the [[Federal Department of the Interior (Switzerland)|Federal Department of the Interior]] responded to a motion on the subject of the creation of a [[Swiss National Museum]] and entrusted the «Society for the preservation of historical art monuments» with the acquisition of a certain number of objects of its choice, but the ownership of which would revert to the Confederation. In the implementing ordinance of 25 February 1887, a Federal Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities of Switzerland was created and its competences and duties were passed to the committee of the «Society for the preservation of historical art monuments». In the same year, the statutes of the latter were adapted to its new function.

===  Creation of the Swiss National Museum  ===

In 1891, the [[Federal Council of Switzerland|Federal Council]] (Swiss Government) founded the Swiss National Museum with its head office in Zurich and the purchase of [[antiquities]] then no longer came within the competence of the «Society for the preservation of historical art monuments». This decision was confirmed on 12 March 1892. The Society continued its inventory, preservation and restoration work on historic works of art, and excavations. In 1896, Karl Stehlin, then President of the Society (1895–1898) who had succeeded Julius Kunkler (1888–1895), was called on to take charge of a new subsidiary research commission relating to the Roman period. [[Josef Zemp]] (1898–1904 and 1915–1916) and Albert Naef, who took over the presidency from Zemp between 1904 and 1915, pleaded for equality of treatment of the different old styles, rejecting any organisation of the periods into a hierarchy. They attached great importance to as complete a job of preservation as possible of the authentic work and a distinction between what was original and what was reconstructed, in order to avoid any pastiche. Starting from 1899, the «Anzeiger für schweizerische Altertumskunde» (Directory of Swiss Antiquities), published by the Swiss National Museum, served as the official organ of the «Society for the preservation of historical art monuments», complemented from 1901 on by the publication of the Communications in two editions, German and French. The first issue of this series was devoted to the stained-glass windows of the [[chancel]] of the church in [[Oberkirch, Switzerland|Oberkirch]] near [[Frauenfeld]] and the Weinmarkt (wine market) fountain in [[Lucerne]], with texts by Johann Rudolf Rahn and Josef Zemp. The state archivist Robert Durrer edited the statistics of the monuments of [[Obwalden]] and [[Nidwalden]], published in a supplement to the «Anzeiger für schweizerische Altertumskunde» and reprinted in 1971.

At the same time, in 1900 Paul Ganz suggested the establishment of a directory with photographs of old stained-glass windows in [[Switzerland]], as well as working drawings and designs of stained-glass windows. Appointed director of the Art Museum in [[Basle]], he succeeded in building up a small collection by 1902 which became the starting point of the «Archiv für schweizerische Kunstgeschichte» (Archives of the history of art in Switzerland). At the same time, Johann Rudolf Rahn began to draw up an inventory of Switzerland’s art and history monuments.

===  Creation of the «Eidgenössische Kommission für Denkmalpflege» (Federal Commission of Historic Monuments)  ===

In 1915, the Department of the Interior created a Federal Commission of Historic Monuments and the Society’s activity in the field of the preservation of monuments thus had to come to an end. Funds of 2000 francs – later 3000 – for «small restoration works» were, however, granted to the Society as consolation. These funds were paid until 1960. Having thus been successively relieved of two essential tasks, that is the acquisition or works of art and the preservation of monuments, the Society devoted itself from then on more intensely to the publication of works.

===  The «Inventar der Kunstdenkmäler der Schweiz» (Inventory of Monuments of art and history of Switzerland)  ===

In 1920, under the presidency of the Genevan architect Camille Martin (1916–1922), the scholarly inventory of Switzerland’s art and history monuments was able to commence: Samuel Guyer undertook the architectural inventory of the canton of [[Zurich (canton)|Zurich]], Linus Birchler that of the cantons of [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]] and [[Uri (canton)|Uri]]. The Society’s committee submitted a request for grants to the federal authorities and drew up rules in 1924 to determine the organisation of these far-reaching works. In 1925, in agreement with the Department of the Interior and various scholarly associations, the Society undertook the publication of the national inventory of the ''Monuments of art and history of Switzerland'' in close collaboration with the cantons. The first volume, devoted to three districts of the canton of Schwyz, that is [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]], [[March, Switzerland|March]] and [[Höfe District|Höfe]], appeared in 1927. It was the work of the architectural historian Linus Birchler, the first president of the Federal Commission of Historic Monuments.

Since then, more than 120 volumes of this collection have been published. They were complemented between 1982 and 2004 by the ''«Inventar der neueren Schweizer Architektur, 1850-1920 INSA»'' (Swiss inventory of architecture), a collection of eleven volumes. The «Society for the history of art in Switzerland» also publishes the ''«Schweizerischer Kunstführer»'' (Guides to Swiss monuments), a series launched in 1935 by Paul Ganz, of regional or cantonal guides, special issues touching on specific subjects linked to the history of art and architecture, as well as its quarterly revue ''«Kunst+Architektur in der Schweiz»'' (Art+Architecture in Switzerland).

'''Tendril perversion''', often referred to in context as simply '''perversion''', is a geometric phenomenon found in [[helix|helical]] structures such as plant [[tendril]]s, in which a helical structure forms that is divided into two sections of opposite [[chirality]], with a transition between the two in the middle.&lt;ref name=MacMillan2002/&gt; A similar phenomenon can often be observed in kinked helical cables such as [[telephone handset]] cords.&lt;ref name="LiuEtAl"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0093183| pmid = 24759785| title = Structural Transition from Helices to Hemihelices| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 4| pages = e93183| year = 2014| last1 = Liu | first1 = J. | last2 = Huang | first2 = J. | last3 = Su | first3 = T. | last4 = Bertoldi | first4 = K. | last5 = Clarke | first5 = D. R. | pmc=3997338|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...993183L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The phenomenon was known to [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref name=Goriely2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/maths/research/researchgroups/applied/siam/resources/SIAM_Day_2013_AGoriely_lecture.pdf|title=Inversion, Rotation, and Perversion in Mechanical Biology: From Microscopic Anisotropy to Macroscopic Chirality | author=Alain Goriely | date = 2013 | page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote in 1865,

{{cquote|
A tendril ... invariably becomes twisted in one part in one direction, and in another part in the opposite direction...
This curious and symmetrical structure has been noticed by several botanists, but has not been sufficiently
explained.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin, "On the movements and habits of climbing plants", ''Journal of the Linnean Society'', 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The term "tendril perversion" was coined by Goriely and Tabor in 1998 based on the word ''perversion'' found in the 19th Century science literature. "Perversion" is a transition from one chirality to another and was known to [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who attributed it to the [[topologist]] [[J. B. Listing]].&lt;ref name=Goriely2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treatise of Electricity and Magnetism|author=James Clerk Maxwell|year=1873|publisher=Clarendon Press|place=Oxford|page=|quote=The operation of passing from one system to the other is called by Listing, ''Perversion''. The reflection of an object in a mirror image is a perverted image of the object.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tendril perversion can be viewed as an example of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], in which the strained structure of the tendril adopts a [[minimum total potential energy principle|configuration of minimum energy]] while preserving zero overall twist.&lt;ref name="MacMillan2002" /&gt; 

Tendril perversion has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. Gerbode et al. have made experimental studies of the coiling of [[cucumber]] tendrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1223304| pmid = 22936777| title = How the Cucumber Tendril Coils and Overwinds| journal = Science| volume = 337| issue = 6098| pages = 1087–91| year = 2012| last1 = Gerbode | first1 = S.

Generalized tendril perversions were put forward by Silva et al., to include perversions that can be intrinsically produced in elastic filaments, leading to a multiplicity of geometries and dynamical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Pedro E.

'''Termeh''' ({{lang-fa|ترمه}}) is a type of [[Iran]]ian handwoven cloth, produced primarily in the [[Yazd province]]. Weaving termeh requires a good [[wool]] with long fibers. Termeh is woven by an expert with the assistance of a worker called a ''Goushvareh-kesh''. Weaving termeh is a sensitive, careful, and time-consuming process; a good [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]] can produce only {{convert|25|to|30|cm|-0}} in a day. The background colors used in termeh are [[jujube]] red, light red, green, orange and black. Termeh has been admired throughout history; Greek historians commented on the beauty of [[Persian Empire|Persian]] weavings in the [[Achaemenian]] (532 B.C.), [[Ashkani]] (222 B.C.) and [[Sasanidae]] (226–641 A.D.) periods and the Chinese tourist Hoang Tesang admired termeh.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

During the [[Safavid]] period (1502–1736 A.D.), zarbaf and termeh weaving techniques were significantly refined. Due to the difficulty of producing termeh and the advent of mechanized weaving, few factories remain in Iran that produce traditionally woven Termeh.

'''''The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Robin Moore]] first published in 1969 about the notorious "[[French Connection]]" drug trafficking scheme. It is followed by the book ''[[The Setup (book)|The Setup]]''. The book was adapted to film in 1971 as ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', written by [[Ernest Tidyman]] and directed by [[William Friedkin]].

==Overview==
The story follows the exhausting investigation of New York City detectives [[Eddie Egan]] and [[Sonny Grosso]] as they attempt to uncover the participants of a major drug ring.  Acting on a hunch, the detectives begin surveillance on [[Pasquale Fuca|Pasquale "Patsy" Fuca]], who was observed in a nightclub consorting with known criminals.  It soon becomes apparent that Fuca is involved in a large drug trafficking operation, including two Frenchmen: [[Jean Jehan]], the main person responsible for importing the heroin shipment to the United States, and [[Jacques Angelvin]], a television personality.

'''''The Guitar Player''''' is a circa 1672&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; painting by [[Jan Vermeer]], on display in [[Kenwood House]], [[London]] as part of the [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh#Art collector|Iveagh Bequest]].

The '''Théâtre de l’Ambigu-Comique''' ({{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ də lɑ̃biɡy kɔmik|pron}}, literally, Theatre of the Comic-Ambiguity), a former Parisian theatre, was founded in 1769 on the [[boulevard du Temple]] immediately adjacent to the [[Théâtre de Nicolet]]. It was rebuilt in 1770 and 1786, but in 1827 was destroyed by fire. A new, larger theatre with a capacity of 2,000 as compared to the earlier 1,250 was built nearby on the boulevard Saint-Martin at its intersection with the rue de Bondy and opened the following year.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick 1993, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was eventually demolished in 1966.

==History of the first theatre in the boulevard du Temple==

It was founded in 1769 on the [[boulevard du Temple]], originally known as the Promenades des Ramparts, in Paris by [[Nicolas-Médard Audinot]], formerly a comedian of the [[Opéra-Comique]], which he had left to become a puppet-master at the Paris fairs. Audinot had already been a success in one of the sites of the [[Saint-Germain Fair]], where his large [[marionette]]s (called "bamboches") were in vogue.

Under the name of his foundation, the "Comédiens de bois", the Opéra-Comique proposed [[pantomime]]s and "féeries" (spectacles), then he enlarged his repertoire to include marionettes, child-performers, and [[acrobatics|acrobat]]s, in comedies, [[vaudeville]] shows, "opéras comiques", dramas and pantomimes.

The variety and mix of these theatrical modes justified and explained changing the theatre's name, after only one year, from "Comédiens de bois" to "Ambigu-Comique" when Audinot substituted child-performers for marionettes.  Audinot also used wooden puppets to spitefully reenact his former colleagues from the Comédie Italienne. Audinot saved the profits he made from shows and constructed a permanent theatre building on the Boulevard du Temple, which officially opened on July 9, 1769.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings 1994, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The following April, Audinot added to his puppets with a few young children, who he trained up in the theatrical arts, and painted the motto "Sicut infantes audi nos" on the theatre's curtain.  His success caused [[Jacques Delille|Delille]] to write "Dear Audinot, childhood attired as old age".

The architectural success of the theatre was mostly due to the ambitious and inventive set designer, Louis Daguerre.  Daguerre, who is also credited with developing early photography and diorama theatre (1822), was an expert in scenic and lighting design and created picturesque effects within the theatre.

[[Image:Plans of the theatres Ambigu-Comique and Gaîté on the Boulevard du Temple - Carlson 1966 p226.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plans of the Ambigu-Comique (left) and the Théâtre de [[Jean-Baptiste Nicolet|Nicolet]] ([[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)]], right), on the boulevard du Temple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ambigu-Comique and the Gaîté had a smaller number of boxes for privileged clientele than other Parisian theatres. These were separated by only half partitions that were more steeply angled toward the stage. The boxes usually found at the rear of a theatre were replaced with galleries of benches which seated more people. These arrangements provided more patrons with a better view of the stage, rather than a view of the other members of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson 1966, p. 226; McCormick 1993, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A Conseil decision of 1771 (demanded by the Opéra) banned singing, dancing, and having more than four musicians aroused such emotion that it was revoked only a few days later, and Audinot took full advantage of the situation.  Judging, in 1772, that the time was right to extend the building, he gave up puppetry altogether, replacing them entirely with child-performers.  Not entirely released from the ties which had brought about his rise in the large theatres, from 1780 he had to pay the Opéra a fee for representation and to engage him but not use him, in producing ballets and lyric pieces borrowed for that scene, whose shows had at least ten years of publicity.  The Comédie-Française and the Comédie-Italienne stipulated, for their part, that dialogue pieces in the repertoire would be submitted to them before being played, so they could edit and change them to their own advantage.

Despite these problems and burdens, the Ambigu was able to rebuild and enlarge its theatre in 1786. Audinot sustained the fashion for "pantomimes historiques and "pantomimes romanesques" such as "Belle au bois dormant", "Masque de fer", "Forêt-Noire", and "Capitaine Cook". The Ambigu's success was equally down to the "comédies graveleuses" written by its official writers [[Roger-Timothée Régnard de Pleinchesne|Plainchesne]] and [[Pierre-Louis Moline|Moline]]. [[Louis Petit de Bachaumont|Bachaumont]] even noted in 1771 that Audinot's theatre was better attended than the Opéra.

Being located on the Boulevard du Temple amongst several other successful theaters created a healthy competition and a spark that the Ambigu used to strive to achieve greatness.  Some of the theaters along the Boulevard included Theatre de Nicolet, Theatre des Associes, Theatre des Delassement-Comiques, and many others.  The Comedie Francais, which was established back in 1680 and was certainly well-known throughout Europe, coexisted with the Ambigu and, therefore, they competed each other for an audience.  However, l’Ambigu’s biggest rival was Théâtre Feydeau.  The Feydeau was closed by the government due to the social “turbulence” it invoked, and on February 3, 1795 Théâtre de l’Ambigu showed a production of "Le Concert de la rue Feydeau."  This production was a satirical piece and a supposedly “lighthearted attack” against The Feydeau which was taken the wrong way to many viewers and caused “angry crowds to surround the Ambigu for two evenings until the Committee of Public Saftety demanded that the play be withdrawn in the interests of public tranquility” (Carlson.)

The proclamation of the freedom of the theatres in 1791 gave rise to a large number of rivals to the Ambigu, which was forced to close in 1799. In 1801, Audinot inaugurated a [[melodrama]] with [[Guilbert de Pixérécourt]], [[Louis-Charles Caigniez|Caigniez]] and [[Victor Henri-Joseph Brahain Ducange|Victor Ducange]].  In addition to the big name of Pixerecourt, actor Frederick Lemaitre played “Robert Macaire,” a classic villain in many French plays, in 1823 with outstanding success.  After Audinot stepped down as the director, one of the company’s actors named Picardeaux took over, followed by Andre Coffin-Rosny, then Hector Chaussier, and another actor, Cammaile Saint-Aubin. The Ambigu's building burned down on 13 July 1827.

The theatre was rebuilt to plans by the architects [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]] and [[Jean-François-Joseph Lecointe]] on the [[boulevard Saint-Martin]], at the corner of [[rue de Bondy]] (now [[rue René-Boulanger]]).  The 19th century saw the Ambigu's success augmented, so much so that its grand spectacles, dramas, melodramas, "[[boulevard theatre (aesthetic)|pièces de boulevard]]" and vaudeville shows remain the most faithful representation of the dramatic traditions of what is called "the [[Boulevard du Crime|boulevard of crime]]" ("le boulevard du crime").

Productions of adapted novels were successful such as Émile Zola’s ''L’Assommoir'' in 1879 and ''Nana'' in 1881.

===20th century===
In the 1920s, the building was briefly turned into a cinema.  In 1954, the comedian [[Christian Casadesus]] reopened the Théâtre de l'Ambigu, and plays were staged there once again, by contemporary authors such as [[François Billetdoux]] and [[Roger Vitrac]]. In 1966, despite several demonstrations and a spectacular parade by the whole theatrical profession, the theatre was closed for good and demolished.  The department of [[André Malraux]], minister of culture, promised that the auditorium, then the whole building, would be preserved, when demolition works had already begun.

[[File:tint-tone-shade.svg|thumb|right]]
[[File:Kleurenovergang van zwart naar blauw.png|right|thumb|Some [[shades of blue]]]]

In [[color theory]], a '''tint''' is a mixture of a color with [[white]], which reduces [[darkness]], while a '''shade''' is a mixture with [[black]], which increases darkness. A '''tone''' is produced either by mixing a color with [[grey]], or by both tinting and shading.&lt;ref&gt;Color Theory: An Essential Guide to Color-from Basic Principles to Practical Applications by Patti Mollica, page 17, {{ISBN|1-60058-302-4}}, 9781600583025&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing a color with any [[neutral color]] (including black, gray and white) reduces the [[Chrominance|chroma]], or [[colorfulness]], while the [[hue]] remains unchanged.

In common language, the term ''shade'' can be generalized to furthermore encompass any varieties of a particular color, whether technically they are shades, tints, tones, or slightly different hues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shade|title=Definition of SHADE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the term ''tint'' can be generalized to refer to any lighter or darker variation of a color (e.g. [[tinted windows]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tint|title=Definition of TINT|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When mixing colored light (additive color models), the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red, green, and blue (RGB) is always white, not gray or black. When we mix colorants, such as the [[pigment]]s in [[paint]] mixtures, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black or a [[complementary color|color's complement]].

==In art==
It is common among some artistic painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called ''shades''—or to lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called ''tints''. However, this is not always the best way for representational painting, since an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in their hues. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue{{clarify|date=November 2012|which route: via green or via purple?}} when mixed with reds and oranges.

Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. violet-purple added to yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).

[[File:HSLSphere.svg|thumb|600px|center|An extension of the color wheel: the color sphere. Colors nearest the center or the poles are most ''achromatic''. Colors of the same lightness and saturation, but of different hue, are called ''nuances''. Colors of the same hue and saturation, but of different lightness, are called ''tints'' and ''shades''. Colors of the same hue and lightness, but of different saturation, are called ''tones''.]]'''

The company has  headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and satellite offices in the Netherlands, Brazil, the United States, and China. The firm sells more than 2,000 home products through over 25,000 retailers in 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2015/02/12/canadas-umbra-celebrates-35-big-years-of-small-design-with-reinvented-queen-w-flagship-store.html|author=Vicky Sanderson|title=Canada’s Umbra celebrates 35 big years of small design with reinvented Queen W. flagship store|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The firm was founded in 1978 by childhood friends Les Mandelbaum and Paul Rowan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbra.com|title=Shop Modern Home Décor - Free Shipping Over $50|publisher=Umbra|accessdate=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm opened its first  store in Toronto's  Queen West District in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Drolet, Daniel. “Umbra proves flagship stores still have their place.” ''Canwest News Service'' 19 Jul. 2008: D3.&lt;/ref&gt; It has retail stores in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, China, Israel, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore, and  the Umbra and Umbra Shift e-commerce websites. Umbra products are also sold through  other retailers.

[[File:Umbra Concept Store 1.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Umbra Concept Store]] in downtown Toronto]]

==Designs==
Umbra has an in-house design team headed by Matt Carr, consisting of over 30 designers in Canada and abroad. Many independent designers have also collaborated with the firm. Notable ones who have made significant contributions to Umbra include [[Karim Rashid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karimrashid.com/|title=Karim Rashid|website=karimrashid.com|accessdate=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hlynur Atlason]], and [[Harry Allen (designer)|Harry Allen]].

In 1996, Umbra teamed up with Rashid to create what would become one of the company’s most well-known products; the GARBO trash can. The wastebasket was named after actress [[Greta Garbo]], mimicking the shape of her body. It sold more than two million units within the first two years of production and continues to sell today in a miniature version, GARBINO. It was donated to the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1999 and added into the permanent collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 2000. In 1997, it earned the [[Chicago Athenaeum Good Design Award]].

Rashid also designed the OH Chair for Umbra; a "scoop" of plastic, making use of negative space, modeled into a chair. These chairs are still in the firm's catalogue today.

===Umbra Shift===
Umbra Shift is a brand extension of Umbra that utilizes higher end materials and  different production techniques. The products are sold through the independent retailers and the Umbra Shift website.
