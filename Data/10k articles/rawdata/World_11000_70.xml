'''Baron Cimitière''' (Baron Cemetery) is one of the [[Guédé]], a spirit of the dead, along with [[Baron Samedi]] and [[Baron La Croix]] in [[Haitian Vodun|Vodou]]. He is said to be the guardian of the cemetery, protecting its graves.&lt;ref&gt;http://horrorpedia.com/2013/10/15/baron-samedi-and-haitian-loa-folklore-religion/&lt;/ref&gt;

He wears a tuxedo with tails and a top hat. He has expensive taste, smoking cigars and drinking wine and fine liquor. He is just as crass as the other Guédé, but shows polite manners and an upper-class air while doing so.

==Other manifestations==
Brave Guede is the doorman between the world of the living and the afterlife, guardian of the cemetery gate. He keeps the dead in and the living out.

It was part of [[Fortifications of Malta#French occupation (1798–1800)|a chain of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments]] encircling the French positions in [[Marsamxett Harbour|Marsamxett]] and the [[Grand Harbour]].

Capuchin Convent Battery was built overlooking Kalkara Creek. The battery was located adjacent to a Capuchin convent which had been built between 1736 and 1743.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scerri|first1=John|title=Kalkara|url=http://www.malta-canada.com/churches-chapels/Kalkara.htm|website=malta-canada.com|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convent sheltered it from bombardment from the nearby [[Cottonera Lines]] and the [[Fortifications of Birgu|Post of Castile]]. It was medium-sized, and it blocked a country lane which led towards the creek. Its armament is not known.

The battery was possibly built by [[Alexander Ball]]. Construction started in January 1799, and was completed within a month.&lt;ref name=onparade/&gt;

Like the other French blockade fortifications, the battery was dismantled, possibly sometime after 1814. No traces of the battery can be seen today, but the convent still exists, although it has been modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Maltese ‘siege’ batteries of the blockade 1798-1800|journal=Arx - Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=May 2008|issue=6|page=28|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daojali Hading''' is an important [[Neolithic]] site in [[Dima Hasao District]] of [[Assam]] on the hills near [[Brahmaputra valley]] close to routes leading into [[China]] and [[Myanmar]]. Extensive digging at this site has yielded polished stone tools, ceramics and kitchen items such as grinders, pestles and mortars.Jadeite stone was also found that must be transported from [[China]] .A large number of pots have also been found. These findings suggest that people here were growing and storing grains, and preparing food

'''Desfolhada portuguesa''' ("Portuguese husking"), or simply '''Desfolhada''' (as was introduced as '''Deshojada''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] titles when broadcast because in that last language the word ''Desfolhada'' is similar to an obscene word), was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Simone de Oliveira]] and written by [[Ary dos Santos]].

The song deals with the love of Portugal - the first occasion on which this was the theme of the Portuguese entry, but far from the last. The song compares the love from the conception of a child to patriotic love.

The song was performed fifteenth on the night, following [[France]]'s [[Frida Boccara]] with "[[Un jour, un enfant]]" and preceding [[Finland]]'s [[Jarkko &amp; Laura]] with "[[Kuin silloin ennen]]". At the close of voting, it had received 4 points, placing 15th in a field of 16.

Portugal opted out of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|1970 contest]], one of the many countries to withdraw after the chaotic 1969 result where four songs tied for first place. The entry, however, had been selected at the time the withdrawal was made, so the country would have been represented by [[Sérgio Borges]] with "Onde vais rio que eu canto".

Following the return to the traditional set-up in 1970, Portugal returned to the contest. Thus, the song was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|1971 contest]] by [[Tonicha]] with "[[Menina do alto da serra]]".

'''Devrim''' (lit. ''Revolution'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), was a weekly newspaper published in [[Ankara]] and it was launched on 21 Ekim 1969. The owner was [[Cemal Reşit Eyuboğlu]], and the director of publication was [[Doğan Avcıoğlu]], who also wrote the editorials.

The magazine sought to show that the contemporary understanding of democracy was simply a diversion. Instead, they proposed a 'national – revolutionary' administration in the direction of extra-parliamentary opposition. [[Hasan Cemal]], one of the writers of the magazine in his memoirs, '[[Cumhuriyet'i Çok Sevmiştim]]', confessed that the purpose of such a policy was to convince nationalist officers in the military to stage a coup in the cause of 'National Democratic Revolution'.

The newspaper ceased publication on 27 April 1971 as a result of the [[1971 Turkish coup d'état]]

[[File:Defense de la France.JPG|thumb|Issue of ''Défense de la France'' for 30 September 1943]]
'''''Défense de la France''''' was an [[Underground media in German-occupied Europe|underground newspaper]] produced by a group of the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]].

Essentially developed in the [[Vichy France|Northern Zone]], ''Défense de la France'' distinguishes itself by an activity centered on the distribution of a clandestine newspaper created in August 1941 by a group of Parisian students, of the Christian faith. [[Philippe Viannay]] was the founder of it and the main editor. With a circulation of 450,000 in January 1944, it had the largest circulation of the whole clandestine press.

The niece of [[Charles de Gaulle]], Geneviève, known later under the name of [[Geneviève de Gaulle-Anthonioz]] was part of the founding group of the movement.

The newspaper denounced the attacks and actions of the army up until 1942. It firstly supported General [[Henri Giraud]] before turning to de Gaulle in June 1943. Not represented at the ''[[Conseil National de la Résistance]]'' (National Resistance Council), at the end of 1943 ''Défense de la France'' adhered to the ''[[Mouvement de Libération Nationale (France)|Mouvement de Libération Nationale]]'' (National Liberation Movement), which participated in the foundation of the right-of-center ''[[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]]'' (UDSR).

'''ESPN GamePlan''' was an [[out-of-market sports package]] offering [[college football]] games to viewers throughout the [[United States]].

GamePlan began on [[Labor Day]] weekend, and continued through the first Saturday in December.  It included all regional telecasts on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]], as well as games from various syndicators like [[ESPN Plus]], [[Raycom Sports]] and SportsWest, and some local stations like [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]]'s [[WFMZ-TV]] which broadcast locally-produced college football games. Viewers could watch games from their [[cable television|cable]] or [[satellite television|satellite]] provider or on the [[ESPN3]] [[broadband]] [[Internet]] service.

Eventually, with carriage of [[ESPN3]] moving from computers only to [[smartphone]]s, [[computer tablet|tablets]] and [[digital media player]]s allowing access without any additional fees, GamePlan became a superfluous package, with only the few providers who refused to offer ESPN3 or where ESPN3 access was limited (for instance, rural areas) really able to compel viewers to use the service.

On August 28, 2015, the package was discontinued, along with [[ESPN Full Court]], to make way for [[ESPN College Extra]],&lt;ref&gt;"ESPN College Extra", http://espn.go.com/espncollegeextra/&lt;/ref&gt; which will offer a select bundle of games that would previously have been broadcast by GamePlan and Full Court.&lt;ref&gt;"ESPN GamePlan is no more, ESPN College Extra to take its place." http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/espn-gameplan-is-no-more-espn-college-extra-to-take-its-place.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The New ESPN College Extra, Now on DIRECTV" http://www.itsallaboutsatellites.com/the-new-espn-college-extra-now-on-directv/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1992, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime Event Television]] supplemented ABC's airing of regional college football telecasts by creating "Option Play."&lt;ref&gt;"PPV: the old college try."  http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14372649.html&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed viewers to watch games not airing on their local ABC station via pay-per-view. The original cost for a single game was $8.95 (with each additional game costing $1 extra),&lt;ref&gt;"College football to take pay-per-view turn", http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-08-19/sports/1992232137_1_two-games-southern-cal-game-games-on-television&lt;/ref&gt; with the full "season-ticket" package priced between $49.95 and $69.95.&lt;ref&gt;"ABC, ESPN team to tackle college football on PPV", https://variety.com/1993/tv/news/abc-espn-team-to-tackle-college-football-on-ppv-105575/&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[ESPN]] took over for Showtime and offered the purchase of up to three individual Saturday afternoon blocks for $8.95, as opposed to only a single game. In 1993, the package was renamed "Season Ticket", followed in 1994 by "ABC College Football on ESPN Pay-Per-View." In 1996, the name was again changed to "ESPN GamePlan", as the formation of [[ESPN Plus|ESPN Regional Television]] allowed for additional out-of-market games from conferences such as the Big Ten and MAC to be broadcast. ESPN would also pick up telecasts from other conferences such as the ACC, Big 12, Big East, Conference-USA, Mountain West, Pac-10, SEC and WAC for inclusion in GamePlan.

==Schedule==
Up to 15 games were provided each week.  Some games were joined in progress due to time and channel constraints.
In 2007, ESPN GamePlan picked up additional telecasts of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] and [[Southeastern Conference]] shown on [[Comcast Sports Southeast/Charter Sports Southeast]].  This change replaced [[Big Ten Conference]] games that left ESPN Plus for the new [[Big Ten Network]].

==Pricing==
As of 2014, the regular season offer was $142, or 4 payments of $35.50.  A single day's games was also available for $26.00.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN GamePlan on DISH&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EU Med''' or '''EuroMed 7''', which is also referred to as "Club Med" and "Med Group", is an alliance of seven [[Southern European]] Union member states, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain. All have [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] heritage and, with the exception of [[Portugal]], all border the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

== History ==
The Group was informally established on 17 December 2013 in Brussels at the initiative of the Foreign Ministers of Cyprus and Spain in order to create coordination on issues of common interest within the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/All/1509F682251F88DEC2257C460026875A?OpenDocument]{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was decided that the group would hold an annual meeting at the ministerial level. The first ministerial meeting was to take place in Greece in 2014, during Greece's [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency of the Council]], but instead took place on 14 April in [[Alicante]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famagusta-gazette.com/fm-participates-in-med-group-meeting-p23193-69.htm |title=FM participates in "Med Group" Meeting |publisher=Famagusta-gazette.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambafrance-mt.org/Med-Group-meeting-at-the |title=" Med Group " meeting at the initiative of Cyprus and Spain (Brussels – (...) - La France à Malte |publisher=Ambafrance-mt.org |date=2013-12-30 |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufmsecretariat.org/informal-ministerial-meeting-of-the-mediterranean-group-ufm-presents-latest-updates-on-regional-integration-efforts/ |title=Informal Ministerial Meeting of the Mediterranean Group: UfM presents latest updates on regional integration efforts - Union for the Mediterranean - UfM |publisher=Ufmsecretariat.org |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second meeting took place in February 2015 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abnaorg.eu/?p=4150 |title=FM to attend Med Group ministerial meeting in Paris - ABNA-SE - The Association of the Balkan News Agencies – Southeast Europe |publisher=Abnaorg.eu |date=2015-02-19 |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Ministerial Meeting of the Mediterranean Group took place in Cyprus in February 2016 which was also attended by the Secretary General of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] (UfM), [[Fathallah Sijilmassi]]. The Foreign Ministers discussed security and stability issues in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] as well as the handling of the [[European migration crisis|migration crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/All/29B7C54EE6ACE4F2C2257F68002EB421?OpenDocument%26print |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509001414/http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/mfa2006.nsf/All/29B7C54EE6ACE4F2C2257F68002EB421?OpenDocument |archivedate=2016-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufmsecretariat.org/ministerial-meeting-of-the-med-group-ufm-secretary-general-presents-state-of-play-and-perspectives-for-regional-integration-in-the-mediterranean/ |title=Ministerial Meeting of the "Med Group": UfM Secretary General presents state of play and perspectives for regional integration in the Mediterranean - Union for the Mediterranean - UfM |publisher=Ufmsecretariat.org |date=2016-02-26 |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/cyprus/events/article/cyprus-3rd-informal-ministerial-meeting-of-the-med-group-joint-communique-25-26 |title=Cyprus - 3rd informal Ministerial Meeting of the "Med Group" - Joint Communiqué (25-26.02.16) - France-Diplomatie - Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development |publisher=Diplomatie.gouv.fr |date=2016-02-26 |accessdate=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elections in Liechtenstein''' take place at a national level within a [[multi-party system]], with two dominant [[political parties]]. The [[Landtag of Liechtenstein]] has 25 members, elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]] in two multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]]. 

== Electoral Process ==
{{unsourced section|date=June 2017}}
A variation of the standard party-list [[Proportional representation|proportional]] format is used to elect 15 members from the district of [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] and 10 members from the district of [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]]. The [[Highest Remainder|highest-remainder]] method dictates each party’s [[Counting single transferable votes|seat total]] in a district based on their vote share (which will be covered in more detail) there. Elections in these two districts are essentially separate, and the individual municipal divisions technically play no role in determining the eventual winners.

There are four parties currently registered in Liechtenstein: the [[FDP liechtenstein|FDP]], [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]] (VU), [[Political liechtenstein|DU]], and [[Free List (Liechtenstein)|Free List]] (FL). Each party may nominate as many candidates in a district as can be elected there (15 available for [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] and 10 for [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]]). Voters are assigned voting locations (either [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] or [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]] district) based on their living. When voting, each voter must choose one party but is allowed to select as many candidates as they like (but only up to the maximum given: 15 candidate votes per [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] voter and 10 candidate votes for each [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]] voter).

Any ballots without a single party mark at the top are considered void, but will be accepted no matter how many candidates are chosen. If more candidates are chosen than the limit, the candidates following the fifteenth (if in [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]]) or tenth (if in [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]]) are ignored and only the first 15 ([[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]]) or 10 ([[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]]) distinct choices will count. If the name of a candidate is repeated, only in the first instance where the candidate is named is taken into consideration and all subsequent mentions are ignored.

Although the number of candidates selected by each voter can vary and is up to their own determination, [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] voters still must cast 15 total votes, and [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]] voters always give 10. The difference is made through the candidate rankings, which will be discussed later. Each candidate that is chosen by a voter counts as a vote for that candidate’s party. Each remaining vote out of the 15 (for [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]]) or 10 (for [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]]) corresponding to the number of candidates not chosen counts as a vote for the party initially specified by the voter.

For example, if a voter from [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] chooses the FDP as their party of choice, and then chooses 4 candidates from the VU, 2 candidates from the FDP, and 1 candidate from the DU, then the ''party votes'' that this voter has cast are 4 for the VU, 1 for the DU, and 10 for the FDP (by virtue of the 2 votes for candidates from this party and the 8 remaining, empty candidate votes). Likewise, if an [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]] voter chooses DU as their party of choice, then casts 18 votes for the same FDP candidate and a vote for each of 2 VU candidates, then this voter’s party votes are counted as 1 for the FDP (since only 1 FDP candidate was selected), 2 for the VU, and 7 for the DU due to the 7 remaining candidate votes.

Note that it is impossible for a voter to cast votes for any party other than the one listed at the top of their ballot without selecting the requisite number of candidates from that party. This has been criticized by some as restricting the freedom of voters to choose multiple parties while refraining from supporting at least 1 particular candidate.

Also keep in mind that a maximum of 1 vote can be cast for each candidate by a single voter, and thus it would be impossible for a given voter to cast multiple votes for a single candidate. Especially because parties may not nominate a full slate in a given district since the party usually desires maximum influence on the candidates elected and because it is unlikely for the party to win a very large majority of seats that they had not anticipated, voters who support just one party have complained that their influence is diminished because they can only support the candidates their party has nominated and thus their remaining votes would only count as party votes and not also candidate votes.

Additionally as fact, the expected transition by [[Politics of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein authorities]] to new, electronic voting machines could eliminate the possibility of a voter selecting too many candidates, especially if mistakenly believing that they would all be counted and being told that they could only vote for 15 in the [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] and 10 in the [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]]. The party choice for each voter does not matter if the voter chooses the maximum number of candidates that they are allowed (15 in [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] and 10 in [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]]) but makes a difference of one party vote if they leave one candidate choice blank, and it counts as two party votes if two are unchecked.

Once the number of seats for each party in every district has been determined by the ''party vote'' count in that district, the corresponding candidates of that party with the highest number of votes are elected. For example, if the VU is given three seats in [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]], then the 3 most popular VU candidates in [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]] are elected as the 3 representatives of the VU from the [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]], regardless of how many votes these candidates garnered in relation to candidates from other parties.

If a party is given more seats in a district than the number of candidates that it has nominated there, then the extra seats are redistributed to the other parties as if the party of concern had not received that many votes also by using the [[Hare quota]]. In this case, the maximum number of seats that this party can earn in the relevant district is also equivalent to the total candidates it has nominated there.

It is important to note that votes for a party and votes for candidates are separate and affect the count differently: as explained above, party votes are used only for determining the number of seats given to a party in each [[Districts of liechtenstein|district]], while candidate votes determine which candidates from a party win election from each district, this value corresponding to the number of seats that the party in question receives as determined in the previous step.

This is also why the two districts are not compared outside of the separate elections: [[Oberland (electoral district)|Oberland]] voters get 15 votes each and [[Unterland (electoral district)|Unterland]] voters 10 votes, which would distort support if a party’s vote share is different between the two districts. However, this is evened out because the seats are determined by district, and therefore both districts are approximately equally represented since the ratio of seats between them must be roughly proportional to their [[Demographics of Liechtenstein|population]] difference.

The '''[[flag]] of [[Ceuta]]''' is a black and white [[gyronny]] with a central [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] displaying the [[Coat of arms of Ceuta|municipal coat of arms]].  (The civil flag omits the escutcheon.)

The gyronny is identical to that of the [[flag of Lisbon]], to commemorate the conquest of the city by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in [[Conquest of Ceuta|1415]].&lt;ref name="News1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=CBS News|title=The New York Times Encyclopedic Almanac|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EEMKAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=1973|publisher=New York Times, Book &amp; Educational Division.|page=750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was a part of the [[Portuguese Empire]] until 1640, after which it decided to remain with Spain.&lt;ref name="Drinkwater1786"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Drinkwater|title=A History of the Late Siege of Gibraltar: With a Description and Account of that Garrison, from the Earliest Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeM-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=1786|publisher=T. Spilsbury|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the coat of arms of the city is almost the same as that of the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Kingdom of Portugal]], showing the seven castles and the five [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]] with [[Argent|silver]] [[Roundel (heraldry)|roundels]].&lt;ref name="McMurdo1889"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward McMurdo|title=The History of Portugal: The history of Portugal from the reign of D.

Retrieved 29 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the service started on 6 December 2006. It is aimed at a worldwide market and is generally broadcast via satellite and cable operators around the world, but additionally, in 2010, France 24 began broadcasting through its own iPhone and Android apps. The stated mission of the channels is to "provide a global public service and a common editorial stance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/about-france-24|title=France 24, the company|work=France 24|access-date=3 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203050635/http://www.france24.com/en/about-france-24|archive-date=3 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008 the channel has been wholly owned by the French government, via its holding company [[France Médias Monde]], having bought out the minority share of the former partners: [[TF1 Group|Groupe TF1]] and [[France Télévisions]]. The budget is approximately €100&amp;nbsp;million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aefmonde.com/page/presentation-faits-chiffres.html |title=Faits et chiffres |publisher=Audiovisuel Exterieur de France |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230034300/http://www.aefmonde.com/page/presentation-faits-chiffres.html |archivedate=30 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming ==
{{Stack|[[Image:F24 newstitle.png|thumb|The News title as of 9 January 2011]]}}
France 24 is broadcast on four channels: in French, in English, in Arabic and in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20101012-france-24-arabic-channel-goes-24-hours-north-africa-middle-east-news-television|title=FRANCE 24's Arabic channel goes to 24 hours|work=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France 24's programming is divided more or less equally between news coverage and news magazines or special reports.

Along with 260 journalists of its own, France 24 can call on the resources of the two main French broadcasters ([[TF1 Group|Groupe TF1]] and [[France Télévisions]]) as well as partners such as [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] and [[Radio France Internationale|RFI]]. The CEO of France 24 is [[Alain de Pouzilhac]]. From 19 May 2010 and the Director of France 24 since 2012 is [[Marc Saikali]], France 24 unveiled a new schedule that prioritizes the morning and evening slots, anchored live by the network's editorial staff. More programming space than ever before goes to business, sport, culture, and studio discussion.

As from 2016, France 24 shares its French-language night programming with the France-based [[France Info]]. According to Marie-Christine Saragosse, president and CEO of France Médias Monde, "part of the value added of this public channel" would be the fact that "[France 24 journalists] will be wide awake while others would be sleeping".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqz5INe_4GM&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Channel inception===
The media's perception was that the channel was a [[Idea|brainchild]] of former president [[Jacques Chirac]], famous for defending the position of the French language in the world, specifically versus the English domination in this media category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6215170.stm |title=France launches world TV channel |publisher= BBC News |date=6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First project (1987–1997)===
In 1987, then French Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] expressed his desire for an international television news channel in French and had requested a report into the activities of current international broadcasts from France ([[Radio France Internationale]], [[TV5MONDE|TV5]], and to a certain extent [[Outre-Mer 1ère|Réseau France Outre-Mer]]) and noted the collective offering was ''"fragmented, disorganised and ineffective."''

With the arrival of [[François Mitterrand]] as President in 1981 and the naming of [[Michel Rocard]] as Prime Minister in 1988, the government launched a new project, ''Canal France International'' (CFI), a package of programmes aimed at making programmes in French for foreign audiences, particularly in Africa, to be developed in parallel as a television channel.

The First [[Gulf War]] of 1990, relayed across the world by [[CNN International]] in particular, revealed the power of international news channels and their role in the formation of opinion. A parliamentary minister, [[Philippe Séguin]], wished to create a French-language equivalent.

In 1996, after nineteen governmental reports in ten years, Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] asked [[Radio France Internationale]] president [[Jean-Paul Cluzel]] (who was also [[General Inspection of Finances (France)|General Inspector of Finances]]) to create a French international news channel. Cluzel proposed in 1997 to group TV5, RFI, and CFI within a corporation entitled Téléfi. The [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]-led government decided to follow that recommendation but, with the return of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to government and the nomination of [[Hubert Védrine]], the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, favoured the augmentation of existing outlets such as TV5, which started to produce its own programming, notably its news bulletins, which in turn created its own news team.

Additionally with the creation of [[EuroNews]] in 1993 (with French-language commentary), the media presence of France overseas became more complex, more fragmented, and costlier, without being able to rely on a true round-the-clock international news channel.

===Relaunched project (2002–2003)===
In 2002, President Jacques Chirac relaunched the project to create a French international news channel; after a speech given at a reception in honour of the High Council of the Francophonie at the 'Élysée on 12 February 2002, he stated:

''"Is it understandable that year after year we are still lamenting our persistent failure with news and the French-language media on the international scene? Admittedly, we have with [[Agence France-Presse]] a remarkable information tool that we must continue to reinforce, notably in its international mission. Indeed, everyone here recognises the recent progress made by RFI, by TV5, by CFI, thanks to the efforts of their teams and to the determination of the public bodies. But everybody notices that we are still far from having a large international news channel in French, capable of competing with the BBC or CNN."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/fevrier/allocution_prononcee_par_m_jacques_chirac_president_de_la_republique_lors_de_la_reception_en_l_honneur_du_haut_conseil_de_la_francophonie-palais_de_l_elysee.2162.html Speech given by Jacques Chirac to the High Commission of the Francophonie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210853/http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/fevrier/allocution_prononcee_par_m_jacques_chirac_president_de_la_republique_lors_de_la_reception_en_l_honneur_du_haut_conseil_de_la_francophonie-palais_de_l_elysee.2162.html |date=30 September 2007 }} (French), 12 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The recent crises have shown the handicap that a country suffers, a cultural area, which doesn't possess a sufficient weight in the battle of the images and the airwaves. Let us question, in the time of terrestrial television networks, of satellite, of the internet, on our organisation in this domain, and notably in the dissipation of public funds which are reserved to them."''

On 7 March, speaking in the French Senate in front of foreign delegates to France, and as part of his presidential campaign, Chirac said:

''"We must have the ambition of a big, round-the-clock news channel in French, equal to the BBC or CNN for the English-speaking world. It is essential for the influence of our country. For our expatriates, it would be a live and an immediate link to the mainland"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/mars/discours_de_m_jacques_chirac_devant_les_representants_des_francais_de_l_etranger-campagne_electorale_pour_l_election_presidentielle.426.html Speech given by Jacques Chirac in front of foreign representatives of the French state] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222601/http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/interventions/discours_et_declarations/2002/mars/discours_de_m_jacques_chirac_devant_les_representants_des_francais_de_l_etranger-campagne_electorale_pour_l_election_presidentielle.426.html |date=30 September 2007 }}, (French), 7 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his reelection, the first reflections were engaged at the [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], headed by [[Dominique de Villepin]]. Various technical options were examined at the time, in an unreleased report:

* '''Purchase of EuroNews''' by the French State
* '''Creation of an external channel''', proposed by then-[[France Télévisions]] President Marc Tessier, approved by the previous government.
* An '''international version of [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]]''', proposed by [[Groupe TF1]], which asked for a state subvention for the service.
* '''Strengthening of TV5's news service''', as suggested by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The subsequent wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]] reassured the authorities about the project, especially in February 2003, when the American broadcasters CNN, [[FOX News]], and [[MSNBC]] opted not to broadcast the long applause given by the members of the United Nations Security Council after Dominique de Villepin gave his address on the Iraq conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignpolicy.org.tr/documents/villepin_140203_p.htm Statement by Dominique de Villepin to the United Nations Security Council]. ''Foreign Policy''. 14 February 2003. Retrieved 5 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2003, [[Prime Minister of France|Matignon]] opened offers to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Elicit the development of an international news channel. Broadcasting primarily in the French language, this service will assure a more important and more visible presence of France in the worldwide battle of images, and to contribute to the pluralism of international information by offering to our viewers the choice of a different viewpoint on the news, marked by a singular point of view of our country on world affairs, by its culture and by its own ideas, and to value its historical links and its privileged geography. The international news channel must contribute to a long-lasting strategy of influence of France in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022113155/http://www.ddm.gouv.fr/article.php3?id_article=615 Consultation guide, Direction and Developemt of Media (Archive)] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the application deadline on 22 April 2003, three candidates replied:
* '''France Télévisions''' &amp; '''RFI''': to operate a channel entirely run by the public service sector;
* '''Groupe TF1''' : proposed an international version of its '''LCI''' channel;
* '''Groupe Canal+''' : proposed a news "factory" to reinforce its '''[[i-Télé|i&gt;Télé]]''' channel, already seen in 47 countries but running at a financial loss.

One month later, a parliamentary commission gave its conclusion, voted with a unanimous decision by its members in the National Assembly, to form a '''public-owned corporation''' ''(groupement d'intérêt public)'' grouping all of the public broadcasters (France Télévisions, RFO, RFI, TV5 and AFP) with the goal of launching the channel at the end of 2004.

Ignoring the work of the parliamentary commission, the government asked a member of the assembly, Bernard Brochand, to form a partnership between the applying candidates for the international channel, something which the parliamentary commission did not demand. Brochard attempted to group both '''Groupe TF1''' and '''Groupe Canal+''', with no success. He then proposed a 50/50 partnership between '''France Télévisions''' and '''Groupe TF1''' (whilst at the same time rejecting '''RFI'''), both groups possessing the technical means and experience of broadcasting externally: TF1 with its LCI channel and France Télévisions' editorial teams at [[France 2]] and [[France 3]].

===Preparing for launch (2004–2006)===

====Defying parliament====
After a press conference in January 2004, President Chirac wished for a launch of the channel towards the end of the year. However, various disputes began to surface. The ministers of the assembly that voted were angry that the recommendations voted for in the parliamentary commission were thrown out in favour of one prepared outside the parliamentary framework. Unionised journalists working for France Télévisions denounced the potential alliance with the private sector, calling it ''"the marriage of the snake and the rabbit"''; [[Radio France International]] was angry that it were not to be associated with the project. A headline published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' described the partnership having a ''"public channel, private owner"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2006/01/BENILDE/13103 |title=Parrain privé, chaîne publique |work=Le Monde diplomatique |location =Paris |date=January 2006 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sections of the press criticised its modest budget of 80 million euro (compared with 600 million euro for [[BBC World News|BBC World]]). Finally the Minister for Foreign Affairs had worried that the budget would take away from existing funded channels such as [[TV5MONDE|TV5]].

Facing discontentment, the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] delayed all discussion of the project in 2004. Then Foreign Minister Michel Barnier announced on 21 July that the channel would not be funded before 2007, which was confirmed by a vote in parliament on the Finance Bill.

However, the Prime Minister acceded to pressure from the [[Élysée]]; a press conference by Raffarin on 9 December confirmed the launch of the new news channel in 2005.

''"I have decided to accept the proposed joint venture proposed by France Télévisions and TF1. As desired by the President, the new channel will draw on the talents of major French television companies, and will promote the expression of a French vision, more necessary than ever in the world today. The Government will present an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the start of the channel, to a total of 30 million euro."''&lt;ref&gt;Press conference, 9 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
The amendment was carried the same day in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].

====Public-private angst====
The start of 2005 concerned obtaining the authorisation necessary from the [[European Union]] and the relevant competition commissions. Trade union members working for France Télévisions continued to voice opposition to the project and circulated a petition in March 2005. The newly elected president of the public corporation, [[Patrick de Carolis]], who assumed his position in the summer (and who had been accused of being too close to the President), expressed doubts about an alliance with TF1:

''"To be effective, you need a single driver in a car".''&lt;ref&gt;Delesalle, Nicolas (11 January 2006). "La voix de la France, en léger différé…", ''[[Télérama]]'', n°2922.&lt;/ref&gt;

He insisted that the channel be made available within France, which the members of parliament required, and which [[TF1]], wanting to protect its own news channel [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]], could object to. Patrick Le Lay, president of TF1, gave his blessing for the channel to be broadcast domestically and wished the direction of the channel to alternate every six months between the two parties, and eventually a Supervisory Board devolved to France Télévisions. These few amendments needed new authorisation from the French and European authorities, obtained this time round without difficulty.

===Birth (2006–2008)===
The launch of the channel was made official after a statement to the cabinet of the [[Minister of Culture (France)#Names of the Ministry of Culture|Ministry of Culture and Communication]], headed by [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]] on 30 November 2005:

''" The project of the International French News Channel (abbreviated in French to '''CFII''')[...] will allow us to propose our own country's vision of world events and to reinforce its presence in the world."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/salle_de_presse/communiques_du_conseil_des_ministres/2005/novembre/communique_du_conseil_des_ministres_du_30_11_2005.33186.html&amp;title=communiqu%C3%A9%20officiel%20du%20Conseil%20des%20ministres|title=Statement by the Ministry of Culture and Communication (Archive)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alain de Pouzilhac, former CEO of Havas, was named President, along with two deputies, one each from group partners TF1 and France Télévisions.

Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that CFII, against the wishes of TF1, would be broadcast within mainland France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/071/article_39709.asp "Financée par l'argent public, il est légitime qu'elle soit diffusée en France"]. Radio France International. 9 November 2005. (French)&lt;/ref&gt; However, TF1 wished to launch its news channel LCI onto the digital terrestrial platform. In order to placate TF1, CFII was due to be broadcast via satellite and cable.

On 22 April 2006, ''Le Monde'' announced that the managers of the forthcoming channel found its initial name difficult to pronounce ('''CFII''', in French pronounced as ''C-F-I-I'' or ''C-F-2-I'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0%2C1-0%2C36-764014%2C0.html Article published online, ''Le Monde'' (Paris). (Paid article) (Archive)]{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (French), 23 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A new name was announced on 30 June 2006;  '''France 24''' (pronounced ''France vingt-quatre''). This decision was taken by the Supervisory Board, chaired by France Télévision president Patrick de Carolis, who made the choice from a list of five potential names.

'''France 24''' launched on 6 December 2006, initially available online as a web stream, followed by satellite distribution a day later, covering France and the rest of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the United States (specifically airing in [[New York State]] and the [[District of Columbia]] using two channels: one in English and the other in French.  Since April 2007 the channel increased its reach, airing programmes in Arabic for viewers in the [[Maghreb]], North Africa and the Middle East.

Two months after launch, a survey conducted by [[Taylor Nelson Sofres|TNS Sofres]] indicated that 75% of respondents in France questioned thought France 24 was ''"useful and essential"'',&lt;ref&gt;Survey published in ''[[Metro International#Europe|Métro]]'', 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but questions have arisen concerning the France 24 name being too Franco-centric for an international news channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://agora.qc.ca/francophonie.nsf/Dossiers/Television&amp;title=commentaire%20du%20politologue%20Marc%20Chevrier "France24, ou le splendide isolement audiovisuel de la France"], Marc Chevrier, Professor of Political Science, [[Université du Québec à Montréal]]. ''Encyclopédie de la Francophonie''. Retrieved 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====State takes over====
In 2008 [[Groupe TF1]] ceded its share in the channel to a government-owned holding company, '''Société de l'audiovisuel extérieur de la France''' '''(AEF)''', whilst conversely committing to producing programmes for the channel until 2015.

Despite the launch of France 24, the fragmentation of public broadcasting overseas continues. The total budget for external broadcasting from France totalled 300 million euro each year. Following the election of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as President in May 2007, a "steering committee" of twenty members was called in with view to reform in June 2007. President Sarkozy called on [[Bernard Kouchner]] and [[Christine Albanel]], respectively [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|Foreign Minister]] and [[Minister of Culture (France)|Culture Minister]] to reform the current system. The proposition of reform was met with concern from Belgium, Switzerland and Canada/[[Québec]], as the public broadcasters involved in '''[[TV5MONDE|TV5]]''' (of which the French government holds a 49% share whilst the three aforementioned countries hold 11% each) consider TV5 to be a promoter of the wider French-language world.&lt;ref&gt;"Audiovisuel extérieur. Une réforme au forceps", Daniel Psenny, ''Le Monde'' (Paris). 11 October 2007, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Just one month after France 24's launch, TV5 renamed itself [[TV5MONDE]].

As published in the ''Journal Officiel de la République Française'' of 23 January 2009, a Decree for 23 January 2009 appeared, ''authorising the company '''France Télévisions''' to cede its share in the capital of the France 24 company''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020166732&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id Legifrance.gouv.fr]. 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The same Decree transferred its share to the ''Société de l'audiovisuel extérieur de la France'' '''(AEF)''', which made AEF sole shareholder of France 24, for the sum of 4 million euro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020166734&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id Legifrance.gouv.fr]. 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under one ''maison'' (2008–present)===
President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] announced on 8 January 2008 that he was in favour of reducing France 24's programming to French only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3236,36-999167@51-999278,0.html "La chaîne France 24 dans l'incertitude"]. ''Le Monde'' (Paris).&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 '''AEF''' announced a merger between '''France 24''' and '''Radio France International''', a procedure finalised on 13 February 2012. It is expected that staff from Radio France International (which includes Arabic sister station '''Monte Carlo Doualiya''') will move to premises currently home to France 24. Alain de Pouzilhac, president of AEF stated in ''Le Monde'':

{{quote|"We have just created a French audiovisual group of international dimensions, that aspires to be powerful and ambitious; [the merger] is irreversible and is definitive"}}

102 posts, of which 85 from RFI, were cut preceding the official merger. Editorial teams, technical and distribution, financial and human resources departments of both France 24 and RFI were involved. On 13 February 2012 the merger of France 24 and RFI was made official.

===Long-term goals===
France 24 aims to compete with leading English-language international news channels [[BBC World News]] and [[CNN International]]. Its intention is to put more emphasis on debate, dialogue and the role of cultural differences. It also competes with [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Al Jazeera English]], and [[NHK World]] news channels. The Arabic programming competes with [[Al Jazeera]]'s Arabic service, [[RT Arabic]], [[BBC Arabic Television|BBC Arabic]] and [[Sky News Arabia]]. The new Spanish channel for the Latin American market is expected to start in September 2017. It will compete with [[CNN en Español]], [[DW (Latinoamérica)]], [[NTN24]], [[TeleSUR]], [[RT Spanish|RT en español]] and [[CCTV-E]]

The French government allocated around €100&amp;nbsp;million for the project. The [[European Commission]] gave the green light to France 24 in June 2006, saying it did not breach [[European Union]] state aid rules.

=== Overnight simulcast ===
From 2 September 2016, France's new news channel, [[France Info (TV channel)|France Info]], started simulcasting France 24 from midnight to 6{{nbsp}}am daily, when the channel doesn't broadcast live except the on-the-hour news bulletins.

However, from 20 March 2017, on weekdays, France Info started simulcasting France 24 until 6:30 am, due to the main presenter Laurent Bignolas anchors the early newscast on France 2 ''Le 6H Info'', which isn't simulcast on France Info.

The show is hosted by two presenters and together with the attractive "Adrenaline girls", they rotate every three to four months. Some of the most beloved Bulgarian comedians have hosted the show.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2876">'''Hostivít''' was the last of the seven [[Bohemia]]n mythical princes between the (also mythical) founder of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]] [[Přemysl, the Ploughman|Přemysl the Ploughman]] and the first historical prince [[Bořivoj]]. The names of the princes were first recorded in [[Cosmas of Prague|Cosmas chronicle]] and then transmitted into the most of historical books of the 19th century including [[František Palacký]]'s ''The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia''. According to tradition, he was the father of the non-legendary prince Bořivoj. Some historians suppose that when [[St. Ludmila]] was born, Hostivít (or [[Svatopluk I]] of Moravia) and Ludmila's father, [[Slavibor]], contracted that Bořivoj and Ludmilla would get married (that can refer to the wedding procession of an unknown bride mentioned in [[Annales Fuldenses]] for 871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moraviamagna.cz/tabulky/t14premp.htm Notes 4 and 6 on]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Chronicle of Dalimil]], Hostivít had a brother called Děpolt who inherited the land of [[Kouřim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moraviamagna.cz/povesti/p_da22hd.htm  Chronicle of Dalimil]&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory about the number of the princes is propped on the [[fresco]]es on the walls of the [[Ducal Rotunda of the Virgin Mary and St Catherine|Rotunda]] in [[Znojmo]], [[Moravia]] but [[Anežka Merhautová]] claimed that the frescoes depict all the members of the Přemyslid dynasty including the Moravian junior princes.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Krzemieńska-Anežka Merhautová-[[Dušan Třeštík]]: "Moravští Přemyslovci ve znojemské rotundě", Praha 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the name ==

Hostivít's name is thought to be derived from the old [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] words ''"hosti"'' meaning ''guests'' and ''"vítat"'' meaning ''to welcome''. [[Záviš Kalandra]] thought the names of the seven princes were cryptical names of ancient Slavonic days of the week - Hostivít being the seventh - Saturday when the guests are welcome.&lt;ref&gt;Záviš Kalandra: "České pohanství", Praha 1947&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory says that the names were mistaken from a coherent and partly interrupted old Slavonic text.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimír Karbusický: Báje, mýty, dějiny.  Nejstarší české pověsti v kontextu evropské kultury, p.237, Praha 1995 [http://www.moraviamagna.cz/rodokmeny/r_2myty.htm#p5]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hryvnia sign''' ('''₴''') is a [[currency symbol]] used for the [[Ukrainian hryvnia]] [[currency]] since 2004.

==Description==
[[File:Hryvnia symbol.svg|50px|left|Hryvnia currency sign]]
The hryvnia sign is a [[cursive]] [[Ukrainian alphabet|Ukrainian Cyrilic letter]] [[He (Cyrillic)|He]] (''г''), or a mirrored letter S, with a double horizontal stroke, symbolising stability, similar to that used in other currency symbols such as ¥ or €. Hryvnia is abbreviated "грн" (hrn) in Ukrainian. The hryvnia sign ₴ was released in March 2004. The specific design of the hryvnia sign was a result of a public contest held by [[National Bank of Ukraine]] in 2003. The bank announced that it would not take any special steps of promoting the sign, but expressed expectations that the recognition and the technical possibilities of rendering the sign would follow. As soon as the sign was announced, a proposal to encode it was written. The sign was Unicode encoded as {{unichar|20B4|HRYVNIA SIGN|html=}} in version 4.1, as published in 2005.
The symbol appears in the [[filigree]] of the 1 Hryvnia banknote.

{{for|nameskes|Ita (disambiguation)}}
'''Ita''' was an ancient city and former bishopric in [[Roman North Africa]], now a Latin Catholic [[titular see]] in [[Algeria]].

== History ==
Media was important enough in the [[Roman province]] of [[Mauretania Caesariensis]] to become one of the many [[suffragan diocese]]s, but was to fade completely, no ruins being identified.

Its only historically documented bishop was Lucius, who attended the [[Council of Carthage (484)|Council of Carthage in 484]] called by the [[Arian]] king [[Huneric]] of the [[Vandal Kingdom]], after which he was banished like most Catholic participants, unlike the [[Donatist]] heretical counterparts.

== Titular see ==
The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin [[titular bishopric]] of Ita (Latin = Curiate Italian) / Iten(sis) (Latin adjective).

It is vacant, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank:
* Tadeusz Stanisław Szwagrzyk (1964.11.03 – death 1992.12.07) as [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Częstochowa|Archdiocese of Częstochowa]] (Poland) (1964.11.03 – 1992.12.07)
* James Anthony Tamayo (1993.01.26 – 2000.07.03) as Auxiliary Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Galveston-Houston|Diocese of Galveston–Houston]] ([[Texas]], USA) (1993.01.26 – 2000.07.03); later first Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Laredo|Laredo]] (Texas, USA) (2000.07.03 – ...)
* Pedro Luiz Stringhini (2001.01.03 – 2009.12.30) as Auxiliary Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Paulo|Archdiocese of São Paulo]] (Brazil) (2001.01.03 – 2009.12.30); later Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Franca|Franca]] (Brazil) (2009.12.30 – 2012.09.19), Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogi das Cruzes|Mogi das Cruzes]] (Brazil) (2012.09.19 – ...)
* Gabriel Edoe Kumordji, [[Divine Word Missionaries]] (S.V.D.) (2010.01.19 – 2017.03.16) as first [[Apostolic Vicar]] of [[Apostolic Vicariate of Donkorkrom|Donkorkrom]] ([[Ghana]]) (2010.01.19 – 2017.03.16); previously last Prefect Apostolic of Donkorkrom (2007.06.12 – 2010.01.19); later Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Keta–Akatsi|Keta–Akatsi]] (Ghana) (2017.03.16 – ...).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6321">'''Luxembourgish euro coins''' feature three different designs, though they all contain the portrait or [[effigy]] of [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg]]. The designs, by Yvette Gastauer-Claire, also contain the [[European symbols|12 stars of the EU]] flag, the year of imprint and the name of the country in the [[Luxembourgish language]]: ''Lëtzebuerg''. [[Luxembourg]] does not mint its own coins. The Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt ([[Royal Dutch Mint]]), in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the [[Netherlands]], produced Luxembourgish coins dated 2002–2004 and again from 2009 onward. [[Mint of Finland]], in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], produced the coins dated 2005–2006. [[Monnaie de Paris]] (Mint of Paris), in [[Pessac]], [[France]], produced coins dated 2007-2008.

The Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg appears on the coins facing to the left.&lt;ref name="left/right"&gt;In heraldry, directions are often described as they would appear to the bearer of a coat of arms, rather than as they would appear to the viewer. Therefore, coin descriptions will use "facing to the left" when it would appear to the layperson that the person depicted is facing to the right.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not featured on the [[Luxembourgish franc]] as he only became Grand Duke in 2000 following the abdication of his father, [[Jean of Luxembourg|Jean]]. Jean's portrait on the francs showed him facing to the right, and it is common in a number of countries for successive monarchs to alternate the direction they faced on coins. Other euro coins issued by member states which are monarchies show their monarchs facing to the left, in common with the effigy on their legacy currencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1934">The '''Nuithones''' were one of the [[Nerthus]]-worshipping [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]s mentioned by [[Tacitus]] in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''.

The '''papal conclave of 1730''' elected [[Pope Clement XII]] as the successor to [[Pope Benedict XIII]].

==Background==
[[Pope Benedict XIII]] died on February 21, 1730 at the age of eighty-one. The conclave which followed is considered to be the longest and most corrupt of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=artifacts/&gt; The conclave opened on March 5 with thirty cardinals, but the numbers increased as more began to arrive. None of the Portuguese Cardinals were in attendance, apparently due to friction between Rome and Lisbon. There were fifty-six cardinals present. At some point in the four-month long ordeal, at least half had been proposed.

==Factions==
One voting bloc was made up of twelve cardinals who had been appointed by Benedict XIII, but this group had no clear leader. A second group was made up of cardinals appointed by [[Pope Alexander VIII]]. Politically, they were allied with the French party, which represented the interests of [[Louis XV]]. 

The Imperial party were all subjects of the Austrian Emperor. This group included Cardinal [[Gianantonio Davia]], a former papal nuncio to Vienna under salary from the imperial court. The Spanish party suffered from internal dissension, but was broadly allied with the Emperor. 

There were also a Savoyard contingent representing Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, King of Sardinia; and the ''Zelanti'', who opposed all secular interference. In addition, the Florentine House of Medici was using financial enticements to forward their candidate, [[Pope Clement XII|Lorenzo Corsini]].

None of the factions were sufficiently large enough to bring a successful vote for their respective candidates.

==Political influence==
From about 1600 to the early 20th century, certain Catholic monarchs claimed the ''[[jus exclusivae]]'' (right of exclusion), i.e. to veto a candidate for the papacy, exercised through a crown-cardinal. By an informal convention, each state claiming the veto was allowed to exercise the right once per conclave. Therefore, a crown-cardinal did not announce the veto until the very last moment when the candidate in question seemed likely to get elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05677b.htm Sägmüller, Johannes Baptist. "Right of Exclusion." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 11 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This conclave saw a good deal of maneuvering by the various parties to induce another to exercise the veto prematurely.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; At one point, in lieu of a veto, the Spanish party threatened to exit the conclave if a particular opposition candidate was likely to be chosen.

Cardinal [[Cornelio Bentivoglio]] presented the veto of King [[Philip V of Spain]] against the election of Cardinal [[Giuseppe Renato Imperiali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petruccelli della Gattina|first1=Ferdinando |title=Histoire diplomatique des conclaves| date=1866| publisher=A.

In 1720 he had attempted to influence the Republic of Genoa to arrest Cardinal [[Giulio Alberoni]], an erstwhile court favorite made a duke and grandee of Spain. However, the veto had been signed by the Spanish Secretary of State rather than the King and was subject to a challenge. Matters dragged on while a messenger was sent to Madrid to obtain verification.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

The Emperor had sent notification of his opposition to Cardinal [[Pietro Marcellino Corradini]], who appeared to be leading with thirty votes. Corradini had opposed the Emperor's attempts at interference in the Papal States, and his attempt to name Hugh Francis Fustenberg bishop of Hildesheim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setino.it/corradini.htm Abbenda, Charles Louis. "Life and Works of Cardinal Pietro Marcellino Corradini", Setino, November 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the middle of May there was a series of earthquakes in Italy. The tension was high, both inside and outside the Conclave, as many interpreted the earthquakes as evidence of God's displeasure at the failure of the Cardinals to elect a Pope.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1730.html Adams, John Paul. "Sede Vacante 1730", California State University at Northridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Eventually Cardinal Cienfuegos persuaded the Germans to accept Corsini as an alternative to Corradini. The Spanish and French factions agreed. After months of contention, on July 12, 1730 Corsini was chosen and took the name of his patron, Clement XI. He was seventy-eight years of age at the time of his election and would rule for nearly ten years.&lt;ref name=artifacts&gt;[http://www.papalartifacts.com/collection/pope-clement-xii/ "Pope Clement XII", Papal Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt; One of Clement's first actions was to create a commission to investigate charges of embezzlement by various officials under his predecessor.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

'''Peruc-Korycany Formation''' is a [[Geology|geologic]] unit of Upper [[Cretaceous]] age, located mostly in the [[Czech Republic]]. [[Dinosaur]] fossil remains about 94 million years old ([[Cenomanian]] stage) were found in 2003 near the village Mezholezy ([[Miskovice]]), by [[Kutná Hora]]. This small ornithopod dinosaur was officially named as ''[[Burianosaurus]] augustai'' in 2017.

'''Real Digital''' was the brand name for a digital satellite television and [[satellite radio|radio]] service in the United Kingdom which was transmitted from [[SES S.A.]]'s [[Astra (satellites)|Astra]] satellites located at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]] ([[Astra 2A]]/[[Astra 2B|2B]]/[[Astra 2D|2D]]/[[Astra 1N|1N]]) and [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat 28A|28A]] satellite at 28.5°E. Real Digital had planned to launch in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realdigitaltv.com/about.html|title=This is the real deal|publisher=Real Digital|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service ceased transmitting on 31 March 2012 to "undergo essential maintenance work", and promised to return in approximately seven days.&lt;ref name="Essential maintenance" /&gt; On 26 April 2013, David Henry informed [[The Guardian]] that the service intended to launch in the autumn.&lt;ref name="Henry Guardian" /&gt;{{As of|2015|01}}, the service has still not launched.

Real Digital's main competitors were [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Virgin Media]].&lt;ref name="Alternative to Freesat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/40565/real-digital-takes-on-freesat|title=Real Digital: The new alternative to Freesat|publisher=Pocket-lint|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freesat and Sky rival"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cable.co.uk/news/freesat-and-sky-rival-real-digital-set-for-uk-launch-800770480/|title=Freesat and Sky rival Real Digital set for UK launch|publisher=Cable.co.uk|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channels==
Real Digital only offered [[free-to-air]] channels which have been available on other platforms for several years.  They had intended to offer [[pay television]] packages by spring 2012 which would have included [[Sky Sports]] 1 and 2 and a high definition version of Blackbelt TV.&lt;ref name="Freesat and Sky rival" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sky Sports launch offer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a284464/real-digital-eyes-sky-sports-launch-offer.html|title=Real Digital eyes Sky Sports launch offer|publisher=Digital Spy|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also planned that subscription packages were to be available on a month-by-month basis, without a contract or minimum subscription period. Additionally, it was proposed that [[pay-per-view]] services would be made available. Support for the [[BBC iPlayer]] and [[ITV Player]] [[video on demand]] services had also been announced.&lt;ref name="Freesat and Sky rival" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realdigitaltv.com/entry006_dst.html|title=Sneak Peek|publisher=Real Digital|date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical information==
The service made use of the same fleet of satellites as [[Freesat]] and [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Astra 28.2°E]] and [[Eutelsat 28A]]. This meant that any satellite dish which was positioned to receive these services was capable of receiving Real Digital, with either an additional suitable receiver or by simply swapping an old Freesat/Sky set top box with a REAL Digital STB. Providing the LNB ([[low-noise block downconverter]]) has sufficient outputs, the one dish was able to receive multiple services. For their proposed pay TV offering, Real Digital intended to use a [[Conax]] [[conditional access]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realdigitaltv.com/entry003_conax.html|title=Conax and Real Digital|publisher=Real Digital|date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real Digital offered two kinds of [[set-top box]]es, one with a single tuner and the other with a dual tuner [[Digital video recorder|PVR]], which were manufactured by [[Fortec Star]] and [[Digital Stream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realdigitaltv.com/entry007_maplins%20online.html|title=First Production run finished!|publisher=Real Digital|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Launch===
Before launch, the company had missed many promised launch dates.&lt;ref name="Alternative to Freesat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/201010278507/competition-tribunal-to-judge-on-real-dth-alternative-to-sky-sports.html|title=Competition tribunal to judge on REAL DTH alternative to Sky Sports|publisher=Rapid TV News|date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service eventually began broadcasting on 1 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/REALDigitalTV/posts/341357832548828?comment_id=4726268|title=Need to replace my...|publisher=Facebook|date=24 January 2012}}{{Dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test boxes were received by reviewers and a small number of beta-testers in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wotsat.com/news/article.asp?a=10205|title=Real Digital PVR- £300|publisher=What Satellite and Digital TV|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014|04}} production boxes still have not reached any high street retail stores, despite an agreement being announced with [[Maplin Electronics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realdigitaltv.com/entry005_maplin.html|title=Pre-order now!|publisher=Real Digital|date=August 2011|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they had been carried by select specialist online retailers.

While a number of set top boxes had been delivered to both testers and reviewers the first manufacturer Fortec Star was both late at delivering and incomplete software led to Maplin Electronics cancelling orders with Fortec Star. A number of live demonstrations to retailers showed the REAL Digital EPG and TV channel lists running and the GUI was widely praised.

===Suspension of service===
On 31 March 2012 at midnight, the lease of the transponder on [[Eutelsat]]'s [[Eutelsat 28A]] satellite ran out.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The transponder was subsequently cleared, removing the EPG broadcast stream. Real Digital claim to be undergoing essential maintenance work, with the signal going offline for approximately 7 days.&lt;ref name="Essential maintenance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realdigitaltv.com/entry010_maintenance.html|title=Maintenance|publisher=Real Digital|date=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move left the Real Digital beta-testers with nothing more than the [[DVB-S]] standard now and next programme information.

{{As of|2012|11}}, the stream has not returned and on 11 April 2012 Real Digital claimed on Facebook that work had halted due to the Easter break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/REALDigitalTV/posts/398075800210364?comment_id=5117378|title=Looks like it's...|publisher=Facebook|date=11 April 2012}}{{Dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Facebook post on 2 May 2012, denied that the service had closed but no further updates would be provided until there was definite news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/REALDigitalTV/posts/223381181105899?comment_id=846118|title=The wiki says you...|publisher=Facebook|date=2 May 2012}}{{Dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 2012, Real Digital deleted their Facebook page and removed all links to it from their website.

{{As of|2014|04}}, the company is still listed as active by [[Companies House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/05982572|title=REAL DIGITAL TV LIMITED 05982572|publisher=Companies House|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 2012 Real Digital submitted a communication to the [[Competition Appeal Tribunal]], in which Real Digital stated that it hoped to have a "soft launch" of a pay TV service in the first quarter of 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/1.1152_1155_1156-9_1170_1179_Ruling_270213.pdf|title=Ruling (Consequential matters)|publisher=Competition Appeal Tribunal|date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this failed to occur. On 26 April 2013, David Henry informed [[The Guardian]] that the service intends to launch in the autumn,&lt;ref name="Henry Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/26/bt-sky-sports-price-bskyb|title=BT wins right to take Sky Sports price ruling to court of appeal|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this did not happen.

==Management==
The company was founded by former [[Rapture TV]] boss David Henry and [[Information TV]] boss Fred Perkins.&lt;ref name="Sky Sports launch offer" /&gt; On 11 November 2011, David Henry was disqualified from acting as a company director after failing to ensure that one of his former companies paid the appropriate amount of tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insolvency.presscentre.com/Press-Releases/Former-director-of-Broadcasting-company-disqualified-over-VAT-refund-672a6.aspx|title=Former director of Broadcasting company disqualified over VAT refund|publisher=The Insolvency Service|date=21 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630041335/http://insolvency.presscentre.com/Press-Releases/Former-director-of-Broadcasting-company-disqualified-over-VAT-refund-672a6.aspx|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Henry had been acting as managing director of Real Digital until he resigned on 21 February 2012 from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencorporates.com/filings/99681822|title=Termination of appointment of director|publisher=OpenCorporates|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 14 October 2013, Frederick J. Perkins has become an inactive company director for Real Digital, Wouter V. Ruth is now the only active acting company director and secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opencorporates.com/companies/gb/05982572|title=REAL DIGITAL TV LIMITED|publisher=OpenCorporates|date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a period of almost 2 years (2014-2016) REAL Digital saw a Russian-based company called General Satellite Group hold a majority of the voting shares in REAL Digital TV Limited. Recent (2016) Companies House filings record that General Satellite Group no longer hold any shares in the company. REAL Digital has moved its registered address to a business unit.

Dmitry Pasechnik is no longer the CEO of REAL Digital TV Limited he was placed on the board by his employer General Satellite Group while they held voting shares in the company.

The annual scholarship supported selected artists and creative individuals under the age of 30 with a £30,000 bursary and mentor support to help them develop to the next stage of their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ccskills.org.uk/careers/events-opps/details/sky-academy-award-arts-scholarships|title=Sky Academy Award Arts Scholarships - CreativeandCulturalSkils.org p.20 November 2014|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the Sky Academy programme from 2013 until its final year in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skyacademy.com/media/25495/sky_academy_brochure_sept_2015.pdf|title=Sky Academy|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Sky Academy Arts Scholarship originally started as the Sky Arts Ignition:Futures Fund in 2011,&lt;ref name=aest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aestheticamagazine.com/review-sky-academy-arts-scholarships-showcase-event/|title=''Review of Sky Academy Arts Scholarships Showcase Event'' - Aesthetica Beesley.R p.28 February 2015|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming part of the new Sky Academy in 2013. Applicants were required to complete an application detailing the project they would complete while they were on the scholarship, and with around a 1000 applicants a year this would be whittled down for a panel of art experts to make the final decision. The panel changed each year and former members have included Godfrey Worsdale (former Director of [[Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art|BALTIC Contemporary Art Gallery]]); Louise Jeffreys  (Director of Arts, [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]]); Radio presenter [[Jo Whiley]]; [[Nancy Durrant]] (Arts Commissioning Editor for The Times); [[Iwona Blazwick]] (Director of Whitechapel Gallery); [[Cam Blackwood]] (Music producer).&lt;ref name=cassart&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cassart.co.uk/blog/sky_arts_james_lomax.htm|title=''Sky Academy Arts Scholarship Winner: James Lomax'' - Cassart|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clydebankpost.co.uk/news/14582049.talented-knightswood-artist-beats-more-than-1000-people-to-win-30000-sky-arts-grant/|title=Talented Knightswood artist beats more than 1,000 people to win £30,000 Sky Arts Grant - Clydebank Post Rooney.S p.27 June 2016|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melvyn Bragg]], who was an ambassador at the Sky Academy stated "I genuinely believe that the Sky Arts Scholarships are a substantial and far-sighted contribution to the best arts practice in this country,
and already we see tremendous talents being encouraged and developed as a result of it"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sky Academy Skills Studios |url=https://www.skyacademy.com/media/25495/sky_academy_brochure_sept_2015.pdf |website=Sky Academy |accessdate=5 November 2018 |date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an interview with the Radio Times he said about the scholarship "People seem to think the arts just pop out of the ground. They don’t. Young people need support, and our scheme should be replicated all over the place. The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Opera House all get whacking great subsidies from us as taxpayers. Why don’t each of them sponsor five or ten scholarships a year?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-06-08/from-tom-hiddleston-to-amy-winehouse-the-stars-who-changed-the-arts-in-britain/|title=''From Tom Hiddleston to Amy Winehouse: the stars who changed the arts in Britain'' - Radio Times p.8 June 2016|accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The winners of the scholarships were announced at the [[South Bank Sky Arts Awards]] until 2016 when the scholarship was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skymedia.co.uk/news/south-bank-sky-arts-awards-2/|title=South Bank Sky Arts Awards - Sky Media|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/2016/feb/23/top-tips-early-career-artists-sky-academy-arts|title=Top tips for early career artists - The Guardian p.23 February 2016|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monroe doctrine.jpg|thumb|A 1912 newspaper cartoon highlighting the [[United States]]' influence in [[Latin America]] following the [[Monroe Doctrine]].]]

In the field of [[international relations]], a '''sphere of influence''' ('''SOI''') is a spatial region or concept division over which a state or organization has a level of cultural, economic, military, or political exclusivity, accommodating to the interests of powers outside the borders of the state that controls it.

While there may be a formal alliance or other treaty obligations between the influenced and influencer, such formal arrangements are not necessary and the influence can often be more of an example of [[soft power]]. Similarly, a formal alliance does not necessarily mean that one country lies within another's sphere of influence. High levels of exclusivity have historically been associated with higher levels of conflict.

In more extreme cases, a country within the "sphere of influence" of another may become a subsidiary of that state and serve in effect as a satellite state or de facto colony. The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations intervene in the affairs of others continues to the present. It is often analyzed in terms of [[superpower]]s, [[great power]]s, and/or [[middle power]]s.

Sometimes portions of a single country can fall into two distinct spheres of influence. In the colonial era the [[buffer state]]s of [[Iran]] and [[Thailand]], lying between the empires of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]/[[Russia]] and Britain/[[France]] respectively, were divided between the spheres of influence of the imperial [[power (international)|powers]]. Likewise, after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], [[Germany]] was divided into four [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]], which later consolidated into [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]], the former a member of NATO and the latter a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]].

The term is also used to describe non-political situations, e.g., a [[shopping mall]] is said to have a sphere of influence which designates the geographical area where it dominates the [[retail trade]].

==Historical remnants==
[[File:Map of colonial Africa in 1897.jpg|thumbnail|right|A map of colonial Africa in 1897 showing the European "sphere[s] of influence".]]
Many areas of the world are considered to have inherited culture from a previous sphere of influence, that while perhaps today halted, continues to share the same culture. Examples include the [[Anglosphere]], [[Arab World]], [[Eurosphere]], [[Francophonie]], [[Françafrique]], [[Germanic languages|Germanosphere]], [[Greater India|Indosphere]], [[Legacy of the Roman Empire|Latin Europe]]/[[Latin America]], [[Lusophone|Lusophonie]], [[Pan-Turkism|Turkosphere]],  [[Chinese cultural sphere]], [[Slavisphere]], [[Hispanophone]], [[Malay World]], as well as many others.

==New Imperialism era==
An example of spheres of influence was China in the late 19th and early 20th Century, when Britain, France, Germany, and Russia (later replaced by Japan) had de facto control over large swaths of territory.  These were taken by means of military attacks or threats to force Chinese authorities to sign [[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] and very long term "leases".&lt;ref&gt;[http://historyworldsome.blogspot.com/2013/12/spheres-of-influence-in-china.html Spheres of Influence in China ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Spheres of influence new.png|thumb|Approximate demarcation of spheres of influence, post-1905, when [[Russo-Japanese War|Japan seized portions of the Russian sphere]]]]
In December 1897 German [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] declared his intent to seize territory in China, precipitating the scramble to demarcate zones of influence in China. The German government acquired, in [[Shandong]] province, exclusive control over developmental loans, mining, and railway ownership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeans |first1=Roger B. |title=Democracy and Socialism in Republican China: The Politics of Zhang Junmai (Carsun Chang), 1906-1941 |date=1997 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0847687074 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Russia gained, in addition to the previous tax exemption for trade in [[Mongolia]] and [[Xinjiang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

Sharpe|isbn=9781563247248|pages=162|chapter=Chinese Diplomacy in Disarray: The Treaty of Livadia}}&lt;/ref&gt; economic powers similar to Germany's over [[Fengtian Province|Fengtian]], [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] provinces. France gained a sphere over [[Yunnan]], [[Guangxi]] and [[Guangdong]] provinces, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] over [[Fujian]] province, and the British Empire over the whole [[Yangtze River]] Valley and [[Treaty of Lhasa|Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties10.html Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet (1904)]&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s request for [[Zhejiang]] province was declined by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lo Jiu-Hwa |first1=Upshur |title=Encyclopedia of World History, Ackerman-Schroeder-Terry-Hwa Lo, 2008: Encyclopedia of World History Volume 7 of Encyclopedia of World History |date=2008 |publisher=Fact on File Publishing, Inc Bukupedia |pages=87-88}}&lt;/ref&gt; These do not include the lease and [[concession territory|concession territories]] where the foreign powers had full authority.

In 1902, [[Winston Churchill]] gave a speech regarding the division of China by the great powers, where he declared that "we shall have to take the Chinese in hand and regulate them", "I believe in the ultimate partition of China" and "the Aryan stock is bound to triumph".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-159/wsc-a-midnight-interview-1902 Speech and interview at the University of Michigan, 1902.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian government militarily occupied their zone, imposed their law and schools, seized mining and logging privileges, settled their citizens, and even established their municipal administration on several cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shan |first1=Patrick Fuliang |title=The Development of the North Manchuria Frontier, 1900-1931 |date=2003 |publisher=McMaster University |location=Hamilton, Ontario |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter without Chinese consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shan |first1=Patrick Fuliang |title=Taming China's Wilderness: Immigration, Settlement and the Shaping of the Heilongjiang Frontier, 1900-1931 |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1317046846 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The powers (and the United States) might have their own courts, post offices, commercial institutions, railroads, and gunboats in what was on paper Chinese territory. However, the foreign powers and their control in some cases could have been exaggerated; the local government persistently restricted further encroachment.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Fuliang Shan, “What was the ‘Sphere of Influence’? A Study of Chinese Resistance to the Russian Empire in  North Manchuria, 1900-1917,” ''The Chinese Historical Review'', (Fall 2006, vol. 13, no. 2), pp.271-291.&lt;/ref&gt; The system ended after the [[Second World War]].

[[File:Map Iran 1900-en.png|thumb|Delimitation of British and Russian influence in Iran]]
In the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]] of 1907, Britain and Russia partitioned Persia ([[Iran]]) into spheres of influence, with the Russians gaining recognition for influence over most of northern Iran, and Britain establishing a zone in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;British Documents on the Origins of the War 1898-1914, Volume IV, The Anglo-Russian Rapprochement 1903-7. Edited by G.P. Gooch and H Temperley. Her Majesty's Stationary Office, London 1929. p618-621. [https://archive.org/stream/britishdocuments04greabyu#page/626/mode/2up Appendix IV - Revised Draft of Agreement Concerning Persia, Sent to Sir A. Nicholson by Sir Edward Grey on June 6, 1907 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angrusen.asp Yale Law School: "Agreement concerning Persia" (in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Siam ([[Thailand]]), Britain and France signed an agreement in 1904 whereby the British recognised a French sphere of influence to the east of the River Menam's ([[Chao Phraya River]]) basin; in turn, the French recognised British influence over the territory to the west of the Menam basin and west of the Gulf of Thailand. Both parties disclaimed any idea of annexing Siamese territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | title=Declaration between the United Kingdom and France concerning Siam, Madagascar, and the New Hebrides | year=1904 | publisher=Governments of Great Britain and the French Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{see also|Foreign relations of the United States|Carter Doctrine|Monroe Doctrine}}
[[Alexander Hamilton]], first [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]], aimed for the United States to establish a sphere of influence in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1801-1829/monroe|title=Monroe Doctrine, 1823|last=|first=|date=April 6, 2016|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=March 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton, writing in the [[Federalist Papers]], harboured ambitions for the U.S. to rise to world power status and gain the strength to expel European powers from the Americas, taking on the mantle of regional dominance among American nations, although most of the New World were European colonies during that period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morison|first=S.E.|date=February 1924|title=The Origins of the Monroe Doctrine|jstor=2547870|journal=Economica|doi=10.2307/2547870|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This doctrine was formalised under President [[James Monroe]], who asserted that the New World was to be established as a Sphere of influence, removed from European encroachment. As the U.S. emerged as a world power, few nations dared to trespass on this sphere.&lt;ref name="Brit1"&gt;{{cite book |title= New Encyclopædia Britannica |edition= 15th |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica |volume= 8 |page= 269 |isbn= 1-59339-292-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] continued to refer to the Monroe doctrine to tout the United States as the region's preferred trade partner over other nations such as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gramer|first1=Robbie|title=Tillerson Praises Monroe Doctrine, Warns Latin America of 'Imperial' Chinese Ambitions|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/02/tillerson-praises-monroe-doctrine-warns-latin-america-off-imperial-chinese-ambitions-mexico-south-america-nafta-diplomacy-trump-trade-venezuela-maduro/|website=Foreign Policy|publisher=The Slate Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
For another example, during the height of its existence in World War II, the [[Japanese Empire]] had quite a large sphere of influence. The Japanese government directly governed events in [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Taiwan]], and parts of Mainland [[China]]. The "[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]" could thus be quite easily drawn on a map of the [[Pacific Ocean]] as a large "bubble" surrounding the islands of [[Japan]] and the [[Asia]]n and Pacific nations it controlled.

===Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact===
According to a secret protocol attached to the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]] of 1939 (revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945), [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] were divided into [[Nazi]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spheres of influence.&lt;ref name="mrtext"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html ''Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact''], executed August 23, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; In the North, [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], and [[Latvia]] were assigned to the Soviet sphere.&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; [[Poland]] was to be partitioned in the event of its "political rearrangement"&amp;mdash;the areas east of the [[Narev]], [[Vistula]], and [[San River]]s going to the Soviet Union while Germany would occupy the west.&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; [[Lithuania]], adjacent to [[East Prussia]], would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed in September 1939 assigned Lithuania to the USSR.&lt;ref name="christie"&gt;Christie, Kenneth, ''Historical Injustice and Democratic Transition in Eastern Asia and Northern Europe: Ghosts at the Table of Democracy'', RoutledgeCurzon, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7007-1599-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another clause of the treaty stipulated that [[Bessarabia]], then part of [[Romania]], would join the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovan ASSR]] and become the [[Moldovan SSR]] under the control of Moscow.&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; The Soviet invasion of [[Bukovina]] on 28 June 1940 violated the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence as agreed with the Axis.&lt;ref&gt;Brackman, Roman The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life (2001) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The USSR continued to deny the existence of the Pact's protocols until after the [[dissolution of the USSR]] when the Russian government fully acknowledged the existence and authenticity of the secret protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Etkind|first1=Alexander|last2=Finnin|first2=Rory|last3=Blacker|first3=Uilleam |author4=Julie Fedor |author5=Simon Lewis |author6=Maria Mälksoo |author7=Matilda Mroz|title=Remembering Katyn|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780745662961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of World War II===
From 1941 and the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Coalition]] operated on the unwritten assumption that the Western Powers and the Soviet Union had each its own sphere of influence. The presumption of the US-British and Soviet unrestricted rights in their respective spheres started causing difficulties as the Nazi-controlled territory shrank and the allied powers successively liberated other states. The wartime spheres lacked a practical definition and it had never been determined if a dominant allied power was entitled to unilateral decisions only in the area of military activity, or could also force its will regarding political, social and economic future of other states. This overly informal system backfired during the late stages of the war and afterwards, when it turned out that the Soviets and the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] had very different ideas concerning the administration and future development of the liberated regions and of Germany itself.&lt;ref name="Davies Victory 172-174"&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory]]'', pp. 172-174. [[Penguin Books]], New York 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-14-311409-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold War==
[[File:Soviet empire 1960.png|thumb|Greatest extent of Soviet influence, before the [[Sino-Soviet Split]]]]
During the [[Cold War]] the [[Baltic states]], [[Central Europe]], some countries in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[North Korea]], and, until the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the [[People's Republic of China]], among other countries at various times, were said to lie under the [[Soviet sphere of influence]]. [[Western Europe]], [[Oceania]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]], among other places, were often said to lie under the sphere of influence of the [[United States]]. However, the level of control exerted in these spheres varied and was not absolute. For instance, France and Great Britain were able to [[Suez Crisis|act independently to invade]] (with [[Israel]]) the [[Suez Canal]] (they were later forced to withdraw by joint U.S. and Soviet pressure). Later, France was also able to withdraw from the military arm of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO). Cuba often took positions that put it at odds with its Soviet ally, including momentary alliances with the People's Republic of China, economic reorganizations, and providing support for insurgencies in Africa and the Americas without prior approval from the Soviet Union. {{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

With the end of the Cold War, the Eastern Bloc fell apart, effectively ending the Soviet sphere of influence. Then in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, replaced by the [[Russian Federation]] and several other [[Post-Soviet states|ex-Soviet Republics]] who became independent states.

==1990s to present==
{{see also|Foreign relations of Russia}}
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia that became independent were often portrayed as part of the Russian Federation's "sphere of influence". According to Ulrich Speck, writing for ''Carnegie Europe'', "After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the West's focus was on Russia. Western nations implicitly treated the post-Soviet countries (besides the Baltic states) as Russia's sphere of influence."&lt;ref name=Carnegie141209&gt;{{cite news |url= http://carnegieeurope.eu/2014/12/09/eu-must-prepare-for-cold-peace-with-russia |title= The EU Must Prepare for a Cold Peace With Russia |first= Ulrich |last= Speck |work= Carnegie Europe |date= 9 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[NATO]] and Russia signed the ''Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security'', stating the "aim of creating in Europe a common space of security and stability, without dividing lines or spheres of influence limiting the sovereignty of any state."&lt;ref name=FoundingAct&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_25468.htm |title= Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation signed in Paris, France |publisher= NATO |date= 27 May 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Russia asserted that the [[European Union]] desires a sphere of influence and that the [[Eastern Partnership]] is "an attempt to extend" it.&lt;ref name=EUO090321/&gt; In March 2009, Sweden's foreign minister [[Carl Bildt]] stated that "The Eastern Partnership is not about spheres of influence. The difference is that these countries themselves opted to join".&lt;ref name=EUO090321&gt;{{cite news |url= https://euobserver.com/foreign/27827 |title=EU expanding its 'sphere of influence,' Russia says |first= Valentina |last= Pop |work= [[EUObserver]] |date= 21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]], [[Václav Havel]] and other former central and eastern European leaders signed an open letter stating that Russia had "violated the core principles of the [[Helsinki Final Act]], the [[Charter of Paris]]... -all in the name of defending a sphere of influence on its borders."&lt;ref name=GW090715/&gt; In April 2014, NATO stated that "Contrary to [the Founding Act], Russia now appears to be attempting to recreate a sphere of influence by seizing a part of Ukraine, maintaining large numbers of forces on its borders, and demanding, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently stated, that “Ukraine cannot be part of any bloc.”"&lt;ref name=NATO140512&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_109141.htm |title= Russia’s accusations - setting the record straight, Fact Sheet - April 2014 |publisher= NATO |date= 12 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticising Russia in November 2014, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said that "old thinking about spheres of influence, which runs roughshod over international law" put the "entire European peace order into question".&lt;ref name=EUO141117&gt;{{cite news |url= https://euobserver.com/foreign/126540 |title= Merkel: Russia cannot veto EU expansion |first= Andrew |last= Rettman |work= [[EUobserver]] |date= 17 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] said, "We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin's claim that it is now in his sphere of influence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/full-text-theresa-mays-speech-to-the-republican-congress-of-tomorrow-conference-2017-1  |title= FULL TEXT: Theresa May's speech to the Republican 'Congress of Tomorrow' conference |publisher= Business Insider |date= 26 January 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170127112956/http://www.businessinsider.com/full-text-theresa-mays-speech-to-the-republican-congress-of-tomorrow-conference-2017-1 |archivedate= 27 January 2017 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations==
In corporate terms, the sphere of influence of a [[business]], organization or group can show its power and influence in the decisions of other businesses/organizations/groups. Influence shows in several ways, such as in size, frequency of visits, etc. In most cases, a company described as "bigger" has a larger sphere of influence.

For example, the software company [[Microsoft]] has a [[Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish|large sphere of influence]] in the market of [[operating system]]s; any entity wishing to sell a software product may weigh up  compatibility with Microsoft's products as part of a marketing plan.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In another example, retailers wishing to make the most profits must ensure they open their stores in the correct location. This is also true for shopping centers that, to reap the most profits, must be able to attract customers to their vicinity.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

There is no defined scale measuring such spheres of influence. However, one can evaluate the spheres of influence of two shopping centers by seeing how far people are prepared to travel to each shopping center, how much time they spend in its vicinity, how often they visit, the order of goods available, etc.{{citation needed|date= November 2015}}

The '''total fertility rate'''  ('''TFR'''), sometimes also called the '''fertility rate''', '''absolute/potential natality''',  '''period total fertility rate''' ('''PTFR'''), or '''total period fertility rate''' ('''TPFR''') of a population is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if:
# She was to experience the exact current age-specific [[fertility]] rates (ASFRs) through her lifetime, and
# She was to survive from birth to the end of her reproductive life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?countryName=France&amp;countryCode=fr&amp;regionCode=eu#2127 Total fertility rate definition from CIA world factbook]. Cia.gov. Retrieved on 2012-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is obtained by summing the single-year age-specific rates at a given time.

The TFR is a synthetic rate, not based on the fertility of any real group of women since this would involve waiting until they had completed childbearing. Nor is it based on counting up the total number of children actually born over their lifetime. Instead, the TFR is based on the age-specific fertility rates of women in their "child-bearing years", which in conventional international statistical usage is ages 15–44 or 15–49.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naphsis.org/index.asp?bid=1205 National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS)], "Statistical Measures and Definitions" [retrieved 16 June 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

The TFR is, therefore, a measure of the fertility of an ''imaginary'' woman who passes through her reproductive life subject to ''all'' the age-specific fertility rates for ages 15–49 that were recorded for a given population in a given year. The TFR represents the average number of children a woman ''would'' potentially have, were she to fast-forward through all her childbearing years in a single year, under all the age-specific fertility rates for that year. In other words, this rate is the number of children a woman would have if she was subject to prevailing fertility rates at all ages from a single given year, and survives throughout all her childbearing years.

==Related parameters==

===Net reproduction rate===
An alternative fertility measure is the [[net reproduction rate]] (NRR), which measures the number of ''daughters'' a woman would have in her lifetime if she were subject to prevailing age-specific fertility ''and mortality'' rates in the given year. When the NRR is exactly '''one''', then each generation of women is exactly reproducing itself. The NRR is less widely used than the TFR, and the United Nations stopped reporting NRR data for member nations after 1998. But the NRR is particularly relevant where the number of male babies born is very high due to [[gender imbalance]] and [[sex selection]]. This is a significant factor in world population, due to the high level of gender imbalance in the very populous nations of [[China]] and [[India]]. The [[gross reproduction rate]] (GRR), is the same as the NRR, except that—like the TFR—it ignores [[life expectancy]].                                    

===Total period fertility rate===
The TFR (or TPFR—total period fertility rate) is a better index of fertility than the [[crude birth rate]] (annual number of births per thousand population) because it is independent of the age structure of the population, but it is a poorer estimate of actual completed family size than the [[total cohort fertility rate]], which is obtained by summing the age-specific fertility rates that actually applied to each cohort as they aged through time. In particular, the TFR does not necessarily predict how many children young women now will eventually have, as their fertility rates in years to come may change from those of older women now. However, the TFR is a reasonable summary of current fertility levels.                                                       

====Tempo effect====
{{further information|Sub-replacement fertility#Tempo effect}}
The TPFR (total ''period'' fertility rate) is affected by a [[Sub-replacement fertility#Tempo effect|tempo effect]]—if age of childbearing increases (and life cycle fertility is unchanged) then while the age of childbearing is increasing, TPFR will be lower (because the births are occurring later), and then the age of childbearing stops increasing, the TPFR will increase (due to the deferred births occurring in the later period) even though the life cycle fertility has been unchanged. In other words, the TPFR is a misleading measure of life cycle fertility when childbearing age is changing, due to this statistical artifact. This is a significant factor in some countries, such as the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Spain]] in the 1990s. Some measures seek to adjust for this timing effect to gain a better measure of life-cycle fertility.

===Replacement rates {{anchor|Replacement rate}}===
{{Further information|Sub-replacement fertility}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Replacement rate]] --&gt;

Replacement fertility is the total fertility rate at which women give birth to enough babies to sustain population levels.

If there were no mortality in the female population from birth to the end of the childbearing years, the replacement level of TFR would be very close to 2.0. The [[sub-replacement fertility|replacement fertility]] rate is indeed only slightly above 2.0 births per woman for most industrialized countries (2.075 in the UK, for example), but ranges from 2.5 to 3.3 in developing countries because of higher mortality rates, especially [[child mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The surprising global variation in replacement fertility|vauthors=Espenshade TJ, Guzman JC, Westoff CF |year=2003|journal=Population Research and Policy Review|doi=10.1023/B:POPU.0000020882.29684.8e|volume=22|page=575|issue=5/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global average for the replacement total fertility rate (leading to a stable global population) was 2.33 children per woman in 2003.&lt;ref name= variation&gt;{{cite journal|title=The surprising global variation in replacement fertility|vauthors=Espenshade TJ, Guzman JC, Westoff CF |year=2003|journal=Population Research and Policy Review | volume=22 |page=575 |doi=10.1023/B:POPU.0000020882.29684.8e |issue=5/6}}, Introduction and Table 1, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lowest-low fertility==
The term "lowest-low fertility" is defined as TFR at or below  1.3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/~hpkohler/papers/Low-fertility-in-Europe-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is characteristic of some Eastern European, Southern European and East Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.demogr.mpg.de/papers/working/wp-2009-029.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, more than half of the population of Europe lived in countries with lowest-low TFR, but TFRs have since slightly increased there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/9808322/c6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Population-lag effect==                                                               
A population that maintained a TFR of 3.8 over an extended period without a correspondingly high death or emigration rate would increase rapidly (doubling period ~ 32 years), whereas a population that maintained a TFR of 2.0 over a long time would decrease, unless it had a large enough immigration. However, it may take several generations for a change in the total fertility rate to be reflected in [[birth rate]], because the age distribution must reach equilibrium. For example, a population that has recently dropped below replacement-level fertility will continue to grow, because the recent high fertility produced large numbers of young couples who would now be in their childbearing years.

This phenomenon carries forward for several generations and is called [[population momentum]], ''population inertia'' or ''population-lag effect''. This time-lag effect is of great importance to the growth rates of human populations.

[[File:TFR vs population growth rate.png|upright=0.45|thumb|left|Symbol radius reflect population size in country]]
TFR (net) and long term population growth rate, g, are closely related. For a population structure in a steady state and with zero migration, g equals log(TFR/2)/Xm, where Xm is mean age for childbearing women and thus P(t) = P(0){{thinsp}}exp(gt). At the left side is shown the empirical relation between the two variables in a cross-section of countries with most recent y-y growth rate. The parameter 1/b should be an estimate of the Xm; here equal to 1/0.02 = 50 years, way off the mark because of population momentum. E.g. for log(TFR/2) = 0, g should be exactly zero, which is seen not to be the case.

==Developed or developing countries==

{{Further information|Income and fertility}}
[[Developed countries]] usually have a significantly lower fertility rate, often correlated with greater wealth, education, urbanization, or other factors. [[Mortality rate]]s are low, [[birth control]] is understood and easily accessible, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, contraception becomes affordable. In countries like [[Iran]] where contraception was subsidized before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined. Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life.  Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility, but not in all countries (for countries in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], increased female labor participation has been associated with increased fertility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Note on the Changing Relationship between Fertility and Female Employment Rates in Developed Countries|author1=Namkee Ahn |author2=Pedro Mira |journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=15|issue=4|year=2002|pages=667–682|jstor=20007839|doi=10.1007/s001480100078}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In [[undeveloped countries]] on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to [[contraceptives]], stricter adherence to traditional religious beliefs, generally lower levels of [[female education]], and lower rates of female employment in industry. The total fertility rate for the world has been declining very rapidly since the 1990s. Some forecasters like [[Sanjeev Sanyal]] argue that, adjusted for gender imbalances, the effective global fertility will fall below replacement rate in the 2020s. This will stabilize world population by 2050, which is much sooner than the UN Population Division expects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-end-of-population-growth|title=The End of Population Growth|first=Sanjeev|last=Sanyal|date=30 October 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the global TFR falls as much as it did from year 1995 to 2000, by 0.25 points, in 2015 to 2020, then that would result in global TFR being 2.11 by year 2020 ( it was 2.36 in 2010-2015 period). 2.11 is the exact global replacement rate of humanity. However if it falls as much as it did from 1975 to 1980, by 0.61 points( It was 4.45 TFR in 1975 and 3.84 TFR by 1980), then the global TFR would be a very low and dangerous 1.75 kids per woman, well below replacement level,by year 2020.

This situation of wealthy countries usually having a lower fertility rate than poor countries is part of the [[Income and fertility|fertility-income paradox]], as the very high fertility countries are very poor, and it may seem counter-intuitive for families there to have so many children. The inverse relationship between income and fertility has been termed a ''demographic-economic "[[paradox]]"'' by the notion that greater means would enable the production of more offspring, as first suggested by demographic scholar [[Thomas Malthus]] in 1798.

==Politics==
Governments have often set population targets, to either increase or decrease the total fertility rate; or to have certain ethnic or socioeconomic groups have a lower of higher fertility rate. Often such policies have been interventionist, and abusive. The most notorious [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century  include those in [[communist Romania]] and [[communist Albania]], under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and [[Enver Hoxha]] respectively. The policy of Romania  (1967-1990) was very aggressive, including outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people; and resulted in large numbers of children put into [[Romanian orphanages]] by parents who couldn't cope with raising them, [[street children]] in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended up on the streets), [[overcrowding]] in homes and schools, and over 9,000 women who died due to [[illegal abortion]]s.&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail. "Political Demography: The Banning of Abortion in Ceausescu's Romania". In Ginsburg, Faye D.; Rapp, Rayna, eds. ''Conceiving the New World Order: The Global Politics of Reproduction.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1995 :234-255. Unique Identifier : AIDSLINE KIE/49442.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in [[China]] the government sought to lower the fertility rate, and, as such, enacted the [[one child policy]] (1978-2015), which included abuses such as [[forced abortions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-18435126|title=Shock at Chinese abortion photo|author=|date=14 June 2012|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments have sought to regulate which groups of society could reproduce through [[eugenic]] policies of [[forced sterilizations]] of 'undesirable' population groups. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the first half of the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|author=|date=24 July 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this historical contexts, the notion of [[reproductive rights]] has developed. Such rights are based on the concept that each person freely decides if, when, and how many children to have - not the state or church. According to the [[OHCHR]] reproductive rights "rest on the recognition of the basic rights of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence, as expressed in human rights documents".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/NHRIHandbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of U.S. states by total fertility rate (TFR) in 2013.svg|thumb|upright=0.85|Map of U.S. states by total fertility rate (TFR) in 2013.]]
The total fertility rate in the US after [[World War II]] peaked at about 3.8 children per woman in the late 1950s and by 1999 was at 2 children. The fertility rate of the total US population was just below the replacement level of about 1.9 children per woman in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fertility of the population of the United States is below replacement among those native born, and above replacement among [[immigrant]] families, most of whom come to the U.S. from countries with higher fertility than that of the U.S. However, the fertility rates of immigrants to the U.S. have been found to decrease sharply in the second generation, correlating with improved education and income.&lt;ref&gt;"How Fertility Changes Across Immigrant Generations." ''Research Brief #58'', Public Policy Institute of California, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; As of the beginning of 2016, there are 59.8 births per 1,000 women aged 15–44; this is the lowest number since records have been kept since 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/vsrr/natality-dashboard.htm|title=Products - Vital Statistics Rapid Release - Natality Dashboard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World extreme lows==
The lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history is for Xiangyang district of [[Jiamusi]] city ([[Heilongjiang]], China) which had a TFR of 0.41.&lt;ref&gt;Terrell, Heather Kathleen Mary, "[http://txspace.tamu.edu/bitstream/1969.1/3892/1/etd-tamu-2005A-SOCI-Terrell.pdf Fertility in China in 2000: A County-Level Analysis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616050257/http://txspace.tamu.edu/bitstream/1969.1/3892/1/etd-tamu-2005A-SOCI-Terrell.pdf |date=2007-06-16 }}" (2005), Texas A&amp;M University.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside China, the lowest TFR ever recorded was 0.80 for Eastern Germany in 1994. The low Eastern German value was influenced by a change to higher age at birth, with the consequence that neither older cohorts (e.g. women born until the late 1960s), who often already had children, nor younger cohort, which often gave childbirth at a higher age (i.e. after 1994), had many children during that time. The total cohort fertility rate of each age [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] of woman in East German did not drop as significantly.

The average total fertility rate in the [[European Union]] (EU-28) is calculated at 1.58 children per woman in 2015.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde220&amp;plugin=0|title=Error|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Southern European countries have very low TFR (Portugal 1.31, Cyprus, 1.32, Greece 1.33, Spain 1.33, Italy 1.35).&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde220&amp;plugin=0|title=Error|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland also has a very low TFR (1.32).&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"/&gt; France has the highest TFR at 1.96, followed by Ireland (1.92), Sweden (1.85), the UK (1.80) and Denmark (1.71). The other non-EU Scandinavian countries also have high TFR (Iceland 1.80, Norway 1.72).&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt;

In the non-EU European post-Soviet states group in 2016, Russia has a TFR of 1.61,  Moldova 1.56, Ukraine 1.54, and Belarus 1.48.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; In former Yugoslavian states, Bosnia has a very low TFR, at only 1.28, the lowest of the whole of Europe.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

Emigration of young adults from Eastern Europe to the West aggravates the demographic problems of those countries. People from countries such as Moldova, Romania,  Hungary, and Bulgaria are particularly moving abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/central-and-eastern-europe-face-emigration-challenge|title=Central and Eastern Europe Face Emigration Challenge|author=|date=|website=Stratfor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TFR of Singapore, Macau, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea are the lowest in the world, with Singapore and Macau having a TFR below 1 in 2017.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; Japan too has a low TFR (1.45 in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00160/|title=Japan’s Annual Births Drop Below 1 Million|author=|date=10 April 2017|website=nippon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Singapore mitigates this through [[Immigration to Singapore|immigrant workers]], but in Japan there is a serious demographic problem.

In South Korea, too, a low birthrate is one of its most urgent socio-economic challenges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/world/asia/south-korea-fertility-birth-map.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Rising housing expenses, shrinking job opportunities for younger generations, insufficient support to families with newborns either from the government or employers are among the major explanations for its crawling TFR, from 1.08 in 2005 to 1.17 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/783928.html|title=2016 saw lowest number of births ever recorded in South Korea|author=|date=|website=hani.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans are yet to find viable solutions to make the birthrate rebound, even after trying out dozens of programs over a decade, including subsidizing rearing expenses, giving priorities for public rental housing to couples with multiple children, funding day care centers, reserving seats in public transportation for pregnant women, etc.

==Africa==
This region of the world has the highest TFR ([[Niger]], [[Burundi]], [[Mali]], [[Somalia]], and [[Uganda]] are highest).&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; The poverty of the region, and the high [[maternal mortality]] and [[infant mortality]] had led to calls from WHO of [[family planning]] and encouragement of  smaller families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/2/10-077925/en/|title=WHO - Family planning in sub-Saharan Africa: progress or stagnation?|author=|date=|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 840s, viking Norsemen were entering the Frankish territories as raiders and, gradually, became settlers. The conception of Normandy as a nationhood was not yet founded; there was no unified duchy. Rather there was northwest Neustria, or Annals of St Bertain, which was commonly referred to as March of Brittany, the region between Seine and Loire, and no man's land. There are territories where various vikings prevailed. 

==The Battle of Chartres==
In the late Ninth Century the Vikings began raiding what is now known as northern France. The raid was made possible by navigating ships down the River Seine to Paris and Chartres. As they sailed, the Vikings would stop along their route to rape, pillage, and raid towns and churches. One such town that suffered a disastrous fate was the village of Saint Clair-Sur-Epte; in 885 A. D. it was burned by the Vikings in 885 A.D. In 911, a group of Vikings led by the Norwegian [[Rollo]] launched a surprise attack on [[Paris]] before laying [[Siege of Chartres (911)|siege to Chartres]]. Appeals for help from the Bishop of Chartres, Joseaume, were answered by Robert, [[Marquis]] of Neustria, [[Richard, Duke of Burgundy]] and Manasses, Count of [[Dijon]]. On 20 July 911, at the Battle of Chartres, they defeated Rollo despite the absence of many French barons and of Charles the Simple.&lt;ref&gt;Francois Neveux. ''A Brief History of The Normans.'' Constable and Robinson Ltd. 2006; p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Frankish victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to negotiate with Rollo.{{clarify|date=February 2018}} 

==The Negotiation and Treaty Itself==
The talks, led by Hervé, the Archbishop of Reims, resulted in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte in 911. The treaty granted Rollo and his soldiers all the land between the river [[Epte]] and the sea "in freehold and good money".&lt;ref name=Bradbury&gt; Bradbury "Predatory Kinship and the Creation of Norman Power, 840-1066: Model and evidences" Chapter 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition, it granted him [[Brittany]] "for his livelihood."&lt;ref name=Bradbury&gt; Bradbury "Predatory Kinship and the Creation of Norman Power, 840-1066: Model and evidences" Chapter 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Brittany was an independent country which present day France had unsuccessfully tried to conquer. In exchange, Rollo guaranteed the king his loyalty, which involved military assistance for the protection of the kingdom against other Vikings. One of the conditions for the Vikings after their loss was to convert. As a token of his goodwill, Rollo also agreed to be [[baptism|baptized]] and to marry [[Gisela of France|Gisela]], a presumed legitimate daughter of Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Baker, ''The Normans'' New York: Macmillan, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With viking bands of settlers, composed of non-aristocratic lineages, there came multiple communities formed and a new political ethos that was not Frankish. The Vikings slowly became known as "Northmen," from which "Normandy" and "Normans" are derived.&lt;ref name=Normans15&gt;Crouch ''Normans'' pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; This identity formation was partly possible because Vikings were adapting indigenous culture, speaking French, renouncing [[paganism]] and converting to [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name=Bates12&gt;Bates ''Normandy Before 1066'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and intermarrying with the local population.&lt;ref name=Bates20&gt;Bates ''Normandy Before 1066'' pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; Though, conversion and assimilation was taking place, it is important to remember that the process for cultivating a Christian end-product society was slow. The culture was, at this time, a hybrid. But the ''traité en forme'' at Saint Clair-Sur-Epte marked the beginning of Normandy as a state.

==Bretons and Vikings==
The territory covered by the treaty corresponds to the northern part of today's [[Upper Normandy]] down to the [[Seine]], but the territory of the Vikings would eventually extend west beyond the Seine to form the [[Duchy of Normandy]], so named because of the [[Norsemen]] who ruled it. The treaty allowed these new settlements. But not all Vikings were welcome. And with the death of [[Alan I, King of Brittany]], another group of Vikings occupied Brittany faced their own dispute. Around 937, Alan I's son [[Alan II, Duke of Brittany|Alan II]] returned from England to expel those Vikings from Brittany in a war that was concluded in 939. During this period the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] was lost by Brittany and gained by Normandy.

==Forming Normandy== 
There would be a convergence between Franks and Normans with a few generations. But for now, the treaty involved a marriage between Gisla and Hrólfr (also known Rollo to the Franks). Marriages such as this played an important role in cultivating alliances and cohesion; wives were often called "peace weavers." And later, Charles the Simple created an alliance and a grant of rights to those Vikings seeking to settle in 918.

While Vikings did adapt, adopt, and assimilate to Christianity, they did not necessarily adopt indigenous administration: "The creation of Norman power between first settlement and the mid-eleventh century is not primarily of assimilation to Carolingian forms, as those appear in the capitualaries. &lt;ref name=Bradbury1&gt;Bradbury"Predatory Kinship and the Creation of Norman Power, 840-1066: Model and evidences" p.1 &lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the Vikings "adhered longer than the Franks around them--to older forms of social organization," that the Franks were abandoning. 

The Vikings came close to being absorbed into a lower social strata in Frankish society had not a wave of invading Vikings occurred in the 960s. Over time, the frontiers of the duchy, based in kinship, expanded to the west.&lt;ref name=Capet53&gt;Hallam and Everard ''Capetian France'' p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; "By the mid-eleventh century the descendants of the settlers formed the most disciplined, cooperative warrior society in Europe, capable of a communal effort--the conquest and subjugation of England--that was not, and could not have been, mounted by any other European political entity."&lt;ref name=Bradbury7&gt; Bradbury "Predatory Kinship and the Creation of Norman Power, 840-1066: Model and evidences" pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Succession Crisis==
There was not a successful duchy until around the time of Richard I control of Normandy. During his reign he bore daughters who would become peace weavers to forge valuable marriage alliances with powerful neighboring counts and the king of England.[19] His daughter, Emma, underwent two marriages. In 1002, King [[Æthelred the Unready|Æthelred II]] married [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], the sister of [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy]].&lt;ref name=Unready54&gt;Williams ''Æthelred the Unready'' p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; After Æthelred the Unready's death in 1016, Emma marriage her second husband who was an invader: Cnut the Great. Emma and Æthelred the Unready's children included Alfred Aetheling and Edward the Confessor. Emma also bore children with Cnut: Haracnut and a daughter, Gunnhild. This is not to mention Cnut's previous child in his previous marriage: Harold Harafoot. While the complicated woven connections that marriage brought could bring peace, the alliances, and stability, once the alliance of Cnut and Emma ended, there was a battle over the throne. Emma's children with Æthelred the Unready give a major connection between Normandy and England that would add validity to William the Conqueror's claim to the throne of England later on. 

On 12th November 1035, King Cnut, died at Shaftsbury in Dorset. He was around 40 years old and was buried at the Winchester Abbey. With his death, a succession Crisis was created, and his huge Northern European Empire, which contained England, Denmark, Norway, and Scania, fell apart because of strife over which heir would control certain regions. For instance, Harold Harefoot tried to seize the throne of England; he is able to rule the "North of the river of Thames" until 1035 when he "failed to prevail over the archbishop."&lt;ref name=Blackwell516&gt;Michael Lapidge "The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England" p.516&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, South of the River Thames, Haracnut reigned, "but was deserted by his supporters in 1037."&lt;ref name=Blackwell516&gt;Michael Lapidge "The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England" p.516&lt;/ref&gt; In 1037, Harold Harefoot ascended the throne "as king everywhere" &lt;ref name=Blackwell516&gt;Michael Lapidge "The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England" p.516&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Unknown&gt;Unknown "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"&lt;/ref&gt; But with his death came the accession of Haracnut. Essentially, all of Cnut's children, whether illegitimate or not, there was interest in the throne of England; that is, the male heirs.

How this relates to Normandy is with Edward the Confessor's claim to the throne. He was an illegitimate child of Cnut because he came from Emma's first marriage. The result of not being a direct son of Cnut, meant Edward and his brother spent most of their lives in Normandy as an exile to England. This dynamic led to the establishment of a powerful Norman interest in English politics. Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Edward was childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]], and his sons, and he may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.&lt;ref name=Unification86&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' pp. 86–99&lt;/ref&gt;" And so, he laid claim to the English throne while Haracnut was King. Eventually, William would not only stake a claim to the English crown, but take advantage of the fragmented state of England due to the Great Succession Crisis and its aftermath.

==Norman Conquest==
Before William left for England, he had to gained support and unify Normandy as a consolidated state. But to maintain this unity in Normandy meant William needed to make sure that his neighbors, such as France, were not a threat. William was able to leave for his invasion with the aid of churches and ducal administration, as well as the timely death of France’s King; all of these circumstances and dynamics secured William’s power.
William was able to accomplished the defeat of England by invading and landing his ships in Dives.&lt;ref name=Hastings164&gt;Bradbury ''The Battle of Hastings'' p.164&lt;/ref&gt; There, William was met with Harold II on the battle field, and the Battle of Hastings ensued in the fall of 1066. Bradbury asserts the Battle of Hastings events unfolded at either Caldbec Hill, Battle Hill, or the Abbey in three phases: The first phase consisted of confrontation, with the Normans striking the Anglo-Saxons first; the second phase is a counter-attack by the English; while the last phrase consisted with a Norman breakthrough.&lt;ref name=Hastings&gt;Bradbury ''The Battle of Hastings'' p.1-278;Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Without the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, there never would have been a Normandy and their duchy formation. In fact, the assimilation of Vikings and their adoption of the French language and customs would have likely occurred in another time, or another manner; if not at all. Nevertheless, these events did happen, and the treaty eventually led to future power struggles between Normandy and England, such as the Norman Conquest. William II, duke of Normandy, became William the I, King of England, when he invaded England at the time of Harold II's reign in 1066. And the Norman Conquest would cause native Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and the like to adopt French into their language which would eventually develop into Middle English.

The '''World Water Forum''' is an event focusing on perceived issues surrounding water. It is hosted by the [[World Water Council]] and takes place every three years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldwaterforum8.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aim==
World Water Forum aims to:

:* Raise awareness with decision makers and the public at large on water issues and, subsequently, to generate action;
:* Contribute to improving access to water supply and sanitation and report on progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals;&lt;ref&gt;The [https://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf United Nations Millennium Declaration] (18 September 2000) outlined 8 goals (MDGs) to meet the needs of the world’s poorest. They range from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education, all by the target date of 2015.  Goal 7, Target 2 specifically refers to reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water, but water provision is also key to making progress on many of the other Goals&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Provide opportunities to progressively develop shared visions on challenging water issues, to develop new partnerships and to pave the way for cooperation and action among a wide diversity of organisations and individuals;
:* Encourage greater media attention for water issues and solutions

==Components==
The forum is made up of four primary components:

# The thematic programme which provides the substantive discussions in the form of sessions and panels.
# The political process which provides the opportunity for discussion with elected officials (local authorities, parliamentarians, ministers) and resulting in various statements and commitments.
# The regional process which provides perspectives on water from all regions of the world.
# The fair and expo which provides a space for all stakeholders to showcase their contributions.

Each of these components benefits from extensive preparatory processes that commence two years prior to the World Water Forum.

Past editions have included other features, such as side events, a learning centre, a children’s forum, a youth forum, a children’s education village, water and film encounters and cultural entertainment.

==History==

===1st World Water Forum: Morocco===

In addition, the debate was furthered within the context of the new commitments of meeting the goals set forth at the United Nations in New York (2000), the in Bonn (2001) and the in Johannesburg (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millennium/summit.htm Millennium Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water-2001.de/ International Freshwater Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/jsummit/html/basic_info/basicinfo.html World Summit on Sustainable Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd World Water Forum offered 351 sessions under 38 themes.&lt;ref&gt;This document offers a concise view of the outcomes of the 3rd Forum as well as a reflection on future perspectives.

New concepts were introduced such as a Virtual Water Forum,&lt;ref&gt;The virtual water forum final report is a compilation of all the online sessions held during the 21 months prior to the 3rd World Water Forum. In addition to its descriptive content of discussions, the report contains detailed statistical data such as number of participants and postings. [http://www.world.water-forum3.com/2003/eng/vwf/VWF.PDF On-line version available here]&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of about 166 interactive sessions available through Internet, and the Water Voices Project,&lt;ref&gt;The “Water Voice” project report can be found [http://www.world.water-forum3.com/en/report_pdf/wv_report.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; where 27,000 opinions of ordinary citizens were collected from 142 countries.

The 3rd World Water Forum also invited the participation of indigenous people, recognizing that indigenous land and water rights is crucial to the discussion of water interests worldwide. Indigenous people have often been excluded from discussions about clean drinking water, water sanitation, and rights to water sources, so this invitation legitimized the rights of indigenous people to help create water related policy. Their participation resulted in the signing of the Indigenous Peoples Kyoto Declaration, which centered on the rights of indigenous people to self determine usage of their own water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/798498968|title=Native peoples of the world : an encyclopedia of groups, cultures, and contemporary issues|last=Laurence.|first=Danver, Steven|date=2013-01-01|publisher=M.E.

===5th World Water Forum: Turkey===

Over 30,000 participants from 182 countries took part in the 5th World Water Forum, from 16 to 22 March 2009 in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. More than 400 organisations prepared together over 100 sessions organised according to 6 themes, 7 regional reports and 5 high-level panels.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/fileadmin/WWF5/Final_Report/WWF5_Final_Report.pdf 5th World Water Forum Final Report] includes detailed information about sessions and activities organised during the 5th World Water Forum&lt;/ref&gt;
