In [[programming languages]], '''ad hoc polymorphism'''&lt;ref&gt;C. Strachey, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jajones/INF102-S18/readings/05_stratchey_1967.pdf Fundamental concepts in programming languages]. Lecture notes for International Summer School in Computer Programming, Copenhagen, August 1967&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied. It is also known as [[function overloading]] or [[operator overloading]]. The term [[ad hoc]] in this context is not intended to be pejorative; it refers simply to the fact that this type of polymorphism is not a fundamental feature of the [[type system]]. This is in contrast to [[parametric polymorphism]], in which polymorphic functions are written without mention of any specific type, and can thus apply a single abstract implementation to any number of types in a transparent way. This classification was introduced by [[Christopher Strachey]] in 1967.

==Early binding==
Ad hoc polymorphism is a [[dynamic dispatch|dispatch]] mechanism: control moving through one named function is dispatched to various other functions without having to specify the exact function being called. Overloading allows multiple functions taking different types to be defined with the same name; the [[compiler]] or [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] automatically ensures that the right function is called. This way, functions appending lists of integers, lists of strings, lists of real numbers, and so on could be written, and all be called ''append''&amp;mdash;and the right ''append'' function would be called based on the type of lists being appended. This differs from parametric polymorphism, in which the function would need to be written ''generically'', to work with any kind of list. Using overloading, it is possible to have a function perform two completely different things based on the type of input passed to it; this is not possible with parametric polymorphism. Another way to look at overloading is that a routine is uniquely identified not by its name, but by the combination of its name and the number, order and types of its parameters.

This type of polymorphism is common in [[object-oriented programming]] languages, many of which allow [[operator (programming)|operator]]s to be overloaded in a manner similar to functions (see [[operator overloading]]). Some languages that are not dynamically typed and lack ad hoc  polymorphism (including type classes) have longer function names such as &lt;code&gt;print_int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;print_string&lt;/code&gt;, etc. This can be seen as advantage (more descriptive) or a disadvantage (overly verbose) depending on one's point of view.

An advantage that is sometimes gained from overloading is the appearance of specialization, e.g., a function with the same name can be implemented in multiple different ways, each optimized for the particular data types that it operates on. This can provide a convenient interface for code that needs to be specialized to multiple situations for performance reasons. The downside is that the type system cannot guarantee the consistency of the different implementations.

Since overloading is done at compile time, it is not a substitute for [[late binding]] as found in [[subtyping polymorphism]].

==Late binding==
The previous section notwithstanding, there are other ways in which ''ad hoc'' polymorphism can work out. Consider for example the Smalltalk language. In [[Smalltalk]], the overloading is done at run time, as the methods ("function implementation") for each overloaded message ("overloaded function") are resolved when they are about to be executed. This happens at run time, after the program is compiled. Therefore, polymorphism is given by [[subtyping polymorphism]] as in other languages, and it is also extended in functionality by ''ad hoc'' polymorphism at run time.

A closer look will also reveal that Smalltalk provides a slightly different variety of ''ad hoc'' polymorphism. Since Smalltalk has a late bound execution model, and since it provides objects the ability to handle messages that are not understood, it is possible to go ahead and implement functionality using polymorphism without explicitly overloading a particular message. This may not be generally recommended practice for everyday programming, but it can be quite useful when implementing proxies.

Also, while in general terms common class method and constructor overloading is not considered polymorphism, there are more uniform languages in which classes are regular objects. In Smalltalk, for instance, classes are regular objects. In turn, this means messages sent to classes can be overloaded, and it is also possible to create objects that behave like classes without their classes inheriting from the hierarchy of classes. These are effective techniques which can be used to take advantage of Smalltalk's powerful reflection capabilities. Similar arrangements are also possible in languages such as [[Self (programming language)|Self]] and Newspeak.

==Example==
Imagine an operator &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; that may be used in the following ways:
# &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 = 3&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;3.14 + 0.0015 = 3.1415&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;1 + 3.7 = 4.7&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;[true, false] + [false, true] = [true, false, false, true]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;"bab" + "oon" = "baboon"&lt;/code&gt;

===Overloading===
To handle these six function calls, four different pieces of code are needed&amp;mdash;or ''three'', if strings are considered to be lists of characters:
* In the first case, [[integer (computer science)|integer]] addition must be invoked.
* In the second and third cases, [[floating point|floating-point]] addition must be invoked (with [[type promotion]], or [[type coercion]], in the third case).
* In the fourth and fifth cases, [[List (computing)|list]] [[concatenation]] must be invoked.
* In the last case, [[literal string|string]] concatenation must be invoked.
Thus, the name &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; actually refers to three or four completely different functions. This is an example of ''overloading''.
(Note that string types used in the last case do not, by themselves, lend themselves to the programmer ''naturally'' assuming concatenation, rather than addition, is meant; consider "123" + "456", which might reasonably be expected to yield "579". Overloading can therefore provide different meaning, or semantics, for an operation, as well as differing implementations.)

'''Ahaṃkāra''' (अहंकार) is a [[Sanskrit]] term that is related to the ego and [[egotism|egoism]] - that is, the identification or attachment of one's ego. The term "ahamkara" comes from an approximately 3,000-year-old [[Vedic philosophy]], where Ahaṃ is the Self or "I" and kāra is "any created thing" or "to do". The term originated in [[Vedic philosophy]] over 3,000 years ago, and was later incorporated into [[Hindu philosophy]], particularly [[Saṃkhyā]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9985/ahankara "Ahamkara"], Britannica Academic Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahamkara is one of the four parts of the [[antahkarana]] (inner organ) described in [[Hindu philosophy]]. The other three parts are [[Buddhi]], [[Citta]] and [[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]]. In the [[Uttara Mimamsa]] or [[vedanta]] branch of [[Hindu philosophy]], even though it is not discussed in great detail in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]] says to Arjun that ahamkara must be removed - in other words, it should be subordinated to the lord. The reason for this is that the Self is not (cannot be) present when one is in a state of ahamkara.

In Bhagavad Gita Lord Krishna says “ Air, water, earth, fire, sky, mind, intelligence and ahankaar (ego) together constitute the nature created by me.”

== Philosophical implications ==
To have an understanding of this term is to have a powerful tool for understanding the nature and behaviour of ourselves and of others. Vedic philosophy teaches that when one's mind is in a state of ahamkara, one is in a state of subjective illusion, where the mind has bound the concept of one's self with an external thing. That thing can be a tangible, material object, or it can be a concept (such as the concept of the fight for peace). The ego is involved in constructing the illusion.

'''Examples of ahaṃkāra in action:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Consider how an otherwise sensible young man might feel that his new sports car was a reflection of his true self and this would encourage him to race his car recklessly against another person's car.
* Similarly, consider how someone who believed in the fight for peace, and who ordinarily might behave in a non-violent manner, might come to blows with someone who threatened or challenged his notions of peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In both cases, the mind has created a state of illusion, but it seems very real to the person in that state, and subjectivity and reality are obscured. This deeply illusory state is what can often cause people to do the strangest, oddest things, sometimes evil, and often quite out of character. All humans can - and usually do at some time in their lives - suffer from this.

== Ahaṃkāra and spiritual development ==
{{unsourced-section|date=June 2017}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Ahaṃkāra is the instrument of [[Aham (Kashmir Shaivism)|Ahaṃ (the Spirit)]], the principle of individuation, acting as an independent conscious entity within the impure reality - yet, it does not have consciousness of its own. 
* Ahamkara is (actually soul/ego-soul) the instrument of the spirit (made by thought-material='dark energy' &amp; emotion-material='dark material') for individual development of the ego-soul, like DEHA (material-body/mold) is the instrument for individual development of the ego-soul/mind.
* It is a receptacle of Cit śakti, its consciousness being a small spark from Cit, the universal consciousness.
* manifests itself by assuming authorship of all the actions of buddhi, manas, the senses and organs of action.
* It is believed to exist in the sphere of duality, in a state of identification with the physical body, its needs and desires.
* It is related to ''Vak tattva'', one of [[The 36 tattvas]] in Vedic and Hindu religious philosophy.
* In ahaṃkāra, a state of ''rajas guna'' (agitation) predominates. This is because it identifies only with a small part of the creation (the body) and rejects everything else as "not me"; it becomes subject to a series of afflictions such as: pride, egoism, competitiveness, hate and jealousy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though ahaṃkāra is generally a state of illusion, once in that state, ''Vak tattva'' (one of the 36 tattvas) can appear. When it does, then, for the first time, individual will, determination, a sense of morality and ethics come into play - which is the first step on the path to spiritual development/enlightenment. Without a sufficiently harmonious and powerful ahaṃkāra (personality), it is thought to be impossible to exert the level of effort necessary to accede to a higher spiritual level.

The position of ahaṃkāra and buddhi are sometimes presented in reversed order because, as the principle of "I-ness", ahaṃkāra is allowed control over the manas (sensorial mind) and buddhi (superior intellect, intuition). Yet, buddhi is a superior tattva, and ahaṃkāra is thus only able to be in a superior position to buddhi from a functional point of view. From an absolute point of view, ahaṃkāra is created by buddhi and thus subordinate to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10291">'''Anchor modeling''' is an agile database modeling technique suited for information that changes over time both in structure and content. It provides a graphical notation used for conceptual modeling similar to that of [[Entity–relationship model|entity-relationship modeling]], with extensions for working with temporal data. The modeling technique involves four modeling constructs: the anchor, attribute, tie and knot, each capturing different aspects of the domain being modeled.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The resulting models can be translated to physical database designs using formalized rules. When such a translation is done the tables in the relational database will mostly be in the [[sixth normal form]]. 

==Philosophy and history==
Anchor modeling was created in order to take advantage of the benefits from a high degree of [[Database normalization|normalization]] while avoiding its drawbacks. Advantages such as being able to non-destructively evolve the model, avoid null values, and keep the information free from redundancies are gained. Performance issues due to extra joins are largely avoided thanks to a feature in modern database engines called '[[table elimination]]'. In order to handle changes in the information content anchor modeling emulates aspects of a [[temporal database]] in the resulting [[relational database]] schema.

The earliest installations using anchor modeling were made in [[Sweden]] with the first dating back to 2004, when a [[data warehouse]] for an insurance company was built using the technique. In 2007 the technique was being used in a few data warehouses and one [[OLTP]] system, and it was presented internationally by Lars Rönnbäck at the 2007 Transforming Data with Intelligence] (TDWI) conference in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;6th TDWI European Conference - [https://www.tdwi.eu/en/events/conferences/tdwi-2007-europe.html?tx_fhconference_pi1_conference_view%5Bshow%5D=online_program&amp;tx_fhconference_pi1_conference_view%5Bsession%5D=39 TDWI homepage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720172604/https://www.tdwi.eu/en/events/conferences/tdwi-2007-europe.html?tx_fhconference_pi1_conference_view%5Bshow%5D=online_program&amp;tx_fhconference_pi1_conference_view%5Bsession%5D=39 |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This stirred enough interest for the technique to warrant a more formal description. Since then research concerning anchor modeling is being done in a collaboration between the creators Olle Regardt and Lars Rönnbäck and a team at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, [[Stockholm University]]. The first paper, in which anchor modeling is formalized, was presented at the 28th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling and won the best paper award.&lt;ref&gt;

==Basic notions==
Anchor modeling has four basic modeling concepts: anchors, attributes, ties, and knots. Anchors are used to model entities and events, attributes are used to model properties of anchors, ties model the relationships between anchors, and knots are used to model shared properties, such as states. Attributes and ties can be historized when changes in the information they model need to be kept.

An example model showing the different graphical symbols for all the concepts can be seen below. The symbols resemble those used in [[entity–relationship model]]ing, with a couple of extensions. A double outline on an attribute or tie indicates that a history of changes is kept and the knot symbol (an outlined square with rounded edges) is also available.
[[File:Anchor Modeling Example.svg|Anchor Modeling Example]]

==Temporal aspects==
Anchor modeling handles two types of informational evolution, structural changes and content changes. Changes to the structure of information is represented through extensions. The high degree of [[Database normalization|normalization]] makes it possible to non-destructively add the necessary modeling concepts needed to capture a change, in such a way that every previous [[Database schema|schema]] always remains as a subset of the current schema. Since the existing schema is not touched, this gives the benefit of being able to evolve the database in a highly iterative manner and without causing any downtime. 

Changes in the content of information is done by emulating similar features of a [[temporal database]] in a [[relational database]]. In anchor modeling, pieces of information can be tied to points in time or to intervals of time (both open and closed). The time points when events occur are modeled using attributes, e g the birth dates of persons or the time of a purchase. The intervals of time in which a value is valid are captured through the historization of attributes and ties, e g the changes of hair color of a person or the period of time during which a person was married. In a relational database this is achieved by adding a single [[Column (database)|column]], with a [[data type]] granular enough to capture the speed of the changes, to the [[Table (database)|table]] corresponding to the historized attribute or tie. This adds a slight complexity as more than one [[Row (database)|row]] in the table have to be examined in order to know if an interval is closed or not.

Points or intervals of time not directly related to the domain being modeled, such as the points of time information entered the database, are handled through the use of [[metadata]] in anchor modeling, rather than any of the above mentioned constructs. If information about such changes to the database needs to be kept bitemporal anchor modeling can be used, where in addition to updates, also delete statements become non-destructive. 

==Relational representation==
In anchor modeling there is a one-to-one mapping between the symbols used in the conceptual model and tables in the relational database. Every anchor, attribute, tie, and knot have a corresponding table in the database with an unambiguously defined structure. A conceptual model can thereby be translated to a relational database schema using simple automated rules, and vice versa. This is different from many other modeling techniques in which there are complex and sometimes subjective translation steps between the conceptual, logical, and physical levels.

Anchor tables contain a single column in which identities are stored. An identity is assumed to be the only property of an entity that is always present and immutable. As identities are rarely available from the domain being modeled, they are instead technically generated, e g from an incrementing number sequence. 

An example of an anchor for the identities of the nephews of [[Donald Duck]] is a set of 1-tuples: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{⟨#42⟩, ⟨#43⟩, ⟨#44⟩}&lt;/code&gt;

Knots can be thought of as the combination of an anchor and a single attribute. Knot tables contain two columns, one for an identity and one for a value. Due to storing identities and values together, knots cannot be historized. Their usefulness comes from being able to reduce storage requirements and improve performance, since tables referencing knots can store a short value rather than a long string. 

An example of a knot for genders is a set of 2-tuples: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{⟨#1, 'Male'⟩, ⟨#2, 'Female'⟩}&lt;/code&gt;

Static attribute tables contain two columns, one for the identity of the entity to which the value belongs and one for the actual property value. Historized attribute tables have an extra column for storing the starting point of a time interval. In a knotted attribute table, the value column is an identity that references a knot table.

An example of a static attribute for their names is a set of 2-tuples: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{⟨#42, 'Huey'⟩, ⟨#43, 'Dewey'⟩, ⟨#44, 'Louie'⟩}&lt;/code&gt;

An example of a knotted static attribute for their genders is a set of 2-tuples: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{⟨#42, #1⟩, ⟨#43, #1⟩, ⟨#44, #1⟩}&lt;/code&gt;

An example of a historized attribute for the (changing) colors of their outfits is a set of 3-tuples: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{⟨#44, 'Orange', 1938-04-15⟩, ⟨#44, 'Green', 1939-04-28⟩, ⟨#44, 'Blue', 1940-12-13⟩}&lt;/code&gt;

Static tie tables relate two or more anchors to each other, and contain two or more columns for storing the identities. Historized tie tables have an extra column for storing the starting point of a time interval. Knotted tie tables have an additional column for each referenced knot.

An example of a static tie for the sibling relationship is a set of 2-tuples: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;{⟨#42, #43⟩, ⟨#42, #44⟩, ⟨#43, #42⟩, ⟨#43, #44⟩, ⟨#44, #42⟩, ⟨#44, #43⟩}&lt;/code&gt;

The resulting tables will all be in [[sixth normal form]] except for ties in which not all columns are part of the primary key.

An '''antihero''' or '''antiheroine''' is a [[protagonist]] in a story who lacks conventional [[Hero|heroic qualities]] and attributes such as [[Ideal (ethics)|idealism]], courage and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Antihero |title=antihero |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary |date=9 January 2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/anti-hero |title=anti-hero |publisher=Macmillan Dictionary |date= |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antiheroine?show=0&amp;t=1350251069 |title=Antiheroine |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anti-hero |title=anti-hero |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |date= |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merriam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antihero |title=Antihero |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although antiheroes may sometimes perform actions that are morally correct, it is not always for the right reasons, often acting primarily out of self-interest or in ways that defy conventional [[ethical code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laham|first1=Nicholas|title=Currents of Comedy on the American Screen: How Film and Television Deliver Different Laughs for Changing Times |date=2009|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786442645|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kerouac_by_Palumbo.jpg|thumb|right|225px|U.S. writer [[Jack Kerouac]] and other figures of the "[[Beat Generation]]" created reflective, critical protagonists who influenced the antiheroes of many later works.]]

An early antihero is [[Homer]]'s [[Thersites]].&lt;ref name="tolstoy1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiner|first1=George|title=Tolstoy Or Dostoevsky: An Essay in the Old Criticism|date=2013|publisher=Open Road|location=New York|isbn=9781480411913}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|197–198}} The concept has also been identified in classical [[Greek drama]],&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27600/antihero |title=antihero |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman satire, and Renaissance literature&lt;ref name="tolstoy1"/&gt;{{rp|197–198}} such as ''[[Don Quixote]]''&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wheeler|first1=L.

The term antihero was first used as early as 1714,&lt;ref name="merriam"/&gt; emerging in works such as ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]'' in the 18th century,&lt;ref name="tolstoy1"/&gt;{{rp|199–200}} and is also used more broadly to cover [[Byronic hero]]es as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wheeler|first1=L.

A '''badge of shame''', also a '''symbol of shame''', '''mark of shame''' or '''stigma''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stigma stigma]. [[Dictionary.com]]. The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Company. (accessed: January 13, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; is typically a distinctive symbol required to be worn by a specific group or an individual for the purpose of [[public humiliation]], [[ostracism]] or [[persecution]].

The term is also used metaphorically, especially in a pejorative sense, to characterize something associated with a person or group as shameful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hinshaw, S.|title=Mark of Shame: Stigma of Mental Illness and an Agenda for Change| chapter =|chapterurl= |publisher=Oxford University Press, Incorporated |location=Oxford|year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-19-530844-0 |oclc= |doi=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, under the [[Poor Act 1697]], paupers in receipt of parish relief were required to wear a [[badge]] of blue or red cloth on the shoulder of the right sleeve in an open and visible manner, in order to discourage people from collecting relief unless they were desperate, as while many would be willing to collect relief, few would be willing to do so if required to wear the "shameful" mark of the poor in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/324/1/WRAP_Hindle_Dependency_Shame_Belonging_Final_Version.pdf|title=Dependency, Shame and Belonging: Badging the Deserving Poor, c. 1550–1750*.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Rome]], both men and women originally wore the [[toga]], but over time matrons adopted the [[stola]] as the preferred form of dress, while prostitutes retained the toga.

At the beginning of the 13th century, [[Pope Innocent III]] prohibited Christians from causing Jews bodily harm, but supported their segregation in society. On at least one occasion he likened this to the fate of [[Cain]] described in the [[Book of Genesis]], writing to the [[Count of Nevers]]:

Striped [[prison uniform]]s were commonly used in the 19th century, as a way to instantly mark an escaping convict. Modern orange prison uniforms serve the same purpose, only with a highly visible bright color to make it difficult to hide. Stripes were adopted as simple one-color uniforms could easily be dyed to another color; dying a striped uniform cannot hide the stripes. They were temporarily abolished in the United States early in the 20th century because their use as a badge of shame was considered undesirable as they were causing constant embarrassment and exasperation to the [[prisoner]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7619-4753-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pratt, John Clark |title=Punishment and civilization: penal tolerance and intolerance in modern society |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, Calif |year=2002 |page= 76 |isbn=0-7619-4753-1 |oclc= |doi= | quote = The distinctive prison stripes were abolished in 1904. ...stripes had come to be looked upon as a badge of shame and were a constant humiliation and irritant to many prisoners' (Report of the New York (State) Prison Department, 1904: 22)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They came back to usage as the public viewpoint changed. In many of today's [[jail]]s and [[prison]]s in the United States the inmates are forced to wear striped prison uniforms. A prominent example is [[Maricopa County Jail]] under the administration of [[Joe Arpaio]], where black and white stripes are used. Another predominantly used color scheme consists of orange and white stripes. A person wearing this kind of clothing is distinctly marked and can unmistakably be identified as a prison inmate from a far distance, which allows citizens to instantly identify escapees and notify the authorities.

===Skin===
Societies have marked people directly in the practice generally known as being "branded a criminal". Criminals and slaves have been marked{{when|date=February 2012}} with [[tattoos]].&lt;ref name="tattoos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/surgery/body_mind/everyone/tattoos/ |author = Sayer, Melissa |date= 2007-06-17 |title= Tattoos : AKA: Getting inked |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work=The Surgery|publisher=BBC|quote=For thousands of years, people have been getting tattoos....

The practice of human branding with visible marks on the face had been firmly established by King [[Edward VI of England]] under the 1547 ''Statute of Vagabonds'', which specified the burning of the letter "S" on the cheek or forehead of an escaped slave, and the letter "F" for "fraymaker" on the cheek of a church brawler.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4254-9141-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrews, William L. |title=Bygone Punishments |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |location= |year=2006 |page= 138|isbn=1-4254-9141-3 |quote=In the reign of Edward VI. was passed the famous Statute of Vagabonds, authorising the branding with hot iron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Nayler]], an [[England|English]] [[Quaker]] convicted of blasphemy in 1656, was famously branded with a "B" on his forehead.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4254-9141-3"/&gt;
The practice of human branding was abolished in England by 1829.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4254-9141-3"/&gt; It continued in the United States until at least 1864, during the [[American Civil War]], where some [[Desertion|deserters]] from the [[Union Army]] had their face branded with the letter "D" as a mark of shame intended to discourage others.&lt;ref name="title"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfmh.org/whps/images/03-04.2001.pdf |title=William Chester Minor, M.D.: The Brilliance of a Tortured Mind |date=March 2001 |first=Syed, MD |last=Abdullah |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work=The Synapse |publisher=West Hudson Psychiatric Society branch of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] |quote=The branding was sometimes done over the cheek so that the would-be deserter carried a visible mark of shame on his face forever. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225063824/http://www.rfmh.org/whps/images/03-04.2001.pdf |archivedate=2004-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Runaway slaves could be branded with an "R" for "runaway", which had the effect of ensuring he or she was watched closely and often prejudiced against by any subsequent owners and overseers.

===Barefoot===
[[File:Cornelis De Wael - To Visit the Imprisoned - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|230px|Depiction of barefooted and partly fettered prisoners by [[Cornelis de Wael]]; ''To Visit the Imprisoned'' c. 1640]]
[[File:Prisoner in courtroom, Wales 19th century.JPG|thumb|230px|Barefooted prisoner in iron restraints; [[Wales]] 19th century (museum exhibit)]]
[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Slave Market - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|230px|Barefooted or naked oriental slaves (''Jean-Léon Gérôme - The Slave Market'')]]
In former times [[prisoner]]s were routinely divested of large parts of their clothing and hereby left with usually covered body parts exposed. This was primarily done to visually earmark the captive individuals so onlookers could distinguish their status upon first sight. It also had a symbolistic connotation in those divesting prisoners of their clothes meant divesting them of their rights and social status.&lt;br&gt;
Notably taking away the [[footwear]] of an unfree person and thereby forcing him or her to remain in [[barefoot|bare feet]] has been used for visibly marking captives, prisoners and [[slaves]] in almost every culture. This customary practice is still commonplace in prisons of many countries.

As [[shoes]] in their various appearances have been worn throughout all [[social class]]es since earliest human history, forcibly presenting a person to the public in bare feet is a common method to showcase a person's loss of status or absence of rights.  As bare feet are a highly noticeable visual attribute in almost every social situation, this particular form of appearance often incidentally raises suspicion or disdain among bystanders.

It also serves to dishearten prisoners and frustrate attempts of escape. The ability to walk or run quickly is hereby often drastically reduced.
As the feet are the only body part with near permanent contact to the environment, their lack of protection can have a victimizing effect and make the person feel physically defeated, helpless or vulnerable which adds to the shaming effect.

Wearing shoes is a low-level and natural manifestation of civil rights and liberties, which cannot be revoked from free citizens of any culture under normal circumstances. Even when suffering neediness in ancient history, simple forms of footwear were handmade from available materials, while today simple shoes are sufficiently inexpensive to be purchased in practically every part of the world.&lt;br&gt;
Forcing a subdued person to go barefoot is therefore used to showcase his or her deprivation of the most basic rights and natural liberties. It hereby displays the subjugation of the person under individuals with sufficient authority to impose and enforce certain living conditions. By abiding it also establishes that the person does not have the self-determination, means or power to resist.&lt;br&gt;
Forcing individuals to remain barefoot against their will is, therefore, a common method to display and exercise authority and showcase the flagrant disproportion of power usually found in situations of imprisonment. Exploiting the effects it is often used to intimidate captives or prisoners and cut their self-confidence.

===Restraints===
Presenting a prisoner to the public in restraints (such as [[handcuffs]], [[legcuffs|shackles]], [[chain]]s or similar devices) has always served as a method of shaming the person as well. In addition to their practical use of preventing movement and escape, they are usually uncomfortable to wear and often lock the body in unnatural positions. Especially restraining the hands of a captive behind his or her back is perceived as particularly shameful, as it renders the person practically defenceless and showcases his or her physical defeat to onlookers. The effect is often multiplied by combining means of marking people such as the use of [[prison uniform]]s or similar clothing like penitential garbs and the exposure of bare feet.

The 1916 [[silent film]] ''[[The Yellow Passport]]'', starring [[Clara Kimball Young]], was also known as ''The Badge of Shame'' when it was reissued in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007599/ |title=The Yellow Passport (1916) |accessdate=2007-11-06 |work=The Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/clarakimballyoung.html |title= Clara Kimball Young – Silent Film Star |accessdate=2007-11-06 |publisher=goldensilents.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013093243/http://goldensilents.com/stars/clarakimballyoung.html| archivedate= 13 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006 film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Lord [[Cutler Beckett]] ([[Tom Hollander]]) is seen using as a [[fireplace poker]], a [[Human branding|branding iron]] with the letter "P" that he used to impart the "pirate's brand" seen on the right forearm of Captain [[Jack Sparrow]] ([[Johnny Depp]]).&lt;ref name="Partial film transcription"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simnia.com/film/potc2/potc2_script.htm |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006): Partial film transcription |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111184232/http://www.simnia.com/film/potc2/potc2_script.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the backstory, Sparrow was branded a pirate by Beckett for refusing to transport slaves for the [[East India Trading Company]].&lt;ref name="wench"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Pearl 101 |publisher=[[Walt Disney Pictures]] |url=http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/liveaction/pirates2/games/gameshell.html?bp101 |accessdate=2007-05-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527182150/http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/liveaction/pirates2/games/gameshell.html?bp101 |archivedate=2007-05-27 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital art''' is an artistic work or practice that uses [[digital technology]] as an essential part of the creative or presentation process. Since the 1970s, various names have been used to describe the process, including [[computer art]] and [[multimedia art]]. Digital art is itself placed under the larger umbrella term [[new media art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] (2006). ''Digital Art'', pp. 7–8. Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lieser, Wolf. ''Digital Art''. Langenscheidt: h.f. ullmann. 2009, pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahn (Eds.), Mainframe experimentalism: Early digital computing in the experimental arts. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of digital technology has transformed activities such as [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[sculpture]] and music/[[sound art]],  while new forms, such as [[net art]], digital [[installation art]], and [[virtual reality]], have become recognized artistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Kuspit]] [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit8-5-05.asp ''The Matrix of Sensations'']  ''VI: Digital Artists and the New Creative Renaissance''&lt;/ref&gt; More generally the term digital artist is used to describe an artist who makes use of [[digital technology|digital technologies]] in the production of art. In an expanded sense, "digital art" is [[contemporary art]] that uses the methods of [[mass production]] or digital media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Gere]] ''Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body'' (Berg, 2005). {{ISBN|978-1-84520-135-7}} This text concerns artistic and theoretical responses to the increasing speed of technological development and operation, especially in terms of so-called ‘real-time’ digital technologies. It draws on the ideas of [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and looks at the work of [[Samuel Morse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Malevich]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of digital art are used extensively by the mainstream [[mass media|media]] in advertisements, and by film-makers to produce [[visual effects]]. [[Desktop publishing]] has had a huge impact on the publishing world, although that is more related to [[graphic design]]. Both digital and traditional artists use many sources of electronic information and programs to create their work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Popper]], ''Art of the Electronic Age'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the parallels between visual and musical arts, it is possible that general acceptance of the value of digital visual art will progress in much the same way as the increased acceptance of electronically produced music over the last three decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Gere]], (2002) Digital Culture, Reaktion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital art can be purely computer-generated (such as [[fractal]]s and [[algorithmic art]]) or taken from other sources, such as a [[image scanner|scanned]] [[photograph]] or an image drawn using [[vector graphics]] software using a [[computer mouse|mouse]] or [[graphics tablet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] (2006). ''Digital Art'', pp. 27–67. Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; Though technically the term may be applied to art done using other media or processes and merely scanned in, it is usually reserved for art that has been non-[[Trivial (mathematics)|trivia]]lly modified by a computing process (such as a [[computer program]], [[microcontroller]] or any electronic system capable of interpreting an input to create an output); digitized text data and raw [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and [[video]] recordings are not usually considered digital art in themselves, but can be part of the larger project of [[computer art]] and [[information art]].&lt;ref&gt;Wands, Bruce (2006). ''Art of the Digital Age'', pp. 10–11. Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; Artworks are considered [[digital painting]] when created in similar fashion to non-digital [[painting]]s but using [[software]] on a computer platform and digitally outputting the resulting image as painted on [[canvas]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane (2006). ''Digital Art'', pp. 54–60. Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andy Warhol]] created digital art using a [[Commodore Amiga]] where the computer was publicly introduced at the [[Lincoln Center]], New York in July 1985. An image of [[Debbie Harry]] was captured in monochrome from a video camera and digitized into a graphics program called ProPaint. Warhol manipulated the image adding colour by using flood fills.&lt;ref&gt;'{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2007/10/amiga-history-4-commodore-years.ars/4 |title=A history of the Amiga, part 4: Enter Commodore |date=October 21, 2007 |last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |work=Arstechnica.com |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital data|Digital]] [[visual art]] consists of either [[Two-dimensional space|2D]] visual information displayed on an [[electronic visual display]] or information [[mathematics|mathematically]] translated into [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] information, viewed through [[perspective projection]] on an electronic visual display. The simplest is [[2D computer graphics]] which reflect how you might draw using a pencil and a piece of paper. In this case, however, the image is on the computer screen and the instrument you draw with might be a tablet stylus or a mouse. What is generated on your screen might appear to be drawn with a pencil, pen or paintbrush. The second kind is [[3D&amp;nbsp;computer graphics]], where the screen becomes a window into a [[virtual environment]], where you arrange objects to be "photographed" by the computer. Typically a 2D computer graphics use [[raster graphics]] as their primary means of source data representations, whereas 3D computer graphics use [[vector graphics]] in the creation of [[immersive virtual reality]] installations. A possible third paradigm is to generate art in 2D or 3D entirely through the execution of algorithms coded into computer programs and could be considered the native art form of the computer. That is, it cannot be produced without the computer. [[Fractal art]], [[Datamoshing]], [[algorithmic art]] and real-time [[generative art]] are examples.

==Computer generated 3D still imagery==
{{Main article|3D computer graphics}}
3D graphics are created via the process of designing [[image]]ry from [[geometry|geometric]] shapes, [[polygon]]s or [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]] curves&lt;ref&gt;Wands, Bruce (2006).

Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; to create three-dimensional objects and scenes for use in various media such as film, [[television]], print, [[rapid prototyping]], games/simulations and special visual effects.

There are many [[software]] programs for doing this. The technology can enable [[collaboration]], lending itself to sharing and augmenting by a creative effort similar to the [[open source]] movement, and the [[creative commons]] in which users can collaborate in a project to create [[art]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Computer-generated animations are [[animations]] created with a [[computer]], from digital models created by the 3D artists or [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]]. The term is usually applied to works created entirely with a computer. Movies make heavy use of computer-generated graphics; they are called [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the film industry. In the 1990s, and early 2000s CGI advanced enough so that for the first time it was possible to create realistic 3D computer [[animation]], although films had been using extensive computer images since the mid-70s. A number of modern films have been noted for their heavy use of photo realistic CGI.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Manovich]] (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital installation art==
{{See also|interactive art}}
Digital installation art constitutes a broad field of activity and incorporates many forms. Some resemble video installations, particularly large scale works involving [[video projection|projections]] and [[video capture|live video capture]]. By using projection techniques that enhance an audiences impression of sensory envelopment, many digital installations attempt to create immersive environments. Others go even further and attempt to facilitate a complete immersion in [[virtual reality|virtual realms]]. This type of installation is generally [[Site-specific art|site-specific]], [[scalable]], and without fixed [[dimensionality]], meaning it can be reconfigured to accommodate different presentation spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane (2006). ''Digital Art'', pp 71. Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Screen" (2003) is an example of digital installation art which makes use of a  [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment]] to create an interactive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noahwf.com/screen/index.html|title=screen - noah wardrip-fruin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kalighat Painting Calcutta 19th Century - Woman Strinking Man With Broom.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kalighat painting]]; "Woman Striking Man With Broom" (1875)]]
'''Domestic violence against men''' deals with [[domestic violence]] experienced by [[Man|men]] or [[boy]]s in a domestic setting, such as in [[marriage]] or [[cohabitation]]. As with [[Violence against women|domestic violence against women]], violence against men may constitute a [[crime]], but laws vary between jurisdictions.

Men who report domestic violence can face [[social stigma]] regarding their perceived lack of [[machismo]] and other denigrations of their [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lupri |first1=Eugene |last2=Grandin |first2=Elaine |title=Intimate partner abuse against men |year=2004 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/familyviolence/pdfs/Intimate_Partner.pdf|publisher=National Clearinghouse on Family Violence |accessdate=2014-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104074211/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/familyviolence/pdfs/Intimate_Partner.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="Marginalizing"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Marginalizing the Battered Male |journal=[[The Journal of Men's Studies]] |last=Migliaccio |first=Todd A. |volume=9 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.3149/jms.0902.205}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV) against men is generally less recognized by society than IPV against women, which can act as a further block to men reporting their situation.&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Framework"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das Dasgupta |first1=Shamita |authorlink=Shamita Das Dasgupta |title=A Framework for Understanding Women's Use of Nonlethal Violence in Intimate Heterosexual Relationships |date=November 2002 |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1364–1389 |doi=10.1177/107780102237408}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative prevalence of IPV against men to that of women is highly disputed between different studies, with some countries having no data at all. Some researchers believe the actual number of male victims may be greater than law enforcement statistics suggest due to the number of men who do not report their abuse.&lt;ref name="Crime Council"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.crimecouncil.gov.ie/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |title=Domestic Abuse of Women and Men in Ireland: Report on the National Study of Domestic Abuse |last1=Watson |first1=Dorothy |last2=Parsons |first2=Sara |publisher=National Crime Council of Ireland |location=Dublin |date=2005 |page=169 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for both men and women, domestic violence is among the most underreported crimes worldwide.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Strong |first1=Bryan |last2=DeVault |first2=Christine |last3=Cohen |first3=Theodore |title=The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationships in a Changing Society |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=February 16, 2010 |page=447 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA447 |isbn=978-1133597469 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110213408/https://books.google.com/books?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA447 |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Diana |title=Kidnapping: An Investigator’s Guide |publisher=Newnes |date=July 11, 2013 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KdueQed_sgC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0123740311 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110194423/https://books.google.com/books?id=-KdueQed_sgC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPV against men is a controversial area of research, with terms such as ''gender symmetry'', ''battered husband syndrome'' and ''bidirectional IPV'' provoking a great deal of debate. The lines of the debate tend to fall between two basic [[polemic]]s. The first of these argues that scholars who focus on female-perpetrated IPV are part of an [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] backlash, and are attempting to undermine the problem of male-perpetrated abuse by championing the cause of the man, over the much more serious cause of the abused woman.&lt;ref name="Kersti"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yllö |first=Kersti |chapter=Political and Methodological Debates in Wife Abuse Research |title=Feminist Perspectives on Wife Abuse |year=1988 |editor1-last=Yllö |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Bogard |editor2-first=Michele |pages=40–47 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA. |isbn=9780803930537}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worcester"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Worcester |first=Nancy |title=Women's Use of Force: Complexities and Challenges of Taking the Issue Seriously |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |date=November 2000 |pages=1390–1415 |doi=10.1177/107780102762478055}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second polemic argues that IPV against men is a significant problem and underreported, and that it puts women in even greater risk of victimization by abusive men, which domestic violence researchers and [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have ignored in order to protect the fundamental gains of the battered women's movement, specifically, the view that intimate partner abuse is an extension of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal dominance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The gender paradigm in domestic violence research and theory: Part 1 — The conflict of theory and data |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |date=September 2005 |volume=10 |issue=6 |last1=Dutton |first1=Donald G. |last2=Nicholls |first2=Tonia L. |pages=680–714 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thirty years"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=332–362 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YBVGswoPYqMC&amp;pg=PA79 |title=Current Controversies on Family Violence |last=Loseke |first=Donileen R. |last2=Gelles |first2=Richard J. |last3=Cavanaugh |first3=Mary M. |date=2005 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=9780761921066 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the tools used to generate statistics concerning IPV perpetration, the [[conflict tactics scale]], is especially contentious.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Researchers have demonstrated a degree of socio-cultural acceptance of aggression by women against men as opposed to a general condemnation of aggression by men against women.

However, analyses of research indicates that frequently the legal system fails to view women who use IPV against controlling male partners as victims due to gendered high expectations on women to be the "perfect victim" and the culturally pervasive stereotype of the passive, "cowering" battered woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Goodmark |first=Leigh |year=2008 |title=When Is a Battered Woman Not a Battered Woman?

Statistics indicate that under-reporting is an inherent problem with IPV irrespective of gender. For example, in England and Wales, the 1995 "[[Home Office]] Research Study 191", carried out as a supplementary study to the British Crime Survey, reported 6.6 million incidents of IPV in the previous twelve months, compared with the 987,000 incidents found by the Crime Survey.

===Estimates of male victimization===
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the 1995 "Home Office Research Study 191" surveyed 10,844 people (5,886 women and 4,958 men) between the ages of 16 and 59, finding that for the twelve-month period preceding the survey, 4.2% of men had experienced IPV. Over a lifetime, this figure increased to 14.9% of men. Of the 6.6 million incidents of IPV in 1995, 3.25 million involved male victims, with 1 million incidents resulting in injury.&lt;ref name="Survey 191"/&gt; Since 2004, more detailed annual records have been maintained as a supplementary survey attached to the annual Home Office ''Crime in England and Wales'' reports. These reports have consistently recorded significantly higher rates of both male and female victims of IPV than the standard crime surveys. In the case of male victims, the figures range from a high of 4.5% in 2007/2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb0209.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110220105210/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb0209.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-02-20 |title=Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence, 2010/2011: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales, 2007/2008 |editor-last=Povey |editor-first=David |chapter=Intimate violence: 2007/08 BCS |last=Roe |first=Stephen |page=66 |date=2009 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a low of 3.1% in 2009/2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116512/hosb0111.pdf |title=Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence, 2009/2010: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales, 2009/2010 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Kevin |chapter=Intimate violence: 2009/10 BCS |last=Hall |first=Philip |page=82 |date=2011 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a 2005 report carried out by the National Crime Council found that 15% of women and 6% of men had suffered severe IPV in their lifetime, equating to roughly 213,000 women and 88,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.crimecouncil.gov.ie/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |title=Domestic Abuse of Women and Men in Ireland: Report on the National Study of Domestic Abuse |last1=Watson |first1=Dorothy |last2=Parsons |first2=Sara |publisher=National Crime Council of Ireland |location=Dublin |date=2005 |page=24 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northern Ireland]], police records for 2012 listed 2,525 male victims of domestic violence, an increase of 259 cases from 2011.&lt;ref name="McNeilly"&gt;{{cite news |title=Domestic violence against men at its highest level in Northern Ireland since police began recording statistics |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/domestic-violence-against-men-at-its-highest-level-in-northern-ireland-since-police-began-recording-statistics-29707051.html |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-30 |work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |first=Claire |last=McNeilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender symmetry==
[[File:Femme battant mari Durer XVII e siecle.jpg|thumb|right|"Femme battant son mari"; [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
The theory that women perpetrate IPV at roughly similar rates as men has been termed "gender symmetry". The earliest empirical evidence of gender symmetry was presented in the 1975 U.S. National Family Violence Survey carried out by Murray A. Straus and [[Richard Gelles|Richard J. Gelles]] on a nationally representative sample of 2,146 "intact families".

Since 1975, numerous other empirical studies have found evidence of gender symmetry in IPV. For example, in the United States, the National Comorbidity Study of 1990-1992 found 18.4% of men and 17.4% of women had experienced minor IPV, and 5.5% of men and 6.5% of women had experienced severe IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kessler |first1=Ronald C. |author1link=Ronald C.

An especially controversial aspect of the gender symmetry debate is the notion of bidirectional or reciprocal IPV (i.e. when both parties commit violent acts against one another). Findings regarding bidirectional violence are particularly controversial because, if accepted, they can serve to undermine one of the most commonly cited reasons for female perpetrated IPV; self-defense against a controlling male partner. Despite this, many studies have found evidence of high levels of bidirectionality in cases where women have reported IPV. For example, social activist [[Erin Pizzey]], who established the first [[women's shelter]] in the U.K. in 1971, found that 62 of the first 100 women admitted to the centre were "violence-prone," and just as violent as the men they were leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=From the Personal to the Political |last=Pizzey |first=Erin |authorlink=Erin Pizzey |title=Women or Men: Who Are the Victims? |editor1-last=Pizzey |editor1-first=Erin |editor2-last=Shackleton |editor2-first=J.R. |editor3-last=Urwin |editor3-first=Peter |publisher=Civitas |location=London |date=2000 |page=27 |url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/cs09.pdf |accessdate=2014-06-28 |isbn=978-1-903386-09-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 National Family Violence Survey found that 27.7% of IPV cases were perpetrated by men alone, 22.7% by women alone and 49.5% were bidirectional.

Whitaker,  Tadesse Haileyesus, Monica Swahn,  and Linda S. Saltzman, of 11,370 heterosexual U.S. adults aged 18 to 28 found that 24% of all relationships had some violence. Of those relationships, 49.7% of them had reciprocal violence. In relationships without reciprocal violence, women committed 70% of all violence. However, men were more likely to inflict injury than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitaker |first1=Daniel |title=Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence |journal=Am J Public Health |date=May 2007 |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=941–947 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020 |pmc=1854883 |pmid=17395835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Philip W. Cook]] conducted a study of 55,000 members of the [[United States Armed Forces]], finding bidirectionality in 60-64% of IPV cases, as reported by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Abused Men: The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence |last=Cook |first=Phillip W. |authorlink=Philip W.

When data provided by women only was analyzed, 51.3% of cases were reported as reciprocal and 49.7% as non-reciprocal. The overall data showed 70.7% of non-reciprocal IPV cases were perpetrated by women only (74.9% when reported by men; 67.7% when reported by women) and 29.3% were perpetrated by men only (25.1% when reported by men; 32.3% when reported by women).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitaker |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Haileyesus |first2=Tadesse |last3=Swahn |first3=Monica |last4=Saltzman |first4=Linda S. |date=May 2007 |title=Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=941–7 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020 |pmc=1854883 |pmid=17395835}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 thirty-two nation International Dating Violence Study "revealed an overwhelming body of evidence that bidirectional violence is the predominant pattern of perpetration; and this ... indicates that the [[etiology]] of IPV is mostly parallel for men and women".

For severe assault, a rate of 10.8% was found, of which 54.8% was bidirectional, 15.7% perpetrated by men only, and 29.4% by women only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Straus |first=Murray A. |date=March 2008 |title=Dominance and symmetry in partner violence by male and female university students in 32 nations |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID41-PR41-Dominance-symmetry-In-Press-07.pdf |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=260–261 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, John Archer conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of eighty-two IPV studies. He found that "women were slightly more likely than men to use one or more acts of physical aggression and to use such acts more frequently. Men were more likely to inflict an injury, and overall, 62% of those injured by a partner were women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Archer |first=John |title=Sex differences in aggression between heterosexual partners: a meta-analytic review |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=651–680 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651 |pmid=10989615 |date=September 2000 |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://www.batteredmen.com/ArcherSexDifferencesMeta-AnalyticReviewf2000.pdf Pdf.]

As both Fiebert and Archer point out, although the numerical tally of physical acts in these studies has found similar rates of IPV amongst men and women, and high rates of bidirectionality, there is general agreement amongst researchers that male violence is a more serious phenomenon, primarily, but not exclusively, because male violence tends to inflict more psychological and physical damage than female violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vivian |first1=Dina |last2=Langhinrichsen-Rohling |first2=Jennifer |title=Are bi-directionality violent couples mutually victimized?

From 2010 to 2012, scholars of domestic violence from the U.S., Canada and the U.K. assembled The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge, a research database covering 1700 peer-reviewed studies, the largest of its kind. Among its findings:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerpub.com/media/springer-journals/FindingsAt-a-Glance.pdf Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project Findings At-a-Glance], Sponsored by the Journal Partner Abuse, John Hamel, LCSW, Editor-in-Chief, www.springerpub.com/pa, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* More women (23%) than men (19.3%) have been assaulted at least once in their lifetime.
* Rates of female-perpetrated violence are higher than male-perpetrated (28.3% vs. 21.6%).
* Male and female IPV are perpetrated from similar motives.
* Studies comparing men and women in the power/control motive have mixed results overall.

A 2013 review examined studies from five [[continents]] and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict tactics scale===

In a 2002 review of the research presenting evidence of gender symmetry, [[Michael Kimmel]] noted that more than 90% of "systematic, persistent, and injurious" violence is perpetrated by men. He was especially critical of the fact that the majority of the empirical studies reviewed by Fiebert and Archer used the [[conflict tactics scale]] (CTS) as the sole measure of domestic violence, and that many of the studies used samples composed entirely of single people under the age of thirty, as opposed to older married couples.&lt;ref name="Kimmel"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kimmel |first=Michael S. |author-link=Michael Kimmel |title='Gender symmetry' in domestic violence: a substantive and methodological research review |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1332–1363 |publisher=[[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/107780102237407 |date=November 2002 |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016110040/http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf |date=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CTS is the most widely used domestic violence measurement instrument in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |last2=Douglas |first2=Emily M. |author-link1=Murray A.

Kimmel argues that the CTS is particularly vulnerable to reporting bias because it depends on asking people to accurately remember and honestly report incidents which have occurred up to a year previously. Even Straus admitted that the data indicates men tend to underestimate their use of violence, and women tend to overestimate their use of violence. "He attempts to control for this by examining only reports from women. Yet this does not correct the bias, because women also tend to underestimate men’s use of violence. Furthermore, men and women alike tend to overestimate women’s use of violence. Violence by men is expected, so it is not reported; violence by women is not expected, so it is notable and reported."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Thus men will overestimate their victimization and underestimate their perpetration, while women will underestimate their victimization and overestimate their perpetration.&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Barbara J. Morse and Malcolm J. George have presented data suggesting that male underestimation of their partner's violence is more common in CTS based studies than overestimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morse |first=Barbara J. |title=Beyond the Conflict Tactics Scale: assessing gender differences in partner violence |journal=[[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence and Victims]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |date=December 1995 |pages=251–272 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/vav/1995/00000010/00000004/art00001 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |accessdate=2014-06-21 |pmid=8703839}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=George |first=Malcolm J. |title=Invisible touch |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=8 |year=2003 |pages=34, 36 |doi=10.1016/S1359-1789(01)00048-9}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda L. Kelly|Linda Kelly]] has noted that even when dividing the data provided by CTS based studies into that given by men and that given by women (such as in the 2001 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health), the rate of female perpetrated IPV remains at roughly the same level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disabusing the definition of domestic abuse: how women batter men and the role of the feminist state |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/flsulr30&amp;div=43 |last=Kelly |first=Linda |authorlink=Linda L.

Indeed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to expectations, agreement between partners did not vary with the perpetrator’s gender or with the type of abusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moffitt |first1=Terrie |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom |title=Findings About Partner Violence From the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study |journal=Research in Brief |date=July 1999 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

R. Emerson Dobash and Russell P. Dobash have also criticized the CTS, arguing that it is improper to equate male IPV with female IPV. They question the methodology behind the CTS, the data which stems from it and the theoretical framework used by investigators who champion it, arguing that male aggression is much more severe than female aggression and the two should not be measured by the same tool on the same scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R.

Another critic, Kersti Yllö, who holds Straus and those who use the CTS accountable for damaging the gains of the battered women's movement, by releasing their findings into the "marketplace of ideas". She argues that, as sociologists committed to ending domestic violence, they should have foreseen the controversy such statistics would cause and the damage it could potentially do to battered women.&lt;ref name="Kersti"/&gt; Similarly, Nancy Worcester refers to studies which find evidence of gender symmetry and high levels of bidirectionality as part of the "[[Antifeminism|anti-feminist backlash]]", arguing that studies which use the CTS demonstrate the "limitations and dangers of a gender-neutral approach to anti-violence work".&lt;ref name="Worcester"/&gt;

Straus argues that it is more harmful to women to attempt to tackle the problem of domestic abuse without proper strategy based on facts: "The research shows that this so-called harmless violence by women because a meta-analysis by Stith and colleagues (2004) found that a woman's perpetration of violence was the strongest predictor of her being a victim of partner violence."&lt;ref name="Symmetry"/&gt;

Straus responded to criticism of the CTS by arguing that it is driven by [[Radical feminism|radical-feminists]] who are uncomfortable with any evidence that women can be as violent as men because it undermines their belief that IPV is an extension of men's desire to subjugate women; "one of the explanations for denying the evidence on gender symmetry is to defend feminism in general. This is because a key step in the effort to achieve an equalitarian society is to bring about recognition of the harm that a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal system]] causes. The removal of patriarchy as the main cause of IPV weakens a dramatic example of the harmful effects of patriarchy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty years of denying the evidence on gender symmetry in partner violence: implications for prevention and treatment |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=349 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}} [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718174010/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |date=July 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Straus also points out that despite being critical of the CTS, numerous feminist researchers use it for their own research, and that it was CTS based studies which first illustrated and brought to the public's attention the extent of the battered women problem in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Symmetry"/&gt;

==Battered husband syndrome==
The most controversial aspect of female perpetrated IPV is the theory of "battered husband syndrome". In reaction to the findings of the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975,&lt;ref name="National"/&gt; Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to "battered wife syndrome".&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt; Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% of husbands had thrown objects, 31% of wives had done likewise; 31% of husbands had pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% of husbands had hit their wives, 20% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 10% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Suzanne K. |date=1977 |title=Cycle of Violence: Assertive, Aggressive and Abusive Family Interactions |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |isbn=9780275914769}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both husbands and wives had thrown objects; 17% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% of husbands had hit their wives, 13% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 12% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt;{{rp|501–503}} In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% of husbands had thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% of husbands had hit their wives, 12% of wives had hit their husbands; 12% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 14% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Suzanne K. |title=The Use of Force for Resolving Family Conflict: The Training Ground for Abuse |journal=The Family Coordinator |volume=26 |issue=1 |date=January 1977 |pages=19–26 |doi=10.2307/581856 |jstor=581856}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings led Steinmetz to conclude that IPV was roughly reciprocal between husbands and wives, with a similar level of intentionality between men and women; "women are as likely to select physical conflict to resolve marital conflict as are men ... women have the potential to commit acts of violence and under certain circumstances, they do carry out these acts".&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt;{{rp|505}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinmatz |first1=Suzanne K. |chapter=Wifebeating, husband beating — a comparison of the use of physical violence between spouses to resolve marital fights |title=Battered Women: A Psychosociological Study of Domestic Violence |editor1-last=Roy |editor1-first=Maria |date=1977 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |location=New York |pages=63–72 |isbn=9780442272012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malcolm J. George, Steinmetz' article "represented a point of departure and antithetical challenge to the otherwise pervasive view of the seemingly universality of female vulnerability in the face of male hegemony exposed by the cases of battered wives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=George |first=Malcolm J. |title=Invisible touch |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=8 |year=2003 |page=32 |doi=10.1016/S1359-1789(01)00048-9}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmetz' colleague, [[Richard J. Gelles]], publicly addressed confusion caused by the research and [[Fathers' rights groups|father's rights groups]] "significant distortion" of the data in his public response ''Domestic Violence: Not An Even Playing Field'', "Indeed, men are hit by their wives, they are injured, and some are killed. But, are all men hit by women battered? No. Men who beat their wives, who use emotional abuse and blackmail to control their wives, and are then hit or even harmed, cannot be considered battered men. A battered man is one who is physically injured by a wife or partner and has not physically struck or psychologically provoked her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fathersmanifesto.net/gelles.htm |title=Richard Gelles:  oh so magnanimous, and dead wrong |website=''fathersmanifesto.net'' |access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmetz' claims in her article, and her use of the phrase "battered husband syndrome" in particular, aroused a great deal of controversy, with many scholars criticizing research flaws in her work. In particular, she was criticized for not differentiating between verbal and physical aggression or between intentionality and action (wanting to hit was considered the same as actually hitting). For example, [[David Finkelhor]] argues that Steinmetz' methodology was unacceptably unscientific. He argues that her work looks at all violence as fundamentally similar; there is no differentiation between male and female violence, or violence against a child and violence against a wife, such as a mother spanking a child and a father breaking a mother's ribs. Finkelhor sees this as especially important insofar as it does not allow a differentiation between ongoing systemic abuse and once-off violence, or between disciplining a child and beating a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finkelhor |first1=David |authorlink=David Finkelhor |chapter=Common Features of Family Abuse |editor1-last=Finkelhor |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Hotaling |editor2-first=Gerald T. |editor3-last=Gelles |editor3-first=Richard J. |editor4-last=Straus |editor-first4=Murray A. |title=The Dark Side of Families: Current Family Violence Research |pages=17–30 |date=1983 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=9780803919358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of female-perpetrated IPV==
The question of what causes female perpetrated IPV is another controversial subject. Donald G. Dutton and Tonia L. Nicholls write that traditional feminist theory "views all social relations through the prism of gender relations and holds, in its [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] view, that men (the [[bourgeoisie]]) hold power advantages over women (the [[proletariat]]) in patriarchal societies and that all domestic violence is either male physical abuse to maintain that power advantage or female defensive violence, used for self-protection".&lt;ref name="Paradigm"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.amen.ie/reports/28004.pdf |title=The gender paradigm in domestic violence research and theory: Part 1 — The conflict of theory and data |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |date=September 2005 |volume=10 |issue=6 |last1=Dutton |first1=Donald G. |last2=Nicholls |first2=Tonia L. |page=682 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, any IPV committed by women against men is by way of self-defense. Linda Kelly writes that "in conceding that women do engage in acts of domestic violence, female use of violence is justified as self-defense—a lifesaving reaction of women who are being physically attacked by their male partners. The development of the battered woman syndrome as a defense for crimes committed against abusive male partners, including homicide, evidences the wide acceptance of a woman's use of violence as self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disabusing the Definition of Domestic Abuse: How Women Batter Men and the Role of the Feminist State |url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/lr/vol30/iss4/7 |last=Kelly |first=Linda |authorlink=Linda L. Kelly |journal=[[Florida State University Law Review]] |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=806 |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that when women commit IPV, it is probably justified because they were previously victims and, therefore, the male was the "primary aggressor." Thus, the woman's violent behavior is caused by her background as a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Leonore E. |title=The Battered Woman Syndrome |publisher=Springer |location=New York |date=1984 |isbn=9780826102522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tower |first1=Leslie E. |last2=Fernandez |first2=Maria Elena |title=English- and Spanish-Speaking Women's Use of Violence |date=January 2008 |journal=[[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]] |pages=23–38 |volume=23 |issue=1 |url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/23/1/21.abstract |accessdate=2014-06-21 |doi=10.1177/0886260507307649}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Carlos Ramírez explains that given the socially accepted model of femininity as one of submission, passivity and abnegation, whatever behavior does not follow this stereotype will be perceived in an exaggerated manner as abnormal and violent. Thus, women will be perceived as disproportionately aggressive even if merely defending themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ramírez |first1=Juan Carlos |title=Madejas entreveradas: Violencia, masculinidad y poder |trans-title=Interlocked skeins: Violence, masculinity and power |year=2005 |publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara |location=Guadalajara |language=Spanish |isbn=978-970-722-360-8}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analyses of the research find that the overwhelming majority of women's IPV against male partners is in the context of being victimized.&lt;ref name="pmid18624096" /&gt; A 2010 systematic review of the literature on women's perpetration of IPV found that anger, [[self-defense]] and retaliation were common motivations but that distinguishing between self-defense and retaliation was difficult.&lt;ref name="pmid20823071"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bair-Merritt |first=Megan H |last2=Crowne |first2=Sarah Shea |last3=Thompson |first3=Darcy A |last4=Sibinga |first4=Erica |last5=Trent |first5=Maria |last6=Campbell |first6=Jacquelyn |year=2010 |title=Why Do Women Use Intimate Partner Violence?

For example, in a 1996 study of 1,978 people in England, 21% of women who admitted to committing IPV gave self-defense as a reason. More prevalent reasons were "Get through to" (53%), "Something said" (52%) and "Make do something" (26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aggression in British Heterosexual Relationships: A Descriptive Analysis |last1=Carrado |first1=Michelle |last2=George |first2=Malcolm J. |last3=Loxam |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Jones |first4=L. |last5=Templar |first5=Dale |journal=Aggressive Behavior |volume=22 |issue=6 |date=June 1996 |pages=401–415 |url=http://www.batteredmen.com/carrgeo1.htm |accessdate=2014-06-21 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:6&lt;401::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a five-year study of 978 college students from California, concluded in 1997, Martin S. Fiebert and Denise M. Gonzalez found an IPV rate amongst women of 20%. Within this group, perpetrators were asked to select reasons as to why they assaulted their partner, with the option to choose multiple reasons. The breakdown of reasons had "my partner wasn't sensitive to my needs" as the most prevalent (46%). Also found more frequently than self-defense were "I wished to gain my partner's attention" (44%) and "My partner was not listening to me" (43%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Women who initiate assaults: The reasons offered for such behavior |last1=Fiebert |first1=Martin S. |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Denise M. |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=80 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=583–590 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1997.80.2.583 |pmid=9129375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking beyond self-defense, studies have found a range of causes for female-perpetrated IPV. Writing of the feminist theory which regards reinforcement of patriarchy as a primary cause of IPV, Murray A. Straus writes "Patriarchy and male dominance in the family are clearly among the causes [of IPV], but there are many others. However, with rare exceptions, current offender treatment programs are based on the assumption that the primary cause is male dominance. Thus, they proceed under an erroneous assumption. Illustrative of this fallacious single-cause approach are the state-mandated offender treatment programs that forbid treating other causes, such as inadequate [[anger management]] skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=351 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Rose A. Medeiros and Murray A. Straus conducted a study using a sample of 854 students (312 men and 542 women) from two American universities. They identified fourteen specific risk factors common amongst both males and females who had committed IPV; poor anger management, [[antisocial personality disorder]]s, [[borderline personality disorder]]s, pattern of dominating relationships, [[substance abuse]], criminal history, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]s, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], communication problems, [[jealousy]], [[sexual abuse]] as a child, [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], and a general attitudinal approval of partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Medeiros |first1=Rose A. |last2=Straus |first2=Murray A. |chapter=Risk Factors for Physical Violence Between Dating Partners: Implications for Gender-Inclusive Prevention and Treatment of Family Violence |title=Family Approaches to Domestic Violence: A Practitioner's Guide to Gender-Inclusive Research and Treatment |editor1-last=Hamel |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Nicholls |editor2-first=Tonia |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |pages=59–87 |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID28-PR28.pdf |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straus states that most female perpetrated IPV is not motivated by self-defense, but by a desire to control their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.010 |title=Gender symmetry and mutuality in perpetration of clinical-level partner violence: Empirical evidence and implications for prevention and treatment |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=279 |year=2011 |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a study involving 1,104 male and female students in their late teens and early twenties found that women are more likely than men to be controlling and aggressive towards their partners, more likely to demonstrate a desire to control their partners, and more likely to use physical aggression in ensuring that control. The main author of the study, Elizabeth Bates, wrote "this suggests that intimate partner violence may not be motivated by patriarchal values and needs to be studied within the context of other forms of aggression, which has potential implications for interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Testing predictions from the male control theory of men's partner violence |date=January 2014 |journal=Aggressive Behavior |volume=40 |issue=1 |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Graham-Kevan |first2=Nicholas |last3=Archer |first3=John |pages=46–50 |doi=10.1002/ab.21499 |pmid=23878077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current literature on IPV has alternative viewpoints in relation to gender symmetry theory. A 2008 review published in journal of ''[[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence and Victims]]'' found that although less serious situational violence or altercation was equal for both genders, more serious and violent abuse was perpetrated by men. It was also found that women's physical violence was more likely motivated by self-defense or fear while men's was more likely motivated by control.&lt;ref name="pmid18624096" /&gt; A 2011 systematic review from the journal of ''Trauma Violence Abuse'' also found that the common motives for female on male domestic violence were anger, a need for attention, or as a response to their partner's own violence.&lt;ref name="pmid20823071" /&gt;  Another 2011 review published in the journal of ''[[Aggression and Violent Behavior]]'' also found that although minor domestic violence was equal, more severe violence was perpetrated by men. It was also found that men were more likely to beat up, choke or strangle their partners, while women were more likely to throw things at their partner, slap, kick, bite, punch, or hit with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf?accept=1 |title=Gender differences in self-reports of intimate partner violence: A review |last=Chan |first=KL |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |year=2011 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.02.008 |volume=16 |pages=167–175 |access-date=2016-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223015704/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf?accept=1 |archive-date=2015-12-23 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also found different outcomes in men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of IPV especially in terms of injuries, fear, and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes |last=Caldwell |first=Jennifer E |journal=Psychology of Violence |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=42&amp;ndash;57 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |doi=10.1037/a0026296 |year=2012 |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222165142/http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf |date=December 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42–45}} The review also found that 70% of female victims in one of their studies were "very frightened" in response to intimate partner violence from their partners, but 85% of male victims cited "no fear".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The review also found that IPV mediated the satisfaction of the relationship for women but it did not do so for men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Gender asymmetry is also consistent with government findings. According to government statistics from the US Department of Justice, male perpetrators constituted 96% of federal prosecution on domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Durose |first=Matthew R. |title=Family Violence Statistics Including Statistics on Strangers and Acquaintances |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf |website=bjs.gov |publisher=US Department of Justice |year=2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054500/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by the US Department of Justice on non-fatal domestic violence from 2003–2012 found that 76 percent of domestic violence was committed against women and 24 percent were committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Truman |first=Jennifer L. |title=Nonfatal Domestic Violence, 2003–2012 |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf |website=bjs.gov |publisher=US Department of Justice |year=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117112249/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf |archive-date=2016-01-17 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth M. Mann of the University of Windsor, an expert on sociology and criminology, stated her opposition to the gender symmetry theory of domestic violence on the grounds that women as well as children are the main victims in the "annual pile up" (Coyle, 2001) of victims being murdered by intimate partners and fathers throughout Canada (AuCoin, 2005; Ogrodnik, 2006).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;

==Responses==
Police services in several locations have expanded their domestic violence programs and response units in an effort to deal with IPV against men. [[Women's shelter|Shelters]] specifically for men have been set up in the UK; as of 2010, there are sixty refuge places available to men throughout England and Wales, compared to 7,500 places for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More than 40% of domestic violence victims are male, report reveals |first=Denis |last=Campbell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] has also campaigned to spread awareness of the problem of male victimization and to promote reporting of incidents. The country's first shelter for male abuse victims, Men's Aid NI, opened in early 2013. Chairman Peter Morris has remarked, "Domestic violence against men can take many forms, including emotional, sexual and physical abuse and threats of abuse. It can happen in heterosexual and same-sex relationships and, as with domestic abuse against females, can go largely unreported."&lt;ref name="McNeilly"/&gt;

It is the first of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. The term is also found in scriptures of [[Hinduism]], such as the [[Upanishads]], in discussions of [[moksha]] (spiritual liberation).&lt;ref name=olivellebu4414/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deussen1980p497"/&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
''Dukkha'' (Pali; Sanskrit ''duḥkha'') is a term found in ancient Indian literature, meaning anything that is "uneasy, uncomfortable, unpleasant, difficult, causing pain or sadness".{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483}}&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA324|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|pages=324–325}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a concept in Indian religions about the nature of life that innately includes the "unpleasant", "suffering," "pain," "sorrow", "distress", "grief" or "misery."{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483}}&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324/&gt; The term ''Dukkha'' does not have a one word English translation, and embodies diverse aspects of unpleasant human experiences.&lt;ref name=peterharvey26/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324/&gt; It is opposed to the word ''[[sukha]]'', meaning "happiness," "comfort" or "ease."{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 542-550}}

The word is commonly explained as a derivation from Aryan terminology for an axle hole, referring to an axle hole which is not in the center and leads to a bumpy, uncomfortable ride. According to Winthrop Sargeant,{{quote|The ancient Aryans who brought the Sanskrit language to India were a nomadic, horse- and cattle-breeding people who travelled in horse- or ox-drawn vehicles. ''Su'' and ''dus'' are prefixes indicating good or bad. The word ''kha'', in later Sanskrit meaning "sky," "ether," or "space," was originally the word for "hole," particularly an axle hole of one of the Aryan's vehicles. Thus ''sukha'' … meant, originally, "having a good axle hole," while ''duhkha'' meant "having a poor axle hole," leading to discomfort.{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|p=303}}}}

[[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], American [[vipassana]] teacher and writer, explains the etymology as follows:
{{quote|The word ''dukkha'' is made up of the prefix ''du'' and the root ''kha''. ''Du'' means “bad” or “difficult.” ''Kha'' means “empty.” “Empty,” here, refers to several things—some specific, others more general. One of the specific meanings refers to the empty axle hole of a wheel. If the axle fits badly into the center hole, we get a very bumpy ride. This is a good analogy for our ride through [[saṃsāra]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=289}}}}

However, according to [[Monier Monier-Williams]], the actual roots of the [[Pali]] term [[wikt:dukkha|''dukkha'']] appear to be [[Sanskrit]] [[wikt:दुस्-|दुस्-]] (''dus-'', "bad") + [[wikt:स्था|स्था]] (''stha'', "to stand").{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483, entry note:&amp;nbsp;|ps="according to grammarians properly written ''dush-kha'' and said to be from ''dus'' and ''kha'' [cf. ''su-khá'']; but more probably a Prākritized form for duḥ-stha'', q.v."}}  Regular phonological changes in the development of Sanskrit into the various [[Prakrit]]s led to a shift from ''dus-sthā'' to ''duḥkha'' to ''dukkha''.

==Buddhism==
Contemporary translators of Buddhist texts use a variety of English words to convey the aspects of ''dukkha''. Early Western translators of Buddhist texts (before the 1970s) typically translated the Pali term ''dukkha'' as "suffering." Later translators have emphasized that "suffering" is too limited a translation for the term dukkha, and have preferred to either leave the term untranslated or to clarify that translation with terms such as anxiety, distress, frustration, unease, unsatisfactoriness, etc.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle locations 524-528}}{{sfn|Prebish|1993}}{{sfn|Keown|2003}} Many contemporary teachers, scholars, and translators have used the term "unsatisfactoriness" to emphasize the subtlest aspects of dukkha.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1998|p=38}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Smith|Novak|2009|loc=Kindle location 2769}}{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 932-934}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2011|p=6}} Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term ''dukkha'',{{refn|group=note|Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term ''dukkha''; translators commonly use different words to translate aspects of the term. For example, ''dukkha'' has been translated as follows in many contexts:
* Suffering (Harvey, Williams, Keown, Anderson, Gombrich, Thich Nhat Hanh, Ajahn Succito, Chogyam Trungpa, Rupert Gethin, Dalai Lama, ''et al.'')
* Pain (Harvey, Williams, Keown, Anderson, Huxter, Gombrich, et al)

* Unease (Rupert Gethin)
* Unhappiness}}
and many translators prefer to leave the term untranslated.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 542-550}}

Within the Buddhist sutras, dukkha is divided in three categories:
* ''Dukkha-dukkha'', the dukkha of painful experiences. This includes the physical and mental sufferings of [[Jāti (Buddhism)|birth]], [[Jarāmaraṇa|aging]], [[Byādhi (Buddhism)|illness]], [[Jarāmaraṇa|dying]]; distress from what is not desirable.
* ''Viparinama-dukkha'', the dukkha of pleasant or happy experiences changing to unpleasant when the causes and conditions that produced the pleasant experiences cease.
* ''Sankhara-dukkha'', the dukkha of conditioned experience. This includes "a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence, all forms of life, because all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance."&lt;ref group=web name=bodhi1&gt;[http://www.beyondthenet.net/dhamma/fourNoble.htm ''The Four Noble Truths - By Bhikkhu Bodhi]&lt;/ref&gt; On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards.

Various sutras sum up how life in this "mundane world" is regarded to be ''dukkha'', starting with ''[[saṃsāra|samsara]]'', the ongoing process of death and rebirth itself:{{refn|group=note|name="PW"|Paul Williams: "All rebirth is due to karma and is impermanent. Short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma. The endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath, is samsara."{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74-75}}}}
# [[Jāti (Buddhism)|Birth]] is dukkha, [[Jarāmaraṇa|aging]] is dukkha, [[Byādhi (Buddhism)|illness]] is dukkha, [[Jarāmaraṇa|death]] is dukkha; 
# Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are dukkha; 
# Association with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha; 
# Not getting what is wanted is dukkha. 
# In conclusion, the five [[skandhas|clinging-aggregates]] are dukkha.

''Dukkha'' is one of the [[three marks of existence]], namely ''dukkha'' ("suffering"), ''[[anatta]]'' (not-self), ''[[anicca]]'' ("impermanence").

The Buddhist tradition emphasizes the importance of developing insight into the nature of ''dukkha'', the conditions that cause it, and how it can be overcome. This process is formulated in the teachings on the [[Four Noble Truths]].

==Hinduism==
In [[Hindu]] literature, the earliest [[Upanishads|Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads]] — the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|Bṛhadāraṇyaka}}]] and the [[Chandogya Upanishad|{{IAST|Chāndogya}}]] — in all likelihood predate the advent of Buddhism.{{refn|group=note|See, e.g., [[Patrick Olivelle]] (1996), ''Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|978-0-19-283576-5}}, p. xxxvi: "The scholarly consensus, well-founded I think, is that the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|Bṛhadāraṇyaka}}]] and the {{IAST|Chāndogya}} are the two earliest [[Upanishads|Upani{{IAST|ṣ}}ads]]....  The two texts as we have them are, in all likelihood, pre-Buddhist; placing them in the seventh to sixth centuries BCE may be reasonable, give or take a century or so."}}  In these scriptures of Hinduism, the Sanskrit word ''du{{IAST|ḥ}}kha'' (दुःख) appears in the sense of "suffering, sorrow, distress", and in the context of a spiritual pursuit and liberation through the knowledge of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul/self).&lt;ref name=olivellebu4414/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deussen1980p497"&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC&amp;pg=PR497| year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=482–485, 497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n281/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of sorrow and suffering, and self-knowledge as a means to overcome it, appears extensively with other terms in the pre-Buddhist Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC | year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=112, 161, 176, 198, 202–203, 235, 455, etc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Duhkha'' also appears in many other middle and later post-Buddhist Upanishads such as the verse 6.20 of [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC&amp;pg=PR326| year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[Bhagavada Gita]], all in the context of [[moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC&amp;pg=PR305| year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|See ''Bhagavad Gita'' verses 2.56, 5.6, 6.22-32, 10.4, 13.6-8, 14.16, 17.9, 18.8, etc; {{sfn|Sargeant|2009}}}} The term also appears in the foundational Sutras of the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], such as the opening lines of ''Samkhya karika'' of the [[Samkhya]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/IshvarakRiShNasAnkyakArikA.pdf Samkhya karika] Compiled and indexed by Ferenc Ruzsa (2015), Sanskrit Documents Archives;&lt;br /&gt;Second Translation (Verse 1): Ferenc Ruzsa (1997), The triple suffering - A note on the Samkhya karika, Xth World Sanskrit Conference: Bangalore, University of Hungary, Budapest;&lt;br /&gt;Third Translation (all Verses): [https://archive.org/stream/hinduphilosophys00davi#page/12/mode/2up Samkhyakarika of Iswara Krishna] John Davis (Translator), Trubner, London, University of Toronto Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colebrookesktrans&gt;[http://www.kouroo.info/kouroo/transclusions/18/37/1837_SankhyaKarikaHTColebrook.pdf Samkhya karika] by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of Buddhism and Hinduism==
Both Hinduism and Buddhism emphasize that one overcomes ''du{{IAST|ḥ}}kha'' through the development of understanding.{{refn|group=note|For a general discussion of the core Indian spiritual goal of developing transcendent "seeing," see, e.g., Hamilton, Sue (2000/2001), ''Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'', (Oxford: Oxford U. Press), pp. 9-10, {{ISBN|978-0-19-285374-5}}.}} However, the two religions widely differ in the nature of that understanding. Hinduism emphasizes the understanding and acceptance of Atman (self, soul) and [[Brahman]], while Buddhism emphasizes the understanding and acceptance of [[Anatta]] (Anatman, non-self, non-soul) as each discusses the means to liberation from ''Dukkha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=34, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">The '''equal authenticity rule''' is a rule of judicial interpretation developed by Canadian courts as a way of interpreting laws which are written in two parallel texts in English and French. The constitution of Canada requires that both versions of each Canadian law be treated as equally authoritative, which can result in problems when the English and French versions do not say exactly the same thing. The equal authenticity rule is derived from section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', which states, ''inter alia'', "The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages [i.e. both English and French]."

==History==
The rule requires courts to treat "both [the English and French] versions of statutes [as] equally valid and authoritative interpretations of the law,"&lt;ref&gt;This definition of the equal authenticity rule is from Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule holds that both versions are equally authoritative even if the statute in question was clearly drafted in one language and translated into the other, and even if the two versions of the law are incompatible.

An early version of the principle may be found a statute of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, enacted in 1857. The ''Act respecting the Codification of the Laws of Lower Canada relative to Civil Matters and Procedure'' requires that the Civil Code of Lower Canada be printed only in bilingual form, with English and French displayed on the same page: "[T]he two texts, when printed, shall stand side by side." It has been suggested that this provision of the 1857 Act is "best understood as a non-verbal legislative sign that the two texts should be interpreted dialogically." &lt;ref&gt;Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Toronto: LexisNexis, 2008, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this is an overstatement, it is certainly true that side-by-side publication was the first step towards the eventual adoption of the Equal Authenticity Rule for interpreting bilingual statutes.

The equal authenticity rule was developed by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1891, in the court’s ruling in ''[[CPR v. Robinson]]''. This case dealt with the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'', which is enacted in both French and English.

By implication, the rule also related to all laws enacted by the Parliament of Canada, as section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'' is equally binding upon the federal Parliament and Quebec legislation.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] first applied this rule of judicial interpretation to Acts of Parliament in 1935, in its ruling in the case of ''[[R. v. DuBois]]''

The rule was reaffirmed as section 18(1) in the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], when the constitution was repatriated in 1982.

==Unresolved issue regarding the application of the rule==
Some Canadian provinces (Quebec and Manitoba from the time of their establishment, and since 1982 New Brunswick) are constitutionally obligated to enact all laws in both official languages. However, a number of other provinces, such as Ontario, have opted to enact their laws in both English and French, even though they are not constitutionally required to do so. One question, not yet tested in the courts, "arises...as to whether both versions of bilingual legislation enacted in a province where there is no constitutional requirement to do so would be considered equally authoritative in the absence of an express Equal Authenticity Rule."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Michel Bastarache, Naiomi Metallic, Regan Morris and Christopher Essert, ''The Law of Bilingual Interpretation''. Markham, Ontario: LexisNexis, 2008, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; (An "express" equal authenticity rule would presumably take the form of such a rule in the relevant province's ''Interpretation Act'' or some other piece of [[Quasi-constitutionality|quasi-constitutional legislation]].

Bastarache ''et al.'', who raise this question, answer it in the affirmative, explaining that in their view, "the logic applicable to federal, Quebec and Manitoba legislation under the Constitution would also apply [even in the absence of a legislated statement of this logic]: that is, where two languages [sic] versions of a statute are enacted simultaneously both versions will be considered equally authoritative."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

{{discrimination sidebar}}

'''Ethnic cleansing''' is the systematic forced removal of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or racial groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically [[homogeneous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Rubenstein |title=The Cultural Landscape: An Introduction to Human Geography |publisher=Pearson, |year=2008 |isbn=9780131346819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} The forces applied may be various forms of [[forced migration]] ([[deportation]], [[population transfer]]), intimidation, as well as [[genocide]] and [[genocidal rape]].

Ethnic cleansing is usually accompanied with efforts to remove physical and cultural evidence of the targeted group in the territory through the destruction of homes, social centers, farms, and infrastructure, and by the desecration of monuments, cemeteries, and places of worship.

Initially used by the perpetrators during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and cited in this context as a euphemism akin to that of Nazi Germany's "[[Final Solution]]", by the 1990s, the term gained widespread acceptance due to journalism and the media's heightened use of the term in its generic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thum |first1= Gregor |year= 2006–2007 |title= Ethnic Cleansing in Eastern Europe after 1945 |journal= Contemporary European History |volume= 19 |issue=1 |pages= 75–81 |doi=10.1017/S0960777309990257 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
An antecedent to the term is the Greek word ''andrapodismos'' ({{lang-gr|ανδραποδισμός}}; lit.

The official United Nations definition of ethnic cleansing is "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or [[intimidation]] to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Robert M.

As a category, ethnic cleansing encompasses a continuum or spectrum of policies. In the words of [[Andrew Bell-Fialkoff]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]thnic cleansing [...] defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with deportation and genocide. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of a population from a given territory''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html "A Brief History of Ethnic Cleansing"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203000000/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html |date=February 3, 2004 }}, ''Foreign Affairs'' 72 (3): 110, Summer 1993.

[[Terry Martin (publisher)|Terry Martin]] has defined ethnic cleansing as "the forcible removal of an ethnically defined population from a given territory" and as "occupying the central part of a continuum between genocide on one end and nonviolent pressured ethnic emigration on the other end".&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin, Terry (1998).

In reviewing the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] in the judgement of [[Jorgic v. Germany]] on July 12, 2007 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] quoted from the ICJ ruling on the ''Bosnian Genocide Case'' to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide'':
{{quote|The term 'ethnic cleansing' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are the subject of this case ... [UN] General Assembly resolution 47/121 referred in its Preamble to 'the abhorrent policy of "ethnic cleansing", which is a form of genocide', as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ... It [i.e., ethnic cleansing] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [Genocide] Convention, if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area "ethnically homogeneous", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can ''as such'' be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is "to destroy, in whole or in part" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''dolus specialis''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the ICTY has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' (''Krstić'', IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 2 August 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide.' |ECHR quoting the ICJ.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-81608 ''Jorgic v.

==As a crime under international law==

There is no international treaty that specifies a specific crime of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ward |last=Ferdinandusse |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |title=The Interaction of National and International Approaches in the Repression of International Crimes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705180121/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=5 |year=2004 |p=1042, note 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense—the forcible deportation of a population—is defined as a [[crime against humanity]] under the statutes of both [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm "Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113100723/http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm |date=January 13, 2008 }}, Article 7; [https://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/index.htm ''Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia''], Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under public international law of [[crimes against humanity]] and in certain circumstances [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daphna |last=Shraga |first2=Ralph |last2=Zacklin |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |title=The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233818/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=3 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however situations, such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]], where ethnic cleansing has taken place without legal redress (see [[Preussische Treuhand v. Poland|''Preussische Treuhand'' v. Poland]]). [[Timothy V. Waters]] argues therefore that similar ethnic cleansing could go unpunished in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy V. Waters, [http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4600&amp;context=expresso "On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing"], Paper 951, 2006, [[University of Mississippi]] School of Law. Retrieved on 2006, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there – thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity". For example, the post-WWII [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.--&gt;

==Genocide==
[[File:Armenianvictimsassault.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Genocide]] victims]]
Academic discourse considers both [[genocide]] and ethnic cleansing to exist in a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or population transfer whereas genocide is the intentional murder of part or all of a particular ethnic, racial, religious, or national group. While ethnic cleansing and genocide may share the same goal and the acts used to perpetrate both crimes may often resemble each other, ethnic cleansing is intended to displace a persecuted population from a given territory, while genocide is intended to destroy a population.&lt;ref name=Schabas&gt;{{cite book |last=Schabas |first=William |year=2000 |title=Genocide in International Law |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYptuRHDQPgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=199–201 |isbn=9780521787901}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some academics consider genocide as a subset of "murderous ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |year=2005 |title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Dark+Side+of+Democracy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=17 |isbn=9780521538541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these concepts are different, but related, as Norman Naimark writes: "literally and figuratively, ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide, as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people".&lt;ref name=MassVio&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Naimark |first=Norman |date=4 November 2007 |url=http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |title=Theoretical Paper: Ethnic Cleansing |encyclopedia=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306173512/http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |archivedate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Schabas adds, "Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come.

In 1946 [[Königsberg]] was renamed [[Kaliningrad]]. The survivors of the German population were forcibly expelled and the city was repopulated with Soviet citizens.

In the 1990s [[Bosnian war]], ethnic cleansing was a common phenomenon. It typically entailed intimidation, forced expulsion and/or killing of the undesired ethnic group, as well as the destruction or removal of key physical and cultural elements. These included places of worship, cemeteries, works of art and historic buildings.

Based on the evidence of numerous attacks by Croat forces against Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993, the Croat leadership from Bosnia and Herzegovina had a designated plan to ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley in Central Bosnia. Dario Kordić, the local political leader, was found to be the instigator of this plan.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict - IV. Attacks on towns and villages: killings - C.

In the same year (1993), ethnic cleansing was also occurring in another country. During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]], the armed [[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]] [[separatist]] insurgency implemented a campaign of [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] against the large population of ethnic Georgians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an NEUTRAL expert opinion this sentence is OR.

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of systemic impacts. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians—recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it removes the fish by draining the water{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to the new Germany]] after 1945, it can contribute to long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} Some individuals of the large German population in [[Czechoslovakia]] and prewar [[Poland]] had encouraged Nazi [[jingoism]] before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} It thus establishes "[[facts on the ground]]"—radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse.

Silent ethnic cleansing is a term coined in the mid-1990s by some observers of the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Apparently concerned with Western media representations of atrocities committed in the conflict—which generally focused on those perpetrated by the Serbs—atrocities committed against [[Serbs]] were dubbed "silent" on the grounds that they did not receive adequate coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Krauthammer, Charles: "When Serbs Are 'Cleansed,' Moralists Stay Silent", ''International Herald Tribune'', August 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some incidents in [[Northern Ireland]] and during [[the Troubles]] between Protestants and Catholics were considered to be "ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/10/northernireland.race|title=Racist war of the loyalist street gangs|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|date=January 10, 2004|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/06/07/news/unionist-react-angrily-to-ira-ethnic-cleansing-plan-550226/|title=Unionists react angrily to IRA ‘ethnic cleansing' border plan|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included events after the [[Holy Cross dispute]] in 2001 when Protestant paramilitaries were accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing of Catholics in north [[Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1974017.stm|title=Fresh trouble in Belfast|date=May 8, 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/09/northernireland.rosiecowan|title='Ethnic cleansing' claim over Ulster attacks|first=Rosie|last=Cowan|date=September 9, 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases where accusations of ethnic cleansing have circulated, partisans have fiercely disputed such an interpretation and the details of the events which have been described as ethnic cleansing by academic or legal experts. This often leads to the promotion of vastly different versions of the event in question.

[[Gregory Stanton]], the founder of [[Genocide Watch]], has criticised the rise of the term and its use for events that he feels should be called "genocide": as "ethnic cleansing" has no legal definition, its media use can detract attention from events that should be prosecuted as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blum |first=Rony |last2=Stanton |first2=Gregory H. |last3=Sagi |first3=Shira |last4=Richter |first4=Elihu D. |title='Ethnic cleansing' bleaches the atrocities of genocide |journal=European Journal of Public Health |year=2007 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pmid=17513346 |pages=204–209 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Ethnic Cleansing and Genocidal Intent: A Failure of Judicial Interpretation?", ''Genocide Studies and Prevention'' 5, 1 (April 2010), Douglas Singleterry&lt;/ref&gt; Because of widespread acceptance after media influence, it has become a term used legally, but carries no legal repercussions as there is no legal definition.

In 1992, the German equivalent of ethnic cleansing" ({{lang-de|Ethnische Säuberung}}) was named [[Un-word of the year|German Un-Word of the Year]] by the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' due to its euphemistic, inappropriate nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christoph |last=Gunkel |date=October 31, 2010 |url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l18/l0/F.html#featuredEntry |publisher=[[Spiegel Online]] |title=Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort! |language=de |trans-title=One year, one (un)word!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Executive functions''' (collectively referred to as '''executive function''' and '''cognitive control''') are a set of [[cognition|cognitive processes]] that are necessary for the cognitive control of [[behavior]]: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include basic cognitive processes such as [[attentional control]], [[cognitive inhibition]], [[inhibitory control]], [[working memory]], and [[cognitive flexibility]]. Higher order executive functions require the simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions and include [[planning]] and [[fluid intelligence]] (e.g., [[reasoning]] and [[problem solving]]).&lt;ref name="NHM pathways"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Malenka |first1=RC |last2=Nestler |first2=EJ |last3=Hyman |first3=SE | editor1-last=Sydor |editor1-first=A |editor2-last=Brown |editor2-first=RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 155–157 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 6: Widely Projecting Systems: Monoamines, Acetylcholine, and Orexin | quote=DA has multiple actions in the prefrontal cortex. It promotes the "cognitive control" of behavior: the selection and successful monitoring of behavior to facilitate attainment of chosen goals. Aspects of cognitive control in which DA plays a role include working memory, the ability to hold information "on line" in order to guide actions, suppression of prepotent behaviors that compete with goal-directed actions, and control of attention and thus the ability to overcome distractions.&amp;nbsp;... Noradrenergic projections from the LC thus interact with dopaminergic projections from the VTA to regulate cognitive control.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions 2008 review"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2008|title=Assessment of executive functions: review of instruments and identification of critical issues|journal=Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=201–216|doi=10.1016/j.acn.2007.08.010|pmid=18096360|quote=The term "executive functions" is an umbrella term comprising a wide range of cognitive processes and behavioral competencies which include verbal reasoning, problem-solving, planning, sequencing, the ability to sustain attention, resistance to interference, utilization of feedback, multitasking, cognitive flexibility, and the ability to deal with novelty (Burgess, Veitch, de lacy Costello, &amp; Shallice, 2000; Damasio, 1995; Grafman &amp; Litvan, 1999; Shallice, 1988; Stuss &amp; Benson, 1986; Stuss, Shallice, Alexander, &amp; Picton, 1995).|vauthors=Chan RC, Shum D, Toulopoulou T, Chen EY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive functions gradually develop and change across the lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time over the course of a person's life.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt; Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by a variety of events which affect an individual.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt; Both [[neuropsychological test]]s (e.g., the [[Stroop test]]) and rating scales (e.g., the [[Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function]]) are used to measure executive functions. They are usually performed as part of a [[neuropsychological assessment|more comprehensive assessment]] to diagnose neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Cognitive control and [[stimulus control]], which is associated with [[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[classical conditioning]], represent opposite processes (internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors;&lt;ref name="Cognitive – stimulus"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Washburn |first1=DA | title = The Stroop effect at 80: The competition between stimulus control and cognitive control | journal = J Exp Anal Behav | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–13 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26781048 | doi = 10.1002/jeab.194 | quote = Today, arguably more than at any time in history, the constructs of attention, executive functioning, and cognitive control seem to be pervasive and preeminent in research and theory. Even within the cognitive framework, however, there has long been an understanding that behavior is multiply determined, and that many responses are relatively automatic, unattended, contention-scheduled, and habitual. Indeed, the cognitive flexibility, response inhibition, and self-regulation that appear to be hallmarks of cognitive control are noteworthy only in contrast to responses that are relatively rigid, associative, and involuntary. }}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, inhibitory control is necessary for overriding stimulus-driven behavioral responses (stimulus control of behavior).&lt;ref name="Executive functions"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Diamond |first1=Adele |author1-link=Adele Diamond | title = Executive functions | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 135–168 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23020641 | pmc = 4084861 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750 | quote = Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking "outside the box," seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances).&amp;nbsp;... EFs and prefrontal cortex are the first to suffer, and suffer disproportionately, if something is not right in your life. They suffer first, and most, if you are stressed (Arnsten 1998, Liston et al. 2009, Oaten &amp; Cheng 2005), sad (Hirt et al. 2008, von Hecker &amp; Meiser 2005), lonely (Baumeister et al. 2002, Cacioppo &amp; Patrick 2008, Campbell et al. 2006, Tun et al. 2012), sleep deprived (Barnes et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2007), or not physically fit (Best 2010, Chaddock et al. 2011, Hillman et al. 2008). Any of these can cause you to appear to have a disorder of EFs, such as ADHD, when you do not. You can see the deleterious effects of stress, sadness, loneliness, and lack of physical health or fitness at the physiological and neuroanatomical level in prefrontal cortex and at the behavioral level in worse EFs (poorer reasoning and problem solving, forgetting things, and impaired ability to exercise discipline and self-control).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;EFs can be improved (Diamond &amp; Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).&amp;nbsp;... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson &amp; Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)&amp;nbsp;... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we would be at the mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn't make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.&amp;nbsp;... The subthalamic nucleus appears to play a critical role in preventing such impulsive or premature responding (Frank 2006).}}&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4084861/figure/F4/ Figure 4: Executive functions and related terms]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prefrontal cortex]] is necessary but not solely sufficient for executive functions;&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EFmeta-analysis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-PFC cognitive processes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Malenka |first1=RC |last2=Nestler |first2=EJ |last3=Hyman |first3=SE |editor1-last=Sydor |editor1-first=A |editor2-last=Brown |editor2-first=RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | page = 315 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 13: Higher Cognitive Function and Behavioral Control | quote = However, damage to the prefrontal cortex has a significant deleterious effect on social behavior, decision making, and adaptive responding to the changing circumstances of life.&amp;nbsp;... Several subregions of the prefrontal cortex have been implicated in partly distinct aspects of cognitive control, although these distinctions remain somewhat vaguely defined. The ''anterior cingulate cortex'' is involved in processes that require correct decision-making, as seen in conflict resolution (eg, the Stroop test, see in Chapter 16), or cortical inhibition (eg, stopping one task and switching to another). The ''medial prefrontal cortex'' is involved in supervisory attentional functions (eg, action-outcome rules) and behavioral flexibility (the ability to switch strategies). The ''dorsolateral prefrontal cortex'', the last brain area to undergo myelination during development in late adolescence, is implicated in matching sensory inputs with planned motor responses. The ''ventromedial prefrontal cortex'' seems to regulate social cognition, including empathy. The ''orbitofrontal cortex'' is involved in social decision making and in representing the valuations assigned to different experiences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the [[caudate nucleus]] and [[subthalamic nucleus]] also have a role in mediating inhibitory control.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM-Cognitive Control" /&gt;

The prefrontal cortex receives inputs not only from other cortical regions, including association cortex, but also, via the thalamus, inputs from subcortical structures subserving emotion and motivation, such as the amygdala (Chapter 14) and ventral striatum (or nucleus accumbens; Chapter 15).&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.&amp;nbsp;... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).&amp;nbsp;... &lt;!--Inhibitory control brain structures--&gt;Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior. Subjects with ADHD exhibit less activation of the medial prefrontal cortex than healthy controls even when they succeed in such tasks and utilize different circuits.&amp;nbsp;...

== Neuroanatomy ==
Historically, the executive functions have been seen as regulated by the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobes, but it is still a matter of ongoing debate if that really is the case.&lt;ref name=EFmeta-analysis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvarez|first1=Julie A.|last2=Emory|first2=Eugene |title=Executive function and the frontal lobes: A meta-analytic review|journal=Neuropsychology Review|year=2006|volume=16|issue=1|pages=17–42|doi=10.1007/s11065-006-9002-x|pmid=16794878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though articles on prefrontal lobe lesions commonly refer to disturbances of executive functions and vice versa, a review found indications for the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] but not for the [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of executive function measures to frontal lobe functioning. This means that both frontal and non-frontal brain regions are necessary for intact executive functions. Probably &lt;!-- this is not an editor writing weasel words, but the word that the authors of the referenced article use--&gt; the frontal lobes need to participate in basically all of the executive functions, but it is not the only brain structure involved.&lt;!-- to anyone who wants to copyedit this sentence: the original sentence in the article is: "Thus, participation of the frontal lobes in virtually any "executive process" is probably a necessary, but largely insufficient, requirement.--&gt;&lt;ref name="EFmeta-analysis" /&gt;

[[Neuroimaging]] and [[brain damage|lesion]] studies have identified the functions which are most often associated with the particular regions of the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name="EFmeta-analysis" /&gt;
* The [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC) is involved with "on-line" processing of information such as integrating different dimensions of cognition and behavior.&lt;ref name=Lezak&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lezak |first1=Muriel Deutsch |last2=Howieson |first2=Diane B. |last3=Loring|first3=David W. |title=Neuropsychological Assessment |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-511121-7 |oclc=456026734 |edition=4th }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, this area has been found to be associated with verbal and design fluency, ability to maintain and [[set shifting|shift set]], planning, response inhibition, working memory, organisational skills, reasoning, problem solving and abstract thinking.&lt;ref name=EFmeta-analysis /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark|first1=L |last2=Bechara|first2=A |last3=Damasio|first3=H |last4=Aitken|first4=MRF |last5=Sahakian|first5=BJ |last6=Robbins|first6=TW |title=Differential effects of insular and ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions on risky decision making|journal=Brain|year=2008|volume=131|issue=5|pages=1311–1322|doi=10.1093/brain/awn066|pmid=18390562|pmc=2367692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prefrontal cortex.png|thumb|200px|Side view of the brain, illustrating dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex]]
* The  [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) is involved in emotional drives, experience and integration.&lt;ref name=Lezak /&gt; Associated cognitive functions include inhibition of inappropriate responses, decision making and motivated behaviors. Lesions in this area can lead to low drive states such as [[apathy]], [[abulia]] or [[akinetic mutism]] and may also result in low drive states for such basic needs as food or drink and possibly decreased interest in social or vocational activities and sex.&lt;ref name=Lezak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allman|first1=John M. |last2=Hakeem|first2=Atiya |last3=Erwin|first3=Joseph M. |last4=Nimchinsky|first4=Esther |last5=Hof|first5=Patrick |title=The anterior cingulate cortex: the evolution of an interface between emotion and cognition|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=2001|volume=935|issue=1|pages=107–117|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03476.x|pmid=11411161|bibcode=2001NYASA.935..107A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The  [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (OFC) plays a key role in impulse control, maintenance of set, monitoring ongoing behavior and socially appropriate behaviors.&lt;ref name=Lezak /&gt; The orbitofrontal cortex also has roles in representing the value of rewards based on sensory stimuli and evaluating subjective emotional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rolls |first1=Edmund T. |last2=Grabenhorst|first2=Fabian |title=The orbitofrontal cortex and beyond: From affect to decision-making|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|year=2008|volume=86|issue=3|pages=216–244|doi= 10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.09.001|pmid=18824074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions can cause disinhibition, impulsivity, aggressive outbursts, sexual promiscuity and antisocial behavior.&lt;ref name=EFmeta-analysis /&gt;

Furthermore, in their review, Alvarez and Emory state that: "The frontal lobes have multiple connections to cortical, subcortical and brain stem sites. The basis of 'higher-level' cognitive functions such as inhibition, flexibility of thinking, problem solving, planning, impulse control, concept formation, abstract thinking, and creativity often arise from much simpler, 'lower-level' forms of cognition and behavior. Thus, the concept of executive function must be broad enough to include anatomical structures that represent a diverse and diffuse portion of the central nervous system."&lt;ref name=EFmeta-analysis /&gt;

The [[cerebellum]] also appears to be involved in mediating certain executive functions.&lt;ref name="pmid22068584"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koziol LF, Budding DE, Chidekel D | title = From movement to thought: executive function, embodied cognition, and the cerebellum | journal = Cerebellum | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 505–25 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22068584 | doi = 10.1007/s12311-011-0321-y | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25439295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noroozian M | title = The role of the cerebellum in cognition: beyond coordination in the central nervous system | journal = Neurol Clin | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 1081–104 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25439295 | doi = 10.1016/j.ncl.2014.07.005 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive system is thought to be heavily involved in handling novel situations outside the domain of some of our 'automatic' psychological processes that could be explained by the reproduction of learned [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] or set behaviors. Psychologists [[Don Norman]] and [[Tim Shallice]] have outlined five types of situations in which routine activation of behavior would not be sufficient for optimal performance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norman|first1=DA |author1-link=Don Norman |last2=Shallice|first2=T |author2-link=Tim Shallice |date=1980 |chapter=Attention to action: Willed and automatic control of behaviour |editor1-last=Gazzaniga|editor1-first=MS |title=Cognitive neuroscience: a reader |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |publication-date=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-631-21660-5 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}

A ''prepotent response'' is a response for which immediate [[reinforcement]] (positive or negative) is available or has been previously associated with that response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barkley |first1=Russell A. |last2=Murphy |first2=Kevin R. |date=2006 |title=Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Clinical Workbook |edition=3rd |volume=2 |isbn=978-1-59385-227-6 |oclc=314949058 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} The executive functions are often invoked when it is necessary to override these prepotent responses that might otherwise be automatically elicited by stimuli in the external environment. For example, on being presented with a potentially rewarding stimulus, such as a tasty piece of [[chocolate cake]], a person might have the automatic response to take a bite.  However, where such behavior conflicts with internal plans (such as having decided not to eat chocolate cake while on a diet), the executive functions might be engaged to inhibit that response.

Although suppression of these prepotent responses is ordinarily considered adaptive, problems for the development of the individual and the culture arise when feelings of right and wrong are overridden by cultural expectations or when creative impulses are overridden by executive inhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cherkes-Julkowski|first1=Miriam |title=The DYSfunctionality of Executive Function |publisher=Surviving Education Guides |location=Apache Junction, AZ |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=978-0-9765299-2-7 |oclc=77573143 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}

== Historical perspective ==

Although research into the executive functions and their neural basis has increased markedly over recent years, the theoretical framework in which it is situated is not new. In the 1940s, the British psychologist [[Donald Broadbent]] drew a distinction between "automatic" and "controlled" processes (a distinction characterized more fully by [[Richard Shiffrin|Shiffrin]] and Schneider in 1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shiffrin|first1=RM |last2=Schneider|first2=W |title=Controlled and automatic human information processing: II: Perceptual learning, automatic attending, and a general theory |journal=Psychological Review |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=127–90 |date=March 1977 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.127 |citeseerx=10.1.1.227.1856 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the notion of [[selective attention]], to which executive functions are closely allied.  In 1975, the US psychologist [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Michael Posner]] used the term "cognitive control" in his book chapter entitled "Attention and cognitive control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Posner |first1=MI |last2=Snyder |first2=CRR |chapter=Attention and cognitive control |editor1-last=Solso |editor1-first=RL |title=Information processing and cognition: the Loyola symposium |publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, NJ |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-470-81230-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of influential researchers such as Michael Posner, [[Joaquin Fuster]], [[Tim Shallice]], and their colleagues in the 1980s (and later [[Trevor Robbins]], Bob Knight, Don Stuss, and others) laid much of the groundwork for recent research into executive functions.  For example, Posner proposed that there is a separate "executive" branch of the attentional system, which is responsible for focusing [[attention]] on selected aspects of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Posner|first1=MI |last2=Petersen|first2=SE |title=The attention system of the human brain |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=25–42 |year=1990 |pmid=2183676 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.13.030190.000325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[neuropsychologist]] Tim Shallice similarly suggested that attention is regulated by a "supervisory system", which can override automatic responses in favour of scheduling behaviour on the basis of plans or intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shallice |first1=T |title=From neuropsychology to mental structure |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-521-31360-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, a consensus emerged that this control system is housed in the most anterior portion of the brain, the [[prefrontal cortex]] (PFC).

Psychologist [[Alan Baddeley]] had proposed a similar system as part of his model of [[working memory]]&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986 /&gt; and argued that there must be a component (which he named the "central executive") that allows information to be manipulated in [[short-term memory]] (for example, when doing [[mental arithmetic]]).

== Development ==
{{further|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Cognitive control and memory}}
The executive functions are among the last mental functions to reach maturity. This is due to the delayed maturation of the [[prefrontal cortex]], which is not completely [[myelination|myelinated]] until well into a person's third decade of life. Development of executive functions tends to occur in spurts, when new skills, strategies, and forms of awareness emerge. These spurts are thought to reflect maturational events in the frontal areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="DeLuca2008"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Developmental trajectories of executive functions across the lifespan | editor1-first=Peter | editor1-last=Anderson | editor2-first=Vicki | editor2-last=Anderson | editor3-first=Rani | editor3-last=Jacobs | first1=Cinzia R. | first2=Richard J. | last1=De Luca | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2F14AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT107 | title=Executive functions and the frontal lobes: a lifespan perspective | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | last2=Leventer | year=2008 | location=Washington, DC | pages=24–47 | isbn=978-1-84169-490-0 | oclc=182857040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attentional control appears to emerge in infancy and develop rapidly in early childhood. Cognitive flexibility, goal setting, and information processing usually develop rapidly during ages 7–9 and mature by age 12. Executive control typically emerges shortly after a transition period at the beginning of adolescence.&lt;ref name="Anderson2002"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=PJ | journal=Child Neuropsychology | issue=2 | doi=10.1076/chin.8.2.71.8724 | last1=Anderson | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1076/chin.8.2.71.8724 | title=Assessment and development of executive functioning (EF) in childhood | year=2002 | volume=8 | pages=71–82 | pmid=12638061}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's not yet clear whether there is a single sequence of stages in which executive functions appear, or whether different environments and early life experiences can lead people to develop them in different sequences.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;

=== Early childhood ===
[[Inhibitory control]] and [[working memory]] act as basic executive functions that makes it possible for more complex executive functions like problem-solving to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Senn|first1=TE|last2=Espy|first2=KA |last3=Kaufmann|first3=PM |title=Using path analysis to understand executive function organization in preschool children |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=26 |pages=445–464 |year=2004 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2601_5 |pmid=15276904 |issue=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/dcnlfacpub/8|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhibitory control and working memory are among the earliest executive functions to appear, with initial signs observed in infants, 7 to 12-months old.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson2002 /&gt; Then in the preschool years, children display a spurt in performance on tasks of inhibition and working memory, usually between the ages of 3 to 5 years.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Best2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Best|first1=JR |last2=Miller|first2=PH |last3=Jones|first3=LL |title=Executive functions after age 5: Changes and correlates |journal=Developmental Review |volume=29 |pages=180–200 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2009.05.002 |pmid=20161467 |issue=3 |pmc=2792574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this time, cognitive flexibility, goal-directed behavior, and planning begin to develop.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;  Nevertheless, preschool children do not have fully mature executive functions and continue to make errors related to these emerging abilities – often not due to the absence of the abilities, but rather because they lack the awareness to know when and how to use particular strategies in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Espy |first1=KA |title=Using developmental, cognitive, and neuroscience approaches to understand executive functions in preschool children |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=26 |pages=379–384 |year=2004 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2601_1 |pmid=15276900 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preadolescence ===
Preadolescent children continue to exhibit certain growth spurts in executive functions, suggesting that this development does not necessarily occur in a linear manner, along with the preliminary maturing of particular functions as well.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson2002 /&gt;  During preadolescence, children display major increases in verbal working memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brocki|first1=KC |last2=Bohlin|first2=G |title=Executive functions in children aged 6 to 13: A dimensional and developmental study; |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=26 |pages=571–593 |year=2004 |doi=10.1207/s15326942dn2602_3 |pmid=15456685 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; goal-directed behavior (with a potential spurt around 12 years of age);&lt;ref name = Anderson2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson|first1=VA|last2=Anderson|first2=P |last3=Northam|first3=E |last4=Jacobs|first4=R |last5=Catroppa|first5=C |title=Development of executive functions through late childhood and adolescence in an Australian sample |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=20 |pages=385–406 |year=2001 |doi=10.1207/S15326942DN2001_5 |pmid=11827095 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; response inhibition and selective attention;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klimkeit|first1=EI |last2=Mattingley|first2=JB |last3=Sheppard|first3=DM |last4=Farrow|first4=M |last5=Bradshaw|first5=JL |title=Examining the development of attention and executive functions in children with a novel paradigm |journal=Child Neuropsychology |volume=10 |pages=201–211 |year=2004 |pmid=15590499 |issue=3 |doi=10.1080/09297040409609811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and strategic planning and organizational skills.&lt;ref name=Anderson2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DeLuca2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Luca|first1=CR |last2=Wood|first2=SJ |last3=Anderson|first3=V |last4=Buchanan|first4=JA |last5=Proffitt|first5=T |last6=Mahony|first6=K |last7=Pantelis|first7=C |title=Normative data from the CANTAB I: Development of executive function over the lifespan |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=25 |pages=242–254 |year=2003 |doi=10.1076/jcen.25.2.242.13639 |pmid=12754681 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Luciana2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luciana|first1=M |last2=Nelson|first2=CA |title=Assessment of neuropsychological function through use of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Testing Automated Battery:  Performance in 4- to 12-year old children |journal=Developmental Neuropsychology |volume=22 |pages=595–624 |year=2002 |doi=10.1207/S15326942DN2203_3 |pmid=12661972 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, between the ages of 8 to 10, [[cognitive flexibility]] in particular begins to match adult levels.&lt;ref name=DeLuca2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Luciana2002 /&gt;  However, similar to patterns in childhood development, executive functioning in preadolescents is limited because they do not reliably apply these executive functions across multiple contexts as a result of ongoing development of inhibitory control.&lt;ref name=DeLuca2008 /&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
Many executive functions may begin in childhood and preadolescence, such as inhibitory control. Yet, it is during adolescence when the different brain systems become better integrated. At this time, youth implement executive functions, such as inhibitory control, more efficiently and effectively and improve throughout this time period.&lt;ref name=Luna2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luna|first1=B |last2=Garver|first2=KE |last3=Urban|first3=TA |last4=Lazar|first4=NA | author4-link = Nicole Lazar |last5=Sweeney|first5=JA |title=Maturation of cognitive processes from late childhood to adulthood |journal=Child Development |volume=75 |pages=1357–1372 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00745.x |pmid=15369519 |issue=5 |citeseerx=10.1.1.498.6633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leon-Carrion|first1=J |last2=García-Orza|first2=J |last3=Pérez-Santamaría|first3=FJ |title=Development of the inhibitory component of the executive functions in children and adolescents |journal=International Journal of Neuroscience |volume=114 |pages=1291–1311 |year=2004 |doi=10.1080/00207450490476066 |pmid=15370187 |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as inhibitory control emerges in childhood and improves over time, planning and goal-directed behavior also demonstrate an extended time course with ongoing growth over adolescence.&lt;ref name=Best2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Anderson2001 /&gt;  Likewise, functions such as attentional control, with a potential spurt at age 15,&lt;ref name = Anderson2001 /&gt; along with working memory,&lt;ref name=Luna2004 /&gt; continue developing at this stage.

=== Adulthood ===
The major change that occurs in the brain in adulthood is the constant myelination of neurons in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt; At age 20–29, executive functioning skills are at their peak, which allows people of this age to participate in some of the most challenging mental tasks. These skills begin to decline in later adulthood. Working memory and spatial span are areas where decline is most readily noted. Cognitive flexibility, however, has a late onset of impairment and does not usually start declining until around age 70 in normally functioning adults.&lt;ref name = DeLuca2008 /&gt; Impaired executive functioning has been found to be the best predictor of functional decline in the elderly.

== Models ==

=== Top-down inhibitory control ===
Aside from facilitatory or amplificatory mechanisms of control, many authors have argued for [[Cognitive inhibition|inhibitory mechanisms]] in the domain of response control,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aron|first1=AR |last2=Poldrack|first2=RA |title=Cortical and subcortical contributions to Stop signal response inhibition: role of the subthalamic nucleus |journal=J.

=== Working memory model ===
One influential model is Baddeley's multicomponent model of working memory, which is composed of a central executive system that regulates three other subsystems: the phonological loop, which maintains verbal information; the visuospatial sketchpad, which maintains visual and spatial information; and the more recently developed episodic buffer that integrates short-term and long-term memory, holding and manipulating a limited amount of information from multiple domains in temporal and spatially sequenced episodes.&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Alan D. |author1-link=Alan Baddeley |title=Working memory |series=Oxford psychology series |volume=11 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=978-0-19-852116-7 |oclc=13125659 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Alan |chapter=16 Fractionating the Central Executive |editor1-last=Knight |editor1-first=Robert L. |editor2-last=Stuss |editor2-first=Donald T. |title=Principles of frontal lobe function |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2002 |pages=246–260 |isbn=978-0-19-513497-1 |oclc=48383566 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supervisory attentional system (SAS) ===
Another conceptual model is the [[supervisory attentional system]] (SAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Norman |first1=DA |last2=Shallice |first2=T |chapter=Attention to action: Willed and automatic control of behaviour |editor1-last=Shapiro |editor1-first=David L. |editor2-last=Schwartz |editor2-first=Gary |title=Consciousness and self-regulation: advances in research |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |orig-year=1976 |date=1986 |pages=1–14 |isbn=978-0-306-33601-0 |oclc=2392770  |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shallice|first1=Tim |last2=Burgess|first2=Paul |last3=Robertson|first3=I. |title= The domain of supervisory processes and temporal organisation of behaviour |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=351 |pages=1405–1412 |year=1996 |doi= 10.1098/rstb.1996.0124 |issue= 1346 |pmid=8941952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, contention scheduling is the process where an individual's well-established schemas automatically respond to routine situations while executive functions are used when faced with novel situations.  In these new situations, attentional control will be a crucial element to help generate new schema, implement these schema, and then assess their accuracy.

=== Self-regulatory model ===
[[Russell Barkley]] proposed a widely known model of executive functioning that is based on [[Self-control|self-regulation]]. Primarily derived from work examining behavioral inhibition, it views executive functions as composed of four main abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barkley |first1=RA |title= Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions:  Constructing a unifying theory of ADHD |journal= Psychological Bulletin |volume=121 |pages=65–94 |year=1997 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.121.1.65 |pmid= 9000892 |issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One element is working memory that allows individuals to resist interfering information. A second component is the management of emotional responses in order to achieve goal-directed behaviors. Thirdly, internalization of self-directed speech is used to control and sustain rule-governed behavior and to generate plans for problem-solving. Lastly, information is analyzed and synthesized into new behavioral responses to meet one's goals. Changing one's behavioral response to meet a new goal or modify an objective is a higher level skill that requires a fusion of executive functions including self-regulation, and accessing prior knowledge and experiences.

According to this model, the executive system of the human brain provides for the cross-temporal organization of behavior towards goals and the future and coordinates actions and strategies for everyday goal-directed tasks. Essentially, this system permits humans to self-regulate their behavior so as to sustain action and problem solving toward goals specifically and the future more generally. Thus, executive function deficits pose serious problems for a person's ability to engage in self-regulation over time to attain their goals and anticipate and prepare for the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Russell A.

=== Problem-solving model ===
Yet another model of executive functions is a problem-solving framework where executive functions is considered a macroconstruct composed of subfunctions working in different phases to (a) represent a problem, (b) plan for a solution by selecting and ordering strategies, (c) maintain the strategies in short-term memory in order to perform them by certain rules, and then (d) evaluate the results with error detection and error correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zelazo|first1=PD |last2=Carter|first2=A |last3=Reznick|first3=J |last4=Frye|first4=D |title= Early development of executive function:  A problem-solving framework |journal= Review of General Psychology |volume=1 |pages=198–226 |year=1997 |doi= 10.1037/1089-2680.1.2.198 |issue= 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lezak's conceptual model ===
One of the most widespread conceptual models on executive functions is Lezak's model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lezak |first1=Muriel Deutsch |title=Neuropsychological assessment |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |edition=3rd |oclc=925640891 |isbn=978-0-19-509031-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework proposes four broad domains of volition, planning, purposive action, and effective performance as working together to accomplish global executive functioning needs. While this model may broadly appeal to clinicians and researchers to help identify and assess certain executive functioning components, it lacks a distinct theoretical basis and relatively few attempts at validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=PJ |chapter=Towards a developmental framework of executive function |editor1-last=Anderson |editor1-first=V |editor2-last=Jacobs |editor2-first=R |editor3-last=Anderson |editor3-first=PJ |title=Executive functions and the frontal lobes: A lifespan perspective |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York |year=2008 |pages=3–21 |oclc=182857040 |isbn=978-1-84169-490-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miller &amp; Cohen's model ===
In 2001,  Earl Miller and Jonathan Cohen published their article "An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function", in which they argue that cognitive control is the primary function of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and that control is implemented by increasing the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of sensory or motor [[neuron]]s that are engaged by task- or goal-relevant elements of the external environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller|first1=EK |last2=Cohen|first2=JD |title=An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=167–202 |year=2001 |pmid=11283309 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a key paragraph, they argue:

{{quote|We assume that the PFC serves a specific function in cognitive control: the active maintenance of patterns of activity that represent goals and the means to achieve them. They provide bias signals throughout much of the rest of the brain, affecting not only visual processes but also other sensory modalities, as well as systems responsible for response execution, memory retrieval, emotional evaluation, etc. The aggregate effect of these bias signals is to guide the flow of neural activity along pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task.}}

Miller and Cohen draw explicitly upon an earlier theory of visual attention that conceptualises perception of visual scenes in terms of competition among multiple representations – such as colors, individuals, or objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Desimone|first1=R |last2=Duncan|first2=J |title=Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention |journal=Annu Rev Neurosci |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=193–222 |year=1995 |pmid=7605061 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.18.030195.001205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[selective attention|Selective visual attention]] acts to 'bias' this competition in favour of certain selected features or representations.  For example, imagine that you are waiting at a busy train station for a friend who is wearing a red coat.  You are able to selectively narrow the focus of your attention to search for red objects, in the hope of identifying your friend.  Desimone and Duncan argue that the brain achieves this by selectively increasing the gain of neurons responsive to the color red, such that output from these neurons is more likely to reach a downstream [[information processing|processing stage]], and, as a consequence, to guide [[behaviour]]. According to Miller and Cohen, this [[selective attention]] mechanism is in fact just a special case of cognitive control – one in which the biasing occurs in the sensory domain.  According to Miller and Cohen's model, the PFC can exert control over input (sensory) or output (response) [[neuron]]s, as well as over assemblies involved in [[memory]], or [[emotion]].  Cognitive control is mediated by reciprocal PFC [[functional integration|connectivity]] with the [[sensory cortex|sensory]] and [[motor cortex|motor cortices]], and with the [[limbic system]].  Within their approach, thus, the term 'cognitive control' is applied to any situation where a biasing signal is used to promote task-appropriate responding, and control thus becomes a crucial component of a  wide range of psychological constructs such as [[selective attention]], error monitoring, [[decision-making]], [[memory inhibition]], and response inhibition.

=== Miyake and Friedman's model ===
Miyake and Friedman's theory of executive functions proposes that there are three aspects of executive functions: updating, inhibition, and shifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miyake|first1=A |last2=Friedman|first2=NP |last3=Emerson|first3=MJ |last4=Witzki|first4=AH |last5=Howerter|first5=A |last6=Wager|first6=TD |title=The unity and diversity of executive functions and their contributions to complex 'frontal lobe' tasks: A latent variable analysis |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=41|pages=49–100 |year=2000 |doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0734 |pmid=10945922 |issue=1 |citeseerx=10.1.1.485.1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A cornerstone of this theoretical framework is the understanding that individual differences in executive functions reflect both unity (i.e., common EF skills) and diversity of each component (e.g., shifting-specific).  In other words, aspects of updating, inhibition, and shifting are related, yet each remains a distinct entity.  First, updating is defined as the continuous monitoring and quick addition or deletion of contents within one's working memory.  Second, inhibition is one's capacity to supersede responses that are prepotent in a given situation.  Third, shifting is one's cognitive flexibility to switch between different tasks or mental states.

Miyake and Friedman also suggest that the current body of research in executive functions suggest four general conclusions about these skills. The first conclusion is the unity and diversity aspects of executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaughan|first1=L |last2=Giovanello|first2=K |title=Executive function in daily life: Age-related influences of executive processes on instrumental activities of daily living |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=25 |pages=343–355 |year=2010 |doi=10.1037/a0017729 |pmid=20545419 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wiebe|first1=SA |last2=Espy|first2=KA |last3=Charak|first3=D |title=Using confirmatory factor analysis to understand executive control in preschool children: I.

=== Banich's "Cascade of control" model ===
This model from 2009 integrates theories from other models, and involves a sequential cascade of brain regions involved in maintaining attentional sets in order to arrive at a goal. In sequence, the model assumes the involvement of the posterior [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC), the mid-DLPFC, and the posterior and anterior dorsal ACC.&lt;ref name = Banich2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banich |first1=MT |title= Executive function: The search for an integrated account |journal= Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |pages=89–94 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01615.x |issue=2 |url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~mbanich/p/SearchIntegratedAccount.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive task used in the article is selecting a response in the [[Stroop task]], among conflicting color and word responses, specifically a stimulus where the word "green" is printed in red ink. The posterior DLPFC creates an appropriate attentional set, or rules for the brain to accomplish the current goal. For the Stroop task, this involves activating the areas of the brain involved in color perception, and not those involved in word comprehension. It counteracts biases and irrelevant information, like the fact that the semantic perception of the word is more salient to most people than the color in which it is printed.

Next, the mid-DLPFC selects the representation that will fulfill the goal. The task-relevant information must be separated from other sources of information in the task. In the example, this means focusing on the ink color and not the word.

The posterior dorsal  [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) is next in the cascade, and it is responsible for response selection. This is where the decision is made whether you will say green (the written word and the incorrect answer) or red (the font color and correct answer).

Following the response, the anterior dorsal ACC is involved in response evaluation, deciding whether you were correct or incorrect. Activity in this region increases when the probability of an error is higher.

The activity of any of the areas involved in this model depends on the efficiency of the areas that came before it. If the DLPFC imposes a lot of control on the response, the ACC will require less activity.&lt;ref name = Banich2009 /&gt;

Recent work using individual differences in cognitive style has shown exciting support for this model. Researchers had participants complete an auditory version of the Stroop task, in which either the location or semantic meaning of a directional word had to be attended to. Participants that either had a strong bias toward spatial or semantic information (different cognitive styles) were then recruited to participate in the task. As predicted, participants that has a strong bias toward spatial information had more difficulty paying attention to the semantic information and elicited increased electrophysiological activity from the ACC. A similar activity pattern was also found for participants that had a strong bias toward verbal information when they tried to attend to spatial information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 23994425| year = 2013| last1=Buzzell|first1=GA |last2=Roberts|first2=DM |last3=Baldwin|first3=CL |last4=McDonald|first4=CG | title = An electrophysiological correlate of conflict processing in an auditory spatial Stroop task: The effect of individual differences in navigational style| journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology| volume = 90| issue = 2| pages = 265–71| doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment ==

Assessment of executive functions involves gathering data from several sources and synthesizing the information to look for trends and patterns across time and settings. Apart from standardized neuropsychological tests, other measures can and should be used, such as [[behaviour checklist]]s, [[observations]], [[interviews]], and [[work samples]]. From these, conclusions may be drawn on the use of executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Castellanos|first1=Irina|last2=Kronenberger|first2=William G.|last3=Pisoni|first3=David B.|date=|year=2016|title=Questionnaire-based assessment of executive functioning: Psychometrics|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irina_Castellanos/publication/309101878_Questionnaire-based_assessment_of_executive_functioning_in_pediatric_psychology_Psychometrics/links/582a1b7908ae138f1bf31c9e.pdf|journal=Applied Neuropsychology: Child|volume=0|issue=2|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/21622965.2016.1248557|pmid=27841670|quote=Clinical  evaluation  of  EF  typically  includes  an  office-  based  visit  involving  administration  of  a  battery  of   neuropsychological assessment instruments.  Despite  their advantages,  however,  individually-administered  neuro-psychological measures of EF have two primary limitations:  First,  in  most  cases,  they  must  be  individually  administered and scored by a technician or professional  in an office setting, which limits their utility for screening  or  brief  assessment  purposes.  Second,  relations between office-based  neuropsychological  measures  of  EF  and  actual  behavior  in  the  daily  environment  are modest (Barkley, 2012), leading to some caution when applying neuropsychological test results to conclusions about behavioral outcomes. As a result of these limitations of office-based neuropsychological tests of EF, parent- and teacher-report behavior checklist measures of EF have  been  developed for both  screening  purposes and  to complement  the results of performance-based neuropsychological  testing  by providing reports  of  EF  behavior  in  daily life  (Barkley, 2011b;  Gioia  et  al., 2000; Naglieri &amp; Goldstein,  2013). These checklists have the advantage of good psychometrics, strong ecological validity, and high clinical utility as a result of their ease of administration, scoring, and interpretation."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different kinds of instruments (e.g., performance based, self-report) that measure executive functions across development. These assessments can serve a diagnostic purpose for a number of clinical populations.

== Experimental evidence ==

The executive system has been traditionally quite hard to define, mainly due to what psychologist [[Paul W. Burgess]] calls a lack of "process-behaviour correspondence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rabbitt |first1=PMA |chapter=Theory and methodology in executive function research |title=Methodology of frontal and executive function |publisher=Psychology Press |location=East Sussex |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-86377-485-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, there is no single behavior that can in itself be tied to executive function, or indeed [[executive dysfunction]]. For example, it is quite obvious what reading-impaired patients cannot do, but it is not so obvious what exactly executive-impaired patients might be incapable of.

This is largely due to the nature of the executive system itself. It is mainly concerned with the dynamic, "online" co-ordination of cognitive resources, and, hence, its effect can be observed only by measuring other cognitive processes. In similar manner, it does not always fully engage outside of real-world situations. As [[neurologist]] [[Antonio Damasio]] has reported, a patient with severe day-to-day executive problems may still pass paper-and-pencil or lab-based tests of executive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saver|first1=JL |last2=Damasio|first2=AR |title=Preserved access and processing of social knowledge in a patient with acquired sociopathy due to ventromedial frontal damage |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=29 |issue=12 |pages=1241–9 |year=1991 |pmid=1791934 |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(91)90037-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of the executive system were largely driven by observations of patients having suffered [[frontal lobe]] damage. They exhibited disorganized actions and strategies for everyday tasks (a group of behaviors now known as [[dysexecutive syndrome]]) although they seemed to perform normally when clinical or lab-based tests were used to assess more fundamental cognitive functions such as [[memory]], [[learning]], [[language]], and [[reasoning]]. It was hypothesized that, to explain this unusual behaviour, there must be an overarching system that co-ordinates other cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Shimamura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shimamura |first1=AP |title=The role of the prefrontal cortex in dynamic filtering |journal= Psychobiology |volume=28 |pages=207–218 |year=2000 |doi=10.3758/BF03331979|doi-broken-date=2018-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the experimental evidence for the neural structures involved in executive functions comes from laboratory tasks such as the [[stroop effect|Stroop task]] or the [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Task]] (WCST).  In the Stroop task, for example, human subjects are asked to name the color that color words are printed in when the ink color and word meaning often conflict (for example, the word "RED" in green ink). Executive functions are needed to perform this task, as the relatively overlearned and automatic behaviour (word reading) has to be inhibited in favour of a less practiced task – naming the ink color.  Recent [[functional neuroimaging]] studies have shown that two parts of the PFC, the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) and the [[prefrontal cortex|dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC), are thought to be particularly important for performing this task.

=== Context-sensitivity of PFC neurons ===
Other evidence for the involvement of the PFC in executive functions comes from single-cell [[electrophysiology]] studies in non-human [[primate]]s, such as the [[macaque]] monkey, which have shown that (in contrast to cells in the posterior brain) many PFC neurons are sensitive to a conjunction of a stimulus and a context.  For example, PFC cells might respond to a green cue in a condition where that cue signals that a leftwards fast movement of the eyes and the head should be made, but not to a green cue in another experimental context.  This is important, because the optimal deployment of executive functions is invariably context-dependent.

One example from Miller &amp; Cohen involves a pedestrian crossing the street.  In the United States, where cars drive on the [[Right- and left-hand traffic|right side of the road]], an American learns to look '''left''' when crossing the street.  However, if that American visits a country where cars drive on the left, such as the United Kingdom, then the ''opposite'' behavior would be required (looking to the '''right''').  In this case, the automatic response needs to be suppressed and executive functions must make the American look to the right while in the UK.

Neurologically, this behavioural repertoire clearly requires a neural system that is able to integrate the stimulus (the road) with a context (US or UK) to cue a behaviour (look left or look right).  Current evidence suggests that neurons in the PFC appear to represent precisely this sort of information.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Other evidence from single-cell [[electrophysiology]] in monkeys implicates ventrolateral PFC (inferior prefrontal convexity) in the control of motor responses. For example, cells that increase their firing rate to NoGo signals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sakagami|first1=M |last2=Tsutsui|first2=Ki |last3=Lauwereyns|first3=J |last4=Koizumi|first4=M |last5=Kobayashi|first5=S |last6=Hikosaka|first6=O |title=A code for behavioral inhibition on the basis of color, but not motion, in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex of macaque monkey |journal=J.

=== Attentional biasing in sensory regions ===
[[Electrophysiology]] and [[functional neuroimaging]] studies involving [[human]] subjects have been used to describe the neural mechanisms underlying attentional biasing.  Most studies have looked for activation at the 'sites' of biasing, such as in the [[visual cortex|visual]] or [[auditory cortex|auditory cortices]].  Early studies employed [[event-related potential]]s to reveal that electrical brain responses recorded over left and right visual cortex are enhanced when the subject is instructed to attend to the appropriate (contralateral) side of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hillyard|first1=SA |last2=Anllo-Vento|first2=L |title=Event-related brain potentials in the study of visual selective attention |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=781–7 |date=February 1998|pmid=9448241 |pmc=33798 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9448241 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.781|bibcode=1998PNAS...95..781H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of bloodflow-based neuroimaging techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) has more recently permitted the demonstration that neural activity in a number of sensory regions, including [[visual cortex#V4|color-]], [[visual cortex#V5|motion-]], and [[face perception|face-responsive]] regions of visual cortex, is enhanced when subjects are directed to attend to that dimension of a stimulus, suggestive of [[Gain (electronics)|gain control]] in sensory neocortex.   For example, in a typical study, Liu and coworkers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu|first1=T |last2=Slotnick|first2=SD |last3=Serences|first3=JT |last4=Yantis|first4=S |title=Cortical mechanisms of feature-based attentional control |journal=Cereb. Cortex |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1334–43 |date=December 2003|pmid=14615298 |url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14615298 |doi=10.1093/cercor/bhg080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presented subjects with arrays of dots moving to the left or right, presented in either red or green.  Preceding each stimulus, an instruction cue indicated whether subjects should respond on the basis of the colour or the direction of the dots.  Even though colour and motion were present in all stimulus arrays, fMRI activity in [[visual cortex#V4|colour-sensitive regions]] (V4) was enhanced when subjects were instructed to attend to the colour, and activity in [[visual cortex#V5|motion-sensitive regions]] was increased when subjects were cued to attend to the direction of motion.  Several studies have also reported evidence for the biasing signal prior to stimulus onset, with the observation that regions of the frontal cortex tend to come active prior to the onset of an expected stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kastner|first1=S |last2=Pinsk|first2=MA |last3=De Weerd|first3=P |last4=Desimone|first4=R |last5=Ungerleider|first5=LG |title=Increased activity in human visual cortex during directed attention in the absence of visual stimulation |journal=Neuron |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=751–61 |date=April 1999|pmid=10230795 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896-6273(00)80734-5 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80734-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connectivity between the PFC and sensory regions ===
Despite the growing currency of the 'biasing' model of executive functions, direct evidence for functional connectivity between the PFC and sensory regions when executive functions are used, is to date rather sparse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller|first1=BT |last2=d'Esposito|first2=M |title=Searching for "the top" in top-down control |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=535–8 |date=November 2005|pmid=16301170 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the only direct evidence comes from studies in which a portion of frontal cortex is damaged, and a corresponding effect is observed far from the lesion site, in the responses of sensory neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barceló|first1=F |last2=Suwazono|first2=S |last3=Knight|first3=RT |title=Prefrontal modulation of visual processing in humans |journal=Nat.

Other methods for measuring connectivity between distant brain regions, such as correlation in the fMRI response, have yielded indirect evidence that the frontal cortex and sensory regions communicate during a variety of processes thought to engage executive functions, such as working memory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gazzaley|first1=A |last2=Rissman|first2=J |last3=d'Esposito|first3=M |title=Functional connectivity during working memory maintenance |journal=Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=580–99 |date=December 2004|pmid=15849899 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=1530-7026&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=580&amp;aulast=Gazzaley |doi=10.3758/CABN.4.4.580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but more research is required to establish how information flows between the PFC and the rest of the brain when executive functions are used. As an early step in this direction, an fMRI study on the flow of information processing during visuospatial reasoning has provided evidence for causal associations (inferred from the temporal order of activity) between sensory-related activity in occipital and parietal cortices and activity in posterior and anterior PFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shokri-Kojori |first1=E |last2=Motes|first2=MA |last3=Rypma|first3=B |last4=Krawczyk|first4=DC |title=The network architecture of cortical processing in visuo-spatial reasoning |journal=Sci.

=== Bilingualism and executive functions ===
A growing body of research demonstrates that bilinguals show advantages in executive functions, specifically inhibitory control and task switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bialystok |first1=Ellen |title=Bilingualism in development: Language, literacy, and cognition |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |year=2001 |oclc=51202836 |isbn=978-0-511-60596-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref name="Carlson SM, Meltzoff AM 2008 282–298"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson|first1=SM |last2=Meltzoff|first2=AM |title=Bilingual experience and executive functioning in young children |journal=Developmental Science |volume=11 |pages=282–298 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00675.x |pmid=18333982 |issue=2 |pmc=3647884 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation for this is that speaking two languages requires controlling one's attention and choosing the correct language to speak. Across development, bilingual infants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conboy|first1=BT |last2=Sommerville|first2=JA |last3=Kuhl|first3=PK |title=Cognitive control factors in speech at 11 months |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=44 |pages=1505–1512 |year=2008 |doi=10.1037/a0012975 |pmid=18793082 |issue=5 |pmc=2562344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; children,&lt;ref name="Carlson SM, Meltzoff AM 2008 282–298" /&gt; and elderly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bialystok|first1=E |last2=Craik|first2=FIM |last3=Klein|first3=R |last4=Viswanathan|first4=M |title=Bilingualism, aging, and cognitive control: Evidence from the Simon task |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=19 |pages=290–303 |year=2004 |doi= 10.1037/0882-7974.19.2.290 |pmid= 15222822 |issue=2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.524.3897 }}&lt;/ref&gt; show a bilingual advantage when it comes to executive functioning. Bimodal bilinguals, or people who speak one oral language and one sign language, do not demonstrate this bilingual advantage in executive functioning tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emmorey |first1=K |last2=Luk |first2=G |last3=Pyers |first3=JE |last4=Bialystok |first4=E |title=The source of enhanced cognitive control in bilinguals |journal=Psychological Science |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1201–1206 |year=2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02224.x|pmid=19121123 |pmc=2677184|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:12122308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because one is not required to actively inhibit one language in order to speak the other.
Bilingual individuals also seem to have an advantage in an area known as conflict processing, which occurs when there are multiple representations of one particular response (for example, a word in one language and its translation in the individual's other language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costa |first1=A |last2=Hernandez |first2=M |last3=Sebastian-Galles |first3=N |title=Bilingualism aids conflict resolution: Evidence from the ANT task |journal=Cognition |volume=106 |pages=59–86 |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.12.013 |pmid=17275801 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the [[lateral prefrontal cortex]] has been shown to be involved with conflict processing. However, there are still some doubts. In a meta-analytic review, researchers concluded that bilingualism did not enhance executive functioning in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehtonen|first=Minna|last2=Soveri|first2=Anna|last3=Laine|first3=Aini|last4=Järvenpää|first4=Janica|last5=de Bruin|first5=Angela|last6=Antfolk|first6=Jan|date=April 2018|title=Is bilingualism associated with enhanced executive functioning in adults?

==In disease or disorder==
The study of executive function in [[Parkinson's disease]] suggests subcortical areas such as the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]] and [[basal ganglia]] are important in these processes.  [[Dopamine]] modulation of the prefrontal cortex is responsible for the efficacy of dopaminergic drugs on executive function, and gives rise to the [[Yerkes-Dodson law|Yerkes Dodson Curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leh|first1=Sandra E|last2=Petrides|first2=Michael|last3=Strafella|first3=Antonio P|title=The Neural Circuitry of Executive Functions in Healthy Subjects and Parkinson's Disease|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=16 February 2017|volume=35|issue=1|pages=70–85|doi=10.1038/npp.2009.88|issn=0893-133X|pmid=19657332|pmc=3055448}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inverted U represents decreased executive functioning with excessive arousal (or increased catecholamine release during stress), and decreased executive functioning with insufficient arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robbins|first1=T.W.|last2=Arnsten|first2=A.F.T.|title=The Neuropsychopharmacology of Fronto-Executive Function: Monoaminergic Modulation|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|date=1 January 2009|volume=32|pages=267–287|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.051508.135535|issn=0147-006X|pmid=19555290|pmc=2863127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The low activity polymorphism of [[Catechol-O-methyltransferase]] is associated with slight increase in performance on executive function tasks in healthy persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=J.

Damage to these areas may also manifest in deficits of other areas of function, such as [[motivation]], and [[social functioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szczepanski|first1=Sara M.|last2=Knight|first2=Robert T.|title=Insights into Human Behavior from Lesions to the Prefrontal Cortex|journal=Neuron|volume=83|issue=5|pages=1002–1018|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.08.011|pmid=25175878|pmc=4156912|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future directions ==
Other important evidence for executive functions processes in the prefrontal cortex have been described.  One widely cited review article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ridderinkhof|first1=KR |last2=Ullsperger|first2=M |last3=Crone|first3=EA |last4=Nieuwenhuis|first4=S |title=The role of the medial frontal cortex in cognitive control |journal=Science |volume=306 |issue=5695 |pages=443–7 |date=October 2004|pmid=15486290 |doi=10.1126/science.1100301 |bibcode=2004Sci...306..443R |hdl=1871/17182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes the role of the medial part of the PFC in situations where executive functions are likely to be engaged – for example, where it is important to detect errors, identify situations where stimulus conflict may arise, make decisions under uncertainty, or when a reduced probability of obtaining favourable performance outcomes is detected.  This review, like many others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Botvinick|first1=MM |last2=Braver|first2=TS |last3=Barch|first3=DM |last4=Carter|first4=CS |last5=Cohen|first5=JD |title=Conflict monitoring and cognitive control |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=624–52 |date=July 2001|pmid=11488380 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/108/3/624 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; highlights interactions between [[prefrontal cortex|medial and lateral PFC]], whereby posterior medial frontal cortex signals the need for increased executive functions and sends this signal on to areas in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that actually implement control. Yet there has been no compelling evidence at all that this view is correct, and, indeed, one article showed that patients with lateral PFC damage had reduced ERNs (a putative sign of dorsomedial monitoring/error-feedback)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gehring |first1=WJ |last2=Knight|first2=RT |title=Prefrontal-cingulate interactions in action monitoring |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=516–20 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10769394 |doi=10.1038/74899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – suggesting, if anything, that the direction of flow of the control could be in the reverse direction. Another prominent theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koechlin|first1=E |last2=Ody|first2=C |last3=Kouneiher|first3=F |title=The architecture of cognitive control in the human prefrontal cortex |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5648 |pages=1181–5 |date=November 2003|pmid=14615530 |doi=10.1126/science.1088545 |bibcode=2003Sci...302.1181K |citeseerx=10.1.1.71.8826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises that interactions along the perpendicular axis of the frontal cortex, arguing that a 'cascade' of interactions between anterior PFC, dorsolateral PFC, and [[premotor cortex]] guides behaviour in accordance with past context, present context, and current sensorimotor associations, respectively.

Advances in [[neuroimaging]] techniques have allowed studies of genetic links to executive functions, with the goal of using the imaging techniques as potential [[endophenotype]]s for discovering the genetic causes of executive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biol Psychol |year=2007 |title=Imaging the genetics of executive function |last1=Greene|first1=CM |last2=Braet|first2=W |last3=Johnson|first3=KA |last4=Bellgrove|first4=MA |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2007.11.009 |pmid=18178303 |volume=79 |pages=30–42 |issue=1 |hdl=10197/6121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More research is required to develop interventions that can improve executive functions and help people generalize those skills to daily activities and settings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Adele|last2=Ling|first2=Daphne S.|date=2016-04-01|title=Conclusions about interventions, programs, and approaches for improving executive functions that appear justified and those that, despite much hype, do not|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929315300517|journal=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience|series=Flux Congress 2014|volume=18|pages=34–48|doi=10.1016/j.dcn.2015.11.005|pmc=5108631|pmid=26749076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2179">The doctrine of '''exhaustion of remedies''' prevents a [[litigant]] from seeking a [[Legal remedy|remedy]] in a new [[court]] or [[jurisdiction]] until all [[Cause of action|claim]]s or remedies have been exhausted (pursued as fully as possible) in the original one. The doctrine was originally created by [[case law]] based on the principles of [[comity]].

In the [[United States]], exhaustion of remedies is applied extensively in [[administrative law]]. Many cases are handled first by [[independent agencies of the United States government]] which have primary responsibility for [[Legal case|cases]] involving the [[statute]]s or [[regulation]]s which the agency administers. 

A person's specific rights and duties depend on the federal statute involved, but here is an outline of how the doctrine works in practice.  "Exhaustion of administrative remedies" requires a person to first go to the agency which administers the statute; this process usually involves filing a petition, then going to a hearing, and finally using the agency's internal appeal process.  Once the agency's own procedures are finished, or "exhausted", then the aggrieved person can file a complaint in a federal court.  But the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies prevents parties from seeking [[relief]] in the [[court]]s first.

The same process is required under the laws of many, if not all, states.

Exhaustion of remedies frequently affects cases of [[habeas corpus]]. Federal law, for example, prevents a petitioner from seeking federal relief where the [[U.S. state|state]] claims have not yet been exhausted.{{ref|28USC2254}} Generally, the exhaustion requirement permits state courts a "...meaningful opportunity to consider the allegations of legal error." {{ref|vasquez}} 

The issue of exhaustion of remedies in a [[criminal law]] case was before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] in ''[[Harvey v. Horan]]''.

'''Franz Samuel Karpe''', {{lang-sl|'''Franc Samuel Karpe'''}}, {{lang-cs|'''František Samuel Karpe'''}} (November 17, 1747 - September 4, 1806) was a [[Slovenia]]n philosopher and rector of [[University of Olomouc]].

==Biography==
Franz Samuel Karpe was born in [[Kranj]], [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]] (nowadays [[Slovenia]]), to a townsman's family. His parents died soon and subsequently Count Lichteberg's family assumed responsibility for his upbringing and education. Karpe entered a Jesuit college in Ljubljana, which he finished in 1768.&lt;ref name="jurispr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jurisprudentia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=513&amp;Itemid=42|title=Franc Samuel Karpe |accessdate=2011-04-22|work=jurisprudentia.net|language=sl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1769 Karpe moved to Vienna, where he studied law and philosophy. He graduated university in 1773. One year later Karpe assumed position of professor of [[logic]], [[metaphysics]] and [[moral philosophy]] at the [[University of Olomouc]]. In 1777 he became the director of [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] with pay of 600 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]] a year&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The University was relocated to [[Brno]] in years 1778-1782. In Brno, Karpe taught also [[pedagogy]]. In 1781 Karpe became the university's Rector.&lt;ref name="jurispr"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16853">'''Genealogical bewilderment''' is a term referring to potential [[Identity formation|identity problem]]s that could be experienced by a child who was either [[foster care|fostered]], [[adoption|adopted]], or conceived via an [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedure such as [[surrogacy]] or gamete donation ([[egg donation|egg]] or [[sperm donation]]).

The concept was first introduced in a 1952 letter to the Journal of Mental Health by psychiatrist E. Wellisch. The term “genealogical bewilderment” was coined in 1964 by psychologist H. J. Sants, a colleague of Wellisch, referring to the plight of children who have uncertain, little, or no knowledge of one or both of their natural parents. Sants argued that genealogical bewilderment constituted a large part of the additional stress that adoptees experienced that is not experienced by children being raised by their natural parents.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shaughnessy, T. (1994). ''Adoption, social work and social theory:  Making the connections.'' Brookfield, VT: Ashgate Publishing, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, researchers Sorosky, Pannor and Baran drew upon the work of Sants to explore the concept in a number of publications, including a book titled {{cite book |title=The Adoption Triangle}}, thus bringing "genealogical bewilderment" to a larger audience.&lt;ref name="Wellisch"&gt;Wellisch, 1952, as quoted by O'Shaughnessy, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Supporting Arguments==
#[[Genealogy]] or genetic ancestry provides us with knowledge about ourselves, i.e., our heredity;
#The knowledge about ourselves that a genealogy or genetic ancestry provides is knowledge of who we really are, i.e., our [[Identity (social science)|identity]];
#Normal psychological development requires knowledge of identity;
#Normal psychological development requires knowledge of heredity.&lt;ref&gt;Leighton, K. (2012). “Addressing the harms of not knowing one's heredity: lessons from genealogical bewilderment”. “Adoption &amp; Culture, (3) 63-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these arguments is supported by E. Wellisch in his 1952 letter to the Journal of Mental Health:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Knowledge of and definite relationship to his genealogy is ... necessary for a child to build up his complete body image and world picture. It is an inalienable and entitled right of every person. There is an urge, a call, in everybody to follow and fulfill the tradition of his family, race, nation, and the religious community into which he was born. The loss of this tradition is a deprivation which may result in the stunting of emotional development."&lt;ref name="Wellisch"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These arguments are further supported by adoptee’s experience of abandonment, separation, and loss. They are no longer attached to their birth families, and so have lost a connection to their biological heritage. This loss is not considered as critical in infant adoptees, but is seen much more prominently in older adoptees. However, according to the "[[The Primal Wound|primal wound theory]]", separation from the mother results in a lack of mother-child bond and separation trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Verrier, N. (1993). The primal wound: Understanding the adopted child. Baltimore: Gateway Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family Formation==
There are three different styles of adoptive families that affect the development of adopted individuals. First, families that deny any differences between the biological family members and the adoptee. Second, families that insist on the differences between biological family members and the adoptee, going so far as to blame the adoptee’s genetics, or life before adoption for any problems. These two families experience the most difficulties across the lifespan, including grappling with feelings of genealogical bewilderment. Finally, there are families who are open about the adoptive nature of their family, openly embracing differences. This type of family is most often the most successful in raising happy, well-adjusted children who do not experience feelings of genealogical bewilderment.&lt;ref name= "Groza"&gt;Groza, V., &amp; Rosenberg, K. (2001). “Clinical and practice issues in adoption: bridging the gap between adoptees placed as infants and as older children” Westport, Conn.: Bergin &amp; Garvey.&lt;/ref&gt;

In older adoptees, as opposed to children who are adopted as infants or very young children, they have knowledge of their previous family system and their preadoptive history. These children often have the most trouble with family integration. If placed in the third type of family structure, these issues will often take care of themselves without outside intervention. If placed in either of the other two systems, integration is much more difficult; sometimes resulting in the adoption being disrupted or ended entirely.&lt;ref name= "Groza"/&gt;

There are researchers who disagree. If the quality of adoptive family relationships is sufficient to meet the child's emotional needs, knowledge of biological background should not equate good mental health; this in direct contrast to the concept of genealogical bewilderment. Adoptees with a need to search for their biological parents are often stigmatized as suffering from emotional deprivation as a result of poor relationships with their adoptive families. However, adoption reunion searches may stem from a variety of needs unrelated to the mental and emotional health and development of the adoptee. Among these may be the desire to reassert international citizenship rights as asserted and protected in the United Nations Charter on Human Rights; long-term health planning with respect to the advisability and utility of obtaining long-term biological family health histories; curiosity; and a sense of the personal and inalienable right to one's own identity, which begins with life.

==Identity Conflicts==
Some adoptees are concerned with a feeling of isolation and alienation from past generations; their adoption disrupts the continuity of generations that natural families have. This wall between the past and the present can create the perception that there is a wall between the present and the future as well. The feeling of genealogical bewilderment in these individuals is often seen as stronger during the adoptee’s marriage, birth of children, and the deaths of the adoptive parents.&lt;ref&gt;Sorosky, A. D., Baran, A. &amp; Pannor, R. (1975). “Identity conflicts in adoptees”. “American Journal of Orthopsychiatry,”(45): 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoptee identity formation is described as “ongoing resentment and immobilization stemming from a sense of powerlessness and disadvantage in relation to “regular” people; anxiety and ambivalence related to body-image, sexual relationships, and reproduction; and a driven need to experience human connectedness, described as a sense of not being really human or feeling real” as a result of not knowing their biological history.&lt;ref&gt;Brodzinsky, D.M. &amp; Schechter M.D. (1990). “The psychology of adoption”. Oxford University Press. 62–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

If these children express feelings of grief as a result of their adoption or non-traditional conception, they fear they will be labeled as “ungrateful”.&lt;ref&gt;“Adoption and loss: The hidden grief.”&lt;/ref&gt; They often feel estranged from their identities by not bearing a familial resemblance to their parents, further contributing to any feelings of genealogical bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;Telfer, J. (2000). “Why (not) looking like anybody else makes a difference: Putting the pieces together.”&lt;/ref&gt;

In older adoptees, they may have been a part of multiple family systems with vastly different dynamics and occupying different roles in each of those systems. In the biological family they may have been the oldest and the caregiver child; in the foster family they may have been the youngest and the foster child, in the adoptive family they might be in the middle and are also the adopted child. This constant change may also be compounded if the race or culture of the families they are placed with differ from their own. This upheaval contributes to the child’s genealogical bewilderment by not allowing them to establish a concrete self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Groza&lt;/ref&gt;

However, research has also shown that adoption had no negative impact on the identity formation of adopted individuals when they were adopted as infants.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, L.M., Hoopes, J.L. (1985) "Identity formation in the adopted adolescent." Child Welfare League of America, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This was not true in older adoptees.

==Behavior Problems==
In infant adoptees, behavior problems can be seen as the child comes to fully understand what adoption means- that to be chosen by their adoptive parents, their biological parents had to relinquish them. This realization can result in acting out, a common coping mechanism for grief in young children.&lt;ref&gt;Brodzinsky, D. M. (1987). “Adjustment to adoption: A psychosocial perspective.”Clinical Psychology Review, (7) 25– 47.&lt;/ref&gt; This grief continues to be significant as the child realizes that they have no access to their biological parents; this realization can grow into feelings of genealogical bewilderment.

A direct correlation has been established between the severity of behavioral problems with the age at which adoption occurs; adoptions that occur in later life with more extensive maternal deprivation have more difficulties growing up than other children. Researchers consider this maternal deprivation to disrupt the child’s [[object relations theory|object relations]], causing the difficulties.

Later childhood adoptees exhibiting behavioral problems are often expressions of unresolved internal emotional issues like the “fear of becoming attached, unresolved grief, a poor sense of identity, depression, and strong underlying feelings such as anger and fear related to past trauma.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith, S. L., Howard, J.A., &amp; Monroe, A.D. (2000). "Issues underlying behavior problems in at-risk adopted children." Children and Youth Services Review 22, (7) 539-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoptees and search/reunion issues==
According to Jones (1997), identity development presents a challenge for adoptees, especially those in closed adoptions, and describes this "genetic bewilderment" as a logical consequence of a lack of immediate knowledge of their origins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[An issue] that surfaces repeatedly in an adoptee's life is that of identity. The development of an identity is a crucial building block for self-esteem, and an adoptee's struggle to achieve a coherent story is often a daunting task. The sense of continuity, of a past and present that is necessary for identity formation (Glen, 1985/1986) is defied in mandates governing closed adoption" (p. 66).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. (1997). "Issues relevant to therapy with adoptees". ''Psychotherapy, 34(''1). 64-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Levy-Shiff (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;102) elaborated based on findings from a study on adult adoptees:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whereas previous studies have documented adoption during childhood and adolescence, the findings of the present study suggest that during adulthood as well, adoptees are at a higher risk for psychological maladjustment. Thus they were found, on average, to have a less coherent and positive self-concept and to manifest more pathological symptomatology than did nonadoptees. ...  It has been suggested (Sorosky et al., 1975; Verrier, 1987) that the difficulties in resolving a sense of coherent and positive self-identity is tied to four fundamental psychological issues: ... (4) confusion and uncertainty regarding genealogical continuity, tied to the lack of knowledge about one’s ancestors. Accordingly, the lack of ‘‘biological mutuality’’ among adoptive family members, such as shared biologically based characteristics regarding appearance, intellectual skills, personality traits, and so forth, impedes the adoptee’s ability to identify with adoptive parents. Moreover, the lack of information about one’s biological background is likely to create a ‘‘hereditary ghost’’ which may contribute to a confused, unstable, and distorted sense of self. It is possible that self development does not have closure in adolescence, especially among adoptees, but continues to evolve over the lifespan through reconciliation and integration of many complex perceptions, cognitive systems, and self-object representations. (p. 102)."&lt;ref&gt;Levy-Shiff, R. (2001). "Psychological adjustment of adoptees in adulthood: Family environment and adoption-related correlates".  ''International Journal of Behavioral Development, 25''(2) 97-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is some debate about the contribution of genealogical bewilderment to adoption searches. On other hand, Storm (1988) in the ''[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'', summarizes Humphrey and Humphrey (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, M., &amp; Humphrey, H. (1986). "A fresh look at genealogical bewilderment". ''British Journal of Medical Psychology'', '''59'''(2), 133-140.&lt;/ref&gt; who state that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The term genealogical bewilderment refers to a group of psychological problems stemming from lack of knowledge of one's ancestors. Adopted children and children conceived by artificial insemination from an anonymous donor are two examples of groups who may suffer from this problem. The literature is reviewed. Early papers suggested that not knowing about one's ancestors keeps one from developing a secure self-image. More recent work suggests that good surrogate family relationships lead to good development, regardless of the lack of information about biological ancestors, and that the drive to search out biological ancestors usually reflects poor relationships with the surrogate parents."&lt;ref&gt;Storm, J.E. (1988). ''British Journal of Medical Psychology''. LIX, 1986. [[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'', 57, 288-288. Information retrieved from [http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=paq.057.0288a PEP Web]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, in a more recent article, Affleck and Steed (2001) state:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dissatisfaction with adoptive parents was originally thought to be a motivating factor related to adoptees' searching (Sorosky, et al., 1975; Triseliotis, 1973).  However, more recent research has found that the vast majority of adoptees who search have positive relationships with adoptive parents (Pacheco &amp; Eme, 1993) or that the quality of adoptive relationships (either positive or negative) is not associated with a decision to search (Sachdev, 1993).... In fact, the most common reasons for searching given by adoptees are related to four themes: "genealogical bewilderment" (adoptees' need for historical connection to resolve identity issues); a need for information, a need to reduce stigma, and a desire to assure the [natural parents] of the adoptees' wellbeing" (p. 38).&lt;ref&gt;Affleck, M. &amp; Steed, L. (2001). "Expectations and Experiences of Participants in Ongoing Adoption Reunion Relationships: A Qualitative Study". ''[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]]'', '''71'''(1), 38-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Genealogical bewilderment has mass social relevance based on the general acceptance of the term and its meaning.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Judith and Martin Land (2011) address genealogical bewilderment as an important psychological motive for doing an adoption search, ''Adoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child'', pages 270 and 275. The uncertain state of genealogical bewilderment is a source of stress, perhaps leaving adoptees more prone to rebellion because they have no roots or foundation from which to judge their potential. Discovery of genealogical roots is a path to understanding the true inner being and potential source of psychological grounding. Exposure of this topic to a wider audience is encouraged. “Genealogical bewilderment evokes a nefarious air of uncertainty and befuddles a child’s ability to establish their true self-identity.” —Judith Land&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:GHS-pictogram-exclam.svg|thumb|The [[GHS hazard pictograms|pictogram]] for harmful substances of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.]]

The '''Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals''' ('''GHS''') is an internationally agreed-upon standard managed by the [[United Nations]] that was set up to replace the assortment of hazardous material classification and labelling schemes previously used around the world. Core elements of the GHS include standardized hazard testing criteria, universal warning pictograms, and harmonized safety data sheets which provide users of dangerous goods with a host of information. The system acts as a complement to the [[UN number|UN Numbered]] system of regulated hazmat transport. Implementation is managed through the [[United Nations Secretariat|UN Secretariat]]. Although adoption has taken time, as of 2017, the system has been enacted to significant extents in most major countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/implementation_e.html|title=GHS implementation -  Transport - UNECE|website=www.unece.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[European Union]], which has implemented the United Nations' GHS into EU law as the [[CLP Regulation]], and United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] standards.

==History==
Before the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) was created and implemented, there were many different regulations on hazard classification in use in different countries, resulting in multiple standards, classifications and labels for the same hazard. Given the $1.7 trillion per year international trade in chemicals requiring hazard classification, the cost of compliance with multiple systems of classification and labeling is significant. Developing a worldwide standard accepted as an alternative to local and regional systems presented an opportunity to reduce cost and improve compliance. &lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Guide to The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals |url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf |website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United States of America |publisher=OSHA, U.S.A. |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=English (US) |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHS development began at the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development by the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government HSE website|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/index.htm|author=Health and Safety Executive|publisher=UK Government|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[Earth Summit (1992)]] when the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), various governments and other stakeholders agreed that "A globally harmonized hazard classification and compatible labelling system, including [[material safety data sheets]] and easily understandable [[symbols]], should be available if feasible, by the year 2000".&lt;ref name=visual&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS: What's Next? {{!}} Visual.ly|url = http://visual.ly/ghs-whats-next|website = visual.ly|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal standard for all countries was to replace all the diverse classification systems; however, it is not a compulsory provision of any treaty. The GHS provides a common infrastructure for participating countries to use when implementing a hazard classification and [[Hazard Communication Standard]].&lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide" /&gt;

==Hazard classification==
The GHS classification system is a complex system with data obtained from tests, literature, and practical experience.

The main elements of the hazard classification criteria are summarized below:

===Physical hazards===
Substances or articles are assigned to 9 different [[hazard class]]es largely based on the [[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods|United Nations Dangerous Goods System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods -  Model Regulations, Rev. 19 Volume I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117032522/http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html |date=November 17, 2016 }} 2015, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, retrieved 6 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–60}} Additions and changes have been necessary since the scope of the GHS includes all target audiences.
# '''[[Explosives]]''', which are assigned to one of six subcategories depending on the type of hazard they present, as used in the UN Dangerous Goods System.
# '''Gases''' are category 1 [[flammable]] if they start to flame in a range in air at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa. Category 2 is Non flammable and non toxic gases, and category 3 is toxic gases. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the test or calculation method.
# A '''[[flammable liquid]]''' is a liquid with a [[flash point]] of not more than 93&amp;nbsp;°C.  Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of four hazard categories on the basis of the flash point and [[boiling point]]. A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.
# A '''[[flammable solids|flammable solid]]''' is one that is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.  Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into &lt;br&gt;• flammable solids, &lt;br&gt;• polymerizing substances 
# '''[[self-reactive substance|self-reactive substances]]''', are thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly [[exothermic]] thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air), other than materials classified as explosive, [[organic peroxide]]s or as [[oxidizing]].
# '''[[pyrophoric substance|pyrophoric substance]]''' more coloquially described as spontaneously combusting substances are those solids or liquids that even in small quantities are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.2. 
# '''[[Self-heating substance|Self-heating substances]]''' A self-heating solids or liquids, other than a [[pyrophoric]] substance, is one which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.
# '''Oxidizing substances and organic [[peroxide]]s ''' contain &lt;br&gt;• category 1: oxidizing substances and&lt;br&gt;• category 2: organic peroxides, organic liquids or solids that contain the bivalent -O-O- structure and may be considered a derivative of [[hydrogen peroxide]], where one or both of the [[hydrogen]] [[atoms]] have been replaced by [[Substituent|organic radicals]]. The term also includes organic peroxide formulations (mixtures). &lt;br&gt;Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of seven 'Types', A to G, on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test Series A to H.
#'''[[Toxic]] and [[infectious]] substances'''
#'''[[Radioactive]] substances''' 
# '''Substances [[corrosive]] to metal''' are substances or mixtures that by chemical action will materially damage or even destroy metals. These substances or mixtures are classified in a single hazard category on the basis of tests (Steel: ISO 9328 (II): 1991 - Steel type P235; Aluminum: ASTM G31-72 (1990) - non-clad types 7075-T6 or AZ5GU-T66). The GHS criteria are a [[corrosion]] rate on [[steel]] or [[aluminum]] surfaces exceeding 6.25&amp;nbsp;mm per year at a test temperature of 55&amp;nbsp;°C.
#'''Miscellaneous''' dangerous substances which includes environmentally dangerous substances

===Health hazards===
* '''[[Acute toxicity]]''' includes five GHS categories from which the appropriate elements relevant to transport, consumer, worker and environment protection can be selected. Substances are assigned to one of the five [[toxicity]] categories on the basis of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (oral, dermal) or LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;  (inhalation).
* '''Skin corrosion''' means the production of irreversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized corrosion category.
* '''[[Skin irritation]]''' means the production of reversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single [[irritation|irritant]] category. For those authorities, such as [[pesticide]] regulators, wanting more than one designation for skin irritation, an additional mild irritant category is provided.
* '''Serious eye damage''' means the production of tissue damage in the eye, or serious physical decay of vision, following application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which is not fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized category.
* '''Eye irritation''' means changes in the eye following the application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which are fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized hazard category.  For authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for eye irritation, one of two subcategories can be selected, depending on whether the effects are reversible in 21 or 7 days.
* '''Respiratory sensitizer''' means a substance that induces [[hypersensitivity]] of the airways following inhalation of the substance. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.
* '''Skin sensitizer''' means a substance that will induce an allergic response following skin contact. The definition for "skin [[wikt:sensitizer|sensitizer]]" is equivalent to "contact sensitizer". Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.
* '''Germ cell mutagenicity''' means an agent giving rise to an increased occurrence of [[mutations]] in populations of cells and/or organisms. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.
* '''Carcinogenicity''' means a chemical substance or a mixture of chemical substances that induce [[cancer]] or increase its incidence. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.
* '''[[Reproductive toxicity]]''' includes adverse effects on sexual function and [[fertility]] in adult males and females, as well as [[developmental toxicity]] in offspring.  Substances and mixtures with reproductive and/or developmental effects are assigned to one of two hazard categories, 'known or presumed' and 'suspected'. Category 1 has two subcategories for reproductive and developmental effects. Materials which cause concern for the health of breastfed children have a separate category: effects on or via [[Lactation]].
* '''[[Specific target organ toxicity]] (STOT) ''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/03e_part3.pdf|title=Part 3 Health Hazards| work=Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)| version=Second revised edition|publisher=United Nations| accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for [[Target Organ]] Effects.  All significant health effects, not otherwise specifically included in the GHS, that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed are included in the non-lethal target organ/systemic toxicity class (TOST). Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure.  Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories.  Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories.
* '''Aspiration hazard''' includes severe acute effects such as [[chemical pneumonia]], varying degrees of [[pulmonary injury]] or death following [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[lower respiratory system]].  Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories this hazard class on the basis of [[viscosity]].

===Environmental hazards===

* '''Acute [[aquatic toxicity]]''' means the intrinsic property of a material of causing injury to an [[aquatic organism]] in a short-term exposure. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three toxicity categories on the basis of acute toxicity data: LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ([[fish]]) or EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ([[crustacean]]) or ErC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (for [[algae]] or other [[aquatic plants]]). In some regulatory systems these acute toxicity categories may be subdivided or extended for certain sectors.
* '''Chronic aquatic toxicity''' means the potential or actual properties of a material to cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms during exposures that are determined in relation to the lifecycle of the organism. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of four toxicity categories on the basis of acute data and environmental fate data:  LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (fish) or EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (crustacea) or ErC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (for algae or other aquatic plants) and [[Environmental degradation|degradation]] or [[bioaccumulation]].

===Classification of mixtures===

The GHS approach to the classification of mixtures for health and environmental hazards is also complex.  It uses a tiered approach and is dependent upon the amount of information available for the mixture itself and for its components. Principles that have been developed for the classification of mixtures, drawing on existing systems such as the [[European Union]] (EU) system for classification of preparations laid down in [[Directive 1999/45/EC]].  The process for the classification of mixtures is based on the following steps:

# Where [[toxicological]] or [[ecotoxicological]] test data are available for the mixture itself, the classification of the mixture will be based on that data;
# Where test data are not available for the mixture itself, then the appropriate [[bridging principles]] should be applied, which uses test data for components and/or similar mixtures;
# If (1) test data are not available for the mixture itself, and (2) the bridging principles cannot be applied, then use the calculation or cutoff values described in the specific endpoint to classify the mixture.

==Testing requirements==

The GHS document does not include testing requirements for substances or mixtures.  In fact, one of the main goals of the GHS is to reduce the need for animal testing.  The GHS criteria for determining health and environmental hazards are test method neutral, allowing different approaches as long as they are scientifically sound and validated according to international procedures and criteria already referred to in existing systems.  Test data already generated for the classification of chemicals under existing systems should be accepted when classifying these chemicals under the GHS, thereby avoiding duplicative testing and the unnecessary use of test animals.  The GHS physical hazard criteria are linked to specific [[UN test methods]].  It is assumed that mixtures will be tested for physical hazards.

==Hazard communication==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Per GHS, hazards need to be communicated:{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
* in more than one form (for example, placards, labels or SDS’s).
* with [[GHS hazard statements|hazard statements]] and [[GHS precautionary statements|precautionary statements]].
* in an easily comprehensible and standardized manner.
* consistent with other statements to reduce confusion.
* taking into account all existing research and any new evidence.

Comprehensibility is challenging for a single culture and language, so global harmonization is complex. The [[GHS Purple Book]] includes a comprehensibility-testing instrument in Annex 6. Factors that were considered in developing the GHS communication tools include:{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
* Different philosophies in existing systems on how and what should be communicated;
* Language differences around the world;
* Ability to translate phrases meaningfully;
* Ability to understand and appropriately respond to [[pictograms]].

===GHS label elements===
[[File:GHS-pictogram-silhouette.svg|thumb|The symbol for substances hazardous to the human health as implemented by the GHS.]]

The standardized label elements included in the GHS are:
* '''Symbols''' ([[GHS hazard pictograms]]): Convey [[health]], physical and [[Natural environment|environmental]] hazard information, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.  Pictograms include the harmonized hazard symbols plus other graphic elements, such as borders, background patterns or cozers and substances which have target organ toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS pictograms -  Transport - UNECE|url = http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/pictograms.html|website = www.unece.org|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harmful chemicals and irritants are marked with an [[exclamation mark]], replacing the European [[saltire]]. Pictograms will have a black symbol on a white background with a red diamond frame.  For transport, pictograms will have the background, symbol and colors currently used in the ''[[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods]]''. Where a [[transport pictogram]] appears, the GHS pictogram for the same hazard should not appear.
* '''Signal words''':  "Danger" or "Warning" will be used to emphasize hazards and indicate the relative level of severity of the hazard, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.  Some lower level hazard categories do not use signal words. Only one signal word corresponding to the class of the most severe hazard should be used on a label.
* '''[[GHS hazard statement]]''': Standard phrases assigned to a [[hazard class]] and category that describe the nature of the hazard.  An appropriate statement for each GHS hazard should be included on the label for products possessing more than one hazard.

The additional label elements included in the GHS are:
* '''[[GHS precautionary statements]]''': Measures to minimize or prevent [[adverse effects]].  There are four types of precautionary statements covering: prevention, [[Chemical accidents|response in cases of accidental spillage or exposure]], storage, and disposal. The precautionary statements have been linked to each GHS hazard statement and type of hazard.
* '''[[Product identifier]]''' (ingredient disclosure): Name or number used for a hazardous product on a label or in the SDS.  The GHS label for a substance should include the [[chemical identity]] of the substance.  For mixtures, the label should include the chemical identities of all ingredients that contribute to acute toxicity, skin corrosion or serious eye damage, germ cell mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, skin or respiratory sensitization, or Systemic Target Organ Systemic (STOT), when these hazards appear on the label.
* '''Supplier identification''': The name, address and telephone number should be provided on the label.
* '''Supplemental information''': Non-harmonized information on the container of a hazardous product that is not required or specified under the GHS.  Supplemental information may be used to provide further detail that does not contradict or cast doubt on the validity of the standardized hazard information.

===GHS label format===

The GHS includes directions for application of the hazard communication elements on the label. In particular, it specifies for each hazard, and for each class within the hazard, what signal word, [[pictogram]], and hazard statement should be used. The GHS hazard pictograms, signal words and hazard statements should be located together on the label. The actual label format or layout is not specified in the GHS. National authorities may choose to specify where information should appear on the label or allow supplier discretion.  There has been discussion about the size of GHS pictograms and that a GHS pictogram might be confused with a transport pictogram or "diamond". Transport pictograms are different in appearance than the GHS pictograms. Annex 7 of the Purple Book explains how the GHS pictograms are expected to be proportional to the size of the label text so that generally the GHS pictograms would be smaller than the transport pictograms.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

===Safety data sheet===

The [[safety data sheet]] or SDS (The GHS dropped the word "material" from material safety data sheet in its final revisions) is specifically aimed at use in the workplace. It should provide comprehensive information about the chemical product that allows employers and workers to obtain concise, relevant and accurate information in perspective to the hazards, uses and [[risk management]] of the chemical product in the workplace. While there were some differences in existing industry recommendations and country specific requirements, there was agreement on a 16 section SDS to include the following headings in the order specified:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlineehssupply.com/2017/02/25/understanding-ghs-sds-sections/|title=Understanding The GHS SDS Sections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Identification
# Hazard(s) identification
# Composition/ information on ingredients
# [[First-aid]] measures
# Fire-fighting measures
# [[Chemical accidents|Accidental release measures]]
# Handling and storage
# Exposure control/ personal protection
# Physical and chemical properties
# [[chemical stability]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]
# Toxicological information
# Ecological information
# Disposal considerations
# Transport information
# Regulatory information
# Other information

The primary difference between the GHS and the international industry recommendations is that sections 2 and 3 have been reversed in order.  The GHS SDS headings, sequence and content are similar to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[European Union]] and [[ANSI]] MSDS/SDS requirements.  The SDS should provide a clear description of the data used to identify the hazards.  A table comparing the content and format of a MSDS/SDS versus the GHS SDS is provided in Appendix A of the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) GHS guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals - GHS|url = https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html#3.0|website = www.osha.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702005153/http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html#3.0|archivedate = 2007-07-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==

Current training procedures for [[Hazard Communication]] in the United States are more detailed than the GHS training recommendations.&lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide" /&gt; Educating employees on the updated chemical and product classifications and related pictograms, signal words, hazard statements and precautionary measures at the level of detail by the national authority represents the greatest training challenge.  Training will be a key component of the overall GHS approach and should incorporate information as it is introduced into the workplace.  Employees and [[emergency responders]] will need to be trained on all new program elements, from hazard statements to pictograms. Bear in mind, if the importation of products using only GHS labeling is permitted prior to its adoption in the United States and Canada, employers may need to begin employee training may need to begin earlier than expected.

==Implementation==

The [[United Nations]] goal was broad international adoption, and as of 2017, GHS has been adopted to varying degrees in nearly all major countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1514">'''Hard inheritance''' was a model of [[heredity]] that explicitly excludes any acquired characteristics, such as of [[Lamarckism]]. It is the exact opposite of [[soft inheritance]], coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] to contrast ideas about [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]].

Hard inheritance states that characteristics of an organism's offspring (passed on through [[DNA]]) will not be affected by the actions that the [[parental]] [[organism]] performs during its lifetime. For example: a medieval [[blacksmith]] who uses only his right arm to [[forge]] [[steel]] will not sire a son with a stronger right arm than left because the blacksmith's actions do not alter his genetic code. Inheritance due to usage and non-usage is excluded. Inheritance works as described in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis of evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1980). Provine, William B.; Mayr, Ernst. ed. The Evolutionary synthesis: perspectives on the unification of biology. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 1–48. {{ISBN|0-674-27225-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of inherited [[epigenetics|epigenetic variants]] has led to renewed interest in soft inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, E. J. (May 2006). "Inherited epigenetic variation—revisiting soft inheritance". [[Nature Reviews Genetics]] 7 (5): 395–401. {{doi|10.1038/nrg1834}}. {{PMID|16534512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3470">The '''Hume-Rothery rules''', named after [[William Hume-Rothery]], are a set of basic rules that describe the conditions under which an element could dissolve in a [[metal]], forming a [[solid solution]].  There are two sets of rules; one refers to substitutional solid solutions, and the other refers to [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] solid solutions.

==Substitutional solid solution rules==
For substitutional solid solutions, the Hume-Rothery rules are as follows:

# The [[atomic radius]] of the solute and [[solvent]] atoms must differ by no more than 15%:
#:&lt;math&gt; \% \mbox{ difference} = \left ( \frac{r_{solute} - r_{solvent}}{r_{solvent}} \right ) \times 100\% \le 15\%.&lt;/math&gt;
# The [[crystal structure]]s of solute and solvent must be similar.
# Complete [[solubility]] occurs when the solvent and solute have the same [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foundations of Materials Science and Engineering'', 4th ed., W. Smith and J. Hashemi, pp.139-140 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   A metal of higher valency is more likely to dissolve in a metal with lower valency.&lt;ref&gt;VALENCY  EFFECTS AND  RELATIVE SOLUBILITIES IN  TRANSITION METAL ALLOYS D.

It appears more easily-obtainable 2ndary sources say lower is likelier to dissolve in higher than this.  Two independent 2ndary sources are needed to leave this statement as is.  References in talk page.|date=January 2018}}
# The solute and solvent should have similar [[electronegativity]]. If the electronegativity difference is too great, the metals tend to form [[Intermetallics|intermetallic compounds]] instead of solid solutions.

==Interstitial solid solution rules==
For [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] solid solutions, the Hume-Rothery rules are:

# Solute atoms should have radius no larger than 59% of the radius of solvent atoms.&lt;ref&gt;https://madeeasy.in/admin/ESEGroup/12.%20ME_ESE_FST_Paper-2_Conv_2109.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slideplayer.com/slide/7666224/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slideplayer.com/slide/5866092/&lt;/ref&gt;

# They should show a wide range of composition.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} {{confusing | section | reason = this statement is either circular, or contradictory, or incomprehensible. |date=January 2018}}
# Valency factor: two elements should have the same valence. The greater the difference in valence between solute and solvent atoms, the lower the solubility.

In [[psychology]], '''illusory correlation''' is the phenomenon of perceiving a [[correlation|relationship]] between variables (typically people, events, or behaviors) even when no such relationship exists. A false association may be formed because rare or novel occurrences are more [[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]] and therefore tend to capture one's [[attention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Pelham |first1= Brett |last2= Blanton |first2= Hart |title= Conducting Research in Psychology: measuring the weight of smoke |publisher= [[Cengage Learning]] |location= Belmont, CA |edition= 4th |origyear = 2007 |year= 2013 |isbn= 978-0-495-59819-0 |pages= 11&amp;ndash;12 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aI_fiKAJbHkC&amp;pg=PA11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is one way [[stereotype]]s form and endure.&lt;ref name="MullenJohnson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mullen |first1= Brian |last2= Johnson |first2= Craig |year= 1990 |title= Distinctiveness-based illusory correlations and stereotyping: A meta-analytic integration |journal= [[British Journal of Social Psychology]] |volume= 29 |issue= 1 |pages= 11–28 |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] on behalf of the [[British Psychological Society]] |doi= 10.1111/j.2044-8309.1990.tb00883.x |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Stroessner |first1= Steven J. |last2= Plaks |first2= Jason E. |chapter= Illusory Correlation and Stereotype Formation: Tracing the Arc of Research Over a Quarter Century |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=DE-cJ8F4rSMC&amp;pg=PA247 |pages= 247&amp;ndash;259 |editor-first= Gordon B. |editor-last= Moskowitz |title= Cognitive Social Psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition |publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location= Mahwah, N.J. |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-8058-3414-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Hamilton|Rose|1980}} found that stereotypes can lead people to expect certain groups and traits to fit together, and then to overestimate the frequency with which these correlations actually occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Vivian E. |last1=Peeters|year=1983| chapter=The Persistence of Stereotypic Beliefs: a Cognitive View|title=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=10|editors= Richard P.

==History==
"Illusory correlation" was originally coined by Chapman and Chapman (1967) to describe people's tendencies to overestimate relationships between two groups when distinctive and unusual information is presented.&lt;ref name="Whitley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapman1967"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=L|title=Illusory correlation in observational report|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|volume=6|issue=1|year=1967|pages=151–155|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(67)80066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was used to question claims about objective knowledge in clinical psychology through [[Rorschach test#Illusory and invisible correlations|Chapmans' refutation]] of many clinicians' widely used Wheeler signs for homosexuality in [[Rorschach test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Loren J. and Jean P.|title=Illusory Correlation as an Obstacle to the Use of Valid Psychodiagnostic Signs|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1969|volume=74|issue=3|pages=271–80|doi=10.1037/h0027592|pmid=4896551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
David Hamilton and Robert Gifford (1976) conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated how stereotypic beliefs regarding minorities could derive from illusory correlation processes.&lt;ref name="HamiltonGifford1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=D|last2=Gifford|first2=R|title=Illusory correlation in interpersonal perception: A cognitive basis of stereotypic judgments|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=12|issue=4|year=1976|pages=392–407|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(76)80006-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test their hypothesis, Hamilton and Gifford had research participants read a series of sentences describing either desirable or undesirable behaviors, which were attributed to either Group A or Group B.&lt;ref name="Whitley"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitley|Kite|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abstract groups were used so that no previously established stereotypes would influence results. Most of the sentences were associated with Group A, and the remaining few were associated with Group B.&lt;ref name="HamiltonGifford1976" /&gt; The following table summarizes the information given.
{| class="wikitable" align="right"
|-
! Behaviors !! Group A (Majority) !! Group B (Minority) !! Total
|-
| Desirable || 18 (69%) || 9 (69%) || 27
|-
| Undesirable || 8 (30%) || 4 (30%) || 12
|-
| Total || 26 || 13 || 39
|-
|}

Each group had the same proportions of positive and negative behaviors, so there was no real association between behaviors and group membership. Results of the study show that positive, desirable behaviors were not seen as distinctive so people were accurate in their associations. On the other hand, when distinctive, undesirable behaviors were represented in the sentences, the participants overestimated how much the minority group exhibited the behaviors.&lt;ref name="HamiltonGifford1976" /&gt;

A parallel effect occurs when people judge whether two events, such as pain and bad weather, are correlated. They rely heavily on the relatively small number of cases where the two events occur together. People pay relatively little attention to the other kinds of observation (of no pain or good weather).&lt;ref name="Kunda127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunda|1999|pp=127–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plous162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Plous|1993|pp=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===General theory===
Most explanations for illusory correlation involve psychological ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]]'': information processing short-cuts that underlie many human judgments.&lt;ref name=Plous164 /&gt; One of these is ''[[availability heuristic|availability]]'': the ease with which an idea comes to mind. Availability is often used to estimate how likely an event is or how often it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Plous|1993|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in illusory correlation, because some pairings can come easily and vividly to mind even though they are not especially frequent.&lt;ref name="Plous164"&gt;{{Harvnb|Plous|1993|pp=164–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information processing===

Martin Hilbert (2012) proposes an information processing mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective observations into subjective judgments. The theory defines noise as the mixing of these observations during retrieval from memory.&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilbert|first1=Martin|title=Toward a synthesis of cognitive biases: How noisy information processing can bias human decision making|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=138|issue=2|year=2012|pages=211–237| url=http://martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf |doi=10.1037/a0025940|pmid=22122235}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, underlying cognitions or subjective judgments are identical with noise or objective observations that can lead to overconfidence or what is known as conservatism bias—when asked about behavior participants underestimate the majority or larger group and overestimate the minority or smaller group. These results are illusory correlations.

===Working-memory capacity===
In an experimental study done by Eder, Fiedler and Hamm-Eder (2011), the effects of [[Working memory|working-memory]] capacity on illusory correlations were investigated.  They first looked at the individual differences in working memory, and then looked to see if that had any effect on the formation of illusory correlations.  They found that individuals with higher working memory capacity viewed minority group members more positively than individuals with lower working memory capacity.  In a second experiment, the authors looked into the effects of [[Cognitive load|memory load]] in working memory on illusory correlations.  They found that increased memory load in working memory led to an increase in the prevalence of illusory correlations.  The experiment was designed to specifically test working memory and not substantial stimulus memory.  This means that the development of illusory correlations was caused by deficiencies in central cognitive resources caused by the load in working memory, not [[selective thinking#Biased memory|selective recall]].&lt;ref name=Eder&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eder|first1=Andreas B.|last2=Fiedler|first2=Klaus|last3=Hamm-Eder|first3=Silke|title=Illusory correlations revisited: The role of pseudocontingencies and working-memory capacity|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=64|issue=3|year=2011|pages=517–532|doi=10.1080/17470218.2010.509917|pmid=21218370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention theory of learning===
Attention theory of learning proposes that features of majority groups are learned first, and then features of minority groups.  This results in an attempt to distinguish the minority group from the majority, leading to these differences being learned more quickly. The Attention theory also argues that, instead of forming one stereotype regarding the minority group, two stereotypes, one for the majority and one for the minority, are formed.&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherman|first1=Jeffrey W.|last2=Kruschke|first2=John K.|last3=Sherman|first3=Steven J.|last4=Percy|first4=Elise J.|last5=Petrocelli|first5=John V.|last6=Conrey|first6=Frederica R.|title=Attentional processes in stereotype formation: A common model for category accentuation and illusory correlation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=96|issue=2|year=2009|pages=305–323|doi=10.1037/a0013778|pmid=19159134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of learning===
A study was conducted to investigate whether increased learning would have any effect on illusory correlations. It was found that educating people about how illusory correlation occurs resulted in a decreased incidence of illusory correlations.&lt;ref name="MurphySchmeer2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Robin A.|last2=Schmeer|first2=Stefanie|last3=Vallée-Tourangeau|first3=Frédéric|last4=Mondragón|first4=Esther|last5=Hilton|first5=Denis|title=Making the illusory correlation effect appear and then disappear: The effects of increased learning|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=64|issue=1|year=2011|pages=24–40|doi=10.1080/17470218.2010.493615|pmid=20623441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
Johnson and Jacobs (2003) performed an experiment to see how early in life individuals begin forming illusory correlations. Children in grades 2 and 5 were exposed to a typical illusory correlation paradigm to see if negative attributes were associated with the minority group. The authors found that both groups formed illusory correlations.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnston|first1=Kristen E.|last2=Jacobs|first2=Janis E.|title=Children's Illusory Correlations: The Role of Attentional Bias in Group Impression Formation|journal=Journal of Cognition and Development|volume=4|issue=2|year=2003|pages=129–160|doi=10.1207/S15327647JCD0402_01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study also found that children create illusory correlations.  In their experiment, children in grades 1, 3, 5, and 7, and adults all looked at the same illusory correlation paradigm.  The study found that children did create significant illusory correlations, but those correlations were weaker than the ones created by adults.  In a second study, groups of shapes with different colors were used. The formation of illusory correlation persisted showing that social stimuli are not necessary for creating these correlations.&lt;ref name=Primi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Primi|first1=Caterina|last2=Agnoli|first2=Franca|title=Children correlate infrequent behaviors with minority groups: a case of illusory correlation|journal=Cognitive Development|volume=17|issue=1|year=2002|pages=1105–1131|doi=10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00076-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explicit versus implicit attitudes===
Two studies performed by Ratliff and Nosek examined whether or not explicit and implicit attitudes affected illusory correlations.  In one study, Ratliff and Nosek had two groups: one a majority and the other a minority. They then had three groups of participants, all with readings about the two groups.  One group of participants received overwhelming pro-majority readings, one was given pro-minority readings, and one received neutral readings.  The groups that had pro-majority and pro-minority readings favored their respective pro groups both explicitly and implicitly.  The group that had neutral readings favored the majority explicitly, but not implicitly.  The second study was similar, but instead of readings, pictures of behaviors were shown, and the participants wrote a sentence describing the behavior they saw in the pictures presented.  The findings of both studies supported the authors' argument that the differences found between the explicit and implicit attitudes is a result of the interpretation of the covariation and making judgments based on these interpretations (explicit) instead of just accounting for the covariation (implicit).&lt;ref name="RatliffNosek2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ratliff|first1=Kate A.|last2=Nosek|first2=Brian A.|title=Creating distinct implicit and explicit attitudes with an illusory correlation paradigm|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=46|issue=5|year=2010|pages=721–728|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2010.04.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradigm structure===
Berndsen et al. (1999) wanted to determine if the structure of testing for illusory correlations could lead to the formation of illusory correlations.  The hypothesis was that identifying test variables as Group A and Group B might be causing the participants to look for differences between the groups, resulting in the creation of illusory correlations.  An experiment was set up where one set of participants were told the groups were Group A and Group B, while another set of participants were given groups labeled as students who graduated in 1993 or 1994.  This study found that illusory correlations were more likely to be created when the groups were Group A and B, as compared to students of the class of 1993 or the class of 1994.&lt;ref name="Berndsen 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berndsen|first1=Mariëtte|last2=Spears|first2=Russell|last3=Pligt|first3=Joop|last4=McGarty|first4=Craig|title=Determinants of intergroup differentiation in the illusory correlation task|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=90|issue=2|year=1999|pages=201–220|doi=10.1348/000712699161350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of '''individuation''', or '''''{{lang|la|principium individuationis}}''''',&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion |last=Reese |first=William L. |edition=1st |year=1980 |publisher=Humanities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey |isbn=0-391-00688-6 |pages=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |editor1-last= Audi |editor1-first=Robert |edition= 2nd |coauthors= |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63136-X |pages=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept appears in numerous fields and is encountered in works of [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[David Bohm]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Smith, Henry Somers-Hall (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manuel De Landa]].

==Usage==
The word ''individuation'' occurs with different meanings and connotations in different fields.

===In philosophy===
Philosophically, "individuation" expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that "is not something else". This includes how an individual person is held to be distinct from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons.

===In Jungian psychology===
In [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], also called [[analytical psychology]], individuation is the process in which the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] – seen as a developmental [[Psyche (psychology)|psychic process]] during which innate elements of personality, the components of the immature [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], and the [[Experience (disambiguation)|experience]]s of the person's life become, if the process is more or less successful, integrated over time into a well-functioning whole.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
{{See also|Analytical psychology#Self-realization and neuroticism}}

===In the media industry===
The media industry has begun using the term ''individuation'' to denote new printing and online technologies that permit [[mass customization]] of the contents of a newspaper, a magazine, a broadcast program, or a website so that its contents match each individual user's unique interests. This differs from the traditional [[mass-media]] practice of producing the same contents for all readers, viewers, listeners, or online users.

Communications theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]] alluded to this trend{{qn|date=June 2015}} when discussing{{when|date=June 2015}} the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UUMoGmujREwC&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;ots=2C5ZRF6d1W&amp;dq=mcluhan%20packaged%20information%20services&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false alluded to this trend], books.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===In physics===
Two [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]] particles cannot be understood independently. Two or more states in [[quantum superposition]], e.g., as in [[Schrödinger's cat]] being simultaneously dead and alive, is mathematically not the same as assuming the cat is in an individual alive state with 50% probability. The [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] says that [[Complementarity (physics)|complementary variables]], such as [[Position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]], cannot both be precisely known - in some sense, they are not individual variables. A ''natural criterion of individuality'' has been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=Individuation in Quantum Mechanics|journal=Foundations of Physics|date=2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=299–304|doi=10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-009-9382-x|bibcode=2011FoPh...41..299J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arthur Schopenhauer==

For Schopenhauer the principium individuationis constituted of time and space, being the ground of multiplicity.

==Carl Jung==
{{Main|Carl Jung}}
According to [[Jungian psychology]], individuation ({{lang-de|Individuation}}) is a process of psychological integration. "In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated [from other human beings]; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G.  ''Psychological Types''.  Collected Works, vol. 6, par. 757.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, [[active imagination]], or [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C.G. (1962). ''Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia'' (vol. 2). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuation has a [[Holistic health|holistic healing]] effect on the person, both mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="jung1"/&gt;

In addition to [[Complex (psychology)|Jung's theory of complexes]], his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] filled with mythic images, a non-sexual [[libido]], the general types of [[extraversion and introversion]], the compensatory and prospective functions of [[dream]]s, and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. (Shamdasani, S). (2009). ''The Red Book'', p. 208, par. 3. Verona, Italy: Mondadori Printing.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The symbols of the individuation process . . . mark its stages like milestones, prominent among them for Jungians being the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], the [[wise old man]] . . . and lastly [[Anima and animus|the anima in man and the animus]] in woman."&lt;ref&gt;Jung quoted in J. Jacobi, ''Complex, Archetype, Symbol'' (London 1959) p. 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "There is often a movement from dealing with the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] at the start . . . to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] at the second stage, to the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] as the third stage, to the anima or animus, to the [[Self]] as the final stage. Some would interpose the [[Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman|Wise Old Man and the Wise Old Woman]] as spiritual archetypes coming before the final step of the [[Self]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John, ''Subpersonalities'' (London 1990) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilbert Simondon==
{{Main|Gilbert Simondon}}
In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation.

Simondon also conceived of "pre-individual fields" which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently.

==Bernard Stiegler==
{{Main|Bernard Stiegler}}
The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. During a talk given at the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Stiegler summarized his understanding of individuation. The essential points are the following:

*The ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s acknowledge each other’s existence.
*This inheritance is an adoption, in that I can very well, as the French grandson of a German immigrant, recognize myself in a past which was not the past of my ancestors but which I can make my own. This process of adoption is thus structurally factual.
*The ''I'' is essentially a process, not a state, and this process is an in-dividuation — it is a process of psychic individuation. It is the tendency to ''become one'', that is, to become indivisible.
*This tendency never accomplishes itself because it runs into a counter-tendency with which it forms a [[Metastability|metastable equilibrium]]. (It must be pointed out how closely this conception of the dynamic of individuation is to the Freudian [[Drive theory#Psychoanalysis|theory of drives]] and to the thinking of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Empedocles]].)
*The ''we'' is also such a process (the process of collective individuation). The individuation of the ''I'' is always inscribed in that of the ''we'', whereas the individuation of the ''we'' takes place only through the individuations, polemical in nature, of the ''I''&amp;nbsp;’s which constitute it.
*That which links the individuations of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is a pre-individual system possessing positive conditions of effectiveness that  belong to what Stiegler calls retentional apparatuses. These retentional apparatuses arise from a technical system which is the condition of the encounter of the ''I'' and the ''we'' — the individuation of the ''I'' and the ''we'' is in this respect also the individuation of the technical system.
*The technical system is an apparatus which has a specific role wherein all objects are inserted — a technical object exists only insofar as it is disposed within such an apparatus with other technical objects (this is what [[Gilbert Simondon]] calls the technical group).
*The technical system is also that which founds the possibility of the constitution of retentional apparatuses, springing from the processes of [[Grammar|grammatization]] growing out of the process of individuation of the technical system. And these retentional apparatuses are the basis for the dispositions between the individuation of the ''I'' and the individuation of the ''we'' in a single process of psychic, collective, and technical individuation composed of three branches, each branching out into process groups.
*This process of triple individuation is itself inscribed within a vital individuation which must be apprehended as
**the vital individuation of natural organs,
**the technological individuation of artificial organs,
**and the psycho-social individuation of organizations linking them together.
*In the process of individuation, wherein knowledge as such emerges, there are individuations of mnemo-technological subsystems which overdetermine, ''qua'' specific organizations of what Stiegler calls tertiary retentions, the organization, transmission, and elaboration of knowledge stemming from the experience of the sensible.

'''John Armleder''' (born 1948, in [[Geneva]]) is a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] performance artist, painter, sculptor, critic, and curator. His work is based on his involvement with [[Fluxus]] in the 1960s and 1970s, when he created [[performance art]] pieces, installations and collective art activities that were strongly influenced by [[John Cage]]. However, Armleder's position throughout his career has been to avoid associating his artistic practice with any type of manifesto.

==Early life and education==
Armleder was born as the son of a hotelier (owners of [[Le Richemond]]). He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Geneva (1966-7) and at the Glamorgan Summer School, Britain (1969).

==Work==
In 1969, with Patrick Lucchini and Claude Rychner, Armleder founded the ''Groupe Ecart'' in Geneva, from which stemmed the Galerie Ecart and its associated performance group and publications. The ''Groupe Ecart'' was particularly important in [[Europe]] during the 1970s and 1980s, not only through its activity as an independent publishing house, but also because it introduced in [[Switzerland]]—and sometimes in Europe—a large number of notable artists, including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Bovier, Lionel; Cherix, Christophe; ''L’Irrésolution commune d’un engagement équivoque''; Genève : Mamco : Cabinet des estampes, 1997; {{OCLC|40323917}} (for further reading on Ecart and the early period of John Armleder's work)&lt;/ref&gt; Armleder was later associated with ''Neo-Geo'' artistic movement and was often referred to as the "darling" of the New York art critics in this period (1980s).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Bovier, Lionel; ''John Armleder''; Paris : Flammarion, 2005. {{OCLC|62363982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{En icon}} Bovier, Lionel; Radzinowicz, David; ''John Armleder''; Paris : Flammarion ; New York : Rizzoli International Publications, 2005. {{OCLC|67711312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armleder frequently examines the context in which art is displayed and views the exhibition as a medium in its own right. Since the 1990s, he has created installations, paintings, wall paintings, sculptures and what he calls ''Furniture Sculptures''—installations that usually juxtapose furniture with monochrome or abstract paintings, either literally on the furniture or on a canvas hanging nearby. His work has varied greatly in form, and has, since the beginning, used [[Randomness|chance]] as a method of producing the final forms that pieces take, much like [[John Cage]]. He often uses a dense scenographic hanging style, putting individual works into close proximity and creating installation-like exhibitions.

==Exhibitions==
In 2004, a retrospective exhibition of his works on paper was shown at the [[Kunsthalle Zürich]], Switzerland, and later traveled to the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|ICA]] in Philadelphia. In the winter of 2006-2007, a large exhibition including works from all eras of his career was shown at the [[MAMCO|Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (Mamco)]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. In April 2013, the [[Dairy Art Centre]] in [[London]] opened its doors with a large solo show paying tribute to Armleder's oeuvre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="133196">On a number of occasions throughout history, notable sporting participants have been involved in violent confrontations with spectators during a competition. This list includes events in which a spectator at a sporting event was engaged in such a confrontation with an athlete, coach or game official, either through the spectator's intrusion upon the field of play, or (as a result of such an event) a participant entering the spectator seating area. Incidents of object or snow throwing are included when it results in injuries to a match participant or causes significant delays or cancellation of the event.

It does ''not'' include incidents of [[riot]]s or other violence, often outside the event venue, which did not involve game participants.

Cobb was ejected, and he was suspended indefinitely and fined $50 for the incident. Cobb's teammates, though not fond of him, went on strike to protest the suspension prior to the May 18 game against the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia A's]]; Detroit, after being threatened with a $5‚000 fine for failing to field a team, fielded a team of college and sandlot ballplayers and two of their coaches and lost 24–2. After [[American League|League]] president [[Ban Johnson]] threatened the striking players with indefinite suspensions, the strike ended ten days later when Cobb paid his fine and urged his teammates to return to the field in exchange for his suspension being lifted.&lt;ref name="Merron"&gt;Merron, Jeff, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927560 Fighting through the years], ESPN.com, November 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Babe Ruth then charged from the dugout, swinging his fists, claiming that Cole was throwing at the Yankees, and a bench-clearing brawl broke out. After a few minutes, Ruth was ejected, but Meusel and Ruth took a detour on the way back to the clubhouse and headed to the Tiger dugout, which resulted in another bench-clearing brawl; fans invaded the field, forcing police to escort the players to safety, and numerous brawls broke out between rival fans and police on the field.

After numerous instances of drunk fans being involved in object throwing, running onto the field or [[streaking]], the situation boiled over in the 9th inning when a drunk fan ran onto the field and snatched Rangers outfielder [[Jeff Burroughs]]' cap and glove. Burroughs' teammates charged out to his aid, followed by hundreds of Cleveland fans who poured onto the field; in the ensuing chaos, Indians manager [[Ken Aspromonte]] ordered his players to grab bats and protect the Rangers from their own fans, Rangers manager [[Billy Martin]] grabbed a bat and ran into the crowd, Cleveland pitcher [[Tom Hilgendorf]] was hit in the back of the head with a metal chair, and chief umpire [[Nestor Chylak]] was hit in the head with a chair thrown from the stands and required stitches.

The Vikings protested because they believed that Pearson pushed off, which, by rule, is offensive pass interference, which would've negated the touchdown and cost the Cowboys 10 yards, but field judge [[Armen Terzian]] ruled the catch and touchdown legal, and assessed Vikings defensive tackle [[Alan Page]] a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for arguing with officials. Page was also ejected. After the kickoff, with 14 seconds left to play, Fran Tarkenton argued with officials about the controversial no-call, and encouraged fans to throw objects onto the field, then, a whiskey bottle thrown by a fan hit Terzian in the head, creating a forehead gash requiring 11 stitches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/football/cowboys/classic/webspecials/hailmary/1228hurtofficialsider.html Official hurt, but recovers], ''The Dallas Morning News'', December 29, 1975, retrieved August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Hail Mary pass#Origins]] for details.

As photographers and cameraman were all over him, the predominant and angry Añejo crowd began throwing all sorts of debris that rained on the court and play had to be stopped which led to the 65ers going to their locker room with team manager Bernabe Navarro leading the walkout.  After a bit of order was restored, PBA Commissioner [[Rudy Salud]] gave both teams 10 minutes to get back to the court but the 65ers refused to do so. They were given two 90-second ultimatums but the 65ers never came out. It was only then the Zoom Masters were declared champions by game forfeiture. Team manager Navarro later said that the decision to walkout was from his fear that something more untoward would happen if his team continued on with the game.  The 65ers were fined a total of P550,000 for the walkout.

'''Matching funds''' are funds that are set to be paid in equal amount to funds available from other sources.  Matching fund payments usually arise in situations of charity or [[Public interest|public good]]. The terms [[cost sharing]], in-kind, and matching are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Research/COSTSHARING_PROC02.html |title=University of Minnesota Policy |accessdate=2014-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable causes==
In philanthropic giving, foundations and corporations often give money to non-profit entities in the form of a '''matching gift'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantspace.org/Tools/Knowledge-Base/Funding-Resources/Corporations/Matching-gifts|title=Where can I learn more about workplace giving, like employee matching gifts?|first=|last=Grantspace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate matches often take the form of employee matching gifts, which means that if an employee donates to a nonprofit, the employee's corporation will donate money to the same nonprofit according to a predetermined match ratio (usually 1:1). For foundations, matching gifts are in the form of grants made directly to nonprofits if that the nonprofit raises a set quantity of money before the grant is bestowed. The benefit of foundation matching grants is that they provide greater incentive leverage when a nonprofit is fundraising from its constituency. If a foundation approves a 1:1 matching grant, donors know that their dollars will be doubled. On the other side, foundations who give matching grants receive assurance of the nonprofit's capacity to raise adequate funds.

For example, Dr. [[Booker T. Washington]], a famous [[African-American]] [[educator]], had a long-time friendship with [[millionaire]] [[industrialist]] [[Henry H. Rogers]], who provided him with substantial amounts of money to be applied for the betterment and education of black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Washington later wrote that Rogers had encouraged projects with at least partial matching funds'' so that two ends were accomplished: 
# The gifts would help fund even greater work. 
# Recipients would have a stake in knowing that they were helping themselves by their own hard work and sacrifice.

Using the matching funds philosophy, after Rogers's death, [[Julius Rosenwald]] and the [[Rosenwald Fund]] continued and expanded the work, eventually funding over 5,000 [[Rosenwald School]]s between 1912 and 1932. During that time, over US$4.6 million additional dollars were contributed by [[Black people|blacks]] in the communities to respond to the challenge thus presented.

In 1954, the General Electrics Foundation created the Corporate Alumni Program to match donations to the colleges and universities that employees graduated from.  This eventually broadened to other charities.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=10 Awesome Matching Gift Resources for Nonprofits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation is one of the most generous with a $25,000 match per employee or retiree. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gefoundation.com/giving-programs/matching-gifts/|title=Matching Gifts - GE Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies facilitate the process, allowing employers to match the gifts of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=10 Awesome Matching Gift Resources for Nonprofits|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A matching gift, typically a one-time charitable gift made by an employee and matched by the employer, should not be confused with an [[employer matching program]], which has to do with the employee's [[401(k)]] plan and [[retirement]].

In 2014, corporations donated $17.8 Billion to nonprofit organizations. This is a 13.7% increase over 2013 corporate giving levels. In 2010, matching gifts represented ~20% of corporate cash donations.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, over 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer an employee matching gift program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/nonprofit-matching-gifts/|title=Matching Gift &amp; Corporate Philanthropy Statistics (Updated)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the not-for-profit organisation, [[the Big Give]], have used match funding to raise over £97m for thousands of different charitable projects. The match funding is provided by a network of philanthropists and funders, called 'Champions'. Research commissioned by the Big Give shows that more people give when donations are matched (84% of surveyed respondents said they would be more likely to give if donation was matched) and people give more (one in three donors said they would give more than they usually would if do). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.thebiggive.org.uk/static/docs/A-Great+Match-EVersion.pdf|title=A Great Match|last=|first=|date=|website=www.theBigGive.org.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure funding==
In the United States, many projects in the various states and communities are partially funded with federal grants with a requirement for matching funds. For example, the [[Interstate Highway System]] was primarily built with a mix of 90% FHWA funds from the Highway Trust Fund and 10% matching state DOT funds. In some cases, borrowed money may be used to meet criteria for a matching grant; the $550 million Canadian federal government investment to connect a [[Detroit River International Crossing]] to [[Interstate 75 in Michigan]] qualifies the state for US$2 billion in US federal matching grants that can rebuild other [[Michigan]] highways even though the Canadian money is nominally a loan, to be repaid by tolls on the new bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deal reached to build new bridge to Detroit|author=Dave Battagello|publisher=Windsor Star|url=http://www.canada.com/sports/Deal+reached+build+bridge+Detroit/6791295/story.html |date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic preservation==
US federal matching grants have also funded historic preservation initiatives; a local historic property may be able to seek a 1:1 federal matching grant for specific capital projects, such as restoration of structures on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Preservation Grants|publisher=US [[National Park Service]]|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/HPG/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
In [[American politics]], the term refers to the money a [[president of the United States|presidential]] candidate is given by [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] to match the money they have raised personally. Candidates can expect up to US$250 extra from public funds for each contribution from an individual they receive.&lt;ref name="FECMatch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml |title=Public Funding of Presidential Elections |publisher=US Federal Election Commission |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222110433/http://www.cfinst.org/pr/111005.html |archivedate=February 22, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That usually applies to the two main parties; as in order for a candidate to gain the benefits of matching funds, they must raise $5,000 from 20 states during the primaries or have received 5% of the popular vote in the general election.&lt;ref name="FECMatch"/&gt; [[Pat Buchanan]], running as the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate in 2000, received matching funds despite winning only 0.4% of the vote.

The source of the funds comes from a $3 voluntary [[Presidential election campaign fund checkoff|checkoff]] on the [[US Income tax]] form. The program was established by the 1971 [[Federal Election Campaign Act]]. The law also "established overall spending limits for eligibility to receive matching funds, and provided for public funding of major party candidates in the general election for president".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Campaign Finance Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences|url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa238.html|website = www.cato.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect that these have on the candidates for presidential campaigns is to strengthen the role that the party plays in raising money.

Former New Mexico Governor [[Gary Johnson]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] candidate for president, qualified for federal matching funds in the [[2012 US presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2012/20120531_GJohnsonEligibility.shtml |title=20120531_GJohnsonEligibility |publisher=Fec.gov |date=2012-04-27 |accessdate=2012-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601010804/http://www.fec.gov/press/press2012/20120531_GJohnsonEligibility.shtml |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on June 30, 2012, [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate, [[Jill Stein]], also received enough contributions to qualify.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

On July 15, 2016, ALL Party presidential candidate, Alberto Cedeno, intentionally received no contributions to avoid qualifying for federal matching funds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Prior to a 2011 Supreme Court decision, states like Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Wisconsin were using a system that distributed "additional funding to publicly financed candidates when they face big-spending opponents or opposition groups".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court strikes Arizona’s ‘matching funds’ for publicly financed candidates|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-strikes-arizona-system-of-matching-funds-to-publicly-financed-candidates/2011/06/26/AG92xenH_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2011-06-26|access-date = 2015-11-03|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Robert|last = Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined cases, ''Arizona Free Enterprise Fund v. Bennett'' (2011) and ''[[McComish v. Bennett]]'' (2011) held that "the law impermissibly forces private candidates and independent political organizations to either restrain their spending or risk triggering matching funds to their publicly financed opponents".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Now, states and cities are considering the implementation of programs like [[New York City]]'s public financing model; public funds are used to multiply the impact of a small donor. The program is administered by the [[New York City Campaign Finance Board]], which has avoided partisan divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/Small%20Donor%20Matching%20Funds-The%20NYC%20Election%20Experience.pdf|title = Small Donor Matching Funds: The NYC Election Experience|date = 2010|accessdate = |website = Brennan Center for Justice|publisher = New York University School of Law|last = Migally|first = Angela|last2 = Liss|first2 = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs work by making each contribution worth more than their current value, thereby increasing the proportional impact of the contribution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Public Financing of Judicial Races Can Give Small Donors a Decisive Role|url = https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/civil-liberties/report/2012/12/12/47657/public-financing-of-judicial-races-can-give-small-donors-a-decisive-role/|website = name|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, for example, a $6-to-$1 program has resulted in "small dollar donors constitute the vast majority of spending in New York City elections, representing 73% of all contributions in 2013 and 80% specifically to City Council race".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New York City Partial-Public Matching Program: A Model of Successful Campaign Finance Reform|url = https://www.ced.org/blog/entry/new-york-city-partial-public-matching-program-a-model-of-successful-campaig|website = Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the Brennan Center found that "by pumping up the value of small contributions, the New York City system gives [candidates] an incentive to reach out to their own constituents rather than focusing all their attention on wealthy out-of-district donors, leading them to attract more diverse donors into the political process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/publications/DonorDiversityReport_WEB.PDF|title = Donor Diversity Through Public Matching Funds|date = May 14, 2012|accessdate = July 21, 2015|website = Brennan Center for Justice|publisher = New York University School of Law|last = Genn|first = Elisabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs of this type incentivize candidates to "fuse fundraising with voter outreach" and incentivize political engagement by communities that can afford only modest contributions. Candidates may then have more an incentive to reach out to their constituents rather than devoting their energy to financing their campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ''Election Law Journal'' found that matching funds through a multiplier has increased the proportional role of small donors as well as the number of small donors. The programs have also helped to shift the demographic and class profile of those who give. Finally, besides diluting the power of major givers, these programs led candidates to reach out and engage a more representative set of constituents during fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cfinst.org/pdf/state/NYC-as-a-Model_ELJ_As-Published_March2012.pdf|title = Small Donors, Big Democracy: New York City's Matching Funds as a Model for the Nation and States|last = Malbin|first = Michael J.|date = 2012|journal = Election Law Journal|doi = 10.1089/elj.2010.0099|pmid = |access-date = July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some dispute regarding the impact of matching funds programs like the one implemented in New York City. For example, "after implementing the public matching funds program in NYC, [the] most recent mayoral election of 2009 witnessed the lowest voter turnout it's had since the 1960's".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benefits and Inequalities of Matching Funds - CFO - Compliance|url = http://www.cfo-compliance.com/benefits-and-inequalities-of-matching-funds/|website = CFO - Compliance|accessdate = 2015-12-07|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the matching funds system benefits candidates with higher name recognition, especially if they are tied to a measure of popular support.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some have suggested that public funding actually has a negative effect on the perceptions the public has of the government, perhaps because public funding programs do not meet "the expectations set by reformers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = What Does Research Say About Public Funding for Political Campaigns|last = Primo|first = David M.|date = August 2010|journal = Institute for Justice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''meaningless statement''' posits nothing of substance with which one could agree or disagree. In the context of [[logical argument]]s, the inclusion of a meaningless statement in the premises will undermine the validity of the argument since that premise can neither be true nor false.

There are many classes of meaningless statement:

* A statement may be considered meaningless if it asserts that two categories are disjoint without proposing a criterion to distinguish between them. For example, the claim, "I wouldn't know how [[pornography]] differs from [[erotica]]" is a [[distinction without a difference]].
* A statement may be meaningless if its terms are undefined, or if it contains unbound variables. For instance, the sentence "All ''X'' have ''Y''" is meaningless unless the terms ''X'' and ''Y'' are defined (or bound).
* A grammatically correct sentence may be meaningless if it ascribes properties to particulars which admit of no such properties. For example, the famous sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" cannot be taken literally.
* An ungrammatical sentence admits of no meaning. For instance, the string of words "deities Olympus Greek reside The. upon" offers no information regarding the Greek deities, or their whereabouts.
* [[Lewis Carrol]]'s poem [[Jabberwocky]] is a famous example of the [[nonsense verse|nonsensical as literature]].

A '''meteogram''' is a graphical presentation of one or more meteorological variables with respect to time, whether observed or forecast, for a particular location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w1.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?word=meteogram|title=Glossary - NOAA's National Weather Service|last=NOAA's National Weather Service|first=|date=|website=w1.weather.gov|language=EN-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where forecast data is used, the meteogram will typically be generated directly from a [[weather forecasting]] model based on the [[longitude]], [[latitude]] and [[elevation]] of the location,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://meteograms.com|title=Meteogram Generator with Interactive Map|last=Brewer|first=Michael|website=meteograms.com|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it can also be corrected by a [[meteorologist]].  Where a meteogram is used to display historical [[weather observations]], this will typically be for a specific [[weather station]].

In the meteogram, time is plotted along the X axis, while the values of the different weather parameters are plotted along the Y axis.  The most common weather parameters in a meteogram are [[precipitation]], [[temperature]], [[air pressure]], [[cloud cover]], [[wind speed]] and [[wind direction]], such as in [https://www.yr.no/place/Norway/Rogaland/Stavanger/Stavanger/hour_by_hour_detailed.html this example meteogram] provided as part of a weather forecast by [[yr.no]].  In this example, [[wind speed]] and [[wind direction]] are conveniently presented in the form of &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[Station model#Plotted winds|wind barbs]]&lt;/span&gt;, [[precipitation]] is represented in column format, while [[temperature]] and [[air pressure]] are represented as lines.  [[Cloud cover]] is represented in a layered format, providing an indication of the amount of cloud at different heights in the [[atmosphere]].

J. H. Lambert (mathematician and scientist) and William Playfair (political economist), working in the late 1700s, used time-series plots in lieu of tables to describe data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|last=Tufte|first=Edward|publisher=Graphics Press, Cheshire, CT|year=1983|isbn=9780961392109|location=|pages=Chapter 1, especially pp. 28–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique marked the revival of a graphic display after nearly 800 years from the first known time-series use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Over the two centuries since Lambert and Playfair, time-series graphs have been used frequently to show data, or data relationships, for a variety of variables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The meteogram, also known as the meteorogram,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Meteorogram|title=Meteorogram - AMS Glossary|website=glossary.ametsoc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one application of the time-series graph.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physical Climatology|last=Landsberg|first=Helmut|publisher=Gray Printing Company, Inc., Dubois, PA|year=1941|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 2, "Climatological Elements" pp. 107-279, including Figure 61 on page 200, meteorogram showing the abrupt change in the relationship of the climatological elements temperature and relative humidity when the sea breeze occurs, with respect to time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Meteorological Analysis|last=Saucier|first=Walter|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1955|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=Chapter 12, "Local Analysis," pp. 385–399, especially Figures 12.02 and 12.03 "Meteorograms"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Climate and weather are ideally suited for display using time-series techniques because of the way the variables change with time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The meteorograph recording of weather variables "as they happen" is simply another application of time-series.  Examples are the barograph, wind, or thermograph traces, and early upper air soundings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Huschke, Ralph E., Editor, 1959, Glossary of Meteorology American Meteorological Society, Boston, MA, Definition of a "meteorogram"&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanical meteorograph, which was used to take the first atmospheric soundings above the surface, traced the data in a series of lines similar to the seismograph, became known as a meteorogram of the sounding data.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Geer, Ira W., Editor, 1996, Glossary of Weather and Climate With Related Oceanic and Hydrological Terms American Meteorological Society, Boston, MA, Definition of a "meteorogram"&lt;/ref&gt;

Saucier&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; described the use of meteorogram charts to analyze surface weather data with respect to time.  It is a simple extension to project these variables into the future using data from the forecast models and produce the modern meteogram.  So, meteograms have evolved to mean any group of meteorological variables graphed with respect to time, whether observed or forecast, usually confined to surface variables,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; though some include time-height charts.  Meteogram use increased in the 1990s with the growth of computing power.  Now meteograms are created from various models and made available to forecasters through the Internet.  In addition, researchers and operational forecasters have the capability to make meteograms for their local use on their local computing systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4353">'''Moral authority''' is authority premised on principles, or fundamental truths, which are independent of written, or positive, laws. As such, moral authority necessitates the existence of and adherence to truth. Because truth does not change, the principles of moral authority are immutable or unchangeable, although as applied to individual circumstances the dictates of moral authority for action may vary due to the exigencies of human life. These principles, which can be of metaphysical or religious nature, are considered normative for behavior, whether they are or are not also embodied in written laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/moral-authority/ Legal Definitions: Moral Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the community is ignoring or violating them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oqYtU5iObYYC&amp;pg=PA86 Richard Norris, Timothy F. Sedgwick, ''The Business of All Believers: Reflections on Leadership'' (Church Publishing, Inc. 2009 ISBN 978-1-59627119-7), p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the authoritativeness or force of moral authority is applied to the [[conscience]] of each individual, who is free to act according to or against its dictates.

Moral authority has thus also been defined as the "fundamental assumptions that guide our perceptions of the world".&lt;ref&gt; James Davison Hunter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KTiTxl-rY9AC&amp;pg=PA119 ''Culture Wars''] (Basic Books 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-46501534-4}}), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

An individual or a body of people who are seen as communicators of such principles but which does not have the physical power to enforce them on the unwilling are spoken of as having or being a moral authority. An example is the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor_en.html Full text of Veritas Splendor], English Translation. John Paul II. August 6, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, moral authority has been defined as "the capacity to convince others how the world should be", as opposed to epistemic authority, "the capacity to convince others of how the world is".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missouriwestern.edu/orgs/polanyi/TAD%20WEB%20ARCHIVE/TAD36-3/TAD36-3-fnl-pg17-30-pdf.pdf Jay A. Labinger, "Individual or Institutional Authority in Science?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing focuses==

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], traditional sources of moral authority such as church or state have been viewed with increasing suspicion in Western culture:&lt;ref&gt;S. Sims ed., ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'' (2012) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps indeed all claims to moral authority.&lt;ref&gt;Niamh Stephenson, ''Theoretical Psychology'' (2003) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of guides, entertainers; in place of ideals, stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Mosley, ''Dumbing Down'' (2000) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Expertise, or alternatively what [[Emmanuel Levinas]] called the tyranny of opinion,&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; or else an appeal to science,&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Brown, ''Imperfect Oracle'' (2009) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; may be looked to for alternative sources of moral authority; or there may be a [[postmodern]] revulsion from all [[grand narrative]]s which might ground such narratives &lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of [[moral relativism]].

Where a figure still wields some degree of moral authority, this may be attributed in large part to his modernist reticence, lack of dogma, and capacity for self-doubt&lt;ref&gt;Bernard O'Donoghue ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney'' (2009) p. 11 and p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as opposed for example to the unchallenged moral authority for centuries attributed to [[Virgil]] as a ''norma vivendi''.{{Translation needed inline}}&lt;ref&gt;M. Tudeau-Clayton, ''Jonson, Shakespeare and Early Modern Virgil'' (1998) p. 26 and p. 72-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the erosion of sources of moral authority, [[Late Modernity]] has also seen the appearance of various forms of [[fundamentalism]], from a range of religious types to [[market fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' O. J. Simpson murder case''' (officially titled '''''People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson''''') was a [[criminal trial]] held at the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] in which former [[National Football League]] (NFL) player, broadcaster, and actor [[O. J. Simpson]] was tried on two counts of murder for the June 12, 1994, deaths of his ex-wife, [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], and her friend, [[Ron Goldman]]. On the morning of June 13, 1994, they were found stabbed to death outside Brown's [[condominium]] in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] area of Los Angeles. Simpson was a [[person of interest]] in their murders. He did not turn himself in, and on June 17 he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 [[Ford Bronco]] [[SUV]] owned and driven by [[Al Cowlings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/the-simpson-case-the-fugitive-simpson-is-charged-chased-arrested.html|title=The Fugitive: Simpson Is Charged, Chased, Arrested|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=18 June 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV stations interrupted coverage of the [[1994 NBA Finals]] to broadcast the incident live.

The trial, often characterized as the [[trial of the century]] because of its international publicity similar to that of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], spanned eleven months, from the [[Juror's oath|jury's swearing-in]] on November 9, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=12 Simpson Jurors Are Sworn In : Trial: The eight-woman, four-man panel is predominantly black.

Simpson was represented by a very high-profile defense team, also referred to as the "[[Dream Team (law)|Dream Team]]", which was initially led by [[Robert Shapiro (lawyer)|Robert Shapiro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Lawyer for O.

The team also included [[F. Lee Bailey]], [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Robert Kardashian]], [[Shawn Holley]], [[Carl E. Douglas]], and [[Gerald Uelmen]]. [[Barry Scheck]] and [[Peter Neufeld]] were two additional attorneys who specialized in DNA evidence.

Deputy [[District Attorney]]s [[Marcia Clark]] and [[Christopher Darden]] believed they had a strong case against Simpson, but Cochran was able to convince the jurors that there was reason to doubt the [[DNA]] evidence provided by the State, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpson Team Taking Aim at DNA Laboratory |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= September 7, 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/07/us/simpson-team-taking-aim-at-dna-laboratory.html |accessdate=December 5, 2008 | first=Barry | last=Meier}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reasonable doubt]] theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits.&lt;ref name="usa today"&gt;{{cite news |title=List of the evidence in the O.

Simpson's celebrity status, racial issues, and the lengthy [[televised trial]] riveted national attention. By the end of the trial, national surveys showed dramatic differences in the assessment of Simpson's guilt or innocence between black and white Americans.&lt;ref name="usa today4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Race factor tilts the scales of public opinion |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 5, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns212.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediate reaction to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of [[Los Angeles County]] residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the "not guilty" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Cathleen|title=THE TIMES POLL : Most in County Disagree With Simpson Verdicts|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-08/news/mn-54801_1_times-poll|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trial, the Brown and Goldman families filed a [[civil lawsuit]] against Simpson. On February 4, 1997, the jury unanimously found Simpson responsible for both deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury unanimous: Simpson is liable|publisher=CNN |date=February 4, 1997|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/04/simpson.verdict1/index.html|accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families were awarded compensatory and punitive damages totaling $33.5 million  (${{Inflation|US|33.5|1997|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), but have received only a small portion of that.

==Background==

===Brown–Simpson marriage===
[[File:O.J. Simpson (1986)2.JPG|thumb|upright|Simpson with his daughter, Sydney, in 1986]]
[[O.J. Simpson]] and [[Nicole Brown Simpson|Nicole Brown]] were married on February 2, 1985, five years after Simpson's retirement from professional football.{{sfn|Lange|Vannatter|Moldea|1997|p=115}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/23/us/simpson-case-victim-nicole-brown-simpson-slain-dawn-better-life.html|title=The Simlson Case: The Victim; Nicole Brown Simpson: Slain At the Dawn of a Better Life|last=Rimer|first=Sara|date=1994-06-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, Sydney Brooke Simpson (b. 1985) and Justin Ryan Simpson (b. 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/new_docs/custody.html|title=Child custody decision|publisher=courttv.com| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090110000200/http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/new_docs/custody.html| archive-date =January 10, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage lasted seven years, during which time Simpson was investigated multiple times by police for [[domestic violence]] and pleaded [[no contest]] to [[spousal abuse]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 6, 1995|title=Judge Allow Evidence of Domestic Violence In O. J. Simpson Murder inside of this cases or Case|journal=Jet|volume=87|issue=13|page=51|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown filed for [[divorce]] on February 25, 1992, citing "[[irreconcilable differences]]" as the reason.{{sfn|Taylor Gibbs|1996|p=136}} Still, the abuse continued; Brown called [[9-1-1]] on 25 October 1993, crying and saying that "[Simpson] is going to beat the shit out of me".{{r|anolik201406}}

===Murders===
At 12:10&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldman|first=Ronald|title=O.J.

She had been stabbed multiple times in the head and neck, and had [[defensive wound]]s on her hands.

Robert Riske, one of the first two officers on the scene, found a single bloody glove, among other evidence.

Detectives went to Simpson's Brentwood estate to inform him that Nicole had been murdered. Detective [[Mark Fuhrman]] climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a [[search warrant]] because of exigent circumstances – specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to [[Chicago]] late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed [[Kato Kaelin]], who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found at the murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be [[probable cause]] to issue an [[arrest warrant]] for Simpson.

Simpson, while waiting in his bedroom, invited longtime friend and police officer Ron Shipp for a private discussion; Simpson jokingly told him, "To be honest, Shipp, I've had some dreams about killing her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-02/news/mn-27325_1_nicole-simpson|title=Simpson Dreamed of Killing, Witness Says: Courts: Ex-officer says he is a longtime friend of the defendant.

===Arrest of Simpson===
[[File:Mug shot of O.J. Simpson.jpg|thumb|upright|Simpson's mugshot, 17 June 1994]]
Lawyers convinced the LAPD to allow Simpson to turn himself in at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. on June 17, 1994,{{sfn|Bailey|Rabe|2008|p=87}} although the double murder charge meant that no [[bail]] would be set and a [[first-degree murder]] conviction could result in a [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penal Code Sections 187–199 |publisher=Legislative Counsel of California |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=187-199 |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512011845/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=187-199 |archivedate=May 12, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson at the police station, but he did not arrive. At 2&amp;nbsp;p.m., the LAPD issued an [[all-points bulletin]]. At 5&amp;nbsp;p.m., [[Robert Kardashian]], a friend of Simpson's and one of his defense lawyers, read a letter by Simpson to the media.{{sfn|Schuetz|Lilley|1999|p=22}} In the letter, Simpson sent greetings to 24 friends and wrote, "First everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder ... Don't feel sorry for me.

Simpson's lawyer [[Robert Shapiro (lawyer)|Robert Shapiro]] was present at Kardashian's press conference and said that Simpson's [[psychiatrist]]s agreed with the suicide note interpretation. Through television, Shapiro appealed to Simpson to surrender.&lt;ref name="30for30"/&gt;

News helicopters searched the Los Angeles highway system for Simpson's white [[Ford Bronco]].{{r|adams20160617}} At around 6:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., a motorist in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] notified police after seeing Simpson riding in the Bronco, driven by his longtime friend [[Al Cowlings|Al "A.C." Cowlings]]. The police tracked calls placed from Simpson on his cell phone. At 6:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., police officer Ruth Dixon saw the Bronco head north on [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]]. When she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out that Simpson was in the back seat of the vehicle and had a gun to his own head.&lt;ref name="30for30"/&gt; The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle{{sfn|Bailey|Rabe|2008|pp=87–88}} at {{convert|35|mph|km/h}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The Simpson Case: The Fugitive; Simpson Is Charged, Chased, Arrested | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/the-simpson-case-the-fugitive-simpson-is-charged-chased-arrested.html| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date = June 18, 1994| last =Mydans| first =Seth| accessdate =November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 20 police cars following her in the chase.&lt;ref name="jet19940704" /&gt;

More than nine news helicopters eventually joined the pursuit; the high degree of media participation caused [[Co-channel interference|camera signals to appear on incorrect television channels]].&lt;ref name="30for30"&gt;{{cite video|title=[[30 for 30]]: June 17, 1994|medium=television|people=Brett Morgen, Director|date=June 16, 2010|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chase was so long that one helicopter ran out of fuel, forcing its station to ask another for a camera feed.{{r|anolik201406}} Radio station [[KNX (AM)|KNX-AM]] also provided live coverage of the low-speed pursuit. [[University of Southern California|USC]] sports announcer Peter Arbogast and station producer Kash Limbach contacted former [[USC Trojans football|USC football]] coach [[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] to go on the air and encourage Simpson to end the pursuit. McKay agreed and asked Simpson to pull over and turn himself in instead of committing [[suicide]];{{sfn|Bailey|Rabe|2008|p=88}} "My God, we love you, Juice.

LAPD detective Tom Lange, who had previously interviewed Simpson about the murders on June 13, realized that he had Simpson's [[cell phone]] number and called him repeatedly. A colleague hooked a tape recorder up to Lange's phone and captured a conversation between Lange and Simpson in which Lange repeatedly pleaded with Simpson to "throw the gun out [of] the window" for the sake of his mother and children. Simpson apologized for not turning himself in earlier that day and responded that he was "the only one who deserved to get hurt" and was "just gonna go with Nicole."

Thousands of spectators and on-lookers packed overpasses along the procession's journey, waiting for the white Bronco.

==Trial==
[[File:Judge Lance Ito October 1995 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Judge Lance Ito presided over the trial]]
On June 20, Simpson was [[arraignment|arraigned]] and pleaded not guilty to both murders. As expected, the presiding judge ordered that Simpson be held without bail. The following day, a [[grand jury]] was called to determine whether to [[indictment|indict]] him for the two murders. Two days later, on June 23, the grand jury was dismissed as a result of excessive media coverage, which could have influenced its neutrality. Jill Shively, a Brentwood resident who testified that she saw Simpson speeding away from the area of Nicole's house on the night of the murders, told the grand jury that the Bronco almost collided with a [[Nissan]] at the intersection of Bundy and San Vicente Boulevard.&lt;ref name="true tv"/&gt; Another grand jury witness, a cutlery salesman named Jose Camacho, said he had sold Simpson a 15-inch (380&amp;nbsp; mm) German-made knife, similar to the murder weapon, three weeks before the killings.&lt;ref name="true tv"/&gt; Shively and Camacho were not presented by the [[prosecution]] at the criminal trial because they had sold their stories to the tabloid press.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; Shively had talked to the television show ''[[Hard Copy]]'' for $5,000,&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; while Camacho sold his story to the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' for $12,500.

Rather than a grand jury hearing, authorities held a probable cause hearing to determine whether or not to bring Simpson to trial. This was a minor victory for Simpson's lawyers because it would give them access to evidence as it was being presented by the prosecution in contrast to the procedure in a grand jury hearing. After a week-long court hearing, [[California Superior Court]] Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled on July 7 that there was sufficient evidence to bring Simpson to trial for the murders. At his second arraignment on July 22, when asked how he pleaded to the murders, Simpson, breaking a courtroom practice that says the accused may plead using only the words "guilty" or "not guilty," firmly stated: "Absolutely, one hundred percent, not guilty."

The prosecution decided not to seek the death penalty and instead sought a [[life sentence]]. Deputy District Attorney [[Marcia Clark]] was designated as the lead prosecutor. Deputy District Attorney [[Christopher Darden]] became Clark's co-counsel. Simpson wanted a [[speedy trial]], and the defence and prosecuting attorneys worked around the clock for several months to prepare their cases. In October 1994, Judge [[Lance Ito]] started interviewing 304 prospective jurors, each of whom had to fill out a 75-page questionnaire. On November 3, twelve jurors were seated with twelve alternates.

The trial began on January 24, 1995, and was televised by [[truTV|Court TV]], and in part by other cable and network news outlets, for 134 days. Darden argued that Simpson killed his ex-wife in a jealous rage; the prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from Nicole Brown Simpson on January 1, 1989, in which she expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling at her in the background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented including another 9-1-1 phone call that Nicole made on October 25, 1993 expressing the same thing and Simpson also could be be heard shouting in the background, less than eight months before the murders. The prosecution also presented dozens of [[expert witness]]es to place Simpson at the scene of the crime, on subjects ranging from [[DNA profiling]] to blood and shoeprint analysis.

During the opening weeks of the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Simpson had a history of physically abusing Nicole. Simpson's lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] argued that only a tiny fraction of women who are abused by their spouses are murdered. Within days after the start of the trial, lawyers and those viewing the trial from a single closed-circuit TV camera in the courtroom saw an emerging pattern: continual and countless interruptions with objections from both sides of the courtroom, as well as one [[sidebar (law)|sidebar]] conference after another with the judge, beyond earshot of the unseen jury located just below and out of the camera's frame.

==Jury selection and revolt==
According to media reports, Clark thought that women, regardless of race, would sympathize with the domestic violence aspect of the case and connect with her personally. On the other hand, the defense's research suggested that women generally were more likely to acquit than men, and that jurors did not respond well to Clark's combative style of [[litigation]]. The defense also speculated that black women would not be as sympathetic as white women to the victim, who was white, because of tensions about [[interracial marriage]]s. Both sides accepted a disproportionate number of female jurors. From an original jury pool of 40% white, 28% black, 17% Hispanic, and 15% Asian, the final jury for the trial had ten women and two men, of which there were nine blacks, two whites, and one Hispanic.&lt;ref name="usa today4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/simpson/jurypage.html |title=The O.

At the start of trial, twelve jurors and twelve alternates were selected from a pool of 250 potential jurors. Over the course of the trial ten were dismissed for a wide variety of reasons. Only four of the original jurors remained on the final panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatsports.com/top-news/a/who-was-oj-simpson-trial-jury-meet-12-people-who-found-him-not-guilty-26948|title=Who Was On The O.J.

After being [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] for 101 days, thirteen of the eighteen jurors refused to enter the courtroom until they were granted a meeting with Judge Ito.

==Prosecution case==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
The prosecution believed it had a strong case despite the lack of known witnesses to the crime and the failure to recover the murder weapon.{{sfn|Darden|1996}} Clark's case was supported by DNA evidence, and she expected a conviction. From the physical evidence that was collected, the prosecution claimed that Simpson drove to Brown's house on the evening of June 12 with the intention of killing her. They maintained that Brown had put their two children to bed and was getting ready to go to bed herself when she opened the front door of her house after either responding to a knock on the front door or hearing a noise outside. Simpson allegedly grabbed her before she could scream and attacked her with a knife. Forensic evidence from the [[Los Angeles County]] [[coroner]] alleged that Goldman arrived at the front gate to the townhouse sometime during the assault, and the assailant apparently attacked him and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while restraining him with an arm [[chokehold]]. Brown was found lying face down when authorities arrived at the crime scene. According to the prosecution's account, after Simpson had finished with Goldman, he pulled Brown's head back using her hair, put his foot on her back, and slit her throat with the knife, severing her [[carotid artery]].&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; They argued further that Simpson left a "trail of blood" from the condo to the alley behind it; there was also testimony that three drops of Simpson's blood were found on the driveway near the gate to his house on Rockingham Drive.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Proving the Case: The Science of DNA: DNA Evidence in the O.J. Simpson Trial |publisher=William Thompson |url=http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/laws131/unit3/simpson.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212205439/http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/laws131/unit3/simpson.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the prosecution, Simpson was last seen in public at 9:36&amp;nbsp;p.m. that evening when he returned to the front gate of his house with Kaelin, a bit-part actor and family friend who had been given the use of a guest house on Simpson's estate. Simpson was not seen again until 10:54&amp;nbsp;p.m. – an hour and eighteen minutes later – when he came out of the front door of his house to a waiting [[limousine]] he had hired to take him to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to fly to a [[Hertz]] convention in Chicago. The defense and prosecution both agreed that the murders took place between 10:15 and 10:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., with the prosecution alleging that Simpson had driven his Bronco during the required five minutes to and from the murder scene. They presented a witness in the vicinity of Bundy Drive who saw a car similar to Simpson's Bronco speeding away from the area at 10:35&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

Limousine driver Allan Park testified that he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24&amp;nbsp;p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, he did not see Simpson's Bronco parked at the curb. Park testified that he had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the prosecution presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jared Grimmer |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/parktest.html |title=Testimony of limo driver Allan Park in the O. J. Simpson trial |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford Street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the [[intercom]] at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limo and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the [[pager]] of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin hung up the phone and ventured outside to investigate the noises, but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property and saw Park's limo outside the Ashford gate.

At the same time Park saw Kaelin come from the back of the property to the front, he testified that directly behind Kaelin a short distance away that he saw "a tall black man" of Simpson's height and build enter the front door of the house from the driveway area, after which lights were turned on and Simpson finally answered Park's call.{{Citation needed | reason = Reliable source needed for the whole sentence |date=June 2017}} Simpson explained that he had overslept and would be at the front gate soon. Kaelin opened the Ashford gate to let Park drive the limo onto the estate grounds, and Simpson came out of his house through the front door a few minutes later. Both Kaelin and Park helped Simpson put his belongings (which were already outside the front door when Park drove up to the front of Simpson's house) into the trunk of the limo for the ride to the airport. Both Kaelin and Park remarked in their testimony that Simpson looked agitated. But other witnesses, including the ticket clerk at LAX who checked Simpson onto the plane and a flight attendant, said that Simpson looked and acted perfectly normal. Conflicting testimony such as this was to be a recurring theme throughout the trial.

Simpson's initial claim that he was asleep at the time of the murders was refuted by several different accounts. According to defense lawyer [[Johnnie Cochran]], Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential [[alibi]] witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house at the time of the murders. However, Lopez's account, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense [[cross-examination]] by Clark, when she was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's Bronco outside his house.

The defense tried to convince the jury that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders, saying that Goldman was a fit young man who put up a fierce struggle against his assailant. Simpson was a 46-year-old former professional football player with chronic [[arthritis]], and had scars on his knees from old football injuries. However, Clark produced into evidence an exercise video that Simpson made a few months before the murders titled ''O.J. Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness For Men,'' which showed that, despite some physical conditions and limitations, Simpson was anything but frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-07-19/news/9507190140_1_simpson-videotape-huizenga|title=Exercise Video Shows O.J. Squatting, Lunging, Joking|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution called Brown's sister, Denise, to the witness stand. She tearfully testified to many episodes of domestic violence in the 1980s, when she saw Simpson pick up his wife and hurl her against a wall, then physically throw her out of their house during an argument. The prosecution then called Karen Lee Crawford, the manager of the Mezzaluna restaurant where Brown ate on the night she was murdered. Crawford recounted that Brown's mother phoned the restaurant at 9:37&amp;nbsp;p.m. about a pair of lost eyeglasses. Crawford found them and put them in a white envelope. Goldman left the restaurant at 9:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. after his shift, taking the glasses to drop them off at Brown's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jodi Enda|title=Dog Led Neighbors To Body The Akita Took The Couple To The Slain Nicole Simpson.

Brown's neighbor, [[Pablo Fenjves]], testified about hearing a "very distinctive barking" and "plaintive wail" of a dog at around ten to fifteen minutes after 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. while he was at home watching the news on television. Eva Stein, another neighbor, testified about very loud and persistent barking, also at around 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., that kept her from going back to sleep. Neighbor Steven Schwab testified that while he was walking his dog in the area near Brown's house at around 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., he noticed Brown's wandering and agitated [[Akita (dog)|Akita dog]] trailing its leash. He saw that it had bloody paws, but after examining it, he found the dog uninjured. Schwab said he took the dog to a neighbor friend of his, Sukru Boztepe, before taking it into his home where it became more agitated. Boztepe took the dog for a walk at approximately 12:00 midnight and testified that it tugged on its leash and led him to Brown's house. There he discovered Brown's dead body. Minutes later, Boztepe flagged down a passing patrol car.

Riske, the first officer at the crime scene, testified that he found a barefoot woman in a black dress lying face down in a puddle of blood on the walkway that led to the front door of her house. He next saw Goldman's body a short distance away, lying on its side beside a tree and off the walkway. Riske said he saw a white envelope, which was later found to contain the glasses left at the restaurant by Brown's mother. He also saw Goldman's beeper, a black leather glove, and a dark blue knit ski cap on the ground near the bodies. The front door of Brown's house was wide open, but there were no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. Nothing inside was out of the ordinary.

On Sunday, February 12, 1995, a long motorcade traveled to Brentwood and the jurors, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and Judge Ito made a two-hour inspection of the crime scene. It was followed by a three-hour tour of Simpson's estate. Simpson was under guard by several officers but did not wear [[handcuff]]s; he waited outside the crime scene in and around an unmarked police car and was permitted to enter his house.

Detective Ron Phillips testified that when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, he sounded shocked and upset, but did not ask about how she died. Lange testified that Brown was probably killed first because the soles of her bare feet were clean, implying that she was struck down to the ground before any blood flowed. This was a key point that suggested Simpson might have set out to kill Brown, whereas Goldman appeared to have inadvertently stumbled upon the scene, prompting Simpson to kill him as well. In cross-examining Lange, Cochran proposed two [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] for what happened at the murder scene. First, he suggested that one or more drug dealers encountered Brown while looking for her friend and house guest, Faye Resnick, an admitted [[cocaine]] abuser. In the second hypothesis, Cochran suggested that "an assassin, or assassins," followed Goldman to Brown's house to kill him.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Evidence presented to the jury===

* DNA analysis of blood discovered on a pair of Simpson's socks found in his bedroom identified it as Brown's.

Defense medical expert [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Dr. Henry Lee]] of the Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory testified that the only way such a pattern could appear was if Simpson had a "hole" in his ankle, or a drop of blood was placed on the sock while it was not being worn. Lee also testified that the collection procedure of the socks could have caused contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Testimony of Dr. Henry Lee in the O.J.

* Several coins were found along with fresh blood drops behind Brown's [[condominium]], in the area where the cars were parked.
* DNA analysis of blood on a left-hand glove, found outside Brown's home, showed that it was a mixture of Simpson's, Brown's, and Goldman's blood. Although the glove was soaked in blood, there were no blood drops leading up to, or away from the glove.

* Officers found arrest records indicating that Simpson was charged in 1989 with beating Brown. Photos of Brown's bruised and battered face from that attack were shown to the court.
* Much of the incriminating evidence – bloody glove, bloody socks, blood in and on the Bronco – was discovered by LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman. He was later charged with [[perjury]] for falsely claiming during the trial that he had not used the word "[[nigger]]" within ten years of the trial. Later during the trial, with the jury absent, he invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] against [[self-incrimination]] when asked "did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/transcript.html Simpson trial transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910032810/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/transcript.html |date=September 10, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 interview, Dershowitz suggested that Detective Philip Vannatter {{ndash}} not Fuhrman {{ndash}} may have planted evidence on socks, based upon the presence of anti-coagulant in the blood discovered on the socks.&lt;ref name="FoxKelly2016-02-03"&gt;Fox News, The Kelly Files, 2016-02-03, Interview of Alan Dershowitz.&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz said that the jury may have concluded that if the bloody socks were fabricated by the police, then other evidence may have been fabricated as well.&lt;ref name=FoxKelly2016-02-03/&gt; F.B.I. expert testimony said that the defense exaggerated the significance of the presence of the anti-coagulant.&lt;ref name="FBI-Blood-socks"&gt;F.B.I.

* The bloody shoe prints at the crime scene were identified by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] shoe expert William Bodziak as having been made by a pair of extremely rare and expensive [[Bruno Magli]] shoes; only 29 pairs of this style were sold in the U.S.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; The large size 12 (305&amp;nbsp;mm) prints matched Simpson's shoe size.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; In the trial, Simpson's defense attorneys said the prosecution had no proof Simpson had ever bought such shoes. There were no witnesses who testified to selling Simpson the shoes and there wasn’t any receipts recovered that indicated he bought the shoes.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; But freelance photographer E.J. Flammer claimed to have found a photograph he had taken of Simpson in 1993 that appeared to show him wearing a pair of the shoes at a public event, which was later published in the ''National Enquirer.'' Simpson's defense team claimed that the photograph was doctored, but other pre-1994 photos appearing to show Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes were later discovered and published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=O.J. feels the heat |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985629-5,00.html |date=December 2, 1996 |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these photos were shown until late in the trial and not during the "big shoe debate".&lt;ref&gt;trial transcript&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence collected by LAPD criminalist Dennis Fung was criticized by the defense. He admitted to "having missed a few drops of blood on a fence near the bodies;" on the stand he said that he "returned several weeks afterwards to collect them."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
* Fung admitted that he had not used rubber gloves when collecting some of the evidence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; But the blood tested had no DNA from Fung, within published guidelines.
* Vannatter testified that he saw photographs of press personnel leaning on Simpson's Bronco before evidence was collected.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Evidence not presented to the jury===
* At the June 1994 grand jury hearing, Ross Cutlery provided store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) [[stiletto]] knife from salesman Jose Camacho six weeks before the murders. The knife was determined to be similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that Camacho had sold his story to the ''National Enquirer'' for $12,500.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in a manila envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating it had never been used. The police searched Simpson's estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it was in the house and it was promptly recovered.{{sfn|Schiller|Willwerth|1996}}
* Jill Shively testified to the 1994 grand jury that she saw a white Ford Bronco speeding away from Bundy Drive in such a hurry that it almost collided with another car at an intersection. She talked to the television show ''Hard Copy'' for $5,000, after which prosecutors declined to use her testimony at trial.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* A women's shelter, Sojourn, received a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, who she believed was [[stalking]] her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that Judge Ito would rule the evidence to be [[hearsay]]. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. Her friends Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* Former [[National Football League|NFL]] player and [[pastor]] [[Rosey Grier]] visited Simpson at the [[Men's Central Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]] in the days following the murders. A jailhouse guard, Jeff Stuart, testified to Judge Ito that at one point Simpson yelled to Grier that he "didn't mean to do it," after which Grier had urged Simpson to come clean. Ito ruled that the evidence was hearsay and could not be allowed in court.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* The events of the Bronco chase, and the materials in the Bronco including the cash, handgun, and disguise, were not presented to the jury. The prosecution did not cover Simpson's apparent suicide note and statement to the police.
* A few months before the 1994 murders, Simpson completed a [[film pilot]] for ''Frogmen'', an adventure series in which he starred. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]], received "a fair amount of" military training {{ndash}} including use of a knife {{ndash}} for ''Frogmen'', and holds a knife to the throat of a woman in one scene, it was not introduced as evidence during the trial.&lt;ref name="lowry20000508"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2000/may/08/entertainment/ca-27673 | title=The Saga of O.J.'s Last, Lost Pilot | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Lowry, Brian | date=May 8, 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The testimony of Lopez was recorded on videotape, but not shown to the jury.

===DNA evidence===
Samples from bloody shoe prints leading away from the bodies and from the back gate of the condo were tested for DNA matches.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Initial [[polymerase chain reaction]] testing did not rule out Simpson as a suspect. In more precise [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] tests, matches were found between Simpson's blood and blood samples taken from the crime scene (both the shoe prints in blood and the gate samples).&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Fung testified that this DNA evidence put Simpson at Brown's townhouse at the time of the murders. But defense expert [[Barry Scheck]] conducted an eight-day cross-examination questioning most of the DNA evidence. Dr. Robin Cotton, of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified for six days. Blood evidence had been tested at two separate laboratories, each conducting different tests.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; At this time, the general population was still unfamiliar with the precision and significance of DNA matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=October 14, 2017|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerged during the cross-examination of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that LAPD scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Robin |date=April 28, 1995 |title=Criminalist Assailed At Trial Of O.J.

The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt;

On May 16, Gary Sims, a [[California Department of Justice]] criminalist who helped establish their DNA laboratory, testified that a glove found at Simpson's house tested positive for a match of Goldman's blood.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt;

===Mark Fuhrman===
{{main|Mark Fuhrman}}
[[File:Mfuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Mark Fuhrman in 2008]]
In March 1995, Fuhrman testified to driving over to Simpson's house to question him on the night of the murders. After getting no response when buzzing the intercom of the house, which appeared empty, he scaled one of the outer walls to enter the property. He found blood marks on the driveway of the house, as well as a black leather glove on the premises near the location of Kaelin's bungalow. It was later found to have the blood of both murder victims on it, as well as Simpson's, matched through DNA analysis.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

Despite an aggressive cross-examination by [[F. Lee Bailey]],&lt;ref name="usa today5"&gt;{{cite news |title=Some who helped shape the O.J. Simpson case |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 28, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns182.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuhrman denied on the stand that he was racist or had used the word "nigger" to describe black people in the ten years prior to his testimony.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt; However, a few months later, the defense played audio tapes of Fuhrman repeatedly using the word – 41 times, in total. The tapes had been made between 1985 and 1994 by a young [[North Carolina]] screenwriter named Laura McKinney, who had interviewed Fuhrman at length for a screenplay she was writing on police officers. The [[Fuhrman tapes]] became one of the cornerstones of the defense's case that Fuhrman's testimony lacked credibility.

With the jury absent, Fuhrman was called back to the witness stand by the defense to answer more questions about the discovery of the blood marks and leather glove that he found on Simpson's property. When questioned by attorney [[Gerald Uelmen]], Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side, invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination and further questioning after his integrity was challenged. The prosecution told the jury in closing arguments that Fuhrman was a racist, but said that this should not detract from the factual evidence that showed Simpson's guilt.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; Fuhrman's testimony resulted in his indictment on one count of perjury; he later pleaded no contest.

Fuhrman has stated that he is not a racist and apologized for his previous use of racist language.&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; Many of his [[Ethnic minority|minority]] former coworkers have expressed support for him.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-08/news/mn-771_1_mark-fuhrman|title=Co-Workers Paint Different Portrait of Mark Fuhrman : LAPD: In contrast to racist boasts on tapes, black, Latino colleagues describe a hard-working, unbiased cop.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The glove===
One dark leather glove was found at the crime scene, with its match found near Kaelin's guest house behind Simpson's estate. Kaelin testified that he had heard "thumps in the night" in the same area around the guest house the night of the murder. Brown had bought Simpson two pairs of this type of glove in 1990. Both gloves, according to the prosecution, contained DNA evidence from Simpson, Brown and Goldman. The glove at Simpson's house also contained a long strand of blonde hair similar to Brown's.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

On June 15, 1995, Bailey goaded Darden into asking Simpson to put on the leather glove that was found at the scene of the crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try on the gloves because the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman,&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Uelmen came up with, and Cochran repeated, a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments: "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit". 

On June 22, 1995, Darden told Judge Ito of his concerns that Simpson "has [[arthritis]] and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". However, this theory was debunked by Cochran who informed Judge Ito on the record the next day that [[Shawn Chapman]] contacted the Los Angeles County Jail doctor who confirmed Simpson was taking his medication every day and that the jail’s medical records verified this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=O.J. and the Gloves: What Really Happened |url=https://ojsimpson.co/o-j-and-the-gloves-what-really-happened/
|website=ojsimpson.co |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He said Simpson “takes his medicine every day and that he has never at any time not taken his medicine for his [[rheumatoid arthritis]], sulfathiazole I think it's called, and that the records at the jail so indicate that. And I think that the record should be made clear in that regard. And we took the further statement, as I said, to talk to Dr. Johnson this morning who verifies that fact also. So I felt compelled to indicate that to the Court.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=June 23 1995 trial transcripts|url=https://simpson.walraven.org/jun23.html
|website=walraven.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; They presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.

Prosecutors claimed that the presence of Simpson's blood at the crime scene was the result of blood dripping from cuts on the middle finger of his left hand. Police had noted his wounds and asserted that these were suffered during the fatal attack on Goldman. However, the defense showed that none of the gloves retrieved at the crime scene had any cuts in them. Plus, both prosecution and defense witnesses testified that they did not see cuts or wounds of any kind on Simpson's hands in the hours after the murders took place. The defense alleged that Fuhrman may have planted the glove at Simpson's house after taking it from the crime scene. The analysis that found that the hair could be Brown's was not reliable.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; The prosecution contended that the glove had not been moved. They noted that by the time Fuhrman had arrived at the Simpson home, the crime scene at Brown's home had already been combed over by several officers for almost two hours, and none had noticed a second glove at the scene. In his first round of testimony, Fuhrman answered "no" when asked by Bailey if he had planted any evidence at Simpson's house. In his second round of testimony after the tapes had been revealed, Fuhrman took the Fifth Amendment when asked the same question by Uelmen.

In May 2008, [[Mike Gilbert (sports agent)|Mike Gilbert]], one of Simpson's former sports agents, released his book ''How I Helped O.J. Get Away with Murder'', in which he revealed that the gloves did not
fit because, on his advice, Simpson had stopped taking his arthritis medicine, which made his hands swell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0805/12/ng.01.html|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;"[[O.J.: Made in America]]", Episode 4&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2012, Darden accused Cochran of [[False evidence|tampering]] with the glove before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/09/ex-prosecutor--oj-simpson-lawyer-tampered-with-glove/1|title=Ex-prosecutor: O.J. Simpson lawyer tampered with glove|work=USA Today|accessdate=September 8, 2012|date=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz, a member of the Simpson defense team, refuted the claim, stating "the defense doesn't get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/09/ex-prosecutor--oj-simpson-lawyer-tampered-with-glove/1|title=Ex-prosecutor: O.J. Simpson lawyer tampered with glove|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial issues ===
In closing arguments, Darden ridiculed the notion that police officers might have wanted to frame Simpson.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; He questioned why, if the LAPD was against Simpson, they went to his house eight times on domestic violence calls against Brown between 1986 and 1988 but did not arrest him; they only arrested him on charges of abuse in January 1989 (when photos of Brown's face were entered into the record). Darden noted the police did not arrest Simpson for five days after the 1994 murders.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;

In Cochran's summation to the jury, he emphasized that Fuhrman was proved to have repeatedly referred to African-Americans as "niggers" and also to have boasted of beating young African-Americans in his role as a police officer. Cochran's rhetoric was later criticized by Shapiro and by at least one juror,&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; as well as Goldman's father, Fred Goldman. Cochran called Fuhrman "a [[genocide|genocidal]] racist, a perjurer, America's worst nightmare and the personification of evil".&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; Fuhrman later pleaded no contest to a felony charge of perjury, which had arisen from his testimony in Simpson's trial.

Fears grew that [[race riot]]s would erupt across Los Angeles and the rest of the country if Simpson was convicted of the murders, similar to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots in 1992]] which occurred after the acquittal of four police officers for the beating of black motorist [[Rodney King]] (King's beating was captured on an amateur video). As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were put on 12-hour shifts. The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd.

==Defense case==
[[File:JohnnieCochran 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johnnie Cochran]] in 2001]]
Simpson hired a team of high-profile defense lawyers, including Bailey, Kardashian, Shapiro, Dershowitz, Cochran, Uelmen (then the dean of law at [[Santa Clara University]]), [[Carl E. Douglas]] and [[Shawn Holley]]. Two attorneys specializing in DNA evidence, Scheck and [[Peter Neufeld]], were hired to attempt to discredit the prosecution's DNA evidence.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; They argued that Simpson was the victim of [[police fraud]] and what they termed as sloppy internal procedures, which had contaminated the DNA evidence.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; Simpson's defense was said to have cost between US$3&amp;nbsp;million and $6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="usa today6"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fight over money may follow court battle |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 28, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns183.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson's defense team, dubbed the "[[Dream Team (law)|Dream Team]]" by reporters, argued that Fuhrman had planted evidence at the crime scene. LAPD criminalists Fung and Mazzola were subject to strong scrutiny.

Simpson's defense sought to show that one or more hit men hired by drug dealers had murdered Brown and Goldman – giving both "[[Colombian necktie]]s" – because they were looking for Brown's friend, Faye Resnick, a known cocaine user who had failed to pay for her drugs. However, Judge Ito barred testimony about Resnick's drug use. She had stayed for several days at Brown's condo until entering [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] four days before the killings. Ito stated that the defense had failed to provide sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence that the scenario was possible, indicating: "I find that the [[offer of proof]] regarding motive to be highly speculative." Consequently, he prohibited Christian Reichardt from testifying about his former girlfriend Resnick's drug problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Chicago Tribune|title=Testimony On Resnick Drugs Barred|date=July 13, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Simpson Defense Presses Drug Link A Detective Faced A Barrage Of Questions.

==Verdict==
At 10:07&amp;nbsp;a.m. on October 3, 1995, Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder. The only testimony reviewed was that of limo driver Alan Park, who had said that he did not see Simpson's Bronco outside of his estate when he arrived to pick him up after the murders occurred. The jury arrived at the verdict by 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 2, after four hours of [[deliberation]], but Judge Ito postponed the announcement.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}}

Before the verdict, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] was briefed on security measures if rioting occurred nationwide due to the verdict. An estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to the verdict announcement. Long-distance telephone call volume declined by 58%, and trading volume on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] decreased by 41%. Water usage decreased as people avoided using bathrooms. So much work stopped that the verdict cost an estimated $480&amp;nbsp;million in lost productivity.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}}

The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] received a message on the verdict during [[oral arguments]], with the [[Supreme Court Justice|justices]] quietly passing the note to each other while listening to the attorney's presentation. Congressmen canceled press conferences, with one telling reporters, "Not only would you not be here, but I wouldn't be here, either".&lt;ref name="duggan19951004"&gt;{{cite news | title=Washington Comes to a Stop; Then Pent-Up Emotions Start Spilling Out | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 4, 1995 | accessdate=January 28, 2012 | author=Duggan, Paul | page=A1 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-856074.html |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to the verdict===
In post-trial interviews, a few of the jurors said that they believed Simpson probably did commit the murders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jurors say evidence made the case for Simpson |publisher=CNN |date=October 4, 1995 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/daily/9510/10-04/jurors_speak/index.html |accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Three jurors together wrote and published a book called ''Madam Foreman,''{{sfn|Cooley|Bess|Rubin-Jackson|Byrnes|1996}} in which they described how their perception of police errors, not race, led to their verdict. They said that they considered Darden to be a [[Tokenism|token black]] assigned to the case by the prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt;

Critics of the jury's not-guilty verdict contended that the deliberation time was unduly short in comparison to the length of the trial. Some said that the jurors, most of whom did not have any college education, did not understand the forensic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Matthew |last=Hutson |title=Unnatural Selection |journal=[[Psychology Today]] |date=March–April 2007 |url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-20070302-000001&amp;page=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071012133039/http://psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-20070302-000001&amp;page=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict was read, juror number six, 44-year-old Lionel Cryer, gave Simpson a [[raised fist|black power raised fist]] salute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/03/usa.garyyounge|title=Gary Younge: OJ Simpson and America, ten years after the trial|author=Gary Younge|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Cryer was a former member of the revolutionary nationalist [[Black Panther Party]] that prosecutors had "inexplicably left on the panel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/us/not-guilty-overview-jury-clears-simpson-double-murder-spellbound-nation-divides.html|title=Jury Clears Simpson in Double Murder; Spellbound Nation Divides on Verdict|date=October 4, 1995|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cochran wrote and published a book about the trial. It was titled ''Journey to Justice,'' and described his involvement in the case.{{sfn|Cochran|1997}} That same year, fellow defense attorney Shapiro also published a book about the trial, entitled ''The Search for Justice.'' He criticized Bailey as a "loose cannon" and Cochran for bringing race into the trial.{{sfn|Shapiro|Warren|1996}} In contrast to Cochran's book, Shapiro said that he does not believe that Simpson was framed by the LAPD for racial reasons, but believed the verdict was correct due to reasonable doubt.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt;

Clark published a book about the case titled ''Without a Doubt'' (1998).{{sfn|Clark|1998}} Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.

Former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney [[Vincent Bugliosi]] wrote a book titled ''[[Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder]]'' (1997). Bugliosi was very critical of Clark and Darden, faulting them, among other reasons, for not introducing the note that Simpson had written before trying to flee. He contended that the note "reeked" of guilt and that the jury should have been allowed to see it. He also noted that the jury was never informed about items found in the Bronco. The prosecution said that they felt these items of evidence would bring up emotional issues on Simpson's part that could harm their case, despite the fact that the items seemed as though they could be used for fleeing.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's domestic abuse; that the prosecution should have presented evidence contrary to the defense's assertion that Simpson was a leader in the black community; and criticized the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution for trying the murder in Los Angeles rather than Santa Monica.&lt;ref name="bugliosi"/&gt; During the jury selection process, the defense made it difficult for the prosecution to challenge potential black jurors, on the grounds that it is illegal to dismiss someone from the jury for racially motivated reasons. (California courts barred [[peremptory challenge]]s to jurors based on race in ''People v. Wheeler'',&lt;ref&gt;22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; years before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] would do so in ''[[Batson v. Kentucky]]'').&lt;ref&gt;476 U.S. 79 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

District Attorney Garcetti's supporters noted that the decision to move the trial was made by the Los Angeles Superior Court Presiding Judge, and not by Garcetti. The trial was moved due to security concerns at the smaller facility and the poor physical condition of the Santa Monica Courthouse.&lt;ref name="bugliosi"&gt;{{cite news |title= Bugliosi vs. Garcetti: Author Opens Fire on District Attorney | newspaper=Metropolitan News Enterprise|date=June 7, 2010|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/perspectives060710.htm |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 review, the ''[[Metropolitan News-Enterprise]]'' said that Garcetti had "[[micromanagement|micromanaged]]" the trial, and that he had decided to have Simpson try on the gloves in open court that had been recovered at the murder scene and at Simpson's estate. Also, pundits criticized the prosecution for calling Fuhrman to the witness stand in the first place; they criticized the prosecution for lack of due diligence, which should have discovered his earlier racist statements. The D.A.'s office argued that the defense would have called Fuhrman anyway and that no one knew of the existence of the McKinney tapes until after the trial started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Garcetti Draws Criticism for 'Micromanagement,' the Glove Debacle, the Fuhrman Fiasco | newspaper=Metropolitan News Enterprise|date=June 22, 2010 |url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/perspectives062210.htm |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussion of the racial elements of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of the police and the courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African-Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the [[civil lawsuit|civil verdict]] against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated.&lt;ref name="usa today4"/&gt; An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' reported that most black people now think Simpson was guilty.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |title= Most Black People Now Think O.J. Was Guilty | website=FiveThirtyEight|date=June 6, 2016 |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-black-people-now-think-oj-simpson-was-guilty/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 poll, 83% of white Americans and 57% of black Americans believe Simpson was guilty of the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/25/black-and-white-americans-can-now-agree-o-j-was-guilty/ |title=Two decades later, black and white Americans finally agree on O.J.

==Media coverage==
{{quote|When the trial began, all of the networks were getting these hate-mail letters because people's soap operas were being interrupted for the Simpson trial. But then what happened was the people who liked soap operas got addicted to the Simpson trial. And they got really upset when the Simpson trial was over, and people would come up to me on the street and say, 'God, I loved your show.'|Marcia Clark, 2010{{r|anolik201406}}}}

The murders and trial – "the biggest story I have ever seen", said a producer of NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' – received extensive media coverage from the very beginning; at least one [[instant book]] was proposed two hours after the bodies were found, and scheduled to publish only a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' covered the case on its front page for more than 300 days after the murders. The [[Big Three television networks]]' nightly news broadcasts gave more air time to the case than to the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] combined. The media outlets served an enthusiastic audience; one company put the loss of national productivity from employees following the case instead of working at $40&amp;nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Schuetz|Lilley|1999|pp=22–23}} ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' aired many skits on the trial, and the Dancing Itos – a troupe of dancers dressed as the judge – was a popular recurring segment.&lt;ref name="dancing its"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Dancing It's | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPVA2bGsB4&amp;t=2m | series=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno | network=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in the case received much media coverage. Fans approached Clark at restaurants and malls, and when she got a new hairstyle during the trial, the prosecutor received a standing ovation on the courthouse steps; ''[[People magazine|People]]'' approved of the change, but advised her to wear "more fitted suits and tailored skirts". While Cochran, Bailey, and Dershowitz were already well known, others like Kaelin became celebrities, and Resnick and Simpson's girlfriend [[Paula Barbieri]] appeared in ''[[Playboy magazine|Playboy]]''. Those involved in the trial followed their own media coverage; when [[Larry King]] appeared in the courtroom after a meeting with Ito, both Simpson and Clark praised [[Larry King Live|King's talk show]]. Interest in the case was worldwide; [[Russia]]n president [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s first question to President Clinton when they met in 1995 was, "Do you think O.J. did it?".&lt;ref name="anolik201406"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Anolik |first=Lili |date=June 2014 |title=How O. J. Simpson Killed Popular Culture |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/oj-simpson-trial-reality-tv-pop-culture |magazine=Vanity Fair |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether or not to allow any video cameras into the courtroom was among the first issues Judge Ito had to decide, ultimately ruling that live camera coverage was warranted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/oj/interviews/arenella.html FRONTLINE: the o.j. verdict: interviews: Peter arenella]. PBS. Retrieved December 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ito would be later criticized for this decision by other legal professionals. Dershowitz said that he believed that Ito, along with others related to the case such as Clark, Fuhrman, and Kaelin, was influenced to some degree by the media presence and related publicity. The trial was covered in 2,237 news segments from 1994 through 1997.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}} Ito was also criticized for allowing the trial to become a media circus and not doing enough to regulate the court proceedings as well as he could have.&lt;ref name="USA today3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Fujisaki was able to keep trial in control | newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 5, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns200.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' became the subject of a [[media scandal]]. Commentators found that its staff had used [[photo manipulation]] to darken the photo, and speculated it was to make Simpson appear more menacing. After the publication of the photo drew widespread criticism of racist editorializing and [[yellow journalism]], ''Time'' publicly apologized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/photo_database/image/darkened_mug_shot/ O.J.'s Darkened Mug Shot].

==Aftermath==
In the February 1998 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Simpson was quoted as saying, "Let's say I committed this crime… Even if I did this, it would have to have been because I loved her very much, right?"&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/17/news/mn-9193&lt;/ref&gt;  

In April 1998, Simpson did an interview with talk show host [[Ruby Wax]]. As a joke, Simpson shows up at her hotel room, and waved a banana about his head, as if it were a knife, and pretended to stab Ruby with it. The footage soon made its way onto the US TV networks, causing predictable outrage.

===Civil trial===
In 1996, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo, the parents of Ron Goldman, filed a civil suit against Simpson for [[wrongful death]], while Brown's estate, represented by her father Lou Brown,&lt;ref name="usa today6"/&gt; brought suit against Simpson in a "survivor suit." The trial took place over four months in Santa Monica and, by judge's order, was not televised.&lt;ref name="USA today3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usa today1"/&gt; The Goldman family was represented by [[Daniel Petrocelli]], with Simpson represented by Bob Baker.&lt;ref name="usa today1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Both legal teams given high marks | newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 5, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns201.htm |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorneys for both sides were given high marks by observing lawyers.&lt;ref name="usa today1"/&gt; Simpson's defense in the trial was estimated to cost $1&amp;nbsp;million and was paid for by an insurance policy on his company, Orenthal Enterprises.&lt;ref name="usa today6"/&gt;

Fuhrman was not called to testify, and Simpson was [[subpoena]]ed to testify on his own behalf.&lt;ref name="usa today2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usa today4"/&gt; In addition, a photo of Simpson, taken while he was attending a [[Buffalo Bills]] game in 1993, was presented at trial that showed him wearing Bruno Magli shoes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/1997-01-06/us/9701_06_simpson_1_robert-groden-bruno-magli-shoes-photos?_s=PM:US | publisher=CNN | title=Photo expert resumes testimony in Simpson trial | date=December 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same type of shoes which investigators said the killer of Goldman and Brown was wearing when the murders were committed.&lt;ref name=ojcnn&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/1997-01-23/us/9701_23_shoe.sales_1_maglis-shoes-oj?_s=PM:US | publisher=CNN | title=Not much new in O.J. videotape | date=May 26, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was presented as evidence against him, as Simpson had previously denied ever wearing such shoes.&lt;ref name=ojcnn /&gt;

The jury in the civil trial awarded Brown and Simpson's children, Sydney and Justin (Brown's only children), $12.6&amp;nbsp;million from their father as recipients of their mother's estate.&lt;ref name="usa today2"/&gt; The victims' families were awarded $33.5&amp;nbsp;million in compensatory and punitive damages, thereby finding Simpson "responsible" for the respective murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/o-j-simpson |title=Black Biography: O. J.

Four years after the trial, at an auction to pay some of the money in the compensation order, [[Bob Enyart]], a conservative [[Christian radio]] host, paid $16,000 for some of Simpson's memorabilia, including his [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] induction certificate, two jerseys, and two trophies he was given for charity work. Enyart took the items outside the courthouse where the auction was held, burned the certificate and jerseys, and smashed the trophies with a sledgehammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67474539.html HighBeam]{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/281454.stm|title=OJ memorabilia torched|publisher=BBC News|date=February 18, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''If I Did It''===
{{Main|If I Did It}}
In November 2006, [[ReganBooks]] announced a book ghostwritten by [[Pablo Fenjves]] based on interviews with Simpson titled ''If I Did It'', an account which the publisher said was a hypothetical confession. The book's release was planned to coincide with a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] special featuring Simpson. "This is a historic case, and I consider this his confession", publisher [[Judith Regan]] told the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5KT79AKsn?url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/ap/story_pf.asp?ID=1475260 Publisher Calls Book O.J.'s 'Confession'], AP, November 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, [[News Corporation]], parent company of ReganBooks and Fox, canceled both the book and the TV interview due to a high level of public criticism. CEO [[Rupert Murdoch]], speaking at a press conference, stated: "I and senior management agree with the American public that this was an ill-considered project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6167420.stm |title=Murdoch cancels OJ Simpson plans|publisher= BBC News|date= November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the Goldman family was awarded rights to the book to partially satisfy the civil judgment against Simpson. The title of the book was changed to ''If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.'' On the front cover of the book, the title was stylized with the word "If" to appear much smaller than those of "I Did It", and placed inside the "I", so unless looked at very closely, the title of the book reads "I Did It: Confessions of the Killer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.J.

Due to the change in phrasing, these comments were interpreted by many as being a form of [[confession]], which stirred strong reactions in print media and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OJ Simpson lost interview | url = https://www.9news.com.au/world/2018/03/12/16/18/oj-simpson-lost-confession-2006-interview-video | publisher = 9News | date = 12 March 2018 | accessdate = March 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Snierson |first1=Dan |title=O.J.

Simpson has participated in two high-profile interviews regarding the case – one in 1996 with [[Ross Becker]], which outlines Simpson's side of the story, as well as a guided tour of his estate, where evidence used in the trial was found.

Simpson said, "If she hadn't opened that door with a knife in her hand... she'd still be alive." This, Gilbert said, confirmed his belief that Simpson had confessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0805/12/ng.01.html|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;"[[O.J.: Made in America]]", Episode 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the LAPD announced a knife had been found in 1998 buried at Simpson's estate, when the buildings were razed. A construction worker had given the knife to a police officer, who, believing the case had been closed, did not submit it as evidence at the time. Forensic tests demonstrated that the knife was not related to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/35948459 | title=Knife found at OJ Simpson home not a murder weapon | date=April 1, 2016 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be argued that the presence of Kardashian on Simpson's legal team, combined with the press coverage of the trial, would ultimately be the catalyst for the ongoing popularity of the [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian family]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-oj-simpson-gave-us-the-kardashians&lt;/ref&gt; While Kardashian's ex-wife [[Kris Jenner]] was already married to former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalist [[Bruce Jenner]] at the time of the trial, Kardashian's family was mostly out of the public eye before the trial, only becoming famous due to the trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2016/02/the_relationship_between_oj_simpson_and_the_kardashians_a_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other theories==
Although no one else was charged, and evidence points to Simpson's guilt, the murders continue to be the subject of research and speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afrocentricnews.com/html/simpson.html|work=AfroCentric News Features|title=
The O.J. Simpson Affair: More &amp; Better Conspiracy Theories|author=Coleman, A.G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Detective [[William Dear (detective)|William Dear]] conducted a lengthy investigation, and his evidence and conclusions, among those of other experts (e.g., Dr. Henry Lee&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=O.J.: The Real Untold Story|author=BBC|date=2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/954700.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who have reviewed the crime, trial, and evidence, were addressed in the [[BBC]] documentary, ''O.J.: The True Untold Story'' (2000). The documentary, produced by Malcolm Brinkworth, claims that the police and prosecution had contaminated or planted evidence pointing to Simpson as the killer, and ignored [[exculpatory evidence]]. Furthermore, it asserts that the state too hastily eliminated other possible suspects, including Simpson's elder son Jason, and individuals linked to the [[illegal drug trade]], in which Brown, Goldman, and Resnick allegedly participated.{{sfn|Dear|2012}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC TV|title=''O.J.

Alternative theories of the murders, supposedly shared by Simpson, have suggested they were related to the Los Angeles drug trade,&lt;ref name="Bailey book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=F. Lee|last2=Rabe|first2=Jean|authorlink1=F.

Simpson himself has stated in numerous interviews that he believes the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders at the time were carried out for the same reason. Brown, Simpson believed, had been planning to open a restaurant using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna Trattoria, where she ate her last meal, and where both Nigg and Goldman had worked, was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood.&lt;ref name="Bailey book"/&gt;

[[Brett Cantor]], part-owner of the Dragonfly nightclub in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], was found stabbed to death in his nearby home on July 30, 1993;&lt;ref name="Variety obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=A&amp;R exec Cantor slain|url=https://variety.com/1993/biz/news/a-r-exec-cantor-slain-109236/|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 3, 1993|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; no suspects have ever been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McRady|first=Rachel|title=Rose McGowan Tells All in New Memoir 'Brave': 14 Shocking Allegations|url=https://www.etonline.com/rose-mcgowan-tells-all-new-memoir-brave-14-shocking-allegations-95401|newspaper=[[Entertainment Tonight|ET Online]]|date=January 30, 2018|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case gained renewed attention a year later when [[O.J. Simpson]]'s defense team successfully petitioned the court trying him for the murders of [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], his ex-wife, and [[Ronald Goldman]], for access to the case file, on the grounds that the way in which all three were stabbed suggested the same killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noble|first=Kenneth|title=Simpson's Attempt to Bar Evidence Is Turned Down|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/22/us/simpson-s-attempt-to-bar-evidence-is-turned-down.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 22, 1994|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Goldman had worked for Cantor as a waiter, and Nicole Simpson was a regular at Dragonfly, some books about the case have raised the possibility that the three killings may also have resulted from involvement in drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=F.

[[Murder of Michael Nigg|Michael Nigg]], an aspiring actor and waiter at a Los Angeles restaurant, was shot and killed during an attempted robbery on 8 September 1995 while withdrawing money from an ATM.&lt;ref name="Michael Nigg death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Goldman Friend Slain Resisting Robbery|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/438329/GOLDMAN-FRIEND-IS-SLAIN-RESISTING-ROBBERY.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 12, 1995|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three suspects were arrested a month later but released for lack of evidence and the case remains unsolved. Since Nigg was a friend of [[Ronald Goldman]], with whom he had worked, and seemed to live quite well for someone in his position, leading to some reports that he was involved in drug trafficking, his death has been used to support theories that the murders of Goldman and O.J. Simpson's ex-wife Nicole the year before were drug-related as well.

In 2012, several links between the killings and convicted murderer [[Glen Edward Rogers]] were alleged in the documentary film ''[[My Brother the Serial Killer]]'', which was broadcast on [[Investigation Discovery]] (ID). Clay Rogers, Glen's brother, recounts Glen talking about how he had met Brown and was "going to take her down" a few days before the murders happened in 1994. When the murder case was under process, Van Nuys ADA Lea D'Argostino came to know about a written statement from Glen revealing he had met Brown. The information was forwarded to Simpson's prosecutors, but was ignored. Much later, in his years-long correspondence with [[criminal profiler]] Anthony Meolis, Glen also wrote about and created paintings pointing towards his involvement with the murders. During a personal prison meeting between the two, Glen said he was hired by Simpson to break into Brown's house and steal some expensive jewelry, and that Simpson had told him: "you may have to kill the bitch". In a filmed interview, Glen's brother Clay asserts that his brother confessed his involvement.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Dan|title=Serial Killer Murdered Nicole Brown Simpson, New Documentary Claims|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/serial-killer-oj-simpson-murdered-nicole-brown-simpson/story?id=17765728|accessdate=1 January 2014|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers' family stated that he had informed them that he had been working for Nicole in 1994 and that he had made verbal threats about her to them. Rogers would later speak to a criminal profiler about the Goldman-Simpson murders, providing details about the crime and remarking that he had been hired by O. J. Simpson to steal a pair of earrings and potentially murder Nicole.

"The Shocking Case of O.J. Simpson", released September 29, 2017, was episode 10 of season 2 of [[BuzzFeed]] web series, ''[[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]: and discussed those theories.

===Stephen Singular===

New York Times best selling author and journalist Stephen Singular was approached about the O.J. Simpson murder case a few weeks after the murders from an anonymous source within the [[LAPD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= OJ Simpson: Framed in America

|website=theunredacted.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Singular’s source gave him multiple, specific pieces of information regarding the Simpson case. The source told him about an LAPD detective named [[Mark Fuhrman]] and that he had a history of [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and planting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= OJ Simpson: Framed in America
|url=https://theunredacted.com/oj-simpson-framed-in-america/

Rosa Lopez, a housekeeper for Simpson’s next door neighbor, testified to hearing men’s voices coming from the yard of the Rockingham estate at around midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= February 27, 1995 OJ trial transcript |location=Los Angeles, California |date= February 27, 1995

The families of Brown and Goldman expressed anger at the premise of ''My Brother the Serial Killer'', with both families dismissing the claims by the Rogers family.&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman enraged by Discovery documentary; O.J.

ID's president, Henry Schlieff, replied that the documentary's intention was not to prove that Rogers had committed the crimes, but to "give viewers new facts and let them make up their own minds," and that he believed that Simpson was guilty of the murders.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite web|title=O.J.

Rapper [[Eminem]] referenced the murders in his 1999 song "[[Role Model (song)|Role Model]]", saying, "Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole, When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold. Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold, Killed them both and smeared blood in a white Bronco (We Did It)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trshady.com/eminem-songs/8-role-model "Eminem - Role Model"].

The 2002 song "[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (Good Charlotte song)|Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]", by American punk-pop band [[Good Charlotte]] includes the lyrics, "You know if you're famous you can kill your wife? There's no such thing as 25 to life, as long as you got the cash to pay for Cochran", in reference to the "Not Guilty" verdict which, many believe, wouldn't have been the case if Simpson hadn't appointed Cochran as his lead attorney.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Rapper [[Jay Z]] also referenced the trial in a song named ''The Story Of O.J'' which revolves around the case and the influence of systematic racism on the trial.

Hip hop artist [[Magneto Dayo]] released a 2013 "[[diss track]]" song titled "OJ Simpson" in which he insults his ex-girlfriend/artist [[V-Nasty]], by referencing the Simpson murder case. The song's lyrics were also added to the ''[[Houston Press]]''{{'}} list of "The 15 Most Messed-Up O.J. Simpson Lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Chris (June 13, 2014).

The suit Simpson wore when he was acquitted on October 3, 1995 was donated by Simpson's former agent [[Mike Gilbert]] to the [[Newseum]] in 2010. The Newseum has multiple trial related items in their collection, including press passes, newspapers and the mute button that Superior Court Judge [[Lance Ito]] used when he wanted to shut off the live microphone in court so lawyers could talk privately during the trial. The museum's acquisition of the suit ended the legal battle between Gilbert and Fred Goldman, both of whom claimed the right to the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artdaily.com/news/37797/OJ-Simpson-Acquittal-Suit-Arrives-at-Newseum-in-DC-#.WvdND--FN9M]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">The '''Optional Prisoner's Dilemma''' (OPD) game models a situation of conflict involving two players in [[game theory]]. It can be seen as an extension of the standard [[prisoner's dilemma]] game, where players have the option to "reject the deal", that is, to abstain from playing the game.&lt;ref name="cardinot1"&gt;{{Cite book |first1 = Marcos |last1= Cardinot | first2 = Maud |last2= Gibbons |first3= Colm |last3= O'Riordan |first4= Josephine |last4= Griffith | chapter = Simulation of an Optional Strategy in the Prisoner’s Dilemma in Spatial and Non-spatial Environments | doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-43488-9_14 | title = From Animals to Animats 14 | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 9825 | pages = 145-156 | year = 2016 | isbn =  978-3-319-43487-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of game can be used as a model for a number of real world situations in which agents are afforded the third option of abstaining from a game interaction such as an election. &lt;ref name="batali"&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = John |last1= Batali |first2= Philip |last2= Kitcher |year= 1995 |title= Evolution of altriusm in optional and compulsory games |journal = [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |pages = 161–171| volume= 175 |issue= 2 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1995.0128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payoff matrix==

The structure of the Optional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from the standard prisoner's dilemma game setting. In this way, suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to "Cooperate", "Defect" or "Abstain". &lt;ref name="cardinot2"&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Marcos |last1= Cardinot |first2= Colm |last2= O'Riordan |first3= Josephine |last3= Griffith |chapter= The Optional Prisoner's Dilemma in a Spatial Environment: Coevolving Game Strategy and Link Weights |doi=10.5220/0006053900860093 | title = ECTA | series = Proceedings of the 8th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence |pages = 86-93 |volume=1  |year= 2016  | isbn=978-989-758-201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[payoff matrix]] for the game is shown below:

* If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for mutual cooperation.
* If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''.
* If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''.
* Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.
* If one or both players abstain, both receive the loner's payoff ''L''.

The following condition must hold for the payoffs:

''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''L'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

'''Ousterhout's dichotomy''' is [[computer scientist]] [[John Ousterhout]]'s categorization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcl.tk/doc/scripting.html |title=Scripting: Higher Level Programming for the 21st Century |accessdate=2011-10-09 |author=Ousterhout, John |date= March 1998|work=IEEE Computer magazine |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[high-level programming language]]s tend to fall into two groups, each with distinct properties and uses: ''[[system programming]] languages'' and ''[[scripting language]]s'' – compare [[programming in the large and programming in the small]]. This distinction underlies the design of his language [[Tcl]].

System programming languages (or ''applications languages'') usually have the following properties:
* They are [[static typing|typed statically]]
* They support creating complex [[data structure]]s
* Programs in them are compiled into [[machine code]]
* Programs in them are meant to operate largely independently of other programs
System programming languages tend to be used for components and applications with large amounts of internal functionality such as operating systems, database servers, and Web browsers.  These applications typically employ complex algorithms and data structures and require high performance. Prototypical examples of system programming languages include [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Modula-2]].

By contrast, scripting languages (or ''[[glue language]]s'') tend to have the following properties:
* They are [[dynamic typing|typed dynamically]]
* They have little or no provision for complex data structures
* Programs in them (''scripts'') are [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]]
Scripting languages tend to be used for applications where most of the functionality comes from other programs (often implemented in system programming languages); the scripts are used to ''glue'' together other programs or add additional layers of functionality on top of existing programs.  Ousterhout claims that scripts tend to be short and are often written by less sophisticated programmers, so execution efficiency is less important than simplicity and ease of interaction with other programs.  Common applications for scripting include Web page generation, report generation, graphical user interfaces, and system administration. Prototypical examples of scripting languages include [[AppleScript]], [[C shell]], [[DOS]] [[batch file]]s, and [[Tcl]].

==History==
The dichotomy was fully set out in {{Harvtxt|Ousterhout|1998}}, though Ousterhout had drawn this distinction since at least the design of Tcl (1988), and had stated it publicly at various times. An early episode was "[http://www.vanderburg.org/OldPages/Tcl/war/ The Tcl War]" of late September and October 1994, where [[Richard Stallman]] posted an article critical of Tcl, entitled "Why you should not use Tcl",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Why you should not use Tcl |last=Stallman |first=Richard |date=1994-09-23 |newsgroup=comp.lang.tcl |message-id=9409232314.AA29957@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.tcl/7JXGt-Uxqag/3JBTj5I43yAJ |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Ousterhout replied with an articulation of his dichotomy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Re: Why you should not use Tcl |last=Ousterhout |first=John |date=1994-09-26  |newsgroup=comp.lang.tcl |message-id=367307$1un@engnews2.Eng.Sun.COM |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.tcl/7JXGt-Uxqag/vQNLEgvjmWsJ |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
I think that Stallman's objections to Tcl may stem largely from one aspect of Tcl's design that he either doesn't understand or doesn't agree with. This is the proposition that you should use *two* languages for a large software system: one, such as C or C++, for manipulating the complex internal data structures where performance is key, and another, such as Tcl, for writing small-ish scripts that tie together the C pieces and are used for extensions.}}

==Criticism==
Many {{who|date=May 2012}} believe that the dichotomy is highly arbitrary, and refer to it as ''Ousterhout's fallacy'' or ''Ousterhout's false dichotomy''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While strong-versus-weak typing, data structure complexity, and independent versus stand-alone might be said to be unrelated features, the usual critique of Ousterhout's dichotomy is of its distinction of compiling versus interpreting, since neither semantics nor syntax depend significantly on whether code is compiled into machine-language, interpreted, tokenized, or byte-compiled at the start of each run, or any mix of these. Many languages fall between being interpreted or compiled (e.g. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[UCSD Pascal]], [[Perl]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]). This makes compiling versus interpreting a dubious parameter in a taxonomy of programming languages.

In [[mathematics]], a '''partial differential equation''' ('''PDE''') is a [[differential equation]] that contains beforehand unknown [[Multivariable calculus|multivariable functions]] and their [[partial derivative]]s. PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a [[computer model]]. A special case is [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs), which deal with [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of a single variable and their [[derivative]]s.

PDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as [[sound]], [[heat]], [[diffusion]], [[electrostatics]], [[electrodynamics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], or [[quantum mechanics]]. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional [[dynamical system]]s, partial differential equations often model [[multidimensional system]]s. PDEs find their generalisation in [[stochastic partial differential equation]]s.

== Introduction ==
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are equations that involve rates of change with respect to [[continuous variables]]. The position of a [[rigid body]] is specified by six parameters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9PLbcYd9aUC&amp;pg=PA32|title=Modelling and Control of Robot Manipulators|last=Sciavicco|first=Lorenzo|last2=Siciliano|first2=Bruno|date=2001-02-19|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781852332211|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the configuration of a [[fluid]] is given by the [[continuous distribution]] of several parameters, such as the [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and so forth. The dynamics for the rigid body take place in a finite-dimensional [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]; the dynamics for the fluid occur in an infinite-dimensional configuration space. This distinction usually makes PDEs much harder to solve than ordinary differential equations (ODEs), but here again, there will be simple solutions for linear problems. Classic domains where PDEs are used include [[acoustics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[heat transfer]].

A partial differential equation (PDE) for the function {{math|''u''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,… ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is an equation of the form

: &lt;math&gt;f \left (x_1, \ldots x_n; u, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}, \ldots \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_n}; \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1 \partial x_1}, \ldots \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n}; \ldots \right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|f}} is a [[linear function]] of {{mvar|u}} and its derivatives, then the PDE is called linear. Common examples of linear PDEs include the [[heat equation]], the [[wave equation]], [[Laplace's equation]], [[Helmholtz equation]], [[Klein–Gordon equation]], and [[Poisson's equation]].

A relatively simple PDE is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x,y) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This relation [[Logical implication|implies]] that the function {{math|''u''(''x'',''y'')}} is independent of {{mvar|x}}. However, the equation gives no information on the function's dependence on the variable {{mvar|y}}. Hence the general solution of this equation is

: &lt;math&gt;u(x,y) = f(y),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|f}} is an arbitrary function of {{mvar|y}}. The analogous ordinary differential equation is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} u}{\mathrm{d} x}(x) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which has the solution

: &lt;math&gt;u(x) = c,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|c}} is any [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] value. These two examples illustrate that general solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) involve arbitrary constants, but solutions of PDEs involve arbitrary functions. A solution of a PDE is generally not [[Uniqueness quantification|unique]]; additional conditions must generally be specified on the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the region where the solution is defined. For instance, in the simple example above, the function {{math|''f''(''y'')}} can be determined if {{mvar|u}} is specified on the line {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.

== Existence and uniqueness ==
Although the issue of existence and uniqueness of solutions of ordinary differential equations has a very satisfactory answer with the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]], that is far from the case for partial differential equations. The [[Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem]] states that the [[Cauchy problem]] for any partial differential equation whose coefficients are [[Analytic function|analytic]] in the unknown function and its derivatives, has a locally unique analytic solution. Although this result might appear to settle the existence and uniqueness of solutions, there are examples of linear partial differential equations whose coefficients have derivatives of all orders (which are nevertheless not analytic) but which have no solutions at all: see [[Lewy's example|Lewy (1957)]]. Even if the solution of a partial differential equation exists and is unique, it may nevertheless have undesirable properties.  The mathematical study of these questions is usually in the more powerful context of [[weak solution]]s.

An example of pathological behavior is the sequence (depending upon {{mvar|n}}) of [[Cauchy problem]]s for the [[Laplace equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

with [[boundary condition]]s

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} u(x,0) &amp;= 0, \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}(x,0) &amp;= \frac{\sin nx}{n}, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|n}} is an integer. The derivative of {{mvar|u}} with respect to {{mvar|y}} approaches zero [[uniform convergence|uniformly]] in {{mvar|x}} as {{mvar|n}} increases, but the solution is

: &lt;math&gt;u(x,y) = \frac{\sinh ny \sin nx}{n^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This solution approaches infinity if {{mvar|nx}} is not an integer multiple of {{pi}} for any non-zero value of {{mvar|y}}. The Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation is called ''ill-posed'' or ''not [[Well-posed problem|well-posed]]'', since the solution does not continuously depend on the data of the problem. Such ill-posed problems are not usually satisfactory for physical applications.

The existence of solutions for the [[Navier–Stokes equations]], a partial differential equation, is part of one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].

== Notation ==
In PDEs, it is common to denote partial derivatives using subscripts. That is:

: &lt;math&gt;u_x = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;u_{xx} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;u_{xy} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y\, \partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y } \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Especially in physics, [[del]] or nabla ({{math|∇}}) is often used to denote spatial derivatives, and {{math|''u&amp;#x307;'', ''ü''}} for time derivatives. For example, the [[wave equation]] (described below) can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot u=c^2\nabla^2u&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot u=c^2\Delta u&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Δ}} is the [[Laplace operator]].

== Classification ==
Some linear, second-order partial differential equations can be classified as [[parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic]], [[hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] and [[elliptic partial differential equation|elliptic]]. Others, such as the [[Euler–Tricomi equation]], have different types in different regions. The classification provides a guide to appropriate initial and boundary conditions and to the smoothness of the solutions.

=== Equations of first order ===

{{main|First-order partial differential equation}}

=== Linear equations of second order ===
Assuming {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''u&lt;sub&gt;yx&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the general linear second-order PDE in two independent variables has the form

: &lt;math&gt;Au_{xx} + 2Bu_{xy} + Cu_{yy} + \cdots \mbox{(lower order terms)} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}}, {{mvar|C}}... may depend upon {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. If {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}} over a region of the {{mvar|xy}}-plane, the PDE is second-order in that region. This form is analogous to the equation for a conic section:

: &lt;math&gt;Ax^2 + 2Bxy + Cy^2 + \cdots = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
More precisely, replacing {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by {{mvar|X}}, and likewise for other variables (formally this is done by a [[Fourier transform]]), converts a constant-coefficient PDE into a polynomial of the same degree, with the top degree (a [[homogeneous polynomial]], here a [[quadratic form]]) being most significant for the classification.

Just as one classifies [[conic section]]s and quadratic forms into parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic based on the [[discriminant]] {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''AC''}}, the same can be done for a second-order PDE at a given point.  However, the [[discriminant]] in a PDE is given by {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC''}} due to the convention of the {{mvar|xy}} term being {{math|2''B''}} rather than {{mvar|B}}; formally, the discriminant (of the associated quadratic form) is {{math|(2''B'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''AC'' {{=}} 4(''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC'')}}, with the factor of 4 dropped for simplicity.

# {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC'' &lt; 0}} (''[[elliptic partial differential equation]]''): Solutions of [[elliptic partial differential equation|elliptic PDEs]] are as smooth as the coefficients allow, within the interior of the region where the equation and solutions are defined. For example, solutions of Laplace's equation are analytic within the domain where they are defined, but solutions may assume boundary values that are not smooth. The motion of a fluid at subsonic speeds can be approximated with elliptic PDEs, and the Euler–Tricomi equation is elliptic where {{math|''x'' &lt; 0}}.
# {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC'' {{=}} 0}} (''[[parabolic partial differential equation]]''): Equations that are [[parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic]] at every point can be transformed into a form analogous to the [[heat equation]] by a change of independent variables. Solutions smooth out as the transformed time variable increases. The Euler–Tricomi equation has parabolic type on the line where {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.
# {{math|''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''AC'' &gt; 0}} (''[[hyperbolic partial differential equation]]''): [[hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] equations retain any discontinuities of functions or derivatives in the initial data. An example is the wave equation. The motion of a fluid at supersonic speeds can be approximated with hyperbolic PDEs, and the Euler–Tricomi equation is hyperbolic where {{math|''x'' &gt; 0}}.

If there are {{mvar|n}} independent variables {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;,… ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, a general linear partial differential equation of second order has the form

: &lt;math&gt;L u =\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n a_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \quad \text{ plus lower-order terms} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

The classification depends upon the signature of the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

# Elliptic: the eigenvalues are all positive or all negative.
# Parabolic: the eigenvalues are all positive or all negative, save one that is zero.
# Hyperbolic: there is only one negative eigenvalue and all the rest are positive, or there is only one positive eigenvalue and all the rest are negative.
# Ultrahyperbolic: there is more than one positive eigenvalue and more than one negative eigenvalue, and there are no zero eigenvalues. There is only a limited theory for ultrahyperbolic equations (Courant and Hilbert, 1962).

=== Systems of first-order equations and characteristic surfaces ===
The classification of partial differential equations can be extended to systems of first-order equations, where the unknown {{mvar|u}} is now a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] with {{mvar|m}} components, and the coefficient matrices {{mvar|A&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;}} are {{mvar|m}} by {{mvar|m}} matrices for {{math|''ν'' {{=}} 1, 2,… ''n''}}. The partial differential equation takes the form

: &lt;math&gt;Lu = \sum_{\nu=1}^{n} A_\nu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_\nu} + B=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficient matrices {{mvar|A&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the vector {{mvar|B}} may depend upon {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|u}}. If a [[hypersurface]] {{mvar|S}} is given in the implicit form

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|φ}} has a non-zero gradient, then {{mvar|S}} is a '''characteristic surface''' for the operator {{mvar|L}} at a given point if the characteristic form vanishes:

: &lt;math&gt;Q\left(\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x_1}, \ldots\frac{\partial\varphi}{\partial x_n}\right) =\det\left[\sum_{\nu=1}^nA_\nu \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x_\nu}\right]=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric interpretation of this condition is as follows: if data for {{mvar|u}} are prescribed on the surface {{mvar|S}}, then it may be possible to determine the normal derivative of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}} from the differential equation. If the data on {{mvar|S}} and the differential equation determine the normal derivative of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}}, then {{mvar|S}} is non-characteristic. If the data on {{mvar|S}} and the differential equation ''do not'' determine the normal derivative of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}}, then the surface is '''characteristic''', and the differential equation restricts the data on {{mvar|S}}: the differential equation is ''internal'' to {{mvar|S}}.

# A first-order system {{math|''Lu'' {{=}} 0}} is ''elliptic'' if no surface is characteristic for {{mvar|L}}: the values of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}} and the differential equation always determine the normal derivative of {{mvar|u}} on {{mvar|S}}.
# A first-order system is ''hyperbolic'' at a point if there is a '''spacelike''' surface {{mvar|S}} with normal {{mvar|ξ}} at that point. This means that, given any non-trivial vector {{mvar|η}} orthogonal to {{mvar|ξ}}, and a scalar multiplier {{mvar|λ}}, the equation {{math|''Q''(''λξ'' + ''η'') {{=}} 0}} has {{mvar|m}} real roots {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,… ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The system is '''strictly hyperbolic''' if these roots are always distinct. The geometrical interpretation of this condition is as follows: the characteristic form {{math|''Q''(''ζ'') {{=}} 0}} defines a cone (the normal cone) with homogeneous coordinates ζ. In the hyperbolic case, this cone has {{mvar|m}} sheets, and the axis {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} ''λξ''}} runs inside these sheets: it does not intersect any of them. But when displaced from the origin by η, this axis intersects every sheet. In the elliptic case, the normal cone has no real sheets.

=== Equations of mixed type ===
If a PDE has coefficients that are not constant, it is possible that it will not belong to any of these categories but rather be of '''mixed type'''. A simple but important example is the [[Euler–Tricomi equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;u_{xx} = xu_{yy},&lt;/math&gt;

which is called '''elliptic-hyperbolic''' because it is elliptic in the region {{math|''x'' &lt; 0}}, hyperbolic in the region {{math|''x'' &gt; 0}}, and degenerate parabolic on the line {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}.
&lt;!--
''fill in: Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries, hyperbolic/parabolic/elliptic separation of variables, [[Fourier analysis]], [[Green's function]]s ...--&gt;

=== Infinite-order PDEs in quantum mechanics ===
In the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics,  one may consider the [[Method of quantum characteristics|quantum Hamilton's equations]] for trajectories of quantum particles. These equations are infinite-order PDEs. However, in the semiclassical expansion, one has a finite system of ODEs at any fixed order of [[Dirac constant|{{mvar|ħ}}]].  The evolution equation of the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution|Wigner function]] is also an infinite-order PDE. The quantum trajectories are [[Method of quantum characteristics|quantum characteristics]], with the use of which one could calculate the evolution of the Wigner function.

== Analytical solutions ==

===Separation of variables===
{{main|Separable partial differential equation}}
Linear PDEs can be reduced to systems of ordinary differential equations by the important technique of separation of variables. This technique rests on a characteristic of solutions to differential equations: if one can find any solution that solves the equation and satisfies the boundary conditions, then it is ''the'' solution (this also applies to ODEs). We assume as an [[ansatz]] that the dependence of a solution on the parameters space and time can be written as a product of terms that each depend on a single parameter, and then see if this can be made to solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gershenfeld|first1=Neil|title=The nature of mathematical modeling|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521570956|page=27|edition=Reprinted (with corr.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the method of separation of variables, one reduces a PDE to a PDE in fewer variables, which is an ordinary differential equation if in one variable – these are in turn easier to solve.

This is possible for simple PDEs, which are called [[separable partial differential equation]]s, and the domain is generally a rectangle (a product of intervals). Separable PDEs correspond to [[diagonal matrices]] – thinking of "the value for fixed {{mvar|x}}" as a coordinate, each coordinate can be understood separately.

This generalizes to the [[method of characteristics]], and is also used in [[integral transform]]s.

===Method of characteristics===
{{main|Method of characteristics}}
In special cases, one can find characteristic curves on which the equation reduces to an ODE – changing coordinates in the domain to straighten these curves allows separation of variables, and is called the [[method of characteristics]].

More generally, one may find characteristic surfaces.

===Integral transform===
An [[integral transform]] may transform the PDE to a simpler one, in particular, a separable PDE. This corresponds to diagonalizing an operator.

An important example of this is [[Fourier analysis]], which diagonalizes the heat equation using the [[eigenbasis]] of sinusoidal waves.

If the domain is finite or periodic, an infinite sum of solutions such as a [[Fourier series]] is appropriate, but an integral of solutions such as a [[Fourier integral]] is generally required for infinite domains. The solution for a point source for the heat equation given above is an example of the use of a Fourier integral.

===Change of variables===

Often a PDE can be reduced to a simpler form with a known solution by a suitable [[Change of variables (PDE)|change of variables]].  For example, the [[Black–Scholes equation#Derivation|Black–Scholes]] PDE

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is reducible to the [[heat equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

by the change of variables (for complete details see {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411030405/http://www.math.unl.edu/~sdunbar1/Teaching/MathematicalFinance/Lessons/BlackScholes/Solution/solution.shtml |date=April 11, 2008 |title=Solution of the Black Scholes Equation }})

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V(S,t) &amp;= K v(x,\tau),\\[5px]
x &amp;= \ln\left(\tfrac{S}{K} \right),\\[5px]
\tau &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2} \sigma^2 (T - t),\\[5px]
v(x,\tau)&amp;=e^{-\alpha x-\beta\tau} u(x,\tau).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Fundamental solution===
{{main|Fundamental solution}}
Inhomogeneous equations can often be solved (for constant coefficient PDEs, always be solved) by finding the [[fundamental solution]] (the solution for a point source), then taking the [[convolution]] with the boundary conditions to get the solution.

This is analogous in [[signal processing]] to understanding a filter by its [[impulse response]].

===Superposition principle===
{{further| Superposition principle }}
The superposition principle applies to any linear system, including linear systems of PDEs. A common visualization of this concept is the interaction of two waves in phase being combined to result in a greater amplitude, for example {{math|sin ''x'' + sin ''x'' {{=}} 2 sin ''x''}}. The same principle can be observed in PDEs where the solutions may be real or complex and additive. [[Superposition principle|superposition]]
If {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are solutions of linear PDE in some function space {{mvar|R}}, then {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} with any constants {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are also a solution of that PDE in the same function space.

===Methods for non-linear equations===
{{see also|nonlinear partial differential equation}}

There are no generally applicable methods to solve nonlinear PDEs. Still, existence and uniqueness results (such as the [[Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem]]) are often possible, as are proofs of important qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions (getting these results is a major part of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). Computational solution to the nonlinear PDEs, the [[split-step method]], exist for specific equations like [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]].

Nevertheless, some techniques can be used for several types of equations. The [[h-principle|{{mvar|h}}-principle]] is the most powerful method to solve [[Underdetermined system|underdetermined]] equations. The [[Riquier–Janet theory]] is an effective method for obtaining information about many analytic [[Overdetermined system|overdetermined]] systems.

The [[method of characteristics]] ([[similarity transformation method]]) can be used in some very special cases to solve partial differential equations.

In some cases, a PDE can be solved via [[perturbation analysis]] in which the solution is considered to be a correction to an equation with a known solution. Alternatives are [[numerical analysis]] techniques from simple [[finite difference]] schemes to the more mature [[multigrid]] and [[finite element method]]s. Many interesting problems in science and engineering are solved in this way using [[computer]]s, sometimes high performance [[supercomputer]]s.

===Lie group method===
From 1870 [[Sophus Lie]]'s work put the theory of differential equations on a more satisfactory foundation. He showed that the integration theories of the older mathematicians can, by the introduction of what are now called [[Lie group]]s, be referred to a common source; and that ordinary differential equations which admit the same [[infinitesimal transformation]]s present comparable difficulties of integration. He also emphasized the subject of [[contact transformation|transformations of contact]].

A general approach to solving PDEs uses the symmetry property of differential equations, the continuous [[infinitesimal transformation]]s of solutions to solutions ([[Lie theory]]). Continuous [[group theory]], [[Lie algebras]] and [[differential geometry]] are used to understand the structure of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations for generating integrable equations, to find its [[Lax pair]]s, recursion operators, [[Bäcklund transform]] and finally finding exact analytic solutions to the PDE.

Symmetry methods have been recognized to study differential equations arising in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other disciplines.

===Semianalytical methods===
The [[adomian decomposition method]], the [[Aleksandr Lyapunov|Lyapunov]] artificial small parameter method, and He's [[homotopy perturbation method]] are all special cases of the more general [[homotopy analysis method]]. These are series expansion methods, and except for the Lyapunov method, are independent of small physical parameters as compared to the well known [[perturbation theory]], thus giving these methods greater flexibility and solution generality.

== Numerical solutions ==
The three most widely used numerical methods to solve PDEs are the [[finite element analysis|finite element method]] (FEM), [[finite volume method]]s (FVM) and [[finite difference method]]s (FDM), as well other kind of methods called [[Meshfree methods]], which were made to solve problems where the before mentioned methods are limited. The FEM has a prominent position among these methods and especially its exceptionally efficient higher-order version [[hp-FEM]]. Other hybrid versions of FEM and Meshfree methods include the generalized finite element method (GFEM), [[extended finite element method]] (XFEM), [[Spectral element method|spectral finite element method]] (SFEM), [[Meshfree methods|meshfree finite element method]], [[Discontinuous Galerkin Method|discontinuous Galerkin finite element method]] (DGFEM), [[Element-Free Galerkin Method]] (EFGM), [[Interpolating Element-Free Galerkin Method]] (IEFGM), etc.

=== Finite element method ===
{{main|Finite element method}}
The finite element method (FEM) (its practical application often known as finite element analysis (FEA)) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDE) as well as of integral equations. The solution approach is based either on eliminating the differential equation completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an approximating system of ordinary differential equations, which are then numerically integrated using standard techniques such as Euler's method, Runge–Kutta, etc.

===Finite difference method===
{{main|Finite difference method}}
Finite-difference methods are numerical methods for approximating the solutions to differential equations using [[finite difference]] equations to approximate derivatives.

=== Finite volume method ===
{{main|Finite volume method}}
Similar to the finite difference method or finite element method, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. "Finite volume" refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a mesh. In the finite volume method, surface integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to volume integrals, using the [[divergence theorem]]. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods conserve mass by design.

'''Paul Samuel Henderson''' (October 10, 1899 &amp;ndash; May 24, 1988) was an African-American photojournalist for the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American]]'' newspaper from 1929 through circa 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Other 6 -- no title. (1966, Jan 22). Afro-American (1893-1988). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532275068&lt;/ref&gt; He became well known for taking pictures of large groups and distant objects atop a ladder he carried.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Henderson Was Photographer [Obituary]. (1988, May 29). The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson primarily photographed people, including church groups, politicians, graduations, local college and university groups, weddings, events during the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and more. He was a member of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], a vestryman at St. James Church, charter member of the Druid Hill Avenue Neighborhood Club, assistant treasurer of a local Frontiers International club, and supported [[The Salvation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Henderson Was Photographer [Obituary]. (1988, May 29). The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Paul Samuel Henderson was born on October 10, 1899 in Springfield, Tennessee and was the youngest of four children born to Ike A. and Annie L. Henderson. At age 18 he registered for the World War I draft on September 12, 1918 while working as a bricklayer for a steel company in Gary, Indiana. In 1920 his profession changed to driver for a laundry in Gary. At some point during his residence in Gary, he attended the School for Professional Photography.&lt;ref&gt;Registration State: Indiana; Registration County: Lake; Roll: 1503889; Draft Board: 2.

== Photography career ==
After leaving Indiana, Henderson worked for a newspaper in Roanoke, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Registration State: Indiana; Registration County: Lake; Roll: 1503889; Draft Board: 2. Ancestry.com. U.S., World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson moved to Baltimore in 1929 and became what the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American]]'' newspaper called their first photographer.&lt;ref&gt;Other 6 -- no title. (1966, Jan 22). Afro-American (1893-1988). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532275068&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson used a large format [[view camera]] to produce glass negatives, and eight by ten inch and four by five inch acetate negatives.

Henderson documented racial segregation and early civil rights protests as well as community members of the Baltimore City's African-American population. Henderson photographed [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] Baltimore Branch president [[Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson]], Baltimore City Mayor and Maryland State Governor [[Theodore McKeldin]], Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] when he was a lawyer for the NAACP, journalist and publisher [[Carl Murphy]], businesses and people along Pennsylvania Avenue, which was once a main artery for black culture and life in Baltimore and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J. (2012, Feb 23). Md. Historical Society wants to identify subjects of Civil Rights era photos. The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photograph collection ===
Henderson bequeathed his photograph and object collection to the [[Peale Museum]]. When the Peale closed its doors in 1997, the collection was transferred to the [[Maryland Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J. (2012, Feb 23). Md. Historical Society wants to identify subjects of Civil Rights era photos. The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1930, Henderson married schoolteacher and “prominent society girl” Elizabeth Johnson. Mrs. Henderson was a graduate of Douglass High School and Coppin Normal School for Teachers (now Coppin State University) in Baltimore whose career flourished in the Baltimore City Public School system.&lt;ref&gt;Miss Elizabeth Johnson Will Marry Saturday (1930, Sep 27). [Society] Afro-American, A13.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul and Elizabeth Henderson had no children.

In 1966 Henderson became so gravely ill that on January 22, the Baltimore Afro-American printed a premature obituary for him.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary 1 -- no title. (1966, Jan 22). Afro-American (1893-1988). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532147005&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the same issue, the newspaper asks readers for prayers for Henderson who had been in Hopkins Hospital for the past week. In April 1966, the newspaper’s Bettye M. Moss updates readers in her column about Henderson’s condition, stating that he is able to be “up and about” at the Bolton Hill Nursing Home at Lafayette Avenue and John Street in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, B. (1966, Apr 16). If you ask me. Afro-American (1893-1988). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/532183939&lt;/ref&gt; By June the Afro-American reports that Henderson is back at home at 1925 Druid Hill Avenue in Baltimore.

Henderson died on Tuesday, May 24, 1988, at Union Memorial Hospital after a reported battle with an illness. Services were held at St. James Episcopal Church at Lafayette and Arlington avenues. He had outlived his wife Elizabeth, who died in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Henderson Was Photographer [Obituary]. (1988, May 29). The Baltimore Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary stated that he was survived by his brother, Willard Henderson, who lived in Tampa, Florida.

'''Persecution of people with albinism''' (sometimes abbreviated PWA&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;) is based on the belief that certain body parts of [[Albinism|albinistic]] people can transmit magical powers. Such [[superstition]] is present especially in some parts of the [[African Great Lakes]] region, it has been promulgated and exploited by [[witch doctor]]s and others who use such body parts as ingredients in rituals, concoctions and [[potions]] with the claim that their [[Witchcraft|magic]] will bring prosperity to the user (''[[muti]]'' or [[medicine murder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/ethnologie/forschung/arbeitsstellen/medical_anthropology/publikationen/0000-MEDIEN/Schuehle_Medicine-Murder-_-Albinism-Tanzania_CAS-Working-Paper-2-2013.pdf|title=Medicine Murder of People with Albinism in Tanzania – How Casino Capitalism Creates Rumorscapes and Occult Economies (Working Paper No. 2-13)|last=Schühle|first=Judith|date=|website=FU-Berlin.de|publisher=Center for Area Studies, Freie Universität Berlin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125200414/http://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/cas/forschung/publikationen/working-papers/_CAS-Working-2-13_Schuehle.pdf|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes|access-date=29 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, people with albinism have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinos dug up and desecrated. At the same time, people with albinism have also been ostracised and even killed for exactly the opposite reason, because they are presumed to be cursed and bring bad luck. The persecutions of people with albinism take place mostly in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n communities, especially among [[East Africa]]ns.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cruz-Inigo|first1=Andres E. |last2=Ladizinski|first2=Barry |last3=Sethi|first3=Aisha |date=January 2011 |title=Albinism in Africa: Stigma, Slaughter and Awareness Campaigns |work=Dermatologic Clinics |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=79–87 |doi=10.1016/j.det.2010.08.015 |url= http://www.derm.theclinics.com/article/S0733-8635(10)00140-3/fulltext |access-date=18 April 2014}} Also available [http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0733-8635/PIIS0733863510001403.pdf in PDF format].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81}}

Albinism is a genetically inherited condition which is very rare and, worldwide, affects approximately one in twenty thousand people.&lt;ref&gt;Steiefel, (2014) Hats on for skin health: Albinos in Africa a population at risk {{cite web |url=http://www.stiefel.com/en/community-interest/hatsonforskinhealth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507033012/http://www.stiefel.com/en/community-interest/hatsonforskinhealth.html |archivedate=7 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} Accessed 20 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although rare in the western world, albinism is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa, likely as a result of [[consanguinity]].&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; Both parents, who may or may not be albinos themselves, must carry the gene if it is to be passed on to the child. Albinism occurs in both males and females and is not specific to any race or ethnic group. Statistics show that fifty percent of albinistic people in [[Tanzania]] have a known albinistic relative,&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}} although very few understand or are educated about the medical and genetic causes of this condition. Many believe it is a punishment from God or bad luck, and that their "disease" could be contagious, which is often the view of even members of the medical and professional community. These misconceptions, coupled with the lack of education, are some of the key reasons that albinism is so heavily persecuted. This lack of knowledge about people with albinism means that folktales and superstition in the name of witchcraft take the place of medical and scientific facts in the minds of many native Africans, with and without albinism, which in turn has major effects on the social integration of albinistic people into African society. Ninety-eight percent of albinos die by the age of forty for reasons which could easily be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Morton |first=T. |date=2014 |title=''Watu Kama Sisi'': Reducing Skin Cancer, Stigma and Violence Against Albinos in the Mara Region |publisher=[[Under the Same Sun]] |location=Canada / Tanzania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current statistics of persecution of albinistic people==

A report was released on 1 April 2014 by the [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania, office of the Canadian charity [[Under the Same Sun]]. Titled ''Reported Attacks of Persons with Albinism'', the document reviews 180 countries and lists 129 recent killings and 181 other attacks, all within 23 African countries. These attacks include mutilation, violence, violation of graves, and cases of asylum-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2014 |title=Reported Attacks of Persons with Albinism – Most Recent Attacks Included. |publisher=[[Under the Same Sun]] |location=Canada / Tanzania |url= http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/PWA%20Attacks%20in%20Africa.pdf |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tanzania ===
In Tanzania, albinos represent one in every 1429 births, a much higher rate than in any other nation. According to [[Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer]], an albino member of parliament, there are 6977 officially registered albinos in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="IFRC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[International Federation of Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent Societies]]. |title=Advocacy Report: Through Albino Eyes – The Plight of Albino People in Africa's Great Lakes Region and a Red Cross Response |date=2009 |work=IFRC.org |url= https://www.ifrc.org/Global/Publications/general/177800-Albinos-Report-EN.pdf |access-date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is believed that there may be up to 17000 undocumented.&lt;ref name="BBC wife"&gt;{{cite news |date=2008 |title=Man 'tried to sell' albino wife  |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7726743.stm |access-date=24 April 2014 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of albinos have migrated to the [[Dar es Salaam]] area, as they feel safer in an urban setting. Tanzania is thought to have the largest population of albinos in Africa.&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Malone |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1215949/The-albino-tribe-butchered-feed-gruesome-trade-magical-body-parts.html |title=The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts |date=24 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albinos are especially persecuted in [[Shinyanga Region|Shinyanga]] and [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]], where witch doctors have promoted a belief in the potential magical and superstitious properties of albinos' body parts. There are further issues which arise when there is lack of education about albinism. Fathers often suspect the mother of the albino child of infidelity with a white man or that the child is the ghost of a European colonist.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; This can cause immense strain on families and relationships. An albino child is often seen as a bad omen and treated as unwanted. Many albino babies become victims of infanticide due to these superstitious views.

=== Malawi ===
After 2015 when Tanzania enacted tougher steps against violence against albinos, Malawi has seen a "steep upsurge in killings" with 18 reported killings since November 2014, and the likely toll being higher because of missing persons and unreported murders.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/malawi-albinos-hunted-and-murdered-for-their-limbs/| author=AP| title=Albino people are being hunted for their body parts |publisher=CBS| date=June 7, 2016 |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Peter Mutharika]] has formed a committee to study the situation.&lt;ref name=cbs/&gt; Additionally, Malawi has faced an immense amount of graves belonging to Albino people being robbed in more recent history. In 2017, police found at least 39 cases of illegal removals of the bodies of Albino people from their graves or having body parts removed from their corpses&lt;ref&gt;“The Ritual Murders of People with Albinism in Malawi.” Amnesty International UK, 2 Feb. 2017, 6:50pm, www.amnesty.org.uk/ritual-murders-people-albinism-malawi. Accessed 14 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;. Another phenomenon that has also begun to occur is an increase in religious leaders, police, and government officials being charged and convicted of slaying Albino people in Malawi. As of 2018, there has been speculation President Mutharika making moves toward implementing the death penalty to convicted murderers of Albino people as a way to significantly decrease the attacks being perpetrated, putting fear into those who do it for business or religious purposes and making it substantially less acceptable by witch doctors and other people who follow superstitions. There is a death penalty in place, but it has not been put in to use since the government changed to democracy in 1994, and convicts who are given the death penalty have sat in prison for life instead&lt;ref&gt;Masina, Lameck. “Malawi Debates Death Penalty to Halt Attacks on Albinos.” VOA, VOA, 24 Apr. 2018, www.voanews.com/a/malawi-debates-death-penalty-attacks-albinos/4363063.html.“Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings.” Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings | Amnesty International, 2016, www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/06/albinism-in-malawi-stop-the-killings/. &lt;/ref&gt;. The president sees this as a way to tighten judicial control and work to eradicate the hate crimes committed against Albinos.

==Origins of myths and superstition causing persecution of people with albinism==
African rituals and spiritual ideas about albinism have led to the brutal murder of and attacks on innocent men, women and especially children. These ideas have been around for many generations, but in recent years witch doctors have been teaching misconceived ideas about the promise of wealth, success and power when albino hair or limbs are used in a potion as part of witchcraft practices. This has gained public attention nationally and internationally as these crimes have been reported as crimes against human rights. "Infanticide, kidnapping, amputations, and decapitations, committed for purposes of supplying highly valued body parts used for amulets, which are then sold in underground witchcraft market."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}}  Therefore, this causes great unrest and angst among the albino population, who must be protected and often live in a state of solitude simply to protect their own lives and to prevent being hunted like animals.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}}

US congressman [[Gerry Connolly]] in 2010 introduced legislation to protect albinos and urge local governments to protect albinos, stating that "With their help and the passage of this resolution today, maybe we can bring an end to these horrific and heinous crimes."&lt;ref&gt;This Day Reporter, (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings (http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722. Accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clear that "the main driving forces underlying these profiling crimes are ignorance, myth, and superstition, such as the belief that individuals with albinism possess superpowers or that their body parts bestow fortune and health."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}} It is commonly known that in many communities, predominantly in Tanzania and parts of east Africa, superstitious views derived from ancient spiritual beliefs and reinforced by local witch doctors have been carried through centuries of ritualistic practices and mythical beliefs. This creates a serious risk to the lives of persons with albinism as the people believe it will bring them wealth, power, success or health depending on the variances of interpretation. Senior police officers claim that these body parts may be sold for as much as [[United States dollar|US$]]75,000 on the black market&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt; for a set of arms, legs, ears, and genitals from an individual with albinism.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|79}}&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt; Therefore, there has been an extensive amount of albino murders in the past decade especially in Burundi and Tanzania, where in 2007 more than seventy documented killings took place and one hundred and fifty body parts of albinos were reported to have been chopped off. Now the number of killings is well over one hundred, with low conviction rates, and albinos continue to have limbs severed, leaving many crippled or severely maimed, traumatized and tortured in the process.&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

This threat to albinos has the potential to cause extreme trauma and stress in their daily lives, which are already impacted by the stress of their condition, affecting skin and eyesight, placing albinos in a constant state of insecurity and distrust. According to Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, because of the social and educational exclusion which can often occur there are often very low education levels in albinos, so that they lack social and economic tools to live productive lives.&lt;ref name="Pillay"&gt;Pillay, Navi (13 March 2014) "People with albinism have the right to live without fear or bullying, discrimination, social exclusion, killing and dismemberment". United Nations High Commissioner. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8N_w5C8FWE&amp;feature=youtu.be Accessed 4 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It also "is a common belief that albinos have low brain capacity and are unable to function at the same level as 'normal people'.&lt;ref&gt;Kuster R,(2000) White skin, black souls. New African, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, their ability to learn is often deficient due to the fact that one hundred percent of albinos suffer from some form of visual impairment&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; and there often are not sufficient educational facilities, learning supplies or funding to support children with limited sight. This causes extensive bullying, exclusion from peer groups, low self-esteem and confidence, along with emotional and mental illness stemming from rejection by society and often family members who harbor superstitious myths about albinos. It is clearly revealed that no matter what mythical or spiritual mantra a person may be following or believing about albinos there is a general view in "nearly all cultures in the region of east Africa held and some still hold the view that albinos are less desirable beings who are less than human."&lt;ref name="UTSS history"&gt;{{cite web |work=Under the Same Sun |date=15 July 2013 |title=History of Attacks Against Persons with Albinism (PWA) |url= http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/History%20of%20Attacks%20against%20PWA.pdf |access-date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Therefore, homes and schools specifically for albinos, such as Buhangija Albino School, have been created as safe environments for learning, growing and permanently residing. Many children fear to ever return to their families, believing that they may be killed by even their closest relatives. Ukerewe Island is a key example of this, displayed in the film home to a large community of people with albinism where 62 albinos reside, most likely to remain in solitude and away from albino hunters.&lt;ref name="ITSOTS"&gt;Freeland, Harry (2014) In the Shadow of the Sun  http://intheshadowofthesun.org/long-synopsis Accessed 29 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN report submitted as part of the Human Rights Council resolution 23/13 of 13 June 2013 states that albinos are often regarded as "ghosts and not human beings, who can be wiped off the global map."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013"&gt;United Nations General Assembly: Human Rights Council, 24th Session (12 September 2013) Persons with Albinism. Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Accessed 24 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} They are often persecuted as devils or people who are a bad omen or suffer from a curse. In some communities it is "believed that contact with them will bring bad luck, sickness or death."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Therefore, this is discrimination and mental and emotional persecution alone, where severe bullying of children, exclusion and abandonment occurs even without brutal physical persecution.

However, the issues which have created a spotlight for the Human Rights Council of the United Nations are the murder of albinos for medicine and dismemberment, and attacks and murder of persons with albinism. Another myth that imposes a risk on people with albinism is the belief that "sexual intercourse with a woman or a girl with albinism can cure HIV/AIDS."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Sacrifice of albinos is believed also to "appease the god of the mountain"&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} when fear of a volcano eruption is possible, and it is believed that pulling the hair of albinos can bring good luck. It has also been reported that "miners use the bones of persons with albinism as amulets or bury them where they are drilling for gold.&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} The attacks which occur usually result in the death or severe mutilation of the albino, which according to the Human rights council can in "some cases involve trade in organs, trafficking in persons and sale of children, infanticide and abandonment of children."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Action against persecution==
With escalating killings, President [[Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly and repeatedly condemned [[witch doctor]]s, their helpers and middlemen, and the clients, which include members of the police force, for these murders. Victims include [[child abduction|children snatched or abducted]] from their parents. The killers and their accomplices use hair, arms, legs, skin, eyes, genitals, and blood in rituals or for witch potions.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has published a preliminary report regarding discrimination which has been directed toward people with albinism.&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|5}} This report has been submitted as part of the Human Rights Council resolution 23/13 of 13 June 2013. It reinforced that "states would adopt specific measures to protect and preserve the rights to life and security of persons with albinism, as well as their right not to be subject to torture and ill treatment, and ensure their access to adequate health care, employment, education and justice."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|1}} The discrimination of albinos is often demonstrated by family members and relatives especially at birth, and ill-treatment by general society is widespread where there are severe issues of social exclusion and stigma. The Resolution 23/13 explains the Human Rights council's concerns about "attacks against persons with albinism".&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Therefore, the Council encouraged the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to submit a report. Navi Pillay is the current United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. As the representative, on 11 March 2014 she submitted a message which overviewed the current status of discrimination against persons with albinism and possible pathways for change and development in protection of albinos. "People with albinism have the right to live without fear or bullying, discrimination, social exclusion, killing and dismemberment."&lt;ref name="Pillay" /&gt; This footage was published on 13 March 2014 to overview the current situation surrounding albinos who live in fear of being murdered or captured for the purposes of murder medicine and witch doctors belief in the magical potential of albino hair and limbs.

Also a key issue is the influence of educating the public to encourage the removal of the social stigma associated with albinos in a society which does not completely understand that albinism is not a curse or a spiritual ghost, but simply a skin condition. In Zimbabwe albinos have been given the name ''sope'' which indicated that they are possessed by evil spirits, and in Tanzania they are known as ''nguruwe'' meaning 'pig', or ''zeru'' which means 'ghost'.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; The Report discusses the "most serious human rights violations faced by persons with albinism, primarily focusing on the ritual killings and attacks to which they are subjected."&lt;ref name="UNHRC 2013" /&gt;{{rp|3}} It also includes recommendations to the international community and member states action towards persons with albinism.

Under the Same Sun led by albinism activist Peter Ash is organisation aiming to protect albinos from persecution and he delivered an oral intervention to the Human Rights Council in its 23rd session on 7 June 2013 on behalf of the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders project (EHAHRDP). His submission stated:

"Today I wish to address a little known but very serious human rights violation being perpetrated against people with albinism in many African nations. My NGO, Under the Same Sun, has evidence of the witchcraft related attacks and killings of 207 people with albinism in 16 African nations. The majority of the victims are children. From Tanzania and Burundi in the East, to Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire in the West and South Africa and Swaziland in the South, people born with this genetic condition live in fear every day. There exists a lucrative black market in albino body parts used to make what is promoted as powerful ''[[muti]]'' medicine. The hand, arm or any albino organ is combined with other ingredients and then sold for thousands of dollars: $3,000 for a hand or over $100,000 for an entire set of organs. Sometimes body parts are even shipped across borders. We seek a day when people with albinism will take their rightful place in all levels of African society and such days of discrimination will be a faint memory. To this end, we call on this Council to pass a resolution condemning acts of violence and discrimination against persons with albinism and to request the OHCHR or the Advisory Committee to carry out a study on such violations. As Edmund Burke so rightly stated, "all that is necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Peter (7 June 2013) Human Rights Council: 23rd Session Item 5: General Debate. Oral Intervention East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project (EHAHRDP) http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/Speech%20to%20UN%20June%202013.pdf Accessed 24 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==

International federation Secretary General Bekele Geleta states that "Albinism is one of the most unfortunate vulnerabilities… and needs to be addressed immediately at international level."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;{{rp|20}} This is a cry for international exposure and help to ensure that people suffering from albinism can be protected from inhumane killings and to be sheltered from the merciless hunters of albino body parts for their potions and spiritual medicine. "The main issues that should be addressed include skin cancer prevention education, stigma and discrimination denouncement, and swift prosecution of albino hunters and their sponsors."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|80}} Therefore, it is clear that albinos are facing many issues in their lives, and must be protected on the basis of human rights even if they look different and unlike any other race on earth. It is "imperative to inform the medical community and the general national and international public about the tragedies faced by albinos to protect them from skin cancer and ritualistic murders by individuals seeking wealth through clandestine markets perpetuating witchcraft."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

A number of steps were taken by the government to protect the albino population.  The president ordered a crackdown on witchdoctors in the spring of 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc403"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/7327989.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Tanzania in witchdoctor crackdown |date=3 April 2008 |access-date=3 January 2010 |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an albino woman, [[Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer]], was named to become a member of the parliament, the first albino in such a position in the [[history of Tanzania]]. Police have also been advised to generate lists of albinos and provide special protection for them.&lt;ref name="BBC721"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7518049.stm |first=Karen |last=Allen |title=Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos |date=21 July 2008 |access-date=3 January 2010 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To foil [[graverobber]]s, graves of the albinistic were to be sealed with concrete.&lt;ref name=bbc727&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7527729.stm|title=Tanzania Albinos Targeted Again |work=[[BBC News]] |date=27 July 2008 |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by October 2008, killings had not abated, and while some suspects had been apprehended, no convictions had taken place.&lt;ref name="kul"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=d9487de6-5eeb-4b6e-b21f-4863db51113c |title=Crackdown vowed after Tanzania albino girl killed, mutilated |first=John |last=Kulekana |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=21 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105100148/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=d9487de6-5eeb-4b6e-b21f-4863db51113c |archivedate=5 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that over 50 murders had taken place since March 2007, many of them in the mining and fishing communities near Lake Victoria, especially at [[Mwanza]], [[Shinyanga]] and [[Mara, Tanzania|Mara]].&lt;ref name="kii"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://allafrica.com/stories/200810200901.html |first=Orton |last=Kiishweko |title=Tanzania: JK Orders Crackdown to Stem Murder of Albinos |date=20 October 2008 |work=The Citizen |location=Dar es Salaam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, "Prime Minister Pinda had declared war on the albino hunters, and in an effort to stop the trade in albino body parts he had revoked the licenses of all the country's [[witch doctor]]s who use the body parts in their black magic fetishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themorningstarr.co.uk/2009/01/24/tanzania-albino-hunting-update/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155047/http://www.themorningstarr.co.uk/2009/01/24/tanzania-albino-hunting-update/ |archivedate=24 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convictions against albino hunters===
The first ever conviction for the killing of an albino in Tanzania occurred on 23 September 2009 at the High Court in [[Kahama, Tanzania|Kahama]].&lt;ref name="Albinos call for public hanging of murderers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Albino killers 'should be hanged'" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Howden"&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Howden |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/three-sentenced-to-hang-for-murder-of-an-african-ghost-1792295.html |title=Three sentenced to hang for murder of an African 'ghost' |date=24 September 2009 |access-date=20 April 2014 |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/23/2694777.htm?section=world|title=Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing |date=23 September 2009|access-date=24 September 2009 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a "landmark verdict" was due to the fact that there have been more than 50 murders known at this time and this was the first actual conviction.&lt;ref name="Howden" /&gt; The conviction came about following the murder and mutilation of a 14-year-old boy, Matatizo Dunia, who was attacked by three men in [[Bukombe]] district in [[Shinyanga Region]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="Howden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Death for Tanzania albino killers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanzanian albino killers death sentence"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/2009/09/090923_tanz_albino.shtml |title=Tanzanian albino killers death sentence |date=23 September 2009 |access-date=24 September 2009 |work=[[BBC World Service]] |publisher=[[BBC]]}} Includes audio.&lt;/ref&gt; The men carried Dunia from his home late at night before brutally murdering him. &lt;ref name="Malone" /&gt;

The Canada- and Tanzania-based [[Under The Same Sun]] albinism activist organisation praised the breakthrough but its founder Peter Ash remarked: "This is one conviction.

This issue with witchcraft and its power and influence is that a witch doctor has, as he is almost always "revered by society as ultimate truth."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Most tribes in ancient times would have committed infanticide upon an albino child seeing it as a bad omen, practiced by the [[Sukuma people|Sukuma]], the [[Digo people|Digo]] and the [[Maasai people|Maasai]].&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|5}} However, in some tribes the albinos were made the sacrifices of offerings to the gods or for such uses as potions which is what they are still hunted for today in the 21st century. "One of the most dangerous myths and the crux of recent attacks against PWA is that their body parts can be made into potions that give good luck and wealth to its users."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

In 2006 some of the first publicly reported killings were spoken about in the media, such as 34-year-old albino woman, Arithi, who was murdered with her arms and legs hacked off and sold. Some cases which have been key in recent years firstly occurred in 2008 when a Tanzanian man tried to sell his albino wife for a price of US$3,000 to Congolese businessmen.&lt;ref name="BBC wife" /&gt; Although the businessmen managed to escape their arrest, Interpol has been assigned to attempt to track these men. this is what led to President Jakaya Kikewere ordering a tightening of police and protection from prosecution, however due to corruption there is still proof that even policeman are being bribed and "bought off" to turn a blind eye to certain crimes if they are receiving pecuniary gain. Although according to BBC News one hundred and seventy witch doctors have been arrested for involvement in inhumane interactions and intentions with albinos.&lt;ref name="BBC wife" /&gt;

Another example which occurred where two mothers who were attacked by gangs with machetes in order to get to their albino children. The men broke into a refugee house known as the Lugufu Camp in Kigoma in search of the children; although the children remained untouched the women received severe injuries.&lt;ref name="Howden" /&gt; A further case uncovered by US congressman Gerry Connolly was the November 2008 in Ruyigi, Burundi where the case of a 6-year old albino girl who was shot dead and her head and limbs where hacked off, leaving only her dismembered torso.&lt;ref&gt;This Day Reporter (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings (http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722. Accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations to prevent persecution==

Many organisations have been set up to help protect and provide for communities with albinism. Films have also been produced to encourage, educate and create an international understanding of the trials which persons with albinism are facing in a modern world still dealing with ancient rituals and practices which encourage murder for medicine. This is against all international human rights legislation and therefore it is important that persons with albinism are collectively protected. Organisations such as National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH),&lt;ref&gt;The National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) http://www.albinism.org&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania Albino Centre (TAC)&lt;ref&gt;Tanzania Albino Center (TAC) http://www.tanzaniaalbino.org/ )&lt;/ref&gt; based in Arusha, Tanzania; aiming to "improve the lives of albinos with educational and medical assistance so that they may live safe, accepted, and prosperous lives in the society of their choice."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt; Other groups include Assisting Children in Need (ACN);&lt;ref&gt;Assisting Children in Need (ACN) http://www.assistingchildreninneed.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Under the Same Sun&lt;ref name="underthesamesun.com"&gt;Ash, Peter (2014)  {{cite web |url=http://www.underthesamesun.com/home.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209142022/http://www.underthesamesun.com/home.php |archivedate=9 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Under the Same Sun (2014). Accessed 20 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; where Ash, having albinism himself, states his aspirations and purpose for the project: "I have a dream that one day in Africa, people with albinism will take their rightful place throughout every level of society, and that the days of discrimination against persons with albinism will be a faint memory!"&lt;ref name="underthesamesun.com" /&gt;

The International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) is a key part of the albino protection movement who are working to integrate persons with albinism back into society safely in Burundi "striving to minimize their vulnerability to hunters, skin cancer, and educational and social marginalization."&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|84}} The IFRC particularly works with protecting mothers and children who are fearing persecution and they assist them in providing safe homes and protection where children are frightened of attacker's and by providing a special arena for the albinos it ensures safety protection and an environment of love, understanding of one another all with albinism, and unity in the battle against persecution and discrimination. The Red Cross have made it very clear in their publications that the government must also take drastic steps in protection of persons with albinism to stop the persecution.  They have stated that it is imperative that the government strives to "Ensure effective legal protection for people with albinism, use local administrative structures to locate and protect albino people in hiding and conduct public anti-discrimination campaigns and extend medical services to albinos in need."&lt;ref name="IFRC" /&gt;

Asante Mariamu is another organisation which was created after the survival of Mariamu Staford from an anti-albino attack which is determined to ensure that there is "swift prosecution and convictions of their killers" and therefore encouraging justice.&lt;ref name="Cruz-Inigo" /&gt;{{rp|84}} This story was presented to the US House of Representatives in March 2010 where US Congressman Gerry Connolly was impacted by this horrific story and "moved me to take action."&lt;ref name="TDR"&gt;This Day Reporter (16 March 2010) US Congress passes new law against albinos torture, killings. http://www.thisday.co.tz/?l=10722. Accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced a bill to take action to severe violence being performed against persons with albinism in east Africa and to bring justice and punishment to perpetrators. He spoke to the house in March 2010 urging his colleagues "to join me and Mariamu Stanford in bringing international attention to this horrific abuse of human rights."&lt;ref name="TDR" /&gt; This legislation condemns any injury, murder or mutilation of persons with albinism and specifically urges the local east African government especially in Tanzania and Burundi "to take immediate action to prevent further violence against persons with albinism."&lt;ref name="TDR" /&gt; There are many more which are working on protecting persons with albinism from persecution, and providing adequate health care, sun protection and learning facilities to ensure that persons with albinism are treated fairly and with all human rights, and not hunted as animals in fear of their life. Albino Awareness day has also been created by Dr Aisha Sethi who is an assistant professor of dermatology in the Pritzker School of Medicine which is celebrated on 4th May each year. The President has also appointed Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer, himself a person with albinism, as an MP who seeks to be a voice in the Tanzanian parliament for protection against persecution of persons with albinism in society and encourages facilities and support of their physical, medical, and education protection and enhancement.

===Under the Same Sun (UTSS)===
{{Main|Under the Same Sun}}
[[Under the Same Sun]] is a Canadian-founded organization with support focused on Tanzania and based in Dar es Salam, founded in 2008 by [[Peter Ash (activist)|Peter Ash]] with a vision to "promote via advocacy and education, the wellbeing of persons who are often marginalized or misunderstood. We are driven by the belief that all persons have intrinsic value and since they are created in the image of God."&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Peter (2014) Under the Same Sun:  UTSS Information fact brochure {{cite web |url=http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/About%20Us%20Brochure.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507035422/http://www.underthesamesun.com/sites/default/files/About%20Us%20Brochure.pdf |archivedate=7 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they are acting upon the moral and human rights values to support victims to end the discrimination and persecution of innocent persons with albinism.  According to [[Under The Same Sun]], to eradicate attacks against persons with albinism, "it is necessary to focus on eliminating reliance on witchcraft beliefs by strengthening the provision of infrastructure such as schools and hospitals while enhancing the sense of fairness by improving on the system of justice."&lt;ref name="UTSS history" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Therefore, regaining persons with albinism their rights to being treated as human, fairly as functioning members of society who may look different and suffer severe vulnerabilities die to their physical condition, but do not deserve to be murdered or hurt in any way because of ancient myths claiming sacrifice of these people will create future benefit for another person.

=== Amnesty International (AI) ===
[[Amnesty International]] is a human rights organization that was established by Peter Benenson, a British lawyer and human rights activist, in 1961. It has many city-centered offices in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Central, and Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The goal of the organization is to assist in obtaining freedom and success for everyone globally. It has run several campaigns against the persecution and discrimination of persons with albinism. 'Albinism in Malawi: Stop the Killings' is a campaign run by the organization that was started to “stop ritual murders of people with Albinism” &lt;ref&gt;"Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings.” Albinism in Malawi Stop The Killings | Amnesty International, 2016, &lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the organization provides a plethora of information and statistical research on albinism for other organizations that fight for the same cause.

==Films highlighting persecution of albinism==

Films which have been created are also helping to raise awareness and tell the stories of persecuted persons with albinism, beginning with ''[[In My Genes]]'', a 2009 Kenyan [[Documentary film|documentary]] directed by [[Lupita Nyong'o]] (later a key actor from the 2013 film ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]''). It was followed in 2010 by ''[[White and Black: Crimes of Color]]'', by Canadian filmmaker Jean-François Méan, which tells the story of Vicky Ntetema, a Tanzanian journalist who investigated the trade for albinotic body parts in Tanzania. This film became the cornerstone of a national campaign sponsored by [[Under the Same Sun]] to end the wave of violence.

In October 2008 [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] reported on the further expansion of killings of albinos to the [[Ruyigi]] region of [[Burundi]].

====Biology====
Oculocutaneous albinism, OCA2, is the most common gene type of albinism inherited disorders among the indigenous people Southern Africa. It occurs at a frequency of 1:4000. The incidence in [[Sotho people]] in northern South Africa is at its highest, with a ratio of 1:1500 in neonates.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Patricia M. Lund  Retha Gaigher.

https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-8-225 Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics on albinism in [[South Africa]] are largely incomplete however, studies quoted by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2006 reported that 1:4000 were born with albinism, compared to about 1:20 000 worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcapd.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fact-Sheet_albinism.pdf Accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

South African [[human geneticist]], [[Trefor Jenkins]] has made vast contributions to assist in understanding the social and cultural milieu of albinism, the medical risks and implications, resolving the molecular basis and aetiology for OCA2 in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Int J Ophthalmol. 2014; 7(3): 563–573.

====Skin Cancer====
Children with albinism in rural areas are exposed to high levels of ultraviolet light without the adequate protective gear resulting in skin damage. Only 12% of public schools provided SPF15 sunscreen for children with albinism. [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] of the head and neck is the most common type of cutaneous tumours in African patients with albinism. Non melanoma cancers, namely basal and squamos cell carcinoma, which are usually rare in black populations are common among the vulnerable group living with albinism. A South African study of 111 participants with OCA revealed that 23%
of these participants developed skin cancer with the head area being the most commonly affected site.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many people from rural areas like the Eastern Cape with albinism are unaware of the precautionary measures required to protect their skin. Dr Willie Visser, head of the dermatology division at Stellenbosch University and [[Tygerberg Hospital]], said that while white South Africans presented with skin cancer only after the age of 60, most albinos presented with skin cancer as young as 20. The government health facilities are required to provide sunblock lotion to albinos on a monthly basis however this need is not always met due to stock-outs and lack of knowledge on the part of health workers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iol.co.za/weekend-argus/lifestyle/albinos-have-higher-cancer-risk-7632653 Accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www0.sun.ac.za/vivus/vivus-1-february-2017/engagement/doctors-reach-out-to-children-at-risk-for-skin-cancer.html Accessed 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racial classification====
Racial appearance and descent played a key role in the racial classification process during [[Apartheid]]. Additionally, different sociological and psychological give skin colour its many connotations. Skin colour is traditionally an instant indicator of identifying race and racial differences. Traditional definitions of race suggest that race and colour are inseparable however, for people with albinism race and colour are not linked. Though colour and race are used interchangeably, they remain independent grounds for discrimination. Individuals living with albinism should be protected against unfair discrimination on the basis of their race as well as their skin tone. Individuals living with albinism are exposed to discrimination, stigmatisation and prejudice based on their colour as well as their race. Skin tone discrimination may be interracial or it can be intraracial. Intraracial skin colour discrimination occurs when an individual of a particular racial group makes a distinction on the basis of skin colour between persons of the same racial group, while interracial colourism takes place when an individual of a particular racial group makes a distinction on the basis of skin colour between persons of another racial group. Scott argues that because current classifications of race do not afford people living with albinism adequate protection, a new category of colour should be proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Scott S. A new category of colour: Analyzing albinism under Title VII of the Americans with Disabilities Act. J Gender Race &amp; Just 1999;2(2):508.&lt;/ref&gt; Mswela argues that additional divisions and classifications of race will reinforce problems associated with race.&lt;ref&gt;S Afr J BL 2013;6(1):25-27.

====Discrimination====
The difference in appearance in the child with albinism creates socialization and adaption problems. The distinctive phenotypical difference of black (African) people with albinism and the rest of the population group leads to barriers in social integration thus ostracism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; South Africans living with albinism are among the most vulnerable in the country and there is hardly a serious attempt to protect these citizens from human rights violations, violent crimes, and threats. The extent of violent crimes for people with albinism is not as high as other African countries however, surges of violent crimes against people with albinism have been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Mswela.  African Human Rights Law Journal, Volume 17 Number 1, Aug 2017, p. 114 - 133. https://journals.co.za/content/journal/10520/EJC-8dc964ce9 Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Their sensitivity to sunlight, which limits the extent to which they can participate in outdoor activities, contributes to the physical and social isolation of children living with albinism.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; There has been an obligation and responsibility placed on the government to protect vulnerable people after the constitutional court decision on the [[Carmichele v Minister of Safety &amp; Security]] case. The litigation in the Carmichele case creates a strategy for bringing a precautionary suit against the state based on the contention that the state has a duty to protect persons with albinism from violent acts.&lt;ref&gt;M Mswela ‘Violent attacks against persons with albinism in South Africa: A human rights perspective ’ (2017) 17 African Human Rights Law Journal 114-133

==== '''Community and Personal Identity''' ====
African people who suffer from Albinism are inherently stuck between two racial identities. One side of the spectrum views Albino people as white, due to the color of their skin.  Another person might view Albinos as members of the black community due to the skin color of their other family members. Another contributor to this identity crisis is the negative stigma that surrounds Albino people within African society. The falsely informed notion that babies are born with Albinism as a result of a curse that was brought on by a member of his/her family is a significant weight that leaves people with Albinism debating their dignity. One thing to recognize is that studies done on Albinistic Africans demonstrate that many have a very deep self-understanding of who they are and where they belong in society &lt;ref&gt;Blankenberg, Ngaire. “That Rare and Random Tribe: Albino Identity in South Africa.”&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, the two polarizing color identities that Albino people fall under allow them to be very sure of themselves when they do eventually find their place in society. Family and community also play an essential role in Albinistic identity. The way that a community behaves toward an individual can make or break their sense of self. Research shows that social identities enhance members' well‐being through the provision of social support and feelings of collective efficacy as well as by acting as a basis for collective action&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Niamh, et al. “Community Identity as Resource and Context: A Mixed Method Investigation of Coping and Collective Action in a Disadvantaged Community.” 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. In most cases, the surrounding community and family of Albinos highly mediates their acceptance&lt;ref&gt;Blankenberg, Ngaire. “That Rare and Random Tribe: Albino Identity in South Africa.”&lt;/ref&gt;. Plans for the future, in regards to eliminating persecution and negative stigmas that encompass individuals who have Albinism, appear to incorporate methods that involve focusing on community and family-based acceptance complementary to institutionally-based changes.

====Myths====
Many African communities depend on traditional explanations of albinism rather than the biomedical explanation. This often leads to a negative socialisation of the individual with albinism.&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt; People living with albinism are often referred to by derogatory names such as 'inkawu', the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] term for white baboon, 'isishawa' a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] translation of a person who is cursed as well as 'zeru zeru' which means ghost like.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2017/06/05/being-black-in-a-white-skin-students-with-albinism-battle-prejudice Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
The Swahili term 'zeru' is also commonly used in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sowetan/archive/2008/09/03/under-skins-of-fear Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Three people were convicted of the murder of 20 year old Thandazile Mpunzi, including her 17 year old boyfriend. The boyfriend lured Mpunzi to an isolated area on the afternoon of August 1, 2015 in the Phelandaba area of Emanguzi in northern [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. She was strangled, murdered and body parts dismembered. They planned to sell the body parts of Thandazile Mpunzi for a fortune. They claimed that a [[traditional healer]] told them they would get rich if they mixed Mpunzi's blood and parts with 'muthi'. Two of the accused pleaded guilty of murder and are sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. Numerous accounts of murdered as well as missing people with albinism are reported. The trading of albino body parts has become a lucrative business.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21700395-superstition-fuelling-grisly-trade-human-body-parts-tanzania-shows-how-it-can-be Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enca.com/south-africa/kzn-teenager-gets-18-year-sentence-albino-girlfriends-muti-murder Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enca.com/south-africa/missing-albino-boys-family-not-suspects-says-police Accessed 3 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
After events involving murders of albino people by three Tanzanian men had been publicised by the [[BBC News|BBC]] and others, the [[European Parliament]] strongly condemned the killing of albinos in Tanzania on 4 September 2008.&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0413+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=Resolution on the killing of albinos in Tanzania |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The U.S. House of Representatives passed H. Resolution 1088, introduced by Rep. Gerry Connolly ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]], [[Virginia|VA]]), by a vote of 418-1 on 22 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hr1088/show H.

{{Political corruption sidebar}}

'''Political corruption''' is the use of powers by government officials or their network contacts for illegitimate private gain. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties, is done under [[color of law]] or involves [[Influence peddling|trading in influence]].

Forms of [[corruption]] vary, but include [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[parochialism]], [[patronage]], [[influence peddling]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. Corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking]], though is not restricted to these activities. Misuse of [[government]] power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is also considered political corruption. [[Corruption in Lithuania#Examples post-2016|Masiulis case]] is a typical example of political corruption.

The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, some political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or ill-defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.
Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=African corruption 'on the wane'|date=10 July 2007|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".

Some forms of corruption – now called "institutional corruption"&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis. ''Ethics in Congress: From Individual to Institutional Corruption'' (Washington DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1995).  {{ISBN|0-8157-8423-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; – are distinguished from bribery and other kinds of obvious personal gain.  A similar problem of corruption arises in any institution that depends on financial support from people who have interests that may conflict with the primary purpose of the institution.

Over time, corruption has been defined differently. For example, in a simple context, while performing work for a government or as a representative, it is unethical to accept a gift. Any free gift could be construed as a scheme to lure the recipient towards some biases. In most cases, the gift is seen as an intention to seek certain favors such as work promotion, tipping in order to win a contract, job or exemption from certain tasks in the case of junior employee giving the gift to a senior employee who can be key in winning the favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|date=1998-12-01|title=Corruption Around the World: Causes, Consequences, Scope, and Cures|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.2307/3867585|journal=Staff Papers|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=559–594|doi=10.2307/3867585|issn=0020-8027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
===Effects on politics, administration, and institutions===
In politics, corruption undermines democracy and [[good governance]] by flouting or even subverting formal processes. Corruption in elections and in the legislature reduces accountability and distorts representation in policymaking; corruption in the judiciary compromises the [[rule of law]]; and corruption in [[public administration]] results in the inefficient provision of services.  It violates a basic principle of [[republicanism]] regarding the centrality of civic virtue.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank"/&gt;

More generally, corruption erodes the institutional capacity of government if procedures are disregarded, resources are siphoned off, and public offices are bought and sold. Corruption undermines the legitimacy of government and such democratic values as trust and tolerance. Recent evidence suggests that variation in the levels of corruption amongst high-income democracies can vary significantly depending on the level of accountability of decision-makers.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first= Alexander |year=2013 |title= Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf |format=PDF |publisher= World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from [[fragile state]]s also shows that corruption and bribery can adversely impact trust in institutions.&lt;ref name="bath.ac.uk"&gt;Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J. (2014) The Tribes that Bind: Attitudes to the Tribe and Tribal Leader in the Sudan. Bath Economic Research Papers 31/14. [http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, A 2014"&gt;Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J. (2014) Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan. Bath Economic Research Papers 30/14.[http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/30-14.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can also impact government’s provision of goods and services. It increases the costs of goods and services which arise efficiency loss. In the absence of corruption, governmental projects might be cost-effective at their true costs, however, once corruption costs are included projects may not be cost-effective so they are not executed distorting the provision of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Economic effects===
{{see also|Economics of corruption|Corporate crime}}
In the [[private sector]], corruption increases the cost of business through the price of illicit payments themselves, the management cost of negotiating with officials and the risk of breached agreements or detection. Although some claim corruption reduces costs by cutting [[bureaucracy]], the availability of bribes can also induce officials to contrive new rules and delays. Openly removing costly and lengthy regulations are better than covertly allowing them to be bypassed by using bribes. Where corruption inflates the cost of business, it also distorts the field of inquiry and action, shielding firms with connections from competition and thereby sustaining inefficient firms.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros, [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think "Corruption and development.

Corruption may have a direct impact on the firm's effective marginal tax rate. Bribing tax officials can reduce tax payments of the firm if the marginal bribe rate is below the official marginal tax rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in Uganda, bribes have a higher negative impact on firms’ activity than taxation. Indeed, a one percentage point increase in bribes reduces firm’s annual growth by three percentage points, while an increase in 1 percentage point on taxes reduces firm’s growth by one percentage point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisman|first=Raymond|last2=Svensson|first2=Jakob|date=2007|title=Are corruption and taxation really harmful to growth?

Corruption also generates economic distortion in the [[public sector]] by diverting public investment into capital projects where bribes and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] are more plentiful. Officials may increase the technical complexity of public sector projects to conceal or pave the way for such dealings, thus further distorting investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309123826/http://www.uneca.org/aec/documents/Mina%20Baliamoune-Lutz_%20Leonce%20Ndikumana.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-09 |title=Corruption and growth in African countries: Exploring the investment channel, lead author Mina Baliamoune-Lutz, Department of Economics |publisher=University of North Florida |page=1,2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption also lowers compliance with construction, environmental, or other regulations, reduces the quality of government services and infrastructure, and increases budgetary pressures on government.

Economists argue that one of the factors behind the differing [[economic development]] in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] is that in Africa, corruption has primarily taken the form of [[rent seeking|rent extraction]] with the resulting [[financial capital]] moved overseas rather than invested at home (hence the stereotypical, but often accurate, image of African dictators having [[Swiss bank|Swiss bank accounts]]). In [[Nigeria]], for example, more than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/nigerias-corruption-busters.html |title=Nigeria's corruption busters |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] researchers estimated that from 1970 to 1996, [[capital flight]] from 30 [[Sub-Saharan]] countries totaled $187bn, exceeding those nations' external debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |title=When the money goes west |publisher=New Statesman |date=2005-03-14 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706191351/http://www.newstatesman.com/Economy/200503140015 |archivedate=July 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The results, expressed in retarded or suppressed development, have been modeled in theory by economist [[Mancur Olson]].) In the case of Africa, one of the factors for this behavior was political instability and the fact that new governments often confiscated previous government's corruptly obtained assets. This encouraged officials to stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future [[Nationalization|expropriation]]. In contrast, Asian administrations such as [[Suharto]]'s [[Orde Baru|New Order]] often took a cut on business transactions or provided conditions for development, through infrastructure investment, law and order, etc.

===Environmental and social effects===
{{further|Human impact on the environment}}
[[File:Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|Detail from ''Corrupt Legislation'' (1896) by [[Elihu Vedder]]. Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
Corruption is often most evident in countries with the smallest per capita incomes, relying on foreign aid for health services. Local political interception of donated money from overseas is especially prevalent in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n nations, where it was reported in the 2006 [[World Bank|World Bank Report]] that about half of the funds that were donated for health usages were never invested into the health sectors or given to those needing medical attention.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10.2307/20032209|title=The Challenge of Global Health on JSTOR|publisher=|doi=10.2307/20032209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, the donated money was expended through "[[Counterfeit medications|counterfeit drugs]], siphoning off of drugs to the black market, and payments to ghost employees". Ultimately, there is a sufficient amount of money for health in developing countries, but local corruption denies the wider citizenry the resource they require.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Corruption facilitates environmental destruction. While corrupt societies may have formal legislation to protect the environment, it cannot be enforced if officials can easily be bribed. The same applies to social rights worker protection, [[Trade union|unionization]] prevention, and [[child labor]]. Violation of these laws rights enables corrupt countries to gain illegitimate economic advantage in the international market.

The [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] has observed that "there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem." While drought and other naturally occurring events may trigger [[famine]] conditions, it is government action or inaction that determines its severity, and often even whether or not a famine will occur.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/08/15/wipro-tata-corruption-ent-law-cx_kw_0814whartonindia.html|title=Will Growth Slow Corruption In India?|publisher=Forbes | date=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments with strong tendencies towards [[kleptocracy]] can undermine [[food security]] even when harvests are good. Officials often steal state property. In [[Bihar]], [[India]], more than 80% of the subsidized food aid to poor is stolen by corrupt officials.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; Similarly, food aid is often robbed at gunpoint by governments, criminals, and warlords alike, and sold for a profit. The 20th century is full of many examples of governments undermining the food security of their own nations – sometimes intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheeter |first=Laura |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm |title=Ukraine remembers famine horror |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-11-24 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on humanitarian aid===
The scale of [[humanitarian aid]] to the poor and unstable regions of the world grows, but it is highly [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to corruption, with food aid, construction and other highly valued assistance as the most at risk.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Sarah Bailey (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2385&amp;title=corruption-risks-perceptions-prevention-humanitarian-assistance Need and greed: corruption risks, perceptions and prevention in humanitarian assistance] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Food aid can be directly and physically diverted from its intended destination, or indirectly through the manipulation of assessments, targeting, registration and distributions to favor certain groups or individuals.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

In construction and shelter there are numerous opportunities for diversion and profit through substandard workmanship, kickbacks for contracts and favouritism in the provision of valuable shelter material.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Thus while humanitarian aid agencies are usually most concerned about aid being diverted by including too many, recipients themselves are most concerned about exclusion.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Access to aid may be limited to those with connections, to those who pay bribes or are forced to give sexual favors.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Equally, those able to do so may manipulate statistics to inflate the number of beneficiaries and siphon off additional assistance.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Malnutrition, illness, wounds, torture, harassment of specific groups within the population, disappearances, extra-judicial executions and the forcible displacement of people are all found in many armed conflicts. Aside from their direct effects on the individuals concerned, the consequences of these tragedies for local systems must also be considered: the destruction of crops and places of cultural importance, the breakdown of economic infrastructure and of health-care facilities such as hospitals, etc., etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jpcj.htm|title=The impact of humanitarian aid on conflict development - ICRC|first=Pierre|last=Perrin|date=30 June 1998|website=www.icrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on health===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Corruption plays a huge role in health care system starting from the hospital, to the government and lifted to the other institutions that promote quality and affordable health care to the people. The efficiency of health care delivery in any country is heavily dependent on accountable and transparent systems, proper management of both financial and human resources and timely supply of services to the vulnerable populace of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nazim|first=Habibov|date=March 2016|title=Effect of corruption on healthcare satisfaction in post-soviet nations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.044|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|pages= 119–124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the basic level, greed skyrockets corruption. When the structure of the health care system is not adequately addressed beginning from oversight in healthcare delivery and supply of drugs and tendering process, mismanagement and misappropriation of funds will always be observed.Corruption also can undermine health care service delivery which in turn disorients the lives of the poor. Corruption leads to violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms as people supposed to benefit from the basic health care from the governments are denied due to unscrupulous processes driven by greed. Therefore, for a country to keep citizens healthy there must be efficient systems and proper resources that can tame the evils like corruption that underpin it.

=== Effects on Education ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

Education forms the basis and the fabric in which a society is transformed and different facets of well-being are shaped.Corruption in higher education has been prevalent and calls for immediate intervention. Increased corruption in higher education has led to growing global concern among governments, students and educators and other stakeholders. Those offering services in the higher education institutions are facing pressure that highly threatens the integral value of higher education enterprise. Corruption in higher education has a larger negative influence, it destroys the relation between personal effort and reward anticipation. Moreover, employees and students develop a belief that personal success does not come from hard work and merit but through canvassing with teachers and taking other shortcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borcan|first=Oana|date=February 2017|title=Fighting corruption in education|url=|journal=American Economic Journal|volume= 9|pages= 180–209|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic promotions in the higher education institutions have been disabled by unlimited corruption. Presently, promotion is based on personal connections than professional achievements. This has led to dramatic increase in the number of professors and exhibits their rapid status loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altbach|first=Philiph|date=2015|title=The Question of Corruption|url=|journal=International Higher Education|volume= 34|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utmost the flawed processes in the academic institutions has led to unbaked graduates who are not well fit to the job market. Corruption hinders the international standards of an education system. Additionally, Plagiarism is a form of corruption in academic research, where it affects originality and disables learning. Individual violations are in close relation to the operation ways of a system.

Furthermore, the universities may be in relationships and dealings with business and people in government, which majority of them enrol in doctoral studies without the undergraduate program.Consequently, money, power and related influence compromise education standards since they are fueling factors. A Student may finish thesis report within a shorter time upon which compromises the quality of work delivered and questions the threshold of the higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heyneman|first=Stephen|date=2015|title=The corruption of ethics in higher education|url=|journal=International Higher Education|volume= 62|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other areas:public safety, trade unions, police corruption etc. ===
{{see also|academic corruption}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}&lt;!--many scandalous examples, each of which should have a reference to serious documentation--&gt;
Corruption is not specific to poor, developing, or transition countries. In western countries, cases of bribery and other forms of corruption in all possible fields exist: under-the-table payments made to reputed surgeons by patients attempting to be on top of the list of forthcoming surgeries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Cash+bribes+patients+atop+surgery+waiting+lists/3893239/story.html |title=Cash bribes put patients atop surgery waiting lists |publisher=''The Vancouver Sun'' |date=November 27, 2010 |last=Fidelman |first=Charlie |accessdate=2011-01-21 }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; bribes paid by suppliers to the automotive industry in order to sell low-quality connectors used for instance in safety equipment such as airbags, bribes paid by suppliers to manufacturers of defibrillators (to sell low-quality capacitors), contributions paid by wealthy parents to the "social and culture fund" of a prestigious university in exchange for it to accept their children, bribes paid to obtain diplomas, financial and other advantages granted to unionists by members of the executive board of a car manufacturer in exchange for employer-friendly positions and votes, etc. Examples are endless.

These various manifestations of corruption can ultimately present a danger for public health; they can discredit specific, essential institutions or social relationships.   Osipian summarized a 2008 "study of corruption perceptions among Russians ... .30 percent of the respondents marked the level of corruption as very high, while another 44 percent as high. 19 percent considered it as average and only 1 percent as low. The most corrupt in people's minds are traffic police (33 percent), local authorities (28 percent), police (26 percent), healthcare (16 percent), and education (15 percent). 52 percent of the respondents had experiences of giving money or gifts to
medical professionals while 36 percent made informal payments to educators." He claimed that this corruption lowered the rate of economic growth in Russia, because the students disadvantaged by this corruption could not adopt better work methods as quickly, lowering thereby [[total factor productivity]] for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osipian|first1=Ararat|title=Education Corruption, Reform, and Growth: Case of Post-Soviet Russia|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/17447/|website=Munich Personal RePEc Archive|publisher=Munich University Library|accessdate=2016-05-21|date=2009-09-22|ref = MPRA Paper No. 17447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can also affect the various components of sports activities (referees, players, medical and laboratory staff involved in anti-doping controls, members of national sport federation and international committees deciding about the allocation of contracts and competition places).

Cases exist against (members of) various types of non-profit and non-government organizations, as well as religious organizations.

Ultimately, the distinction between public and private sector corruption sometimes appears rather artificial, and national anti-corruption initiatives may need to avoid legal and other loopholes in the coverage of the instruments.

==Types==

===Bribery===
{{Main|Bribery}}
In the context of political corruption, a bribe may involve a payment given to a government official in exchange of his use of official powers. [[Bribery]] requires two participants: one to give the bribe, and one to take it. Either may initiate the corrupt offering; for example, a customs official may demand bribes to let through allowed (or disallowed) goods, or a smuggler might offer bribes to gain passage. In some countries the culture of corruption extends to every aspect of public life, making it extremely difficult for individuals to operate without resorting to bribes. Bribes may be demanded in order for an official to do something he is already paid to do. They may also be demanded in order to bypass laws and regulations. In addition to their role in private financial gain, bribes are also used to intentionally and maliciously cause harm to another (i.e. no financial incentive).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In some developing nations, up to half of the population has paid bribes during the past 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |title= How common is bribe-paying? |quote=...a relatively high proportion of families in a group of Central Eastern European, African, and Latin American countries paid a bribe in the previous twelve months. |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120405045051/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2005/09_12_2005_barometer_2005 |archivedate= April 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] dissociates active and passive bribery and to incriminates them as separate offences:

* One can define '''active bribery''' as "the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage to any of its public officials, for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions" (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007f3f5 |title= Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 173 |publisher= Conventions.coe.int |accessdate= 2016-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]]). 
* '''Passive bribery''' can be defined as "when committed intentionally, the request or receipt by any [...] public officials, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions" (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

This dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "fee" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174):&lt;ref name="conventions"/&gt;  ''For the purpose of this Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.

===Trading in influence===
{{Main|Influence peddling}}
[[File:The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|"The Bosses of the Senate by Joseph Keppler" (1889)|Reformers like the American [[Joseph Keppler]] depicted the Senate as controlled by the giant moneybags, who represented the nation's financial trusts and monopolies.]]
Trading in influence, or [[influence peddling]], refers a person selling his/her influence over the decision making process to benefit a third party (person or institution). The difference with bribery is that this is a tri-lateral relation. From a legal point of view, the role of the third party (who is the target of the influence) does not really matter although he/she can be an accessory in some instances. It can be difficult to make a distinction between this form of corruption and some forms of extreme and loosely regulated [[lobbying]] where for instance law- or decision-makers can freely "sell" their vote, decision power or influence to those lobbyists who offer the highest compensation, including where for instance the latter act on behalf of powerful clients such as industrial groups who want to avoid the passing of specific environmental, social, or other regulations perceived as too stringent, etc. Where lobbying is (sufficiently) regulated, it becomes possible to provide for a distinctive criteria and to consider that trading in influence involves the use of "improper influence", as in article 12 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; of the [[Council of Europe]].

===Patronage===
{{Main|Patronage}}
[[Patronage]] refers to favoring supporters, for example with government employment. This may be legitimate, as when a newly elected government changes the top officials in the administration in order to effectively implement its policy. It can be seen as corruption if this means that incompetent persons, as a payment for supporting the regime, are selected before more able ones. In nondemocracies many government officials are often selected for loyalty rather than ability. They may be almost exclusively selected from a particular group (for example, [[Sunni]] Arabs in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s Iraq, the [[nomenklatura]] in the [[Soviet Union]], or the [[Junker]]s in [[Imperial Germany]]) that support the regime in return for such favors. A similar problem can also be seen in Eastern Europe, for example in [[Romania]], where the government is often accused of [[patronage]] (when a new government comes to power it rapidly changes most of the officials in the public sector).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher |first=Tom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443792604577572910124653818 |title=The EU Can't Ignore Its Romania Problem |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The above was replaced 2014-09-03 with the following reference to Pakistan.  This is unacceptable, because it is potentially libelous without a citation to a credible source.  I'm placing this comment here, because the edit was made anonymously, i.e., by an IP number -- and it was made it 2 steps, which meant that I couldn't just revert it.  If the author is invited to insert this change here again with an appropriate source but without destroying the reference to Romania.  It might be appropriate to add sections on both Romania and Pakistan to the Wikipedia article on "Patronage".  If that was done, it might be appropriate to delete the reference to Romania here, retaining the one to Pakistan -- provided it was supported by solid reference(s). // Addition deleted:  "[[Pakistan]], where the government is often accused of patronage ; namely Benazir, Zardari and Mian Nawaz Sharif are labeled corrupt politicians having numerous cases of corruption. Currently the Prime minister of Pakistan Mian Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif are accused of murder."  --&gt;

===Nepotism and cronyism===
{{Main|Nepotism|Cronyism}}
Favoring relatives ([[nepotism]]) or personal friends ([[cronyism]]) of an official is a form of illegitimate private gain. This may be combined with [[bribery]], for example demanding that a business should employ a [[kinship|relative]] of an official controlling regulations affecting the business. The most extreme example is when the entire state is inherited, as in [[North Korea]] or [[Syria]]. A lesser form might be in the Southern United States with [[Good ol' boy]]s, where women and minorities are excluded. A milder form of cronyism is an "[[old boy network]]", in which appointees to official positions are selected only from a closed and exclusive social network – such as the alumni of particular universities – instead of appointing the most competent candidate.

Seeking to harm enemies becomes corruption when official powers are illegitimately used as means to this end. For example, trumped-up charges are often brought up against journalists or writers who bring up politically sensitive issues, such as a politician's acceptance of bribes.

===Gombeenism and parochialism===
{{Main|Gombeen man|Parochialism}}
[[Gombeen man|Gombeenism]] refers to an individual who is dishonest and corrupt for the purpose of personal gain, more often through monetary, while, [[parochialism]] which is also known as parish pump politics relates to placing local or vanity projects ahead of the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R.

===Electoral fraud===
{{Main|Electoral fraud}}
'''Electoral fraud''' is illegal interference with the process of an [[election]]. Acts of [[fraud]] affect vote counts to bring about an election result, whether by increasing the vote share of the favored candidate, depressing the vote share of the rival candidates, or both. Also called '''voter fraud''', the mechanisms involved include illegal voter registration, intimidation at polls, voting computer [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], and improper vote counting.

===Embezzlement===
{{Main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] is the theft of entrusted funds. It is political when it involves public money taken by a public official for use by anyone not specified by the public. A common type of embezzlement is that of personal use of entrusted government resources; for example, when an official assigns public employees to renovate his own house.

===Kickbacks===
{{main|Kickback (bribery)}}
{{see also|Anti-competitive practices|Bid rigging|Fraud|Charbonneau Commission}}
A [[Money trail|kickback]] is an official's share of misappropriated funds allocated from his or her organization to an organization involved in corrupt [[bidding]]. For example, suppose that a politician is in charge of choosing how to spend some public funds. He can give a [[contract]] to a [[General contractor|company]] that is not the best bidder, or allocate more than they deserve. In this case, the company benefits, and in exchange for betraying the public, the official receives a kickback payment, which is a portion of the sum the company received. This sum itself may be all or a portion of the difference between the actual (inflated) payment to the company and the (lower) market-based price that would have been paid had the bidding been competitive.

Another example of a kickback would be if a judge receives a portion of the profits that a business makes in exchange for his judicial decisions.

Kickbacks are not limited to government officials; any situation in which people are entrusted to spend funds that do not belong to them are susceptible to this kind of corruption.

===Unholy alliance===
{{Main|Unholy alliance (geopolitical)}}
An [[Unholy alliance (geopolitical)|unholy alliance]] is a coalition among seemingly antagonistic groups for [[ad hoc]] or hidden gain, generally some influential non-governmental group forming ties with political parties, supplying funding in exchange for the favorable treatment. Like patronage, unholy alliances are not necessarily illegal, but unlike patronage, by its deceptive nature and often great financial resources, an unholy alliance can be much more dangerous to the [[public interest]]. An early use of the term was by former US President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt]]:

:"To destroy this invisible Government, to dissolve the '''unholy alliance''' between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day." – 1912 [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] Platform, attributed to Roosevelt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patricia O''Toole Sunday, Jun. 25, 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207791-2,00.html |title=O'Toole, Patricia, "The War of 1912," TIME in Partnership with CNN, Jun. 25, 2006 |publisher=Time.com |date=2006-06-25 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quoted again in his autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/55/15b.html |title=Roosevelt, Theodore. ''An Autobiography:'' XV. The Peace of Righteousness, Appendix B, New York: Macmillan, 1913 |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he connects [[trust (19th century)|trusts]] and [[monopoly|monopolies]] (sugar interests, [[Standard Oil]], etc.) to [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Howard Taft]], and consequently both major [[political parties]].

===Involvement in organized crime===
An illustrative example of official involvement in [[organized crime]] can be found from 1920s and 1930s [[Shanghai]], where Huang Jinrong was a police chief in the [[French concession]], while simultaneously being a gang boss and co-operating with [[Du Yuesheng]], the [[Green Gang|local gang]] ringleader. The relationship kept the flow of profits from the gang's gambling dens, prostitution, and protection rackets undisturbed.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The United States accused [[Manuel Noriega]]'s government in [[Panama]] of being a "[[narcokleptocracy]]", a corrupt government profiting on [[illegal drug trade]]. Later the U.S. invaded Panama and captured Noriega.

==Conditions favorable for corruption==
It is argued that the following conditions are favorable for corruption:
* Information deficits
** Lacking [[freedom of information legislation]]. In contrast, for example: The Indian [[Right to Information Act]] 2005 is perceived to have "already engendered mass movements in the country that is bringing the lethargic, often corrupt bureaucracy to its knees and changing power equations completely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |title=AsiaMedia :: Right to Information Act India's magic wand against corruption |publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu |date=2006-08-31 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926172330/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=52046 |archivedate=2008-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Lack of investigative reporting in the local media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/feature/investigative_journalists_as_anti_corruption_activists_interview_gerardo_re |title=Investigative journalists as anti-corruption activists: An interview with Gerardo Reyes |publisher=Transparency.org |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Contempt for or negligence of exercising [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]].
** Weak [[accounting]] practices, including lack of timely financial management.
** Lack of measurement of corruption. For example, using regular surveys of households and businesses in order to quantify the degree of perception of corruption in different parts of a nation or in different government institutions may increase awareness of corruption and create pressure to combat it. This will also enable an evaluation of the officials who are fighting corruption and the methods used.
** [[Tax haven]]s which tax their own citizens and companies but not those from other nations and refuse to disclose information necessary for foreign taxation. This enables large-scale political corruption in the foreign nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,,1994976,00.html |title=Western bankers and lawyers 'rob Africa of $150bn every year |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2009-12-05 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Mathiason}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
* Lacking control of the government.
** Lacking [[civic society]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s which monitor the government.
** An individual voter may have a [[rational ignorance]] regarding politics, especially in nationwide elections, since each vote has little weight.
** Weak [[civil service]], and slow pace of [[Civil service reform in developing countries|reform]].
** Weak [[rule of law]].
** Weak [[Lawyer|legal profession]].
** Weak [[judicial independence]].
** Lacking protection of [[whistleblower]]s.
*** [[Government Accountability Project]]
** Lack of [[benchmarking]], that is continual detailed evaluation of procedures and comparison to others who do similar things, in the same government or others, in particular comparison to those who do the best work. The Peruvian organization Ciudadanos al Dia has started to measure and compare transparency, costs, and efficiency in different government departments in Peru. It annually awards the best practices which has received widespread media attention. This has created competition among government agencies in order to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |title=Why benchmarking works – PSD Blog – World Bank Group |publisher=Psdblog.worldbank.org |date=2006-08-17 |accessdate=2009-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920181947/http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more |archive-date=2009-09-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Individual officials routinely handle cash, instead of handling payments by [[giro]] or on a separate cash desk – illegitimate withdrawals from supervised bank accounts are much more difficult to conceal.
** Public funds are centralized rather than distributed. For example, if $1,000 is embezzled from a local agency that has $2,000 funds, it is easier to notice than from a national agency with $2,000,000 funds. See the [[subsidiarity|principle of subsidiarity]].
** Large, unsupervised public investments.
** Pay disproportionately lower than that of the average citizen. 
** Government licenses needed to conduct business, e.g., [[import license]]s, encourage bribing and kickbacks.
** Long-time work in the same position may create relationships inside and outside the government which encourage and help conceal corruption and favoritism. Rotating government officials to different positions and geographic areas may help prevent this; for instance certain high rank officials in French government services (e.g. [[Trésor public|treasurer-paymasters general]]) must rotate every few years.
** Costly [[political campaign]]s, with expenses exceeding normal sources of political funding, especially when funded with taxpayer money.
** A single group or family controlling most of the key government offices.  Lack of laws forbidding and limiting number of members of the same family to be in office .
** Less interaction with officials reduces the opportunities for corruption. For example, using the Internet for sending in required information, like applications and tax forms, and then processing this with automated computer systems. This may also speed up the processing and reduce unintentional human errors. See [[e-Government]].
** A windfall from exporting abundant natural resources may encourage corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |title=Resources for Sale: Corruption, Democracy and the Natural Resource Curse |format=PDF |last1=Damania |first1=Richard |first2=Erwin |last2=Bulte |date=July 2003 |publisher=Centre for International Economic Studies, University of Adelaide |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906123659/http://www.adelaide.edu.au/cies/papers/0320.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See [[Resource curse]])''
** [[War]] and other forms of conflict correlate with a breakdown of [[public security]].
* Social conditions
** Self-interested closed cliques and "[[old boy network]]s".
** Family-, and clan-centered social structure, with a tradition of [[nepotism]]/favouritism being acceptable.
** A [[gift economy]], such as the Soviet [[Blat (term)|blat]] system, emerges in a Communist [[centrally planned economy]].
** Lacking [[literacy]] and [[education]] among the population.
** Frequent [[discrimination]] and [[bullying]] among the population.
** Tribal solidarity, giving benefits to certain ethnic groups.  In India for example, the political system, it has become common that the leadership of national and regional parties are passed from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2011/01/is_india_sliding_into_a.html |title=Is India sliding into a hereditary monarchy?|author=Soutik Biswas |date=2011-01-18 |work=BBC |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/column/the-gandhi-dynasty-politics-as-usual/20110805.htm|title=The Gandhi dynasty: Politics as usual|first1=Manjeet|last1=Deo|last2=Kripalani |date=2011-08-05 |work=Rediff|publisher=Rediff News|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** creating a system in which a family holds the center of power. Some examples are most of the Dravidian parties of south India and also the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]], which is one of the two major political parties in India.
** Lack of strong laws which forbid members of the same family to contest elections and be in office as in India where local elections are often contested between members of the same powerful family by standing in opposite parties so that whoever is elected that particular family is at tremendous benefit.

===Media===
[[q:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] observed a tendency for "The functionaries of every government ... to command at will the liberty and property of their constituents.  There is no safe deposit [for liberty and property] ... without information. Where the press is free, and every man able to read, all is safe."

Recent research supports Jefferson's claim.  Brunetti and Weder found "evidence of a significant relationship between more press freedom and less corruption in a large cross-section of countries." They also presented "evidence which suggests that the direction of causation runs from higher press freedom to lower corruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Snyder and Strömberg found "that a poor fit between newspaper markets and political districts reduces press coverage of politics. ... Congressmen who are less covered by the local press work less for their constituencies: they are less likely to stand witness before congressional hearings ... . Federal spending is lower in areas where there is less press coverage of the local members of congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

An analysis of the evolution of mass media in the [[United States]] and [[European Union]] since World War II noted mixed results from the growth of the Internet:  "The digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [and] information [but] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press":  It has disrupted traditional sources of funding, and new forms of Internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what's been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Starr| first = Paul | year = 2012

===Size of public sector===
Extensive and diverse public spending is, in itself, inherently at risk of cronyism, kickbacks, and embezzlement. Complicated regulations and arbitrary, unsupervised official conduct exacerbate the problem. This is one argument for [[privatization]] and [[deregulation]]. Opponents of privatization see the argument as ideological. The argument that corruption necessarily follows from the opportunity is weakened by the existence of countries with low to non-existent corruption but large public sectors, like the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sachs110 |title=Lessons From the North|publisher=Project Syndicate |date= |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries score high on the [[Ease of Doing Business Index]], due to good and often simple regulations and have [[rule of law]] firmly established. Therefore, due to their lack of corruption in the first place, they can run large public sectors without inducing political corruption. Recent evidence that takes both the size of expenditures and regulatory complexity into account has found that high-income democracies with more expansive state sectors do indeed have higher levels of corruption.&lt;ref name="www-wds.worldbank" /&gt;

Like other governmental economic activities, also privatization, such as in the sale of government-owned property, is particularly at the risk of cronyism. Privatizations in Russia, Latin America, and East Germany were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have reported widely the grand corruption that accompanied the sales, studies have argued that in addition to increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less.&lt;ref&gt;Privatization in Competitive Sectors: The Record to Date. Sunita Kikeri and John Nellis. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 2860, June 2002. [http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf Econ.Chula.ac.th] artimort.pdf IDEI.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325112620/http://www.econ.chula.ac.th/about/member/sothitorn/privatization.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the principle of subsidiarity is applied: a government service should be provided by the lowest, most local authority that can competently provide it. An effect is that distribution of funds in multiple instances discourages embezzlement because even small sums missing will be noticed. In contrast, in a centralized authority, even minute proportions of public funds can be large sums of money.

==Governmental corruption==
If the highest echelons of the governments also take advantage of corruption or embezzlement from the state's treasury, it is sometimes referred to the [[neologism]] ''[[kleptocracy]]''. Members of the government can take advantage of the [[natural resource]]s (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid. Indeed, there is a positive correlation between aid flows and high levels of corruption within recipient countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Svensson |first=Jakob |year=2000 |title=Foreign Aid and Rent-Seeking |doi=10.1016/S0022-1996(99)00014-8 |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=437–461 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alesina |first=Alberto |authorlink=Alberto Alesina |last2=Weder |first2=Beatrice |authorlink2=Beatrice Weder di Mauro |year=2002 |title=Do Corrupt Governments Receive less Foreign Aid? |doi=10.1257/00028280260344669 |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corrupt [[dictatorship]] typically results in many years of general hardship and suffering for the vast majority of citizens as [[civil society]] and the [[rule of law]] disintegrate. In addition, corrupt dictators routinely ignore economic and [[society|social]] problems in their quest to amass ever more wealth and power.

The classic case of a corrupt, exploitive dictator often given is the regime of [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko]], who ruled the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (which he renamed [[Zaire]]) from 1965 to 1997. It is said that usage of the term [[kleptocracy]] gained popularity largely in response to a need to accurately describe Mobutu's regime. Another classic case is [[Nigeria]], especially under the rule of General [[Sani Abacha]] who was ''[[de facto]]'' president of Nigeria from 1993 until his death in 1998.  He is reputed to have stolen some [[US$]]3–4 billion.  He and his relatives are often mentioned in [[Advance-fee fraud|Nigerian 419 letter scams]] claiming to offer vast fortunes for "help" in laundering his stolen "fortunes", which in reality turn out not to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Who wants to be a millionaire? – An online collection of Nigerian scam mails&lt;/ref&gt; More than $400 billion was stolen from the treasury by Nigeria's leaders between 1960 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nigeria's corruption totals $400 billion |publisher=''[[Malaysia Today]]'' |date=June 27, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211033642/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm |archivedate=2007-12-11|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/06/nigerias-corruption-totals-400-billion.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, articles in various financial periodicals, most notably ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, have pointed to [[Fidel Castro]], General Secretary of the Republic of [[Cuba]] from 1959 until his death in 2016, of likely being the beneficiary of up to $900 million, based on "his control" of state-owned companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/2006-05-04-castro_x.htm |title=Fidel Castro net worth rises, according to 'Forbes' |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-05-04 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of his regime claim that he has used money amassed through weapons sales, narcotics, international loans, and confiscation of private property to enrich himself and his political cronies who hold his dictatorship together, and that the $900 million published by [[Forbes]] is merely a portion of his assets, although that needs to be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Ben |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BenShapiro/2006/08/02/the_death_of_fidel_castro |title=Ben Shapiro :: Townhall.com :: The death of Fidel Castro |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2006-08-05 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judiciary corruption==
There are two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private. [[Budget]] of the judiciary in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject of the [[constitutional economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judicial corruption]] can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the anti-corruption bureau fights against corruption, and a new ombudsman bill called [[Jan Lokpal Bill]] is being prepared.

In the 1990s, initiatives were taken at an international level (in particular by the [[European Community]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[OECD]]) to put a ban on corruption: in 1996, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/cm/Home_en.asp |title=Committee of Ministers – Home |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, adopted a comprehensive Programme of Action against Corruption and, subsequently, issued a series of anti-corruption standard-setting instruments:
* the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173);&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
* the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174);&lt;ref name="conventions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=174&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=7/18/2008&amp;CL=ENG |title=Criminal Law Convention on Corruption: CETS No. 174 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight against Corruption (Resolution (97) 24);&lt;ref name="coe.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Resolution(97)24_EN.pdf |title=Council of Europe: Resolution (97) 24: On the Twenty Guiding Principles for the Fight Against Corruption |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Recommendation on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials (Recommendation No. R (2000) 10);&lt;ref name="Rec 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/documents/Rec(2000)10_EN.pdf |title=Recommendation No. R (2000) 10 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials |publisher=Coe.int |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of these instruments was to address the various forms of corruption (involving the public sector, the private sector, the financing of political activities, etc.) whether they had a strictly domestic or also a transnational dimension. To monitor the implementation at national level of the requirements and principles provided in those texts, a monitoring mechanism – the [[Group of States Against Corruption]] (also known as GRECO) (French: Groupe d'Etats contre la corruption) was created.

Further conventions were adopted at the regional level under the aegis of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS or OEA), the [[African Union]], and in 2003, at the universal level under that of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]].

==Whistleblowers==&lt;!-- dummy edit to identify attribution ; can be deleted. --&gt;

{{Main|Whistleblower}}
A whistleblower (also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower) is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within an organization that is either private or public. The information of alleged wrongdoing can be classified in many ways: violation of company policy/rules, law, regulation, or threat to public interest/national security, as well as fraud, and corruption. Those who become whistleblowers can choose to bring information or allegations to the surface either internally or externally. Internally, a whistleblower can bring his/her accusations to the attention of other people within the accused organization such as an immediate supervisor. Externally, a whistleblower can bring allegations to light by contacting a third party outside of an accused organization such as the media, government, law enforcement, or those who are concerned. Whistleblowers, however, take the risk of facing stiff reprisal and retaliation from those who are accused or alleged of wrongdoing.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on private sector, or public sector. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an ethical approach. Whistleblowing is a topic of ongoing ethical debate. Leading arguments in the ideological camp that whistleblowing is ethical to maintain that whistleblowing is a form of civil disobedience, and aims to protect the public from government wrongdoing. In the opposite camp, some see whistleblowing as unethical for breaching confidentiality, especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information. Legal protection can also be granted to protect whistleblowers, but that protection is subject to many stipulations. Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers, but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave whistleblowers vulnerable to retaliation and legal trouble. However, the decision and action have become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and communication. Whistleblowers frequently face reprisal, sometimes at the hands of the organization or group they have accused, sometimes from related organizations, and sometimes under law. Questions about the legitimacy of whistleblowing, the moral responsibility of whistleblowing, and the appraisal of the institutions of whistleblowing are part of the field of political ethics.

==Measuring corruption==
Measuring corruption accurately is difficult if not impossible due to the illicit nature of the transaction and imprecise definitions of corruption.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |title=A Users' Guide to Measuring Corruption |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131012755/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/09/users-guide-to-measuring-corruption.html |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few reliable measures of the magnitude of corruption exists and among those, there is a high level of heterogeneity. One of the most common ways to estimate corruption is through perception surveys. They have the advantage of good coverage, however, they do not measure corruption precisely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olken|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|date=|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/73081/1/Olken_Corruption%20in.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917}}&lt;/ref&gt; While "corruption" indices first appeared in 1995 with the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] CPI, all of these metrics address different proxies for corruption, such as public perceptions of the extent of the problem.&lt;ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"&gt;Galtung, Fredrik (2006). "Measuring the Immeasurable: Boundaries and Functions of (Macro) Corruption Indices," in Measuring Corruption, Charles Sampford, Arthur Shacklock, Carmel Connors, and Fredrik Galtung, Eds. (Ashgate): 101–130.&lt;/ref&gt; However, over time the refinement of methods and validation checks against objective indicators has meant that, while not perfect, many of these indicators are getting better at consistently and validly measuring the scale of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf |title= Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand?

[[Transparency International]], an anti-corruption [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], pioneered this field with the CPI, first released in 1995. This work is often credited with breaking a taboo and forcing the issue of corruption into high-level development policy discourse. Transparency International currently publishes three measures, updated annually: a CPI (based on aggregating third-party polling of public perceptions of how corrupt different countries are); a Global Corruption Barometer (based on a survey of general public attitudes toward and experience of corruption); and a [[Bribe Payers Index]], looking at the willingness of foreign firms to pay bribes. The Corruption Perceptions Index is the best known of these metrics, though it has drawn much criticism&lt;ref name="Galtung, Fredrik 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sik |first=Endre |year=2002 |chapter=The Bad, the Worse and the Worst: Guesstimating the Level of Corruption |title=Political Corruption in Transition: A Skeptic's Handbook |editor-first=Stephen |editor-last=Kotkin |editor2-first=Andras |editor2-last=Sajo |location=Budapest |publisher=Central European University Press |pages=91–113 |isbn=963-9241-46-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, Christiane and Charles Oman (2006).

The World Bank collects a range of data on corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance/data/ |title=WBI Governance &amp; Anti-Corruption – Data |publisher=Worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including survey responses from over 100,000 firms worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/Data/ExploreTopics/corruption |title=Corruption – World Bank Survey of Business Managers |publisher=Enterprisesurveys.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a set of indicators of governance and institutional quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.worldbank.org/IU54LJVHT0 |title=Public Sector Governance – Indicators of Governance &amp; Institutional Quality |publisher=Go.worldbank.org |date=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of the six dimensions of governance measured by the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] is Control of Corruption, which is defined as "the extent to which power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as 'capture' of the state by [[elite]]s and private interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance |year=2007 |publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, The World Bank |page=3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527211855/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi2007/pdf/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the definition itself is fairly precise, the data aggregated into the Worldwide Governance Indicators is based on any available polling: questions range from "is corruption a serious problem?" to measures of public access to information, and not consistent across countries. Despite these weaknesses, the global coverage of these datasets has led to their widespread adoption, most notably by the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

A number of parties have collected survey data, from the public and from experts, to try and gauge the level of corruption and bribery, as well as its impact on political and economic outcomes.&lt;ref name="bath.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, A 2014"/&gt;
A second wave of corruption metrics has been created by [[Global Integrity]], the International Budget Partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbudget.org|title=Home - International Budget Partnership|website=International Budget Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many lesser known local groups. These metrics include the [[Global Integrity Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/ |title=The Global Integrity Report &amp;#124; Global Integrity |publisher=Report.globalintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308204055/http://report.globalintegrity.org/ |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 2004. These second wave projects aim to create policy change by identifying resources more effectively and creating checklists toward incremental reform. Global Integrity and the International Budget Partnership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbudget.org/ |title=International Budget Partnership |publisher=Internationalbudget.org |date=2012-05-28 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; each dispense with public surveys and instead uses in-country experts to evaluate "the opposite of corruption" – which Global Integrity defines as the public policies that prevent, discourage, or expose corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/methodology/whitepaper.cfm |title=The Global Integrity Report: 2009 Methodology White Paper |publisher=[[Global Integrity]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307194427/http://report.globalintegrity.org/methodology/whitepaper.cfm |archivedate=2011-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches compliment the first wave, awareness-raising tools by giving governments facing public outcry a checklist which measures concrete steps toward improved governance.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

Typical second wave corruption metrics do not offer the worldwide coverage found in first wave projects and instead focus on localizing information gathered to specific problems and creating deep, "unpackable"{{clarify|date=December 2014}} content that matches quantitative and qualitative data.

Alternative approaches, such as the British aid agency's Drivers of Change research, skips numbers and promotes understanding corruption via political economy analysis of who controls power in a given society.&lt;ref name="commons.globalintegrity.org"/&gt;

A '''reasonable accommodation''' is an adjustment made in a system to accommodate or make fair the same system for an individual based on a proven need. That need can vary.   Accommodations can be religious, physical, mental or emotional, academic, or employment related and are often mandated by law. Each country has its own system of reasonable accommodations. The [[United Nations]] use this term in the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], saying refusal to make accommodation results in [[discrimination]]. It defines a "reasonable accommodation" as:

{{quote|... necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=13&amp;pid=150 |title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |date= |author= |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Canada==

In [[Canada]] [[equality rights]], as set out in provincial and [[Canadian Human Rights Act|federal anti-discrimination laws]] and in [[section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], require that accommodation be made to various minorities. (The origin of the term ''reasonable accommodation'' in Canadian law is found in its labour law jurisprudence, specifically ''[[Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v Simpsons-Sears Ltd]]'', [1985] 2 SCR 536, and is argued to be the obligation of employers to change some general rules for certain employees, under the condition that this does not cause "[[undue hardship]]".)

===Quebec===
In Quebec, under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and the provincial charter of human rights, politicians engaged in "values" clarifications on accommodation from at least 2007. In that time, various ideologies attempted to impose onto Quebecers definitions of values, without consensus or even legislative success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/dan-delmar-why-quebec-values-remain-undefined-after-a-decade-of-debate|title=Dan Delmar: Why Quebec Values Remain Undefined After a Decade of Debate|date=22 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question on what was and will be the national identity has been contested, such as the court decision on the wearing of the Sikh [[kirpan]] in ''[[Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys]].''

The municipal council of the town of [[Hérouxville, Quebec|Hérouxville]] passed a "[[Hérouxville Standards|code of conduct]]" for residents. It provided details of expectations of behaviour, and defined practices of other countries that were not acceptable in the town, such as stoning women or [[death by burning|burning them alive]], and [[female genital mutilation]]. The code of conduct also explained common practices in Canadian culture. It said that carrying a weapon to school (a reference to the [[Sikh]] ceremonial [[kirpan]]), covering one's face (some particular forms of the Muslim [[veil]]), and making accommodation for prayer in public schools would not be permitted. It attests that "Our people eat to nourish the body, not the soul," in reference to [[Kashrut|Jewish]] and [[Halal|Muslim dietary laws]], and that health-care professionals "do not have to ask permission to perform blood transfusions."

This code of conduct was developed as the town and province absorbed more immigrants from other cultures. Other cultural questions arose. In 2007 a [[YMCA]] set up [[clouded windows]] to shield ultra-Orthodox Jews who had complained that youngsters could see girls and women in gym attire. There have been questions about whether voters are allowed to fill out and submit ballots while clothed in a [[niqab]] or [[burqa|burka]], which can hide identity. A Muslim spokesman said that women are always required to show identity for public purposes, so it was a question raised unnecessarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CTV.ca|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070911/{{Not a typo|accom|odation}}_quebec_070911/20070911?hub=Canada|title=Immigrants Source of Enrichment to Quebec: Group|date=11 September 2007|accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most residents in Quebec have identified as Catholic on surveys, the province has become increasingly secular, with declining rates of church attendance. The provincial government has worked to reach an accommodation with the Roman Catholic Church on guidelines for conversion or disposal of underused churches.  The church has allowed local parishes to work with municipalities to develop the buildings as community centres, for example, rather than for private condominium construction.

====Judaism====
In 2007, Benjamin Rubin, a forward with the [[Gatineau Olympiques]] [[ice hockey]] team, refused to play several key matches because they fell on a [[Jewish holiday]].  Some claimed the [[Jews]] would end up forcing the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] to reschedule all their matches on Fridays and Saturdays. Rubin and the Olympiques came to an agreement, and "he will only miss a handful of games." He has since left the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2007/09/12/ot-rubin-070912.html |title=Quebec Jewish hockey Player Agrees to Play on Sabbath |date=12 September 2007 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070924_109270_109270&amp;source=srch |title=Not Particularly Accommodating |date=24 September 2007 |author=Patriquin, Martin |work=Maclean's |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207163139/http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070924_109270_109270&amp;source=srch |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In 2007 [[Elections Canada]] ruled that Muslim women wearing the [[niqab]] (veil) or [[Burqa|burka]] would be allowed to vote in all upcoming national elections, by-elections and referendums without showing their faces to an Elections Canada official.&lt;ref name="veil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a3170edf-a111-443d-b2fe-2b2361274eb2&amp;k=52399|title=Canadians with Faces Veiled Can Vote|date=8 September 2007|work=[[National Post]]|last=Offman|first=Craig|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910124149/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a3170edf-a111-443d-b2fe-2b2361274eb2&amp;k=52399|archivedate=10 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same policy applies to all Canadians under federal Bill C-31, in that photo identification is not strictly required if two other pieces of acceptable official identification are provided, or another voter vouches for them. The proclamation created social animosity towards Muslims in Quebec.&lt;ref name="veil"/&gt; Premier [[Jean Charest]] of Quebec described this as a bad decision. He noted that Quebec's [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] had voted to forbid Muslim women from voting if they would not reveal their faces as a confirmation of identity.&lt;ref name="veil"/&gt;

The national [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government challenged Elections Canada to review this decision. The federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and the [[Bloc Québécois]] also requested such a reversal, to demand that all voters be required to show their faces in order to vote, even those whose faces are normally covered for religious reasons. They joined other federal and provincial politicians from Quebec who attacked the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=4a1a8fe7-60f0-4dff-9f05-9686c31cbb2e |title=No Veils at the Polls, Feds Urge |date=8 September 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102181239/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=4a1a8fe7-60f0-4dff-9f05-9686c31cbb2e |archivedate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Elgazzar, an advocate for the [[Canadian Council on American–Islamic Relations]] in Montreal, declared that it is improbable that very many Muslim women will have hidden faces when voting. Elgazzar insisted that women using niqabs usually take them off to distinguish themselves and do not sport them for photo identification. This fact was echoed by Salam Elmenyawi of the Muslim Council of Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=e3bb831c-31fd-4988-a486-190b5d472ba1 |title=Hey, Here's an Idea: Let's Ask Muslims What They Think |date=8 September 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102174601/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=e3bb831c-31fd-4988-a486-190b5d472ba1 |archivedate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media exposure====

There was extensive coverage of related issues in Quebec's news media in 2006 and 2007. Some analysts attributed this more to competition among media than a measure of citizen concern. The [[premier of Quebec]] declared several non-negotiable values, such as "the equality of women and men; the primacy of French; the separation between the state and religion".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The conservative political party [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) appeared to gain support from these debates. It formed the official opposition in the provincial legislature for one term from 2007 to 2008, until the increasing prominence of the global economic crisis relegated reasonable accommodation to an issue of less importance.&lt;ref name=debatebegin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=ec4ec029-c021-4571-a25e-fa73850b3857&amp;k=99148|publisher=The Gazette (Montreal)|title=Let the Debate Begin|last=Carroll|first=Ann|date=15 August 2007|accessdate=14 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026051327/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=ec4ec029-c021-4571-a25e-fa73850b3857&amp;k=99148|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment integration====

A 2006 examination from [[Statistics Canada]] demonstrated that Quebec had the highest newcomer unemployment rate in Canada.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bryan|first1=Jay|title=Wanted: Reasonable Accommodation in the Job Market|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20070911/281590941183811|accessdate=4 May 2017|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The newest immigrants endured an unemployment ratio of 17.8 per cent in 2006, or almost three times the 6.3 per cent ratio of native-born help.  In contrast, joblessness among current newcomers in Ontario was 11 per cent contrasted with 4.4 per cent among the Canadian born. In British Columbia, the numbers were 9.5 per cent and 3.7 per cent, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt;

The study's coauthor, Danielle Zietsma, was reported to have cautioned that she and her colleagues would need some time to conduct the analyses necessary to explain the basis of these findings. The ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' columnist Jay Bryan suggested that Quebec was exceptional in the degree to which it imposed hurdles on new immigrants seeking employment in the province, including "the devaluation of allegedly inadequate foreign credentials, language tests that have little to do with professional performance, and 'Canadian experience' requirements that serve as an all-purpose excuse to lock out job applicants who don't already have a job."&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt; However, the column reported that the study had found similar numbers of surveyed immigrants had indicated that the demand for Canadian experience (26 per cent) or foreign credentialing and work experience recognition problems (21 per cent) as principal barriers to employment.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt;

====Political reaction====

Former leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] [[André Boisclair]] noted, "We're not talking about reasonable accommodation [if] it has nothing to do with public services", Boisclair said. At the same time, Boisclair blamed Premier [[Jean Charest]] for pandering to Quebecers who balk at adjustments made for immigrants in civil society. Charest declined to defend them when girls wearing [[hijab]] were prohibited from soccer and tae kwon do, and when prejudiced remarks were offered about Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/columnists/article/256056 |title=One Law for One and All, Consistently Applied |date=13 September 2007 |author=Haroon Siddiqui |work=The Star |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mario Dumont]], leader of the [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) said in an interview in ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' that Quebec needs more immigration for economic and demographic reasons, but that he believes that Quebec had met its limits of immigrant acculturation, and that any further increase in rates of immigration would create [[ghettos]]. (At present, the province accepts a smaller percentage of newcomers than elsewhere in Canada.)
He criticized Charest for a plan to raise such levels when the Liberal government has cut funds for integration of newcomers into French culture. "We're a linguistic minority...and immigrants need francization", Dumont said. "It's quite a challenge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/quebec-to-reconsider-integration-of-immigrants-1.252497 |title=Quebec to Reconsider Integration of Immigrants |date=14 August 2007 |author= |publisher=Canadian Press |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Parti Québécois leader [[Pauline Marois]] said that Quebec should assume all control over its immigration, not the 60 per cent that it has now under a bilateral agreement with the government of Canada. She also said the province should make the message clear to immigrants that Quebec is a francophone "state", not officially bilingual as are the federal government and Quebec's neighbouring province [[New Brunswick]].

Marois said that Quebec is in need of more immigrants, to offset a low birth rate for future labour needs. She further believes that Quebec is a francophone state in which the rights of the [[English-speaking Quebecker|anglophone minority]] are respected, and where all the inhabitants live in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=2c1f14fb-f55f-45a9-abee-4167c3b702c6&amp;k=58090 |title=Let Quebec Control Its Immigration, Marois Says |date=15 August 2007 |author= |work=National Post |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charest criticized his political adversaries in the provincial legislature, and blamed them for encouraging "intolerance" in the continuing controversy. He published an open letter in regional dailies, saying he is worried the province's image of openness will diminish outside Quebec.

Dumont's statements about immigration, he said, led to the passing of a code of conduct by the town of [[Hérouxville]] that notified Muslims that face veils or stoning women would not be accepted there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071030/charest_lashesout_071030/20071030?hub=Canada |title=Charest Lashes Out on Reasonable Accommodation |date=30 October 2007 |author= |publisher=The Canadian Press |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bouchard–Taylor Commission====
Premier [[Jean Charest]], citing several instances of "unreasonable" accommodation, [[advice (constitutional)|advised]] the [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec]] to appoint a two-man commission in February 2007, to investigate the issue of reasonable accommodation, and report back by 31 March 2008. The formal title for the commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/266436 |title=Canadian Reality Is Multicultural |date=15 October 2007 |author= |work=The Star |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the ''Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=dd9de1f7-279d-4ca1-9c8d-e3f176f8501d |title=Quebecers Could Use a Primer on the History of Immigration |date=22 August 2007 |author= |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026055500/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=dd9de1f7-279d-4ca1-9c8d-e3f176f8501d |archivedate=26 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is sometimes called the ''Bouchard–Taylor Commission''.  Its commissioners are professors [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], a well-known federalist and philosopher, and [[Gérard Bouchard]], a historian and sociologist. Bouchard said in an interview that ''sovereignty'' was the solution to calm Franco-Quebecers' cultural insecurity. Co-chair Taylor stated, however, that Quebecers need to demonstrate the "openness and generosity of spirit" that majorities should have towards minorities.&lt;ref name=debatebegin /&gt;

The commission conducted hearings in various Quebec regions. The committee listened to individuals, organizations, and so-called experts on Quebec identity, religion, and integration of cultural communities ([[minority groups]]). Before formal proceedings began, Bouchard and Taylor said they heard in focus groups across the province that there was insecurity among Quebec's traditional ethnic French population. They believed that hearings would help with educating the public; for instance, they thought the perception of Muslim influence was higher among some groups than is justified by data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=4e87dde2-987c-4872-9cb9-d0f430ec8ccd |title=Bouchard and Taylor Will Have to Speak, Too |date=22 August 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026062803/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=4e87dde2-987c-4872-9cb9-d0f430ec8ccd |archivedate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor underlined that Quebecers need to show an "openness and generosity of spirit" for 'cultural communities. As well, the report recommended that accommodation be made in public schools to allow students who want to wear religious attire in class, such as the hijab, kippah or turban, to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-dumb-to-say-niqab-is-anti-women-charles-taylor-says-1.3013427|title=Former Quebec Commission Chair Calls Harper's Niqab Line 'Dumb'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bouchard–Taylor report recommended that judges, Crown prosecutors, prison guards and police officers refrain from wearing any religious attire or symbols. "We believe that a majority of Quebecers accept that a uniform prohibition applying to all government employees regardless of the nature of their position is excessive, but want those employees who occupy positions that embody at the highest level the necessary neutrality of the state&amp;nbsp;... to impose on themselves a form of circumspection concerning the expression of their religious convictions", Bouchard and Taylor wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/chris-selley-charles-taylor-niqab-defender|title=Chris Selley: Charles Taylor ... Niqab Defender?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission also recommended that the crucifix in the National Assembly, placed above the Speaker's chair by Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], be removed to another part of the building. This is a recommendation that successive governments have rejected.&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/dangerous-appalling-divisive-destructive-charles-taylor-on-the-caqs-religious-symbols-plan&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, In the aftermath of the [[Charter of Quebecois Values]] debate, Taylor stated that he no longer supports that opinion, and said it was misinterpreted by many politicians. The Bouchard–Taylor report deliberately did not include teachers, civil servants and health-care professionals from those that should be forbidden to wear religious symbols.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-legault-gets-ahead-of-himself-on-the-notwithstanding-clause/&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

In the United States, federal law requires that reasonable accommodations be made for employment, education, housing, courts, and public venues.

===Employment===
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans With Disabilities Act]], known as ADA, was signed into law on 26 July 1990. It carried forward material from Section 504 of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]. 'A reasonable accommodation' is defined by the US Department of Justice as "any modification or adjustment to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application process or to perform essential job functions. Reasonable accommodation also includes adjustments to assure that a qualified individual with a disability has [[employment equity|rights and privileges in employment]] equal to those of employees without disabilities."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In September 2012, [[Home Depot]] company agreed to pay $100,000 and furnish other relief to settle a [[disability]] discrimination lawsuit filed by the US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], for the alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for a cashier with cancer at its [[Towson, Maryland]], store, and then for purportedly firing her because of her condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Depot to Pay $100,000 to Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Suit
|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/home-depot-to-pay-100000-to-settle-eeoc-disability-discrimination-suit |publisher=US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] |work=The National Law Review|date=10 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and local government services, programs, and activities===
Title II of the ADA provides that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by any such entity".&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights. (2012). US Department of Health &amp; Human Services. Retrieved 28 January 2014 from https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; State and local governments must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure such access, unless a fundamental alteration would result.

===Public accommodations===
Title III of the ADA requires private businesses open to the public and commercial facilities to provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities to ensure that they have equal access to goods and services.

===Housing===
Under Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, codified in the United States Code at 42 USC §§ 3601–3619, and commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, virtually all housing providers must make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices, or services under certain circumstances.  A reasonable accommodation must be granted when such an accommodation is necessary to afford a prospective or existing tenant with a disability an [[right to housing|opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling]] (including but not limited to apartments, single family homes, and other types of private and public housing) to the same extent as a person who does not have that disability.  The Fair Housing Act covers "dwellings", and in many situations that term encompasses such non-traditional housing as homeless shelters and college dormitories. It bears noting that in regard to larger dwellings such as apartment buildings, the right to a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act requires that housing providers grant a requested reasonable accommodation that is necessary to enable a disabled tenant to enjoy an indoor or outdoor common area to the same extent as a non-disabled tenant enjoys such areas.

In regard to reasonable accommodations, there is no requirement that a housing provider initiate the reasonable accommodation process; the Fair Housing Act contemplates that a tenant will approach his or her landlord with a request for a change in the landlord's policies that will reasonably accommodate the tenant's disability.  For example, a prospective or actual tenant whose disability requires him to use crutches may request a reasonable accommodation in the form of an assigned parking space close to the entrance of his or her apartment building.  If the disability is of a kind covered by the Fair Housing Act, and there is a genuine relationship between the requested accommodation and the disability, and granting the reasonable accommodation would not fundamentally alter the nature of the landlord's operations or impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the landlord, then the landlord must grant the requested reasonable accommodation or else find himself in violation of the Fair Housing Act and liable for substantial civil money penalties as well as payment to the disabled person for the injury suffered by him or her.

The Fair Housing Act is enforced by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), whose regulations governing reasonable accommodations are found at 24 CFR § 100.204.  Sometimes it is easy to tell when (for example) a tenant has a disability and the tenant's reasonable accommodation request must be granted; other times it is not quite so apparent that a tenant suffers from a recognized disability.  But a housing provider has an obligation to engage in an interactive process in order to honestly try to figure out whether the requested accommodation is reasonable and must be granted.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the US Department of Justice have issued a joint statement to provide guidance on the concept of reasonable accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/library/huddojstatement.pdf | title=Joint Statement of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice&amp;nbsp;– Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act | date=17 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (including the amendments made by the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008), overlaps with the Fair Housing Act in its coverage of [[public housing]].  As noted on HUD's website: "Public housing was established to provide decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph|title=Public Housing |publisher=HUD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a million US households live in public housing.

==United Kingdom==

The laws of England, Wales, and Scotland require employers to make reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, initially under the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], and now under the [[Equality Act 2010]]. Failure to do so can give rise to a complaint by an employee to an [[employment tribunal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8758">In [[mathematics]], '''representation''' is a very general relationship that expresses similarities between objects. Roughly speaking, a collection ''Y'' of mathematical objects may be said to ''represent'' another collection ''X'' of objects, provided that the properties and relationships existing among the representing objects ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' conform in some consistent way to those existing among the corresponding represented objects ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Somewhat more formally, for a set ''Π'' of properties and [[relation (mathematics)|relations]], a ''Π''-representation of some structure ''X'' is a structure ''Y'' that is the image of ''X'' under a [[homomorphism]] that preserves ''Π''. The label ''representation'' is sometimes also applied to the homomorphism itself.

== Representation theory ==
Perhaps the most well-developed example of this general notion is the subfield of [[abstract algebra]] called '''[[representation theory]]''', which studies the representing of elements of [[algebraic structures]] by [[linear transformations]] of [[vector spaces]].

== Other examples ==

Although the term ''representation theory'' is well established in the algebraic sense discussed above, there are many other uses of the term ''representation'' throughout mathematics.

=== Graph theory ===
An active area of [[graph theory]] is the exploration of isomorphisms between [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] and other structures.
A key class of such problems stems from the fact that, like [[adjacency relation|adjacency]] in [[undirected graph]]s, [[intersection (mathematics)|intersection]] of sets
(or, more precisely, [[disjoint sets|non-disjointness]]) is a [[symmetric relation]].
This gives rise to the study of [[intersection graph]]s for innumerable families of sets.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

One foundational result here, due to [[Paul Erdős]] and colleagues, is that every ''n''-[[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] graph may be represented in terms of intersection among [[subsets]] of a set of size no more than ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 |mr=0186575 | doi=10.4153/cjm-1966-014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing a graph by such algebraic structures as its [[adjacency matrix]] and [[Laplacian matrix]] gives rise to the field of [[spectral graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

 |mr=1271140
 | isbn = 978-0-521-45897-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Order theory ===
[[Dual (mathematics)|Dual]] to the observation above that every graph is an intersection graph
is the fact that every [[partially ordered set]] is isomorphic to a collection of sets ordered by the [[subset|containment]] (or inclusion) relation ⊆.
Among the posets that arise as the [[containment order]]s for natural classes of objects are the [[Boolean lattice]]s and the  [[order dimension|orders of dimension ''n'']].&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

 |mr=1169299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many partial orders arise from (and thus can be represented by) collections of [[geometry|geometric]] objects.
Among them are the [[n-sphere#n-ball|''n''-ball]] orders.
The 1-ball orders are the interval-containment orders,
and the 2-ball orders are the so-called ''circle orders'',
the posets representable in terms of containment among disks in the plane.
A particularly nice result in this field is the characterization of the [[planar graph]]s as those graphs
whose vertex-edge incidence relations are circle orders.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

 |mr=1105950
 | doi = 10.1137/0404040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also geometric representations that are not based on containment.
Indeed, one of the best studied classes among these are the [[interval order]]s,&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

 | title = Interval Orders and Interval Graphs: A Study of Partially Ordered Sets
 | series = Wiley-Interscience Series in Discrete Mathematics

 | isbn = 978-0-471-81284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which represent the partial order in terms of what might be called ''disjoint precedence'' of intervals on the [[real line]]:
each element ''x'' of the poset is represented by an interval [''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] such that
for any ''y'' and ''z'' in the poset, ''y'' is below ''z'' if and only if ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Polysemy ===
Under certain circumstances, a single function ''f'':''X'' → ''Y'' is at once an isomorphism from several mathematical structures on ''X''.
Since each of those structures may be thought of, intuitively, as a meaning of the image ''Y''—one of the things that ''Y'' is trying to tell us—this phenomenon is called '''polysemy''',
a [[polysemy|term borrowed from linguistics]].
Examples include:

* '''intersection polysemy'''—pairs of graphs ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a common vertex set ''V'' that can be simultaneously represented by a single collection of sets ''S&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that any distinct vertices ''u'' and ''w'' in ''V''...
::are adjacent in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if their corresponding sets intersect ( ''S&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∩ ''S&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠  Ø ),  and
::are adjacent in ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the [[set complement|complements]] do ( ''S&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ ''S&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; ≠  Ø ).&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation

'''Restraint bias''' is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control [[impulsivity|impulsive behavior]]. An inflated self-control belief may lead to greater exposure to temptation, and increased impulsiveness. Therefore, the restraint bias has bearing on [[addiction]]. For example, someone might experiment with drugs, simply because they believe they can resist any potential addiction.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordgren|first1=Loran F.|last2=van Harreveld|first2=Frenk|last3=van der Pligt|first3=Joop|title=The Restraint Bias: How the Illusion of Self-Restraint Promotes Impulsive Behavior|journal=Psychological Science|date=2009|volume=20|issue=12|pages=1523–1528|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02468.x|url=http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/The-Restraint-Bias_How-the-Illusion-of-Self-Restraint-Promotes-Impulsive-Behavior.pdf|pmid=19883487|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516101139/http://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/The-Restraint-Bias_How-the-Illusion-of-Self-Restraint-Promotes-Impulsive-Behavior.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An individual's inability to control, or their temptation can come from several different [[visceral| visceral impulses]]. Visceral impulses can include hunger, sexual arousal, and fatigue. These impulses provide information about the current state and behavior needed to keep the body satisfied.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2009"/&gt;

'''Empathy Gap Effect:'''
The [[Empathy gap|Empathy Gap Effect]] deals with individuals having trouble appreciating the power that the impulse states have on their behavior. There is a cold-to-hot empathy gap that states when people are in a cold state, like not experiencing hunger, they tended to underestimate those influences in a hot state. The underestimation of the visceral impulses can be contributed to restricted memory for the visceral experience which means the individual can recall the impulsive state but cannot recreate the sensation of the impulsive state.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2009"/&gt;

'''Impulse Control and Attention:'''
Studies have concluded that when people believe that they have stronger sense of self-control over situations in their environment, they have greater control over their impulse control. Individuals also tend to overestimate their capacity for self-control when one is told that they have a high capacity for self-restraint.&lt;ref name="Nordgren2009"/&gt; The more someone is told that they have a high capacity for self-restraint, the more they believe it and display higher levels of impulse control. Attention has a lot to do with biases, self and impulse controls in our environment. The less attention an individual pays to something, the less control they have over whatever they are doing. Focusing attention to oneself can lead to successful self-control which can be helpful in many aspects of life. Self-control engages conflict between competing pressures, pressures that can be brought on by situational or internal prompts from the environment. Some of the cues make the individual act on or engage in that behavior or act to prevent the individual from taking action.&lt;ref name="Mann2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mann|first1=Traci|last2=Ward|first2=Andrew|title=Attention, Self-Control, and Health Behaviors|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=2007|volume=16|issue=5|pages=280–283|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00520.x|url=http://people.uncw.edu/tothj/Extra-Credit-Papers/Mann-Attention%20Self-Control%20and%20Health%20Behaviors-CDPS-2008.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221175422/http://people.uncw.edu/tothj/Extra-Credit-Papers/Mann-Attention%20Self-Control%20and%20Health%20Behaviors-CDPS-2008.pdf|archivedate=2016-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the moral panic|abuse administered under the guise of religion|Religious abuse}}
[[File:Messenoire.jpg|Engraving by Henry de Malvost in the book ''Le Satanisme et la Magie'' by [[Jules Bois]] depicting a [[Black Mass]]|thumb |325px]]

'''Satanic ritual abuse''' ('''SRA''', sometimes known as '''ritual abuse''', '''ritualistic abuse''', '''organised abuse''', '''sadistic ritual abuse''', and other variants) was the subject of a [[moral panic]] (often referred to as the '''satanic panic''') that originated in the [[United States]] in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s. Allegations of SRA involved reports of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]] of people in the context of [[occult]] or [[Theistic Satanism|Satanic]] rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a worldwide SRA organisation that includes the wealthy and powerful of the world elite in which children are abducted or bred for sacrifices, [[child pornography|pornography]] and [[prostitution]].

Nearly every aspect of SRA was controversial, including its definition, the source of the allegations and proof thereof, testimonies of alleged victims, and court cases involving the allegations and criminal investigations. The panic affected lawyers', therapists', and social workers' handling of allegations of [[child sexual abuse]]. Allegations initially brought together widely dissimilar groups, including religious fundamentalists, police investigators, child advocates, therapists, and clients in [[psychotherapy]]. The movement gradually secularized, dropping or deprecating the "satanic" aspects of the allegations in favor of names that were less overtly religious such as "sadistic" or simply "ritual abuse" and becoming more associated with [[dissociative identity disorder]] and anti-government [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].

Initial publicity came via the book ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' (1980), and was sustained and popularized throughout the decade by the [[McMartin preschool trial]]. Testimonials, symptom lists, rumors, and techniques to investigate or uncover memories of SRA were disseminated through professional, popular, and religious conferences, as well as through the attention of [[talk show]]s, sustaining and further spreading the moral panic throughout the United States and beyond. In some cases, allegations resulted in criminal trials with varying results; after seven years in court, the McMartin trial resulted in no convictions for any of the accused, while other cases resulted in lengthy sentences, some of which were later reversed. Scholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, which, as Sarah Hughes observed in 2017, "involved hundreds of accusations that devil-worshipping paedophiles were operating America's white middle-class suburban daycare centers."&lt;ref&gt;BERNIER, C., SEWELL, B., MOYNIHAN, S., &amp; WITHAM, N. (2017). Editors' Note. Journal of American Studies, 51(3), V-Vii. doi:10.1017/S0021875817000858&lt;/ref&gt;

Official investigations produced no evidence of widespread conspiracies or of the slaughter of thousands; only a small number of verified crimes have even remote similarities to tales of SRA.&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"/&gt; In the latter half of the 1990s, interest in SRA declined and skepticism became the default position, with very few researchers giving any credence to the existence of SRA.

==History==

The underpinnings for the contemporary moral panic were found in a rise of five factors in the years leading up to the 1980s: the establishment of [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christianity]] and political organization of the [[Moral Majority]]; the rise of the [[anti-cult movement]] which spread ideas of abusive [[cult]]s kidnapping and [[brainwashing]] children and teens; the appearance of the [[Church of Satan]] and other explicitly [[Satanist]] groups that added a kernel of truth to the existence of Satanic cults; the development of the [[social work]] or child protection field, and its struggle to have [[child sexual abuse]] recognized as a social problem and a serious crime; and the popularization of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[repressed memory]], and corresponding survivor movement.{{sfn|Bromley|Richardson|Best|1991 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt1uw2QOmDQC&amp;pg=PA5 5–10]}}

The early 1980s, during the implementation of [[mandatory reporting]] laws, saw a large increase in child protection investigations in [[United States|America]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and other developed countries, along with a heightened public awareness of [[child abuse]]. The investigation of incest allegations in [[California]] was also changed, with cases led by [[social work]]ers who used leading and coercive interviewing techniques that had been avoided by police investigators. Such changes in the prosecution of cases of alleged incest resulted in an increase in confessions by fathers in exchange for [[plea bargain]]s.{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, some children in child protection cases began making allegations of horrific physical and sexual abuse by caregivers within organized rituals, claiming sexual abuse in Satanic rituals and the use of Satanic symbols. These cases garnered the label "satanic ritual abuse" both in the media and among professionals.&lt;ref name=Hechler&gt;{{cite book |last=Hechler |first=D |title=The Battle and the Backlash: The Child Sexual Abuse War |publisher=Macmillan Pub Co |year=1989 |isbn=0-669-21362-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cozolino1989&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cozolino |first=L. |year=1989 |title=The ritual abuse of children: Implications for clinical practice and research |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=131–38 |doi=10.1080/00224498909551497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood memories of similar abuse began to appear in the [[psychotherapy]] sessions of adults.&lt;ref name=Van1990&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Benschoten |first=S.C. |year=1990 |title=Multiple personality disorder and satanic ritual abuse: The issue of credibility |journal=Dissociation |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=13–20 |url=https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/dspace/bitstream/1794/1492/1/Diss_3_1_5_OCR.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-11 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528205615/https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/dspace/bitstream/1794/1492/1/Diss_3_1_5_OCR.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conte |first=JR |title=Critical issues in child sexual abuse: historical, legal, and psychological perspectives |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks |year=2002 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qBSuIMgJLNYC&amp;pg=PA178 178–79] |isbn=0-7619-0912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, charges were laid in the [[McMartin preschool trial]], a major case in California, which received attention throughout the United States and contained allegations of satanic ritual abuse. The case caused tremendous polarization in how to interpret the available evidence.{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=58}} Shortly afterward, more than 100 preschools across the country became the object of similar sensationalist allegations, which were eagerly and uncritically reported by the press.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA117 117]}} Throughout the McMartin trial, media coverage of the defendants (Peggy McMartin and Ray Buckey) was unrelentingly negative, focusing only on statements by the prosecution.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}} Michelle Smith and other alleged survivors met with parents involved in the trial, and it is believed that they influenced testimony against the accused.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA15 15]}}{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA56 56]}}{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |p=89}}

[[Kee MacFarlane]], a social worker employed by the [[Children's Institute International]], developed a new way to interrogate children with [[anatomically correct doll]]s and used them in an effort to assist disclosures of abuse with the McMartin children. After asking the children to point to the places on the dolls where they had allegedly been touched and asking [[leading question]]s, MacFarlane diagnosed sexual abuse in virtually all the McMartin children.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=79–80}} She coerced disclosures by using lengthy interviews that rewarded discussions of abuse and punished denials. The trial testimony that resulted from such methods was often contradictory and vague on all details except for the assertion that the abuse had occurred.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}} Although the initial charges in the McMartin case featured allegations of Satanic abuse and a vast conspiracy, these features were dropped relatively early in the trial, and prosecution continued only for non-ritual allegations of child abuse against only two defendants.&lt;ref name=Intimate&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=P |title=Intimate enemies: moral panics in contemporary Great Britain |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers|Aldine de Gruyter]] |location=New York |year=1992 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JQQWfqtES5MC&amp;pg=PA151 151–76] |isbn=0-202-30435-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of testimony, McMartin and Buckey were [[acquittal|acquitted]] on 52 of 65 counts, and the jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges against Buckey, with 11 of 13 jurors choosing not guilty. Buckey was re-charged and two years later released without conviction.{{sfn |Eberle |Eberle |1993}}

===Conspiracy accusations===
In 1984 MacFarlane warned a congressional committee of [[scatological]] behavior and animals being slaughtered in bizarre rituals that children were forced to watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacFarlane |first=K |title=Child Abuse and Day Care: Joint hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee of Ways and Means, and Select committee on Children, Youth, and Families" (testimony by [[Kee MacFarlane]]) |date=1984-09-17 |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the [[United States Congress]] doubled its budget for child-protection programs. Psychiatrist [[Roland Summit]] delivered conferences in the wake of the McMartin trial and depicted the phenomenon as a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] that involved anyone skeptical of the phenomenon.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=102–03}} By 1986, social worker Carol Darling argued to a [[grand jury]] that the conspiracy reached the government.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=102–03}} Her husband Brad Darling gave conference presentations about a Satanic conspiracy of great antiquity which he believed now permeated American communities.{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA60 60–62]}}

By the late 1980s, therapists or patients who believed someone had suffered from SRA could suggest solutions that included [[Christian psychology|Christian psychotherapy]], [[exorcism]], and support groups whose members self-identified as "anti-Satanic warriors."{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA69 69]}} Federal funding was increased for research on child abuse, with large portions of the funding allocated for research on child sexual abuse. Funding was also provided for conferences supporting the idea of SRA, adding a veneer of respectability to the idea as well as offering an opportunity for prosecutors to exchange advice on how to best secure convictions—with tactics including destruction of notes, refusing to tape interviews with children, and destroying or refusing to share evidence with the defense.{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995}} Had proof been found, SRA would have represented the first occasion where an organized and secret criminal activity had been discovered by mental health professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=1-55798-521-9 |editor=DeRivera J |editor2=Sarbin T |title=Believed-In-Imaginings: The Narrative Construction of Reality |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |year=1998 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=203 |chapter=Construction of Satanic Ritual Abuse and the Creation of False Memories |last=Victor |first=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 [[Geraldo Rivera]] produced a national television special on the alleged secret cults, claiming "Estimates are that there are over one million Satanists in [the United States and they are] linked in a highly organized, secretive network."{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA32 32–33]}} Tapings of this and similar talk show episodes were subsequently used by [[Fundamentalism|religious fundamentalists]], [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapists]], [[social work]]ers and police to promote the idea that a conspiracy of Satanic cults existed and was committing serious crimes.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA45 45], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA69 69], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA166 166], [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA254 254] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA343 343]}}

In the 1990s psychologist D. Corydon Hammond publicized a detailed theory of ritual abuse drawn from [[hypnotherapy]] sessions with his patients, alleging they were victims of a worldwide conspiracy of organized, secretive [[Clandestine cell system|clandestine cells]] who used torture, [[mind control]] and ritual abuse to create [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personalities]] that could be "activated" with code words; the victims were allegedly trained as assassins, prostitutes, drug traffickers, and child sex workers (to create [[child pornography]]). Hammond claimed his patients had revealed the conspiracy was masterminded by a Jewish doctor in [[Nazi Germany]], but who now worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] with a goal of worldwide domination by a Satanic cult. The cult was allegedly composed of respectable, powerful members of society who used the funds generated to further their agenda. Missing memories among the victims and absence of evidence was cited as evidence of the power and effectiveness of this cult in furthering its agenda. Hammond's claims gained considerable attention, due in part to his prominence in the field of [[hypnosis]] and psychotherapy.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 235–37]}}

===Religious roots and secularization===
Satanic ritual abuse brought together several groups normally unlikely to associate, including psychotherapists, self-help groups, religious fundamentalists and law enforcement.&lt;ref name = DeYoung1994/&gt;  Initial accusations were made in the context of the rising political power of [[Christian right|conservative Christianity]] within the United States,&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; and religious fundamentalists enthusiastically promoted rumors of SRA.&lt;ref name=Intimate/&gt; Psychotherapists who were actively Christian advocated for the diagnosis of [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID); soon after, accounts similar to ''Michelle Remembers'' began to appear, with some therapists believing the alter egos of some patients were the result of [[demonic possession]].&lt;ref name=Spanos/&gt; [[Protestantism]] was instrumental in starting, spreading, and maintaining rumors through sermons about the dangers of SRA, lectures by purported experts, and prayer sessions, including showings of the 1987 Geraldo Rivera television special.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA46 46–47] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA68 68–70]}} Secular proponents appeared,{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA2 2], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA12 12], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA18 18] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}} and child protection workers became significantly involved. Law enforcement trainers, many themselves strongly religious, became strong promoters of the claims and self-described "experts" on the topic. Their involvement in child sexual abuse cases produced more allegations of SRA, adding credibility to the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; As the explanations for SRA were distanced from [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christianity and associated with "survivor" groups, the motivations ascribed to purported Satanists shifted from combating a religious nemesis, to mind control and abuse as an end to itself.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frankfurter |first=D |year=2003 |volume=50 |journal=Numen |title=The satanic ritual abuse panic as religious-studies data |pages=108–17 |doi=10.1163/156852703321103265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinicians, psychotherapists and social workers documented clients with alleged histories of SRA,&lt;ref name = Donner/&gt;&lt;ref name=VS&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinason |first=V |title=Treating survivors of satanist abuse |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=New York |year=1994 |isbn=0-415-10543-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonker1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jonker |first=F |author2=Jonker-Bakker P  |year=1991 |title=Experiences with ritualist child sexual abuse: a case study from the Netherlands |journal=Child Abuse and Neglect |volume=15 |pages=191–96 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429991 |accessdate=2007-10-20 |pmid=2043971 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(91)90064-K |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the claims of therapists were unsubstantiated beyond the testimonies of their clients.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA86 86–87]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA192 192–95]}}

===International spread===
In 1987 a list of "indicators" was published by Catherine Gould,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=C |title=Satanic ritual abuse: child victims, adult survivors, system response |journal=California Psychologist |year=1987 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a broad array of vague symptoms that were ultimately common, non-specific and subjective, capable of diagnosing SRA in most young children.&lt;ref name=Intimate/&gt; By the late 1980s allegations began to appear throughout the world (including [[Canada]], [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]]), in part enabled by [[English language|English]] as a common international language and in the United Kingdom, assisted by Gould's list of indicators. Belief in SRA spread rapidly through the ranks of mental health professionals (despite an absence of evidence) through a variety of continuing education seminars, during which attendees were urged to believe in the reality of Satanic cults their victims, and not to question the extreme and bizarre memories uncovered. Proof was provided in the form of unconnected bits of information such as pictures drawn by patients, heavy metal album covers, historical folklore about devil worshipers, and pictures of mutilated animals. During the seminars, patients provided testimonials of their experiences and presenters stressed that recovering memories was important for healing.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 244]}}

Some [[Feminism|feminist]] critics of the SRA diagnoses maintained that, in the course of attempting to purge society of evil, the panic of the 1980s and 1990s obscured real child-abuse issues, a concern echoed by Gary Clapton.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |p=1}} In England, the SRA panic diverted resources and attention from proven abuse cases; this resulted in a hierarchy of abuse in which SRA was the most serious form, physical and sexual abuse being minimized and/or marginalized, and "mere" physical abuse no longer worthy of intervention.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=14–18}} In addition, as criticism of SRA investigation increased, the focus by social workers on SRA resulted in a large loss of credibility to the profession.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=23–28}} SRA, with its sensational makeup of many victims abused by many victimizers, ended up robbing the far more common and proven issue of [[incest]] of much of its societal significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armstrong |first=L |title=Rocking the Cradle of Sexual Politics |publisher=[[Addison–Wesley]] |year=1994 |location=Reading, Mass. |pages=257–59 |isbn=0-7043-4460-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Center for Abuse and Neglect devised the term "religious abuse" to describe [[exorcism]], [[poison]]ing, and drowning of children in non-satanic religious settings in order to avoid confusion with SRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=G |last2=Qin |first2=J |last3=Bottoms |first3=BL |last4=Shaver |first4=PR |title=Characteristics and Sources of Allegations of Ritualistic Child Abuse |publisher=Center for Abuse and Neglect |year=1994 |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=99–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA223 223–24]}}

==Definitions==
The term "satanic ritual abuse" is used to describe different behaviors, actions and allegations that lie between extremes of definitions.{{sfn |Edge |2001 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA378 378]}} In 1988, a nationwide study of sexual abuse in [[United States|U.S.]] [[Day care sex abuse hysteria|day care agencies]], led by David Finkelhor, divided "ritual abuse" allegations into three categories—cult-based ritualism in which the abuse had a spiritual or social goal for the perpetrators, pseudo-ritualism in which the goal was sexual gratification and the rituals were used to frighten or intimidate victims, and [[Psychopathology|psychopathological]] ritualism in which the rituals were due to [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Finkelhor&gt;{{cite web |last=Finkelhor |first=D |last2=Williams |first2=LM |last3=Burns |first3=N |last4=Kalinowski |first4=M |year=1988 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED292552 |format=PDF |title=Executive Summary – Sexual Abuse in Day Care: A National Study |publisher=University of New Hampshire, Family Research Laboratory |id=Eric # ED292552 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigators{{Who|date=March 2016}} have expanded on these definitions and also pointed to a fourth alleged type of Satanic ritual abuse, in which petty crimes with ambiguous meaning (such as [[graffiti]] or [[vandalism]]) generally committed by teenagers were attributed to the actions of Satanic cults.&lt;ref name="pmid1471565"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Belitz |first=J |last2=Schacht |first2=A |title=Satanism as a response to abuse: the dynamics and treatment of satanic involvement in male youths |journal=Adolescence |volume=27 |issue=108 |pages=855–72 |year=1992 |pmid=1471565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8356163"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Young |first=WC |title=Sadistic ritual abuse.

By the early 1990s, the phrase "Satanic ritual abuse" was featured in media coverage of ritualistic abuse but its use decreased among professionals in favour of more nuanced terms such as multi-dimensional child sex rings,&lt;ref name=Lanning&gt;{{Cite journal |format=PDF |first=Kenneth V. |last=Lanning |title=Investigator's Guide to Allegations of "Ritual" Childhood Abuse |year=1992 | url = http://www.pointnet.ca/media/igtaorca.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031025012607/http://www.pointnet.ca/media/igtaorca.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2003-10-25}}; &lt;/ref&gt; ritual/ritualistic abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hudson |first=PS |title=Ritual child abuse: discovery, diagnosis, and treatment |publisher=R&amp;E Publishers |location=Saratoga, Calif |year=1991 |isbn=0-88247-867-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; organised abuse{{sfn |Bibby |1996}} or [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] abuse,&lt;ref name=VS/&gt; some of which acknowledged the complexity of abuse cases with multiple perpetrators and victims without projecting a religious framework onto perpetrators. The latter in particular failed to substantively improve on or replace "Satanic" abuse as it was never used to describe any rituals except the Satanic ones that were the core of SRA allegations. Abuse within the context of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] or any other religions failed to enter the SRA discourse.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |p=25}}

===Cult-based abuse===
Allegation of cult-based abuse is the most extreme scenario of SRA.{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} During the initial period of interest starting in the early 1980s the term was used to describe a network of [[Satan]]-worshipping, secretive intergenerational cults that were supposedly part of a highly organized [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] engaged in criminal behaviors such as forced [[prostitution]], [[Illegal drug trade|drug distribution]] and [[pornography]]. These cults were also thought to sexually abuse and [[torture]] children in order to coerce them into a lifetime of [[Theistic Satanism#Preconceptions and myths|Devil worship]].{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]}} Other allegations included bizarre sexual acts such as [[necrophilia]], forced [[ingestion of semen]], [[blood]] and [[feces]], [[cannibalism]], [[orgies]], liturgical parody such as pseudosacramental use of feces and urine; [[infanticide]], sacrificial abortions to eat [[fetus]]es and [[human sacrifice]]; satanic police officers who covered up evidence of SRA crimes and desecration of Christian [[grave (burial)|graves]].{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA127 127]}} No evidence of any of these claims has ever been found;&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA3 3–4]}}&lt;ref name=Putnam1991&gt;{{cite journal |last=Putnam |first=F.W. |year=1991 |title=The Satanic Ritual Abuse Controversy |journal=Child Abuse and Neglect: the International Journal |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=175–79 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ429989 |accessdate=2008-06-10 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(91)90062-I}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998}} the proof presented by those who alleged the reality of cult-based abuse primarily consisted of the memories of adults recalling childhood abuse,{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} the testimony of young children{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA16 16–17]}} and extremely controversial confessions.{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} The idea of a murderous Satanic conspiracy created a controversy dividing the professional [[child abuse]] community at the time, though no evidence has been found to support allegations of a large number of children being killed or abused in Satanic rituals.&lt;ref name=Putnam1991/&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PR13 xiii]}} From a law enforcement perspective, an intergenerational conspiracy dedicated to ritual sacrifice whose members remain completely silent, make no mistakes and leave no [[physical evidence]] is unlikely; cases of what the media incorrectly perceived as actual cult sacrifices (such as the 1989 case of [[Adolfo Constanzo]]) have supported this idea.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;

===Criminal and delusional satanism===
A third variation of ritual abuse involves non-religious ritual abuse in which the rituals were [[delusion]]al or [[obsessive compulsive disorder|obsessive]].&lt;ref name=Finkelhor/&gt; There are incidents of extreme sadistic crimes that are committed by individuals, loosely organized families and possibly in some organized cults, some of which may be connected to Satanism, though this is more likely to be related to [[sex trafficking]]; though SRA may happen in families, extended families and localized groups, it is not believed to occur in large, organized groups.{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |pp=64–65}}

===Acting out===
Investigators considered [[graffiti]] such as the [[pentagram]] to be evidence of a Satanic cult. Ambiguous crimes in which actual or erroneously believed symbols of Satanism appear have also been claimed as part of the SRA phenomenon, though in most cases the crimes cannot be linked to a specific belief system; minor crimes such as vandalism, trespassing and graffiti were often found to be the actions of teenagers who were acting out.&lt;ref name="pmid1471565"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8356163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1962303"/&gt;

===Polarization===

There was never any consensus on what actually constituted Satanic ritual abuse.&lt;ref name=deYoung2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Young |first=M |authorlink=Mary de Young |year=2007 |title=Two decades after McMartin: a follow-up of 22 convicted day care employees |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYZ/is_4_34/ai_n25466116/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172921/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYZ/is_4_34/ai_n25466116/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2008-08-11 |journal=Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=9–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of a single definition, as well as confusion between the meanings of the term "ritual" ([[Ritual#Religious|religious]] versus [[Ritual#Psychology|psychological]]) allowed a wide range of allegations and evidence to be claimed as a demonstration of the reality of SRA claims, irrespective of which "definition" the evidence supported.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}} Acrimonious disagreements between groups who supported SRA allegations as authentic and those criticizing them as unsubstantiated resulted in an extremely polarized discussion with little middle ground.&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;{{cite book |last=Fraser |first=GA |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |year=1997 |title=The Dilemma of Ritual Abuse: Cautions and Guides for Therapists |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4CMHRXz5qsQC&amp;pg=PA105 105–17] |isbn=0-88048-478-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}} The lack of credible evidence for the more extreme interpretations often being seen as evidence of an effective conspiracy rather than an indication that the allegations are unfounded. The atheistic or religious beliefs of the disputants have also resulted in different interpretations of evidence, and as well as accusations of those who reject the claims being "anti-child".{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=18–22}} Both believers and skeptics have developed networks to disseminate information on their respective positions.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=27–28}} One of the central themes of the discussion among English child abuse professionals was the assertion that people should simply "believe the children", and that the testimony of children was sufficient proof, which ignored the fact that in many cases the testimony of children was interpreted by professionals rather than the children explicitly disclosing allegations of abuse. In some cases this was simultaneously presented with the idea that it did not matter if SRA actually existed, that the [[empiricism|empirical]] truth of SRA was irrelevant, that the testimony of children was more important than that of doctors, social workers and the criminal justice system.{{sfn |Clapton |1993 |pp=18–22}}

==Evidence==
The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect conducted a study led by [[University of California, Davis|University of California]] psychologist [[Gail Goodman]], which found that among 12,000 accusations of satanic ritual abuse, there was no evidence for "a well-organized intergenerational satanic cult, who sexually molested and tortured children", although there was "convincing evidence of lone perpetrators or couples who say they are involved with Satan or use the claim to intimidate victims."&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"/&gt; One such case Goodman studied involved "grandparents [who] had black robes, candles, and Christ on an inverted crucifix--and the children had chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease, in their throats", according to the report by a [[district attorney]].&lt;ref name="Goleman1994"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/31/us/proof-lacking-for-ritual-abuse-by-satanists.html?sq=satanic+ritual+abuse&amp;scp=1&amp;st=nyt|title=Proof Lacking for Ritual Abuse by Satanists|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|year=1994|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|language=English|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for SRA was primarily in the form of testimonies from children who made allegations of SRA, and adults who claim to remember abuse during childhood,&lt;ref name=Utah&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saferchildren.net/print/utahrataskforce.pdf |date= 1992-05-01 |accessdate=2007-11-26 |title=Report of Utah State Task Force on Ritual Abuse |publisher=Utah Governor's Commission for Women and Families |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA79 79]}} that may have been forgotten and [[Recovered memory therapy|recovered during therapy]].{{sfn |Brown |Scheflin |Hammond |1998 |p=55}}{{sfn |Edge |2001 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLOtSiH2E1cC&amp;pg=PA362 362–63]}}{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |p=18}}{{sfn|Perrin|Miller-Perrin|2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AJgxUqce5GcC&amp;pg=PA318 318–20]}}&lt;ref name=Furies&gt;{{cite book |last=Underwager |first=Ralph C. |last2=Wakefield |first2=Hollida |title=Return of the furies: an investigation into recovered memory therapy |publisher=Open Court |location=La Salle, Ill |year=1995 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iE1-i0umaTsC&amp;pg=PA317 317–21] |isbn=0-8126-9272-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With both children and adults, no corroborating evidence has been found for anything except [[#Pseudo-satanism|pseudosatanism]] in which the satanic and ritual aspects were secondary to and used as a cover for sexual abuse.{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}} Despite this lack of objective evidence, and aided by the competing definitions of what SRA actually was, proponents claimed SRA was a real phenomenon throughout the peak and during the decline of the moral panic.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devine |first=Susan E. |last2=Sakheim |first2=David K. |title=Out of darkness: exploring satanism and ritual abuse |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=1992 |page=173 |isbn=0-669-26962-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite allegations appearing in the United States, Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia, no material evidence has been found to corroborate allegations of organized cult-based abuse that practices human sacrifice and cannibalism.&lt;ref name=Furies/&gt;{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA123 123]}} Though trauma specialists frequently claimed the allegations made by children and adults were the same, in reality the statements made by adults were more elaborate, severe, and featured more bizarre abuse.

For several years, a conviction list assembled by the [[Believe the Children]] advocacy group was circulated as proof of the truth of satanic ritual abuse allegations, though the organization itself no longer exists and the list itself is "egregiously out of date".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-7864-1830-3 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA54 54] |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |last=de Young |first=M |authorlink=Mary de Young |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Two investigations were carried out to assess the evidence for SRA. In the United States, evidence was reported but was based on a flawed methodology with an overly liberal definition of a substantiated case. In the United Kingdom, a government report produced no evidence of SRA, but several examples of false satanists faking rituals to frighten their victims.

====United States====
[[David Finkelhor]] completed an investigation of child sexual abuse in daycares in the United States, and published a report in 1988. The report found 270 cases of sexual abuse, of which 36 were classified as substantiated cases of ritual abuse.&lt;ref name=Finkelhor/&gt; [[Mary de Young]] has pointed out that the report's definition of "substantiated" was overly liberal as it required only that one agency had decided that abuse had occurred, even if no action was taken, no arrests made, no operating licenses suspended. In addition, multiple agencies may have been involved in each case (including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], local police, social services agencies and childhood protective services in many cases), with wide differences in suspicion and confirmation, often in disagreement with each other. Finkelhor, upon receiving a "confirmation", would collect information from whoever was willing or interested to provide it and did not independently investigate the cases, resulting in frequent errors in their conclusions. No data is provided beyond case studies and brief summaries.{{sfn |de Young |2004 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}} Three other cases considered corroborating by the public—the [[McMartin preschool trial]], the [[Day-care sex-abuse hysteria#Country Walk|Country Walk case]] and the murders in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], by [[Adolfo Constanzo]]—ultimately failed to support the existence of SRA. The primary witness in the Country Walk case repeatedly made, then withdrew accusations against her husband amid unusual and coercive inquiries by her lawyer and a psychologist. The Matamoros murders produced the bodies of 12 adults who were ritually sacrificed by a drug gang inspired by the film ''[[The Believers]]'', but did not involve children or sexual abuse. The McMartin case resulted in no convictions and was ultimately based on accusations by children with no proof beyond their coerced testimonies.{{sfn |Faller |2003 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FkT2wTGTUAoC&amp;pg=PA29 29–33]}} A 1996 investigation of more than 12,000 allegations of satanic, ritual and religious abuse resulted in no cases that were considered factual or corroborated.&lt;ref name=Bottoms1996&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bottoms |first=B.L. |last2=Shaver |first2=P.R. |last3=Goodman |first3=G.S. |year=1996 |title=An analysis of ritualistic and religion-related child abuse allegations |journal=Law and Human Behavior |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–34 |doi=10.1007/BF01499130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
A British study published in 1996 found 62 cases of alleged ritual abuse reported to researchers by police, social and welfare agencies from the period of 1988 to 1991, representing a tiny proportion of extremely high-profile cases compared to the total number investigated by the agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes &amp; Parker in Bibby, 1996, pp. 215–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Jean LaFontaine spent several years researching ritual abuse cases in Britain at the behest of the government, finding that all of the cases of alleged satanic ritual abuse that could be substantiated were cases where the perpetrators' goal was sexual gratification rather than religious worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/94959.article | title = Satanic Disabuser | last = Kitzinger | first = Celia | date = 1995-08-28 | accessdate = 2014-10-16 | journal = [[Times Higher Education]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing several reports and the 1998 book ''Speak of the Devil'', after reviewing cases reported to police and children's protective services throughout the country LaFontaine concluded that the only rituals she uncovered were those invented by child abusers to frighten their victims or justify the sexual abuse. In addition, the sexual abuse occurred outside of the rituals, indicating the goal of the abuser was sexual gratification rather than ritualistic or religious. In cases involving satanic abuse, the satanic allegations by younger children were influenced by adults, and the concerns over the satanic aspects were found to be compelling due to cultural attraction of the concept, but distracting from the actual harm caused to the abuse victims.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaFontaine |first=J S. |title=The extent and nature of organised and ritual abuse: research findings |publisher=HMSO |location=London |year=1994 |isbn=0-11-321797-8 |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=157278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient allegations===
The majority of adult testimonials occurred as a result of adults undergoing psychotherapy, in most cases therapy designed to elicit memories of SRA.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003/&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}} Therapists claimed the pain expressed by the patients, internal consistency of their stories and similarity of allegations by different patients was evidence for SRA, but despite this, the disclosures of patients never resulted in any corroboration;{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}} Allegations of alleged victims that were obtained from mental health practitioners lacked verifiable evidence, were [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and involved incidents that were years or decades old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Final Report of the Task Force Studying Ritual Crime |publisher=Crime Commission Task Force Studying Ritual Criminal Activity |location=Richmond, VA |year=1991}}; cited in Victor, 1993, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA263 263–64].&lt;/ref&gt; The concern for therapists revolved around the pain of their clients, which is for them more important than the truth of their patients' statements.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=27–28}} A sample of 29 patients in a medical clinic reporting SRA found no corroboration of the claims in medical records or in discussion with family members.&lt;ref name=Coons&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coons |first=PM |title=Reports of satanic ritual abuse: further implications about pseudomemories |journal=Percept Mot Skills |volume=78 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=1376–78 |date=June 1994 |pmid=7936968 |doi=10.2466/pms.1994.78.3c.1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a survey of 2,709 American therapists found the majority of allegations of SRA came from only sixteen therapists, suggesting that the determining factor in a patient making allegations of SRA was the therapist's predisposition.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA257 257–58]}} Further, the alleged similarities between patient accounts (particularly between adults and children) turned out to be illusory upon review, with adults describing far more elaborate, severe and bizarre abuse than children. Bette Bottoms, who reviewed hundreds of claims of adult and child abuse, described the ultimate evidence for the abuse as "astonishingly weak and ambiguous" particularly given the severity of the alleged abuse. Therapists however, were found to believe patients more as the allegations became more bizarre and severe.{{sfn |McNally |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=88Axi0huzYwC&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 238]}}

In cases where patients made claims that were physically impossible, or evidence found by police was contradictory, the details reported will often change. If patients pointed to a spot where a body was buried, but no body was found and no earth was disturbed, therapists resort to [[special pleading]], saying the patient was hypnotically programmed to direct investigators to the wrong location, or that they were fooled by the cult into believing a crime was not committed. If alleged bodies were cremated and police point out ordinary fires are inadequate to completely destroy a body, stories include special industrial furnaces. The patients' allegations change and creatively find "solutions" to objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Showalter |isbn=0-231-10459-6 |year=1998 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTL34npiiV0C&amp;pg=PA179 179–80] |title=Hystories : hysterical epidemics and modern media |first=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's allegations===
The second group to make allegations of SRA were young children. During the "satanic panic" of the 1980s, the techniques used by investigators to gather evidence from witnesses, particularly young children, evolved to become very leading, coercive and suggestive, pressuring young children to provide testimony and refusing to accept denials while offering inducements that encouraged false disclosures.&lt;ref name=Frankfurter2003/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schreiber et al."/&gt;{{sfn|Nathan|Snedeker|1995}} The interviewing techniques used were the factors believed to have led to the construction of the bizarre disclosures of SRA by the children{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA56 56ff], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA61 61–65], [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA73 73f] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA192 192–95]}} and changes to forensic and interviewing techniques since that time has resulted in a disappearance of the allegations.&lt;ref name=Donner/&gt; Analysis of the techniques used in two key cases (the McMartin preschool and [[Wee Care Nursery School]] trials) concluded that the children were questioned in a highly suggestive manner. Compared with a set of interviews from [[Child Protective Services]], the interviews from the two trials were "significantly more likely to (a) introduce new suggestive information into the interview, (b) provide praise, promises, and positive reinforcement, (c) express disapproval, disbelief, or disagreement with children, (d) exert conformity pressure, and (e) invite children to pretend or speculate about supposed events."&lt;ref name="Schreiber et al."/&gt;

A variety of these allegations resulted in criminal convictions; in an analysis of these cases [[Mary de Young]] found that many had had their convictions overturned. Of 22 day care employees and their sentences reviewed in 2007, three were still incarcerated, eleven had charges dismissed or overturned, and eight were released before serving their full sentences. Grounds included technical dismissals, constitutional challenges and prosecutorial misconduct.&lt;ref name=deYoung2007/&gt;

In his book ''Satanic Panic'', Jeffery Victor writes that, in the United States, the groups most likely to believe rumors of SRA are rural, poorly educated, religiously [[Christian right|conservative]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] families with an unquestioning belief in [[Culture of the United States|American values]] who feel significant anxieties over job loss, economic decline and family disintegration. Victor considers rumours of SRA a symptom of a moral crisis and a form of [[scapegoat]]ing for economic and social ills.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA55 55–56]}}

===Origins of the rumors===
Information about SRA claims spread through conferences presented to religious groups, churches and professionals such as police forces and therapists as well as parents. These conferences and presentations served to organize agencies and foster communication between groups, maintaining and spreading disproven or exaggerated stories as fact.&lt;ref name=CA/&gt; Members of local police forces organized into loose networks focused on cult crimes, some of whom billed themselves as "experts" and were paid to speak at conferences throughout the United States. Religious revivalists also took advantage of the rumors and preached about the dangers of Satanism to youth and presented themselves at paid engagements as secular experts.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA22 22–23]}} At the height of the panic, the highly emotional accusations and circumstances of SRA allegations made it difficult to investigate the claims, with the accused being assumed as guilty and skeptics becoming co-accused during trials, and trials moving forward based solely on the testimony of very young children without corroborating evidence.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA16 16–17]}} No [[forensic evidence|forensic]] or corroborating evidence has ever been found for religiously based cannibalistic or murderous SRA, despite extensive investigations.{{sfn |Bibby |1996 |pp=205–13}}&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}{{sfn |Frankfurter |2006 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysTcp21NfP0C&amp;pg=PA213 213]}} The concern and reaction expressed by various groups regarding the seriousness or threat of SRA has been considered out of proportion to the actual threat by satanically motivated crimes, and the rare crime that exists that may be labeled "satanic" does not justify the existence of a conspiracy or network of religiously motivated child abusers.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins |first=T |title=Satanic Panic: The Creation of a Contemporary Legend – book reviews |journal=Sociology of Religion |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SOR/is_n3_v55/ai_15729291/pg_1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924132924/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0SOR/is_n3_v55/ai_15729291/pg_1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-24 |year=1994 |accessdate=2008-06-27 |doi=10.2307/3712069 |volume=55 |last2=Victor |first2=Jeffrey S. |jstor=3712069 |issue=3 |pages=373–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA20 20–21]}}

===Scholarly and law enforcement investigations===
Jeffrey Victor reviewed 67 rumors about SRA in the United States and Canada reported in newspapers or television, and found no evidence supporting the existence of murderous satanic cults.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA330 330–54]}} LaFontaine states that cases of alleged SRA investigated in the [[United Kingdom]] were reviewed in detail and the majority were unsubstantiated; three were found to involve sexual abuse of children in the context of rituals, but none involved the [[Witches' Sabbath]] or devil worship that are characteristic of allegations of SRA.{{sfn |LaFontaine |1998 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JBxfvDeQdmoC&amp;pg=PA11 11]}} LaFontaine also states that no material evidence has been forthcoming in allegations of SRA; no bones, bodies or blood, in either the United States or Britain.

Kenneth Lanning, an [[FBI]] expert in the investigation of child sexual abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/heimbach050102.htm |title=Testimony of Michael J. Heimbach, Crimes Against Children Unit |last=Heimbach |first=MJ |date=2002-05-01 |publisher=United States Congress |accessdate=2008-04-30 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061230100851/http://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress02/heimbach050102.htm | archivedate = 2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; has stated that pseudo-Satanism may exist but there is "little or no evidence for ... large-scale baby breeding, human sacrifice, and organized satanic conspiracies".&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;There are many possible alternative answers to the question of why victims are alleging things that don't seem to be true....I believe that there is a middle ground—a continuum of possible activity. Some of what the victims allege may be true and accurate, some may be misperceived or distorted, some may be screened or symbolic, and some may be "contaminated" or false. The problem and challenge, especially for law enforcement, is to determine which is which. This can only be done through active investigation. I believe that the majority of victims alleging "ritual" abuse are in fact victims of some form of abuse or trauma.&lt;ref name=Lanning/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lanning produced a [[monograph]] in 1994 on SRA aimed at child protection authorities, which contained his opinion that despite hundreds of investigations no corroboration of SRA had been found. Following this report, several convictions based on SRA allegations were overturned and the defendants released.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |p=230}}

Reported cases of SRA involve bizarre activities, some of which are impossible (like people flying),&lt;ref name="Schreiber et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schreiber |first=Nadja |last2=Bellah |first2=Lisa |last3=Martinez |first3=Yolanda |last4=McLaurin |first4=Kristin |last5=, Renata Stok, Sena Garven and James Wood |title=Suggestive interviewing in the McMartin Preschool and Kelly Michaels daycare abuse cases: A case study |journal=Social Influence |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=16–46 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |url=http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=james_wood |doi=10.1080/15534510500361739}}&lt;/ref&gt; that makes the credibility of victims of child sexual abuse questionable. In cases where SRA is alleged to occur, Lanning describes common dynamics of the use of fear to control multiple young victims, the presence of multiple perpetrators and strange or ritualized behaviors, though allegations of crimes such as human sacrifice and cannibalism do not seem to be true. Lanning also suggests several reasons why adult victims may make allegations of SRA, including "pathological distortion, traumatic memory, normal childhood fears and fantasies, misperception, and confusion".&lt;ref name="Lanning2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Search/Abstracts.aspx?id=159841&amp;library=Publications_Lib&amp;query=%26lt%3BRecordset%26gt%3B%26lt%3BLibrary%20name%3D%26quot%3BPublications_Lib%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BField%20name%3D%26quot%3BDOC_BODY%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BQuery%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%21%5BCDATA%5BLanning%5D%5D%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Query%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Field%26gt%3B%26lt%3BField%20name%3D%26quot%3Bis_full_text%26quot%3B%26gt%3B%26lt%3BQuery%26gt%3B%26lt%3B%21%5BCDATA%5BN%5D%5D%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Query%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Field%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Library%26gt%3B%26lt%3B/Recordset%26gt%3B|title=Satanic Ritual Abuse of Children Is Not Widespread|last=Lanning|first=K|publisher=[[Greenhaven Press]], Inc|year=1994|editor=Bender D|series=Opposing Viewpoints Series|accessdate=2008-04-29|editor2=Leone, B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court cases==
{{Main article |List of satanic ritual abuse allegations}}
Allegations of SRA have appeared throughout the world. The failure of certain high-profile legal cases generated worldwide media attention, and came to play a central feature in the growing controversies over child abuse, memory and the law.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, DP, Scheflin, AW &amp; Hammond, DC |title=Memory, trauma treatment, and the law |publisher=W.W.

During the early 1980s, some courts attempted ''[[ad hoc]]'' accommodations to address the anxieties of child witnesses in relation to testifying before defendants. Screens or [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] technology are a common feature of child sexual assault trials today; children in the early 1980s were typically forced into direct visual contact with the accused abuser while in court. SRA allegations in the courts catalyzed a broad agenda of research into the nature of children's testimony and the reliability of their oral evidence in court. Ultimately in SRA cases, the coercive techniques used by believing district attorneys, therapists and police officers were critical in establishing, and often resolving, SRA cases. In courts, when juries were able to see recordings or transcripts of interviews with children, the alleged abusers were acquitted. The reaction by successful prosecutors, spread throughout conventions and conferences on SRA, was to destroy, or fail to take notes of the interviews in the first place.{{sfn |Nathan |Snedeker |1995 |pp=224–27}} One group of researchers concluded that children usually lack the sufficient amount of "explicit knowledge" of satanic ritual abuse to fabricate all of the details of an SRA claim on their own.&lt;ref name=Goodman1997&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodman, G.S. |author2=Quas, J.A. |author3=Bottoms, B.L. |author4=Qin, J. |author5=Shaver, P.R. |author6=Orcutt, H. |author7= Shapiro, C.  |year=1997 |title=Children's religious knowledge: Implications for understanding satanic ritual abuse allegations |journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1111–30 |doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(97)00070-7 |pmid=9422831}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same researchers also concluded that children usually have the sufficient amount of general knowledge of "violence and the occult" to "serve as a starting point from which ritual claims could develop."&lt;ref name=Goodman1997/&gt;

Many women claiming to be SRA survivors have been diagnosed as sufferers of DID, and it is unclear if their claims of childhood abuse are accurate or a manifestation of their diagnosis.{{sfn |Victor |1993 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=abJqF8csPrQC&amp;pg=PA89 89]}} Of a sample of 29 patients who presented with SRA, 22 were diagnosed with dissociative disorders including DID.

==False memories==
One explanation for the SRA allegations is that they were based upon false memories caused by the over-use of [[hypnosis]] and other suggestive techniques by therapists underestimating the suggestibility of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;Loftus &amp; Ketcham, 1996, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=13JZozT2kMYC&amp;pg=PA85 85].&lt;/ref&gt; The altered state of consciousness induced by hypnosis rendered patients an unusual ability to produce [[confabulation]]s, often with the assistance of their therapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellis, Bill |title=Raising the devil: Satanism, new religions, and the media |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Ky |year=2000 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oLcqlypMCe8C&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 87–97] |isbn=0-8131-2170-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of [[false memory syndrome]] (FMS), a controversial term promoted by the [[False Memory Syndrome Foundation]], claim that the purported "memories" of ritual abuse are actually false memories, created [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenically]] through suggestion or coercion.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt; The FMSF has used the idea of ritual abuse as a strategy to illustrate their position that most allegations of sexual abuse uncovered by the suggestive techniques used during recovered memory therapy are false "memories" of events that never happened. According to Kathleen Faller this has contributed to the sensationalization of the ritual abuse cases in the media.{{sfn |Faller |2003 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AJgxUqce5GcC&amp;pg=PA 51]}}

[[Paul R. McHugh]], professor of psychiatry at [[Johns Hopkins University]] discusses in his book ''Try to Remember'' the developments that led to the creation of false memories in the SRA moral panic and the formation of the FMSF as an effort to bring contemporary scientific research and political action to the polarizing struggle about false memories within the mental health disciplines. According to McHugh, there is no coherent scientific basis for the core belief of one side of the struggle, that sexual abuse can cause massive systemic repression of memories that can only be accessed through hypnosis, coercive interviews and other dubious techniques. The group of psychiatrists who promoted these ideas, whom McHugh terms "[[Mannerism|Mannerist]] Freudians", consistently followed a [[deductive reasoning|deductive approach]] to diagnosis in which the theory and causal explanation of symptoms was assumed to be childhood sexual abuse leading to dissociation, followed by a set of unproven and unreliable treatments with a strong [[confirmation bias]] that inevitably produced the allegations and causes that were assumed to be there. The treatment approach involved isolation of the patient from friends and family within psychiatric wards dedicated to the treatment of dissociation, filled with other patients who were treated by the same doctors with the same flawed methods and staff members who also coherently and universally ascribed to the same set of beliefs. These methods began in the 1980s and continued for several years until a series of court cases and [[medical malpractice]] lawsuits resulted in hospitals failing to support the approach. In cases where the dissociative symptoms were ignored, the coercive treatment approach ceased and the patients were removed from dedicated wards, allegations of satanic rape and abuse normally ceased, "recovered" memories were identified as fabrications and conventional treatments for presenting symptoms were generally successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McHugh |first=PR |authorlink=Paul R.

'''Scotistic realism''' (also '''Scotist realism''' or '''Scotist formalism''') is the [[Scotist]] position on the [[problem of universals]]. It is a form of [[moderate realism]].

The "problem of universals", which was an ancient problem in [[metaphysics]] about whether [[universals]] exist. For [[John Duns Scotus]], a [[Franciscan]] [[philosopher]], [[theologian]] and [[Catholic priest]], universals such as "greenness" and "goodness" exist in reality. This is opposed to the later [[conceptualism]] of [[William of Ockham]], and the earlier views of [[Abelard]] and others, which say universals exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial reality.&lt;ref&gt;"conceptualism" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spade 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scholasticism==

The problem of universals existed as early as [[Plato]], who taught the [[Theory of Forms]], that universal "forms" existed. This opinion was rejected by many later thinkers, such as [[Peter Abelard]], who instead argued that forms are merely mental constructs.&lt;ref&gt; Abelard:Logica Ingredientibus (Glosses on Porphyry)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Fantis - Opus Oxoniense - 4324737.tif|thumb|[[Antonio De Fantis]], ''Opus Oxoniense'']]
Scotus denied these claims; in his ''[[Opus Oxoniense]]'' he argued that universals have a real and substantial existence.&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense II. D3, 1-6, 1-212&lt;/ref&gt; For Scotus, the problem of universals was closely tied to that of [[individuation]], by identifying what makes a particular thing this or that particular thing; we could also come to understand if any form of universal exists, it is in this work that Scotus introduces the word "[[haecceity]]", which means the "thisness" of a particular object – what makes it what it is.

{{Quotation|I say then that the main reason for the likening or similarity is the form itself shared between the generator and the generated, not according to individual unity and identity insofar as it is "this" form, but according to a lesser unity and identity insofar as it is a form. The reason for generating is in accordance with this. Form also is a more principal reason for the distinction than matter is, because just as the form is more principally that by which something is a composite than the matter is, so it is more principally that by which a composite is one, and consequently not distinguished in itself and yet distinct from everything else|Scotus|Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1. q. 6, n. 210 [Scotus, (1950-), 7:412-413; Spade (1994), 69]}}

In this, Scotus argues that form is a better means of individuating a particular object; because according to him the form of an object as a composite is the best manner of making objects distinct from one another, rather than the matter of the object. This is at the heart of Scotist realism, particularly at the theories of haecceity and [[formal distinction]]. Scotus also argues, against [[Aquinas]] and others, that there is no distinction between the [[essence]] of a thing and its [[existence]].&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2, &lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of C. S. Peirce==

The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] was quite influenced by Scotus. Here is a statement of Peirce's interpretation of Scotistic Realism by [[T. A. Goudge]]:

The gist of that 'subtle and difficult' doctrine is taken by Peirce to be as follows.  Apart from thought, only singular things exist.  But there are in singulars certain 'natures,' themselves neither universal nor particular, which constitute the ground of intelligibility.  In things, these natures are particular; when brought into relation with an act of the intellect, they are universal ... Thus, for example, the directly experienced hard surface of a particular stone is determinate, whereas the universal hardness which the intellect grasps is indeterminate or general.  A consequence of this view is that the individual per se is not a proper object of knowledge.  What we know are genera and species, themselves the product of mental action.  Yet because complete being embraces both universality and particularity, because man perceives the singular with his senses while cognizing the universal with his intellect, it is possible for him to attain to the singular by relating universals to something which is ''this.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Goudge, The Thought of C. S. Peirce (Dover 1969), p. 99.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce interprets Scotus's idea of individuation or '''haecceity''' (thisness) in terms of his own category of "secondness." When we think of ''this,'' we are relating our pointing finger, for example, or a particular sense organ with another individual thing. As Scotus said, "nothing is ''this'' in itself." It is so only in relation to something else. Goudge goes on to give Peirce's argument for the objectivity of universals: 

The objection may be raised that such a view destroys the reality of the universal by making it depend on a relation to thought.  Peirce replies that this objection springs from the belief that the real must be wholly independent of reflective activity, i.e., must be a thing in itself.  But the notion of the thing in itself is self-contradictory, for it requires us to think about what is per definitionem out of relation to thought.  We can have no conception of any incognizable reality ... Indeed, “a realist is simply one who knows no more recondite reality than that which is represented in a true representation.”&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Peirce, Collected papers 5.312.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Socrates}}
A '''gadfly''' is a person who interferes with the [[status quo]] of a [[society]] or [[community]] by posing novel, potently upsetting questions, usually directed at authorities. The term is originally associated with the ancient Greek philosopher [[Socrates]], in [[Apology (Plato)|his defense]] when on trial for his life.

==History==
===Socrates===
The term "gadfly" ({{lang-grc-gre|μύωψ}}, ''mýops''&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0068:text=comm:book=3:commline=277 | title = commentary for book 3, line 277, out of George W. Mooney's Commentary on Apollonius: Argonautica}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was used by [[Plato]] in the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.Apol.30e&amp;lang=original|title = Apology 30e}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe [[Socrates]]'s relationship of uncomfortable goad to the [[Ancient Greece|Athenian]] political scene, which he compared to a slow and dimwitted horse.

During [[Apology (Plato)|his defense]] when on trial for his life, Socrates, according to Plato's writings, pointed out that [[dissent]], like the [[horse-fly|gadfly]], was easy to swat, but the cost to society of silencing individuals who were irritating could be very high: "If you kill a man like me, you will injure yourselves more than you will injure me" because his role was that of a gadfly, "to sting people and whip them into a fury, all in the service of truth." This may have been one of the earliest descriptions of [[gadfly ethics]].

===Bible===
The [[Book of Jeremiah]] uses a similar analogy as a political{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} metaphor: "Egypt is a very fair heifer; the gad-fly cometh, it cometh from the north" (46:20, [[Darby Bible]]).

===Modern politics===
In modern politics, a gadfly is someone who persistently challenges people in positions of [[power (social and political)|power]], the status quo or a popular position.&lt;ref name="slategadfly"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Liberto|title=Publix uses law to boot gadfly|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/08/08/State/Publix_uses_law_to_bo.shtml|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=2007-08-08|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Morris Kline]] wrote, "There is a function for the gadfly who poses questions that many specialists would like to overlook. [[Polemics]] is healthy."&lt;ref&gt;''Why the Professor Can't Teach'' (1977), page 238&lt;/ref&gt; The word may be uttered in a [[pejorative]] sense or  be accepted as a description of honourable work or civic duty.&lt;ref name="h2g2gadfly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2334197|title=The Gadfly|accessdate=2008-06-22|work=BBC – h2g2|date=2004-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''subject-expectancy effect''', is a form of [[reactivity (psychology)|reactivity]] that occurs in [[scientific experiment]]s or [[medical treatment]]s when a [[research subject]] or [[patient]] expects a given result and therefore unconsciously affects the outcome, or reports the expected result. Because this effect can significantly [[bias]] the results of experiments (especially on [[human subject research|human subject]]s), [[double-blind]] methodology is used to eliminate the effect.

Like the [[observer-expectancy effect]], it is often a cause of "odd" results in many experiments. The subject-expectancy effect is most commonly found in [[medicine]], where it can result in the subject experiencing the [[placebo effect]] or [[nocebo effect]], depending on how the influence pans out.

The subject expectancy effect is also observed in [[psychotherapy]].

==Example==

An example of a scenario involving these various effects is as follows: A woman goes to her doctor with a problem. The doctor diagnoses with certainty, and then clearly explains the diagnosis and the expected route towards recovery. If he does this convincingly, calming her, removing fear and instilling hope, she will likely, through the positive expectancy, experience the placebo effect, aiding in her recovery.

On the other hand, if her doctor had had little time for her, was uncertain about the diagnosis, and had given her a [[medical prescription|prescription]], combined with a message along the lines of, "this may help sometimes", and added a message about possible horrible [[side effects]] (combined, say, with the patient having talked to a neighbor who also speaks along the same lines about the horrible side effects), then the chance of negative subject-expectancy, or [[nocebo]], becomes quite large.

'''Sustainability''' is the process of maintaining change in a [[Homeostasis|balanced]] fashion, in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalfootprints.org/sustainability|title=What is sustainability|website=www.globalfootprints.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many in the field, sustainability is defined through the following interconnected domains or pillars: environment, economic and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/sustainability_primer_v9.pdf|title=Sustainability Primer|last=EPA|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-domains of sustainable development have been considered also: cultural, technological and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice| url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719 | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}; {{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=Jaes A.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Sustainable development}}

The name sustainability is derived from the [[Latin]] ''sustinere'' (''tenere'', to hold; ''sub'', under). ''Sustain'' can mean "maintain", "support", or "endure".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|sustain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Onions, Charles, T. (ed) (1964). ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. p. 2095.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s ''sustainability'' has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept ''[[sustainable development]]'', that of the [[Brundtland Commission]] of the [[United Nations]] on March 20, 1987: "sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly (1987) [http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm ''Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future''].

While the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, [[social sustainability|social development]] and environmental protection it continued using three domains: economics, environment and social sustainability. More recently, using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade, the [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguished four domains of economic, ecological, political and [[cultural sustainability]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2016 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2=

Retrieved on 2016-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Metropolis, this approach does not mean adding a fourth domain of culture to the dominant [[triple bottom line]] figure of the economy, environment and the social. Rather, it involves treating all four domains—economy, ecology, politics and culture—as social (including economics) and distinguishing between ecology (as the intersection of the human and natural worlds) and environment as that which goes far beyond what we as humans can ever know.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metropolis.org/library Metropolis Action Plan 2018-2020, at www.metropolis.org] {{Cite book | year= 2016 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2=

===Seven modalities===
Another model suggests humans attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities: economy, community, occupational groups, government, environment, culture, and physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Steve A. (2016). The Nature of Sustainability. Chapbook Press. Grand Rapids, Michigan. {{ISBN|9781943359394}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the global to the individual human scale, each of the seven modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels. Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.

===Shaping the future===
Integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]]. It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme]&lt;/ref&gt;
Encouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations. Additionally, instigating innovative and sustainable travel and transportation solutions must play a vital role in this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign|date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205–220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/18877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resiliency==
[[wikt:resilience|Resiliency]] in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability. Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to [[policymaker]]s a definition remains elusive. Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service's current and future generations need from them.  It is also concerned with commitment from [[geopolitical]] policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life?&lt;ref&gt;Brian Walker and David Salt, ''Resilience Practice: Building Capacity to Absorb Disturbance and Maintain Function''. Island Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The resiliency of an ecosystem, and thereby, its sustainability, can be reasonably measured at [[juncture]]s or events where the combination of [[nature|naturally]] occurring [[Regenerative (design)|regenerative]] forces ([[solar energy]], water, soil, [[atmosphere]], vegetation, and [[biomass]]) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead''. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2013, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A practical view of sustainability is [[closed system]]s that maintain processes of [[productivity]] indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin K. Hendrix, Sustainable Backyard Polyculture: Designing for ecological resiliency. Smashwords Edition, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced. In nature, the accounting occurs naturally through a process of [[adaptation]] as an ecosystem returns to [[wikt:viability|viability]] from an external disturbance. The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event (earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, tornado, flood, or thunderstorm), followed by [[dissipation|absorption]], [[utilization]], or [[wikt:rejection|deflection]] of the [[energy]] or energies that the external forces created.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Walker and David Salt, ''Resilience Thinking: Sustaining ecosystems and people in a changing world''. Island Press, 2006. p. xiii; Crawford S. Holling, Adaptive environmental assessment and management. Wiley, 1978. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In analysing systems such as urban and national parks, dams, farms and gardens, theme parks, open-pit mines, water catchments, one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events.&lt;ref&gt;Walker and Salt, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles and concepts==

The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields; in recent years an area that has come to be called [[sustainability science]] has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Kates, Robert W., ed. (2010). [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/cid/publications/faculty/wp/213.pdf Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology – an introduction to the key literatures of sustainability science] CID Working Paper No. 213. Center for International Development, Harvard University. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale and context===
Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales (levels or frames of reference) of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. The focus ranges from the total [[carrying capacity]] (sustainability) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors, ecosystems, countries, municipalities, neighbourhoods, home gardens, individual lives, individual goods and services{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}, occupations, lifestyles, behaviour patterns and so on. In short, it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.&lt;ref&gt;Conceptual Framework Working Group of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. (2003). "Ecosystems and Human Well-being." London: [[Island Press]]. Chapter 5. "Dealing with Scale". pp. 107–124. {{ISBN|9781559634038}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Daniel Botkin, author and environmentalist, has stated: "We see a landscape that is always in flux, changing over many scales of time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Botkin, D.B. (1990). ''Discordant Harmonies, a New Ecology for the 21st century''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507469-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]] has drawn parallels to other, more tangible [[closed systems]]. For example, he likens human existence on Earth&amp;nbsp;— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated [[depletion of resources]]&amp;nbsp;— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lecture by [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]] to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London|title=Sustainability Lessons From Life On A Small Boat|url=http://www.jasonexplorer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rgs_sustainability_end_piece_broadband.mov|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, he argues, exercising the [[precautionary principle]] is a key factor in survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jason "[http://www.billyfishbooks.com/Books.html The Seed Buried Deep (The Expedition Trilogy, part 2)]" BillyFish Books, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumption===
A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of [[biophysical]] [[resources]], and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D. (2006). ''A Rough Guide to Ethical Living''. London: Penguin. {{ISBN|978-1-84353-792-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brower&gt;Brower, M. &amp; Leon, W. (1999). ''The Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices: Practical Advice from the Union of Concerned Scientists''. New York: Three Rivers Press. {{ISBN|0-609-80281-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the [[I PAT]] formula. This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components: [[population]] numbers, levels of consumption (which it terms "affluence", although the usage is different), and impact per unit of resource use (which is termed "technology", because this impact depends on the [[technology]] used). The equation is expressed:

:::::::: I = P × A × T

::: Where: I = Environmental impact, P = Population, A = Affluence, T = Technology&lt;ref name=Ehrlich&amp;Holden&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Ehrlich | first1 = P.R. | last2 = Holden | first2 = J.P. | year = 1974 | title = Human Population and the global environment | url = |magazine= American Scientist | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 282–292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circularity ==
In recent years, concepts based on (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts might be the [[Circular Economy]], with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geissdoerfer|first=Martin|last2=Savaget|first2=Paulo|last3=Bocken|first3=Nancy M.

According to the most recent (July 2015) revision of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the [[world population]] is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/world-population-prospects-2015-revision.html|title=The World Population Prospects: 2015 Revision|date=2015-01-01|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the increase will be in [[Developing country|developing countries]] whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more [[Developed country|developed regions]] is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2009).

At the global scale, scientific data now indicates that humans are living beyond the [[carrying capacity]] of planet Earth and that this cannot continue indefinitely. This scientific evidence comes from many sources but is presented in detail in the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] and the [[planetary boundaries]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;Garver G (2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120123193923/http://cc2011.earthsystemgovernance.org/pdf/2011Colora_0110.pdf "A Framework for Novel and Adaptive Governance Approaches Based on Planetary Boundaries"] ''[[Colorado State University]]'', Colorado Conference on Earth System Governance, 17–20 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An early detailed examination of global limits was published in the 1972 book ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', which has prompted follow-up commentary and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Graham (2008) [http://www.csiro.au/files/files/plje.pdf "A comparison of ''The Limits to Growth'' with thirty years of reality"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128151523/http://www.csiro.au/files/files/plje.pdf |date=28 November 2010 }} Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([[CSIRO]]) Sustainable Ecosystems.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 review in ''Nature'' by 22 international researchers expressed concerns that the Earth may be "approaching a state shift" in its biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barnosky | first1 = AD | last2 = Hadly | first2 = EA | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v486/n7401/full/nature11018.html | journal = Nature | volume = 486 | issue = 7401| pages = 52–58 | doi = 10.1038/nature11018 | pmid = 22678279 | bibcode = 2012Natur.486...52B | hdl = 10261/55208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ecological footprint]] measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 [[global hectare]]s per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms).&lt;ref name="LPR"/&gt; The resulting [[ecological deficit]] must be met from unsustainable ''extra'' sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. [[fossil fuels]]); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by [[Overexploitation|over exploiting]] [[Forests#Forest management and forest loss|forests]] and [[fisheries management|fisheries]]).

The figure (right) examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN [[Human Development Index]] (a measure of standard of living). The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always, [[population growth]] has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich&amp;Holden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams &amp; Jeanrenaud (2008) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels; that is, to not exceed "one planet" consumption. Information generated by reports at the national, regional and city scales confirm the global trend towards societies that are becoming less sustainable over time.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP Grid Arendal.

[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and a [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674257801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|303}} Leading ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]], a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Daly's concession|propounded the same argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daly |first=Herman E., ed. |authorlink=Herman Daly |edition=2nd |date=1980 |title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics.

At the enterprise scale, carrying capacity now also plays a critical role in making it possible to measure and report the sustainability performance of individual organizations.  This is most clearly demonstrated through use of [[Context-Based Sustainability]] (CBS) tools, methods and metrics, including the MultiCapital Scorecard, which have been in development since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|title=Social Footprints|date=2008|publisher=University of Groningen|isbn=978-0-615-24274-3|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/13147558/00-titlecon.pdf|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Martin|last2=McElroy|first2=Mark|title=The MultiCapital Scorecard|date=2016|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=9781603586900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to many other mainstream approaches to measuring the sustainability performance of organizations – which tend to be more incrementalist in form – CBS is explicitly tied to social, environmental and economic limits and thresholds in the world.  Thus, rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another, CBS makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organization-specific norms, standards or thresholds for what they (the impacts) would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable (i.e., which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or non-human well-being).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|last2=Jorna|first2=Rene|last3=van Engelen|first3=Jo|title=Sustaiability Quotients and the Social Footprint|journal=Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management|date=2007|volume=15|issue=4|pages=223–234|doi=10.1002/csr.164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|last2=van Engelen|first2=Jo|title=Corporate Sustainability Management|date=2012|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=978-1-84407-911-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a fundamental level, [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] and [[biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical cycling]] set an upper limit on the number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt; Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated in a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of [[water]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Smil, V.

The ''Millennium Ecosystem Assessment'' is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world's leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth's [[ecosystem]]s and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers. It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world [[ecosystems]], reducing both their [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[biocapacity]]. The report refers to natural systems as humanity's "life-support system", providing essential "[[ecosystem services]]". The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last 50 years, 15 are in serious decline, and five are in a precarious condition.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 6–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

This direct approach is based largely on information gained from [[earth science]], [[environmental science]] and [[conservation biology]].
However, this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.

Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from [[economics]]. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a [[sustainable yield]] (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Daly | first1 = H.E. | year = 1990 | title = Toward some operational principles of sustainable development | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1016/0921-8009(90)90010-r| bibcode = 2005ecec.book.....C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental management===

At a March 2009 meeting of the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]], 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now "no excuse" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction "abrupt or irreversible" shifts in climate may occur that "will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with".&lt;ref&gt;University of Copenhagen (March 2009) [http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ "Key Messages from the Congress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316181631/http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ |date=16 March 2009 }} News item on Copenhagen Climate Congress in March 2009.

Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the [[air pollution]] in cities, the [[pollutants]] including toxic chemicals like [[nitrogen oxides]], [[Sulfur dioxide|sulfur oxides]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]] that produce [[photochemical smog]] and [[acid rain]], and the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s that degrade the [[ozone layer]]. [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] particulates such as sulfate [[aerosol]]s in the atmosphere reduce the direct [[irradiance]] and reflectance ([[albedo]]) of the [[Earth]]'s surface. Known as [[global dimming]], the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global [[water cycle]] by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gases]] on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, G.C. ''et al''. (2007).

====Freshwater and oceans====
[[File:Bleached coral.jpg|thumb|Changes in environmental conditions lead to [[coral bleaching]] and harm to biodiversity of fragile marine ecosystems. ]]
Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing [[urbanization]] pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.&lt;ref name="water"&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y.

====Land use====
[[File:Rice Field.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A farmer working in a rice paddy.|A rice paddy in Bangladesh. Rice, wheat, corn and potatoes make up more than half the world's food supply.]]

Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 560–582.&lt;/ref&gt; At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]] and [[green cities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

===Management of human consumption===
{{Further|Consumption (economics)}}
[[File:Helix of sustainability.png|right|thumb|alt=Diagram showing ways that the manufacturing process can reduce the use of energy|Helix of sustainability—the [[carbon cycle]] of manufacturing]]
The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, L. &amp; Lorek, S. (2004). [http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/publications/2004/87-7614-193-4/pdf/87-7614-194-2.pdf "Consumption and the Environment in Europe: Trends and Futures."] Danish Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental Project No. 904.&lt;/ref&gt; This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, T. &amp; Michaelis, L. (2003). [http://www.sdcommission.gov.uk/pubs/suscon/ "Policies for Sustainable Consumption"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), [[resource intensity]], and [[resource productivity]] are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are [[food]], [[energy]], materials and water.

In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx ''Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production: Priority Products and Materials''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513215416/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |date=13 May 2016 }} 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries. The study found that the most critical impacts are related to [[ecosystem]] health, human health and [[resource depletion]]. From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and [[fisheries]] have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, [[food]] and energy-using products cause the majority of [[life cycle assessment|life-cycle]] impacts of consumption.

The Sun's energy, stored by plants ([[primary producer]]s) during [[photosynthesis]], passes through the [[food chain]] to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes. Since the [[industrial revolution]] the concentrated energy of the [[Sun]] stored in fossilized plants as [[fossil fuel]]s has been a major driver of [[technology]] which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power. In 2007 climate scientists of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world's climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60–90% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels at 450–650&amp;nbsp;ppm from current levels of about 380&amp;nbsp;ppm.

[[Water security]] and [[food security]] are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the [[economy]]—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive [[dam]] construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, affected their [[water quality]] and had a significant impact on the global water cycle.&lt;ref name="Shik" /&gt; Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if [[climate change]] impacts become more severe, [[population]]s increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for [[industry]], and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.&lt;ref name="Shik"&gt;Shiklamov, I.

A recent UNEP report proposes a [[green economy]] defined as one that "improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities": it "does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of [[natural capital]]". The report makes three key findings: "that greening not only generates increases in wealth, in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital, but also (over a period of six years) produces a higher rate of GDP growth"; that there is "an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons, arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor"; "in the transition to a green economy, new jobs are created, which in time exceed the losses in "brown economy" jobs. However, there is a period of job losses in transition, which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environmental Program (2011).

In [[economic]] and [[Environmental policy|environmental]] fields, the term [[Eco-economic decoupling|decoupling]] is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to [[environmental quality]].&lt;ref name=Costanza/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, C.J. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biophysical_economics "Biophysical economics"], ''[[Encyclopedia of Earth]]'', Last updated: 14 September 2006. Retrieved on: 2009-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/ Decoupling: natural resource use and environmental impacts of economic growth]. International Resource Panel report, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce [[resource intensity]] (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, H. (1996). ''Beyond Growth: The Economics of Sustainable Development''. Boston: Beacon Press. {{ISBN|0-8070-4709-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit [[GDP]]) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Von Weizsacker, E.U. (1998). ''Factor Four: Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Weizsacker, E.U., C. Hargroves, M.H. Smith, C. Desha, and P. Stasinopoulos (2009). ''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]] resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cleveland | first1 = C.J. | last2 = Ruth | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Indicators of Dematerialization and the Materials Intensity of Use | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 15–50 | doi=10.1162/jiec.1998.2.3.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., [[second law of thermodynamics]]) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011).[http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a [[steady state economy]] in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by [[Herman Daly]] and others in the [[ecological economics]] community.

A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the ''restore'' approach.&lt;ref name="restore"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the "conundrum"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach views "restore" as a fourth component to the common reduce, reuse, recycle motto. Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources. These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects, but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects.&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt;

=== Ecosocialist approach ===
{{Further|Eco-socialism|Marxism}}
One school of thought, often labeled [[Eco-socialism|ecosocialism]] or ecological Marxism, asserts that the [[Capitalism|capitalist economic system]] is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory rests on the premises that:
# Capitalism's sole economic purpose is "unlimited [[capital accumulation]]" in the hands of the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]]&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The urge to accumulate (the [[profit motive]]) drives capitalists to continually reinvest and expand production, creating indefinite and unsustainable economic growth&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 42–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 38, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Capital tends to degrade the conditions of its own production" (the ecosystems and resources on which any economy depends)&lt;ref name="Kovel 2007, p. 38"&gt;Kovel 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, according to this analysis:

# Giving economic priority to the fulfillment of [[Human rights|human needs]] while staying within ecological limits, as [[sustainable development]] demands, is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A steady-state capitalist economy is impossible;&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; further, a steady-state capitalist economy is socially undesirable due to the inevitable outcome of massive [[Unemployment|unemployment and underemployment]]&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 42, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Capitalism will, unless overcome by [[revolution]], run up against the physical limits of the biosphere and [[Societal collapse|self-destruct]]&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 27, 122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this logic, market-based solutions to ecological crises ([[ecological economics]], [[environmental economics]], [[green economy]]) are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism's structural failures.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 173–87.&lt;/ref&gt; "Low-risk" technology/science-based solutions such as [[solar power]], [[sustainable agriculture]], and increases in [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] are seen as necessary but insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; "High-risk" technological solutions such as [[nuclear power]] and [[climate engineering]] are entirely rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 111–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts made by businesses to "[[Greenwashing|greenwash]]" their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as [[Walmart]]'s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has [[Jevons paradox|the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption]], viz. further economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 102–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sustainable business]] models and the [[triple bottom line]] are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the [[distribution of wealth]] to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable.&lt;ref name="Kovel 2007, p. 38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders [[Environmental law|environmental reforms]] incapable of facilitating large-scale change: "History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens."&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; They also note that, up until the event of total [[ecological collapse]], destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 285–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosocialists advocate for the [[revolution]]ary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism—an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill [[Human rights|human needs]]—as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in [[Nature]]: "What every environmentalist needs to know ... is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, in order to create a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet."&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social dimension==
{{Further|Social sustainability}}
{{see also|Environmental policy}}

Sustainability issues are generally expressed in [[science|scientific]] and environmental terms, as well as in ethical terms of [[stewardship]], but implementing change is a social challenge that entails, among other things, [[international law|international]] and national [[law]], [[urban planning]] and transport, local and individual [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] and [[ethical consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Agenda 21]] "Declaration of the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development." Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; "The relationship between human rights and human development, [[corporate capitalism|corporate power]] and environmental justice, global poverty and citizen action, suggest that responsible global citizenship is an inescapable element of what may at first glance seem to be simply matters of personal consumer and moral choice."&lt;ref name = Blewitt2008,96&gt;Blewitt, J.

===Peace, security, social justice===

===Poverty===
{{Further|Poverty}}
A major hurdle to achieve sustainability is the alleviation of poverty. It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has been made by the [[Brundtland Report|Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=UN Documents Gathering a body of global agreements}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Millennium Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Millennium Development Goals Report, 2009|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_Report_2009_ENG.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, "poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lusigi|first=Angela|title=Linking Poverty to Environmental Sustainability|url=http://www.povertyandconservation.info/docs/20080524-UNDP-UNEP_Poverty_Environment_Initiative.pdf|publisher=UNDP-UNEP Poverty&amp;nbsp;— Environment Initiative|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials. According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world's poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are fewer children a route to prosperity?|url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/home/factsheets/pid/3856|website=FACT SHEET: Population Growth and Poverty|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=2011-04-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221140406/http://www.unfpa.org/public/home/factsheets/pid/3856|archivedate=21 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment. For example, teaching [[water treatment]] to the poor by boiling their water with [[charcoal]], would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] [[solar water disinfection]] would be. Also, sustainable [[best practices]] can involve the [[recycling]] of materials, such as the use of [[plastics recycling|recycled]] [[plastics]] for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as [[Bridges to Prosperity]]'s use of wire rope from shipping container [[gantry cranes]] to act as the structural wire rope for [[footbridges]] that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.

===Human relationship to nature===
According to [[Murray Bookchin]], the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] societies. Bookchin contends that [[capitalism]] and [[Market (economics)|market]] relationships, if unchecked, have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a [[commodity]]: "The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital."&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, M. (2004). ''Post Scarcity Anarchism''. Oakland: [[AK Press]], pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25. {{ISBN|978-1-904859-06-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]], founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, M. (2007). ''Social Ecology and Communalism''. Oakland: AK Press, p.&amp;nbsp;19. {{ISBN|978-1-904859-49-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards of the United States of America, The Government and the Economy has had a long lasting impact on the environment, but in a problematic way. Policy issues regarding the environment has shown that the country regards the protection of the environment as a "second hand issue." One causation from this is a certain dilemma called "collective action problem" or collective action dilemmas." These occur when individuals, firms, or governments would be better off if they cooperated in the pursuit of a common goal, but, for one reason or another, one or more of those involved choose a less optimal course of action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Policy New Directions for the Twenty-First Century|last=Vig, Norman J.|first=Kraft, Michael E.|publisher=CQPress|year=2018|isbn=|location=2455 Teller Road Thousand Oaks, California|pages=269–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Potoski and Aseem Prakash have made a model establishing 4 cells that are explaining each benefit for the government or the economic process.

[[Deep ecology]] is a movement founded by [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] that establishes principles for the well-being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve the ''[[quality of life]]'' rather than the ''[[standard of living]]''. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen.&lt;ref&gt;Devall, W. and G. Sessions (1985). ''Deep Ecology: Living as If Nature Mattered''.

One approach to [[sustainable living]], exemplified by small-scale urban [[Transition Towns|transition towns]] and rural [[ecovillages]], seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of [[simple living]], which maximize [[self-sufficiency]] particularly in food production.

Other approaches, loosely based around [[New Urbanism]], are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve [[sustainable cities]] which support [[sustainable transport]] and [[Zero carbon housing|zero emission housing]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, R [http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html "Growing Cooler – the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |date=24 December 2010 }}.

=== Human and labor rights ===
Application of [[social sustainability]] requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/545/social-sustainability|title=Social Sustainability – GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/546/social-sustainability-initiatives-guidelines-standards|title=Social Sustainability Initiatives, Guidelines, and Standards   – GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Equator Principles]] (financial industry), [[Fair Wear Foundation]] (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as [[Green Seal]] for cleaning products, [[NSF International|NSF]]-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of [[Organic food]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/542/resources-verifying-sustainable-products|title=Resources for Verifying Sustainable Products   – GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural dimension==
{{Further|Cultural sustainability}}
{{See also|Agenda 21 for culture|United Cities and Local Governments}}

The cultural dimension of sustainability is known as '''[[cultural sustainability]]'''. Important in the advancement of this notion have been the [[United Nations]], [[Unesco]], and in particular their [[Agenda 21]] and [[Agenda 21 for culture]] (now also known as [[Culture 21]]), a program for [[cultural governance]] developed in 2002–2004 and coordinated by [[United Cities and Local Governments|United Cities and Local Governments UCLG]], created in 2004.

===Tourism===

Sustainability is central to underpinning feelings of authenticity in tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryce|first=Derek|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Taheri|first4=Babak|date=2015-02-01|title=Visitors' engagement and authenticity: Japanese heritage consumption|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517714001642|journal=Tourism Management|volume=46|pages=571–581|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2014.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences can be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine, and at the same time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite for follow-up visits to the real thing: objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation. Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism; as the maximisation of existential "felt" authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance increases the likelihood of return visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Farrington|first2=Thomas|last3=Curran|first3=Ross|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2017-04-11|title=Sustainability and the authentic experience.

In [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom planning law]], a '''sustainability appraisal''' is an appraisal of the economic, environmental, and social effects of a plan from the outset of the preparation process to allow decisions to be made that accord with [[sustainable development]].

Since 2001, sustainability appraisals have had to be in conformity with the EU directive on [[strategic environmental assessment]].

Dr. Nick Plant of the [[University of West England]] studied and wrote extensively about sustainability appraisals as a solution for [[information and communications technology]] challenges facing small non-profit organizations.  He concluded that "Sustainability Appraisals promote inclusion and collaboration, and the facilitative approach can lead to empowerment and organizational learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plant|first1=Nick|title=Sustainability Appraisal|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/sustainability-appraisal|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is a sector specific sustainability appraisal method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5572">Among the [[Anishinaabe]] people, the '''Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers''', also known simply as either the '''Seven Teachings''' or '''Seven Grandfathers''', is a set of teachings on human conduct towards others.  Originating from traditional Anishinaabe teachings from elders, Edward Benton-Banai describes an in-depth understanding of what each means, in his novel "The Mishomis Book".  Benton-Banai's book is an example of contemporary Anishinaabe teachings to be used in contemporary situations.

== Background ==

In Edward Benton-Banai's story "The Mishomis Book" it is stated that the ''[[aadizookaan]]'' (traditional story) or the teachings of the seven grandfathers were given to the Anishinaabeg early in their history.  Seven Grandfathers asked their messenger to take a survey of the human condition.  At that time the human condition was not very good.  Eventually in his quest, the messenger came across a child.  After receiving approval from the Seven Grandfathers, tutored the child in the [[Midewiwin|"Good way of Life"]].  Before departing from the Seven Grandfathers, each of the Grandfathers instructed the child with a principle.

A very thorough re-formulation of a variety of ancient Anishinaabe/Midewiwin teachings on the ethics of proper behaviour and conduct.  Benton-Banai manages to incorporate many traditional teachings into his story about the Seven Grandfather Teachings.  Benton-Banai succeeds in showing how an Anishinaabe Traditional Teacher can borrow from traditional teachings and recombine and change them to make them relevant to contemporary issues faced by Anishinaabe people.

== Teachings ==

* '''''Nibwaakaawin''—Wisdom''': To cherish knowledge is to know Wisdom.  Wisdom is given by the Creator to be used for the good of the people.  In the [[Ojibwe language|Anishinaabe language]], this word expresses not only "wisdom," but also means "prudence," or "intelligence."  In some communities, '''''Gikendaasowin''''' is used; in addition to "wisdom," this word can also mean "intelligence" or "knowledge."
* '''''Zaagi'idiwin''—Love''': To know peace is to know Love.  Love must be unconditional. When people are weak they need love the most.  In the Anishinaabe language, this word with the reciprocal theme /idi/ indicates that this form of love is mutual.  In some communities, '''''Gizhaawenidiwin''''' is used, which in most context means "jealousy" but in this context is translated as either "love" or "zeal".  Again, the reciprocal theme /idi/ indicates that this form of love is mutual.
* '''''Minaadendamowin''—Respect''': To honor all creation is to have Respect. All of creation should be treated with respect. You must give respect if you wish to be respected.  Some communities instead use '''''Ozhibwaadenindiwin''''' or '''''Manazoonidiwin'''''.
* '''''Aakode'ewin''—Bravery''': Bravery is to face the foe with integrity. In the Anishinaabe language, this word literally means "state of having a fearless heart."  To do what is right even when the consequences are unpleasant.  Some communities instead use either '''''Zoongadikiwin''''' ("state of having a strong casing")  or '''''Zoongide'ewin''''' ("state of having a strong heart").
* '''''Gwayakwaadiziwin''—Honesty''': Honesty in facing a situation is to be brave. Always be honest in word and action. Be honest first with yourself, and you will more easily be able to be honest with others. In the Anishinaabe language, this word can also mean "righteousness."
* '''''Dabaadendiziwin''—Humility''': Humility is to know yourself as a sacred part of Creation.  In the Anishinaabe language, this word can also mean "compassion." You are equal to others, but you are not better. Some communities instead express this with ''''' Bekaadiziwin''''', which in addition to "humility" can also be translated as "calmness," "meekness," "gentility" or "patience."
* '''''Debwewin''—Truth''': Truth is to know all of these things. Speak the truth. Do not deceive yourself or others.

A '''tithe''' ({{IPAc-en|t|aɪ|ð}}; from [[Old English language|Old English]]: ''teogoþa'' "tenth") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory [[tax]] to government.&lt;ref name=burg&gt;{{cite book |title=A World History of Tax Rebellions |author=David F. Burg |year=2004 |pages=viii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T91k6HAODzAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9780203500897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in [[money|cash]], [[cheque]]s, or [[stock]]s, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products. Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes.

Traditional [[Jewish law]] and practice has included various forms of tithing since ancient times. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] commonly practice ''ma'aser kesafim'' (tithing 10% of their income to [[Charity (practice)|charity]]). In modern Israel, Jews continue to follow the laws of agricultural tithing, e.g., ''[[ma'aser rishon]]'', ''[[Terumat Ma'aser|terumat ma'aser]]'', and ''[[ma'aser sheni]]''. 

With respect to [[Christianity]], [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] taught the Jews that "tithing must be done in conjunction with a deep concern for justice, mercy and faithfulness" (Matthew 23:23).&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt; Tithing was taught at early Christian [[ecumenical council]]s, including the [[Council of Tours]] in 567, as well as the [[Synod of Mâcon]] in 585, and remains an important doctrine in many [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Congregationalist Church]]es, [[Methodist Church]]es and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].&lt;ref name="SmithEmerson2008"/&gt;

==Ancient Near East==
None of the extant extrabiblical laws of the [[Ancient Near East]] deal with tithing, although other secondary documents show that it was a widespread practice in the Ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Baker, ''Tight fists or open hands?: wealth and poverty in Old Testament law'' (2009) p. 239. "This was provided by means of a tithe of agricultural produce. a. Tithes in the Ancient Near East None of the extant laws deal with tithing, though other documents show that it was a widespread practice in the ancient Near East."&lt;/ref&gt; [[William W. Hallo]] (1996&lt;ref&gt;WW Hallo, Origins: The Ancient Near Eastern Background of Some Modern Western Institutions (Studies in the History and Culture of the Ancient Near East VI; Leiden/New York/Köln)&lt;/ref&gt;) recognises comparisons for Israel with its ancient Near Eastern environment, however, as regards tithes, comparisons with other ancient Near Eastern evidence is ambiguous,&lt;ref&gt;Menahem Herman ''Tithe as gift: the institution in the Pentateuch and in light of ...'' 1992 p. 127 "Hallo recognizes comparisons for Israel with its ancient Near Eastern environment. However, in the instance of the tithe, comparisons with other ancient Near Eastern evidence has already been shown to be ambiguous, given the lack of ..."&lt;/ref&gt; and Ancient Near Eastern literature provides scant evidence for the practice of tithing and the collection of tithes.&lt;ref&gt;Bertil Albrektson, ''Remembering all the way: a collection of Old Testament studies'' (1981) p. 116. "The Tithes in the Old Testament." H. Jagersma Brussels I. Introduction "In the Old Testament as well as in other Ancient Near Eastern literature, we find only scant evidence for the practice of tithing and the collection of tithes."&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{bibleref2 |Genesis |14:18–20}}, [[Abraham]], after rescuing [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]], met with [[Melchizedek]]. After Melchizedek's blessing, Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he has obtained from battle:
{{quote|"Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.”|Genesis 14:18–20}}

In {{bibleref2|Genesis|28:12–22}}, [[Jacob]], after his [[Vision (spirituality)|visionary]] [[Dream#In Abrahamic religions|dream]] of [[Jacob's Ladder]] and receiving a blessing from God, promises God a tenth:
{{quote|"Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it.” And he was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.”

So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, so that I come again to my father's house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God, and this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that you give me I will give a full tenth to you.”|Genesis 28:12–22}}

[[File:Monier22.JPG|thumb|''Tithing in the Temple'' by [[Pierre Monier]]]]
The tithe is specifically mentioned in the Books of [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]. The tithe system was organized in a three-year cycle, corresponding to the ''[[Shemittah]]''-cycle. These tithes were in reality more like taxes for the people of Israel and were mandatory, not optional giving. This tithe was distributed locally "within thy gates" ({{sourcetext|source=Bible (King James)|book=Deuteronomy|chapter=14|verse=28}}) to support the Levites and assist the poor.

Every year, ''[[First Fruits|Bikkurim]]'', ''[[Terumah]]'', ''Ma'aser Rishon'' and ''Terumat Ma'aser'' were separated from the grain, wine and oil ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:22 |JP}}). (As regards other fruit and produce, the Biblical requirement to tithe is a source of debate.) The ''first tithe'' is giving of one tenth of agricultural produce (after the giving of the standard ''[[terumah]]'') to the [[Levite]] (or Aaronic [[Kohen|priests]]). Historically, during the [[First Temple]] period, the first tithe was given to the [[Levite]]s.  Approximately at the beginning of the [[Second Temple]] construction, [[Ezra]] and his [[Beth din]] implemented its giving to the kohanim.&lt;ref&gt;The Talmud [[Adin Steinsaltz]] 1992 "Yet if a priest has first tithe in his possession, he need not give it to a Levite. Ezra penalized the Levites of his generation because they did not return to Eretz Israel with him, and he decreed that first tithe should be given to ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Restoration: Old Testament, Jewish, and Christian perspectives '' p. 329 James M. Scott. 2001 "One says that the Levites were punished because they did not come up to the Land of Israel during Ezra's days. The other says that the first tithe was given to the priests, so that they would have food when they were in a state of ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other offerings which were restricted to consumption within the [[tabernacle]], the ''[[second tithe]]'' could be consumed anywhere . On years one, two, four and five of the ''Shemittah''-cycle, God commanded the [[Children of Israel]] to take a second tithe that was to be brought to the place of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:23 |JP}}). The owner of the produce was to separate and bring 1/10 of his finished produce to the [[Old City of Jerusalem]] after separating ''Terumah'' and the [[first tithe]], but if the family lived too far from Jerusalem, the tithe could be redeemed upon coins ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:24–25 |JP}}). Then, the Bible required the owner of the redeemed coins to spend the tithe "to buy whatever you like: cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish" ({{bibleverse| |Deuteronomy |14:26 |JP}}). Implicit in the commandment was an obligation to spend the coins on items meant for human consumption.

In years three and six of the ''Shemittah''-cycle the Israelites set aside the (second) tithe instead as the ''[[poor tithe]]'', and it was given to the strangers, orphans, and widows.

The Levites, also known as the Tribe of Levi, were descendants of [[Levi]]. They were assistants to the Aaronic [[Kohen|priests]] (who were the children of [[Aaron]] and, therefore, a subset of the Tribe of Levi) and did not own or inherit a territorial [[Property|patrimony]] ({{sourcetext |source=Bible (King James) |book=Numbers |chapter=18 |verse=21 |range=-28}}). Their function in society was that of temple functionaries, teachers and trusted civil servants who supervised the weights and scales and witnessed agreements. The goods donated from the other Israeli tribes were their source of sustenance. They received from "all Israel" a tithe of food or livestock for support, and in turn would set aside a tenth portion of that tithe (known as the ''[[Terumat hamaaser]]'') for the Aaronic priests.

An additional tithe mentioned in the Book of Leviticus ({{bibleverse-nb||Lv|27:32–33|JP}}) is the [[cattle tithe]], which is to be sacrificed as a ''[[korban]]'' at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

===United Kingdom of Israel===
{{further|Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)}}
[[LMLK seal]]s may represent the oldest archaeological evidence of tithing. About 10 percent of the storage jars manufactured during [[Hezekiah]]'s reign (circa 700 BC) were stamped (Grena, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;376–78). See [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 29–31 for a record of this early worship reformation.

The [[Book of Nehemiah]] also talks about the collection of tithes to Leviim and distribution of Terumah to the priests: {{bibleverse||Nehemiah|13:5|JP}}. People were actually appointed to collect mandatory tithes and place them in specially designated chambers which eventually came to be known as storehouses: {{sourcetext |source=Bible (King James) |book=Nehemiah |chapter=12 |verse=44}}.

===Minor Prophets===
{{further|Minor Prophets}}
The [[Book of Malachi]] has one of the most quoted Biblical passages about tithing, directed to the sons of Jacob:

{{quote|For I, Jehovah, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed. From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return? "Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In your tithes and contributions. You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need. I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the Lord of hosts. Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts."|{{bibleref2 |Malachi |3:6–12}}}}

==Deuterocanonical==
{{further|Deuterocanonical books|Biblical apocrypha}}
The [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Tobit]] provides an example of all three classes of tithes practiced during the [[Babylonian captivity]]:
{{quote|"I would often go by myself to Jerusalem on religious holidays, as the Law commanded for every Israelite for all time. I would hurry off to Jerusalem and take with me the early produce of my crops, a tenth of my flocks, and the first portion of the wool cut from my sheep. I would present these things at the altar to the priests, the descendants of Aaron. I would give the first tenth of my grain, wine, olive oil, pomegranates, figs, and other fruit to the Levites who served in Jerusalem. For six out of seven years, I also brought the cash equivalent of the second tenth of these crops to Jerusalem where I would spend it every year. I gave this to orphans and widows, and to Gentiles who had joined Israel. In the third year, when I brought and gave it to them, we would eat together according to the instruction recorded in Moses’ Law, as Deborah my grandmother had taught me..."|{{bibleref2 |Tobit |1:6-8 |CEB}}}}

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Tithes in Judaism}}
Orthodox Jews continue to follow the laws of [[Heave offering|''Terumah'']] and [[First tithe|''Ma'aser'']] as well as the custom of tithing 10% of one's earnings to charity (''ma'aser kesafim''). Due to doubts concerning the status of persons claiming to be Kohanim or Levi'im arising after severe Roman/Christian persecutions and exile, the Hebrew Bible tithe of 10% for the Levites, and "tithe of the tithe" ({{bibleverse| |Numbers |18:26 |JP}}) of 10% of 10% (1%) for the priests are dealt with in accordance with Jewish Law.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} The [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] contain analysis of the [[Maaser Rishon|first tithe]], [[Maaser Sheni|second tithe]] and [[Maaser Ani|poor tithe]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |noicon=1|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10232-ma-aserot |title=MA'ASEROT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether through community of goods or other forms of financial sharing, mutual aid continues the practice of Israel in giving special care to widows, orphans, aliens, and others in economic need (Deut. 24:17-22).

{{Main article|Tithing (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) bases its tithing on the following additional scriptures:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/manual/primary-6-old-testament/lesson-44-malachi-teaches-about-tithes-and-offerings |contribution= Lesson 44: Malachi Teaches about Tithes and Offerings |title= Primary 6: Old Testament |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1996 |pages= 196–201 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150224044120/https://www.lds.org/manual/primary-6-old-testament/lesson-44-malachi-teaches-about-tithes-and-offerings |archivedate= 24 February 2015 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church collection of religious offerings and taxes===
====England and Wales====
The right to receive tithes was granted to the English churches by [[Ethelwulf of Wessex|King Ethelwulf]] in 855. The [[Saladin tithe]] was a royal tax, but assessed using ecclesiastical boundaries, in 1188. The legal validity of the tithe system was affirmed under the [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster]] of 1285. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] led to the transfer of many rights to tithe to secular landowners and [[the Crown]] – and tithes could be extinguished until 1577 under an Act of the 37th year of [[Henry VIII]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details/C3252914-details|title=Middlesex: London City without the Walls: St Botolph without Aldgate, parish |work=The National Archives Collection IR 18/5462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] criticized the system in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), arguing that a fixed rent would encourage peasants to work far more efficiently.

[[Tithe#Tithes and tithe law in England before reform|See below]] for a fuller description and history, until the reforms of the 19th century, written by [[Sir William Blackstone]] and edited by other learned lawyers of the period.

[[File:Tithes poster 1837.jpg|thumb|Public notice demanding payment due on Tithes, 1837]]
The system gradually ended with the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1836]], whose long-lasting Tithe Commission replaced them with a commutation payment, land award and/or rentcharges to those paying the commutation payment and took the opportunity to map out (apportion) residual chancel liability where the rectory had been appropriated during the medieval period by a religious house or college. Its records give a snapshot of land ownership in most parishes, the Tithe Files, are a socio-economic history resource. The rolled-up payment of several years' tithe would be divided between the tithe-owners as at the date of their extinction.&lt;ref name=na&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/tithes/ How to look for records of Tithes –  The History of Tithes] The National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

This commutation reduced problems to the ultimate payers by effectively folding tithes in with rents however, it could cause transitional money supply problems by raising the transaction demand for money. Later the decline of large landowners led [[leasehold estate|tenants]] to become [[freehold (English law)|freeholders]] and again have to pay directly; this also led to renewed objections of principle by non-[[Anglican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;One account of the objections in the 1920s and 1930s appears in the book ''The Tithe War'' by [[Doreen Wallace]] (London: Gollancz, 1934).&lt;/ref&gt; It also kept intact a system of chancel repair liability affecting the minority of parishes where the rectory had been lay-appropriated. The precise land affected in such places hinged on the content of documents such as the content of deeds of merger and apportionment maps.&lt;ref name=na/&gt;

=====Tithe redemption=====
Rent charges in lieu of abolished English tithes paid by landowners were converted by a public outlay of money under the [[Tithe Act 1936]] into [[annuity (financial contracts)|annuities]] paid to the state through the Tithe Redemption Commission. Such payments were transferred in 1960 to the Board of [[Inland Revenue]], and those remaining were terminated by the [[Finance Act 1977]].

The [[Tithe Act 1951]] established the compulsory redemption of English tithes by landowners where the annual amounts payable were less than £1 so abolishing the bureaucracy and costs of collecting small sums of money.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====France====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Commanderie Coulommiers cour grange aux dimes.jpg|thumb|[[Knights Templar]] tithe barn (''la grange aux dîmes'') with red roof, [[Coulommiers, Seine-et-Marne]], France.]]
In [[France]], the tithes – called "la dîme" – were a land tax. Originally a voluntary tax, the "dîme" became mandatory in 1585. In principle, unlike the [[taille]], the "dîme" was levied on both noble and non-noble lands. The dîme was divided into a number of types, including the "grosses dîmes" (grains, wine, hay), "menues" or "vertes dîmes" (vegetables, poultry), "dîmes de charnage" (veal, lamb, pork). Although the term "dîme" comes from the Latin ''decima [pars]'' ("one tenth", with the same origin as that of the U.S. coin, the [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]]), the "dîme" rarely reached this percentage and (on the whole) it was closer to 1/13th of the agricultural production.

The "dîme" was originally meant to support the local parish, but by the 16th century many "dîmes" went directly to distant abbeys, monasteries, and bishops, leaving the local parish impoverished, and this contributed to general resentment. In the Middle Ages, some monasteries also offered the "dîme" in homage to local lords in exchange for their protection (see [[Feudalism]]) (these are called "dîmes inféodées"), but this practice was forbidden by the Lateran Council of 1179.

All religious taxes were constitutionally abolished in 1790, in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].

====Greece====
There has never been a separate church tax or mandatory tithe on Greek citizens. The state pays the salaries of the clergy of the established [[Church of Greece]], in return for use of real estate, mainly forestry, owned by the church. The remainder of church income comes from voluntary, tax-deductible donations from the faithful. These are handled by each [[diocese]] independently.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Ireland====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
From the [[English Reformation]] in the 16th century, most Irish people chose to remain [[Roman Catholic]] and had by now to pay tithes valued at about 10 per cent of an area's agricultural produce, to maintain and fund the established state church, the [[Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]], to which only a small minority of the population converted. [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Irish Presbyterians]] and other minorities like the [[Quaker]]s and [[Jew]]s were in the same situation.

The collection of tithes was resisted in the period 1831–36, known as the [[Tithe War]]. Thereafter, tithes were reduced and added to rents with the passing of the [[Tithe Commutation Act 1838|Tithe Commutation Act]] in 1836. With the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland by the [[Irish Church Act 1869]], tithes were abolished.

====United States====
While the federal government has never collected a church tax or mandatory tithe on its citizens, states &lt;!---such as Massachusetts, specifically--&gt; collected a tithe into the early 19th century. The United States and its governmental subdivisions also exempt most churches from payment of income tax (under Section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] and similar state statutes, which also allows donors to claim the donations as an income tax [[itemized deduction]]). Also, churches may be permitted exemption from other state and local taxes such as sales and property taxes, either in whole or in part. Clergy, such as ministers and members of religious orders (who have taken a vow of poverty) may be exempt from federal self-employment tax on income from ministerial services. Income from non-ministerial services are taxable and churches are required to withhold Federal and state income tax from this non-exempt income. They are also required to withhold employee's share of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] taxes under [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]], and pay the employer's share for the non-exempt income.&lt;ref name="IRS517"&gt;

====Spain and Latin America====

[[File:Casa reina mora.jpg|thumb|Casa de los Diezmos, [[Canillas de Aceituno]], Málaga, Spain]]
{{Main article|Diezmo}}
Both the tithe (''diezmo''), a levy of 10 per cent on all agricultural production, and "first fruits" (''primicias''), an additional harvest levy, were collected in [[Spain]] throughout the medieval and early modern periods for the support of local [[Catholic]] parishes.

The tithe crossed the Atlantic with the [[Spanish Empire]]; however, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] who made up the vast majority of the population in colonial [[Spanish America]] were exempted from paying tithes on native crops such as corn and potatoes that they raised for their own subsistence. After some debate, Indians in colonial Spanish America were forced to pay tithes on their production of European agricultural products, including wheat, silk, cows, pigs, and sheep.

The tithe was abolished in several [[Latin America]]n countries, including [[Mexico]], soon after independence from Spain (which started in 1810). The tithe was abolished in Spain itself in 1841, and in Argentina in 1826.

{{Main|Church tax}}
====Austria====
In [[Austria]] a colloquially called [[church tax]] (''Kirchensteuer'', officially called ''Kirchenbeitrag'', i. e. ''church contribution'') has to be paid by members of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant Church]]{{which|date=January 2017}}. It is levied by the churches themselves and not by the government. The obligation to pay church tax can just be evaded by an official declaration to cease church membership. The tax is calculated on the basis of personal income. It amounts to about 1.1 per cent (Catholic church) and 1.5 per cent (Protestant church).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Denmark====
All members of the [[Church of Denmark]] pay a church tax, which varies between municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/My_Constitutional_Act_with_explanations/Chapter%207.aspx|title=Chapter 7 - The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Denmark |last= |first= |date=2013-08-23 |website=Folketinget |access-date=2017-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331120111/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/My_Constitutional_Act_with_explanations/Chapter%207.aspx|archive-date=31 March 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax is generally around 1% of the taxable income.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Finland====
Members of [[Religion in Finland|state churches]] pay a church tax of between 1% and 2% of income, depending on the municipality. In addition, 2.55 per cent of corporate taxes are distributed to the state churches. Church taxes are integrated into the common national taxation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evl.fi/EVLfi.nsf/0/F4798384ACD179A1C22572E5003ACBF9?OpenDocument |title=Verot ja muut tulot |work=EVL.fi |publisher=Suomen evankelisluterilainen kirkko |language=Finnish |accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
[[Germany]] levies a [[church tax]], on all persons declaring themselves to be Christians, of roughly 8–9% of their income tax, which is effectively (very much depending on the social and financial situation) typically between 0.2% and 1.5% of the total income. The proceeds are shared among Catholic, Lutheran, and other Protestant Churches.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

The church tax ([[Kirchensteuer]]) actually traces its roots back as far as the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]] of 1803. It was reaffirmed in the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat of 1933]] between Nazi Germany and the Catholic Church. Today its legal basis is article 140 of the [[Grundgesetz]] (the German "constitution") in connection with article 137 of the [[Weimar constitution]]. These laws originally merely allowed the churches themselves to tax their members, but in Nazi Germany, collection of church taxes was transferred to the German government. As a result, both the German government and the employer are notified of the religious affiliation of every taxpayer. This system is still in effect today. Mandatory disclosure of religious affiliation to government agencies or employers constituted a violation of the original European data protection directives but is now permitted after the German government obtained an exemption.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Church tax (Kirchensteuer) is compulsory in Germany for those confessing members of a particular religious group. It is deducted at the [[PAYE]] level. The duty to pay this tax theoretically starts on the day one is christened. Anyone who wants to stop paying it has to declare in writing, at their local court of law (Amtsgericht) or registry office, that they are leaving the Church. They are then crossed off the Church registers and can no longer receive the sacraments, confession and certain services; a Roman Catholic church may deny such a person a burial plot.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article3544885.ece |newspaper=The Times |title=Excommunication for German Catholics who refuse church tax |date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the government, the taxpayer also must notify his employer of his religious affiliation (or lack thereof) in order to ensure proper tax withholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19699581 |title=BBC News ''German Catholics lose church rights for unpaid tax'' 2012-09-24 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This opt-out is also used by members of "free churches" (e.g. Baptists) (non-affiliated to the scheme) to stop paying the church tax, from which the free churches do not benefit, in order to support their own church directly.

====Italy====
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Originally the Italian government of [[Benito Mussolini]], under the [[Lateran treaties]] of 1929 with the [[Holy See]], paid a monthly [[salary]] to [[Catholic]] clergymen. This salary was called the ''congrua''. The eight per thousand law was created as a result of an agreement, in 1984, between the Italian Republic and the [[Holy See]].

Under this law Italian taxpayers are able to vote how to partition the 0.8% ('eight per thousand') of the total income [[tax]] [[IRPEF]] levied by Italy among some specific [[religious]] [[Confession (religion)|confessions]] or, alternatively, to a [[Welfare (financial aid)|social assistance]] program run by the Italian State. This declaration is made on the [[IRPEF]] form. This vote is not compulsory; the whole amount levied by the [[IRPEF]] [[tax]] is distributed in proportion to explicit declarations.

The last official statement of Italian Ministry of Finance made in respect of the year 2000 singles out seven beneficiaries: the Italian State, the [[Roman Catholic Church in Italy|Catholic Church]], the [[Waldenses]], the [[Italian Jews|Jewish Communities]], the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[Assemblies of God in Italy]].

The tax was divided up as follows:
*87.17% Catholic Church
*10.35% Italian State
*1.21% Waldenses
*0.46% Jewish Communities
*0.32% Lutherans
*0.28% Adventists of the Seventh Day
*0.21% Assemblies of God in Italy

In 2000, the [[Catholic Church]] raised almost a billion [[euro]]s, while the Italian State received about €100 million euros.

====Scotland====
{{main|Teind}}
In Scotland ''teinds'' were the tenths of certain produce of the land appropriated to the maintenance of the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] provided that a third of the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed [[Church of Scotland]]. In 1925 the system was recast by statute&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt; and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The [[Court of Session]] acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]].

====Sweden====
Until the year 2000, Sweden had a mandatory [[church tax]], to be paid if one did belong to the [[Church of Sweden]], which had been funneling about $500 million annually to the church. Because of change in legislation, the tax was withdrawn in the year 2000. However, the Swedish government has agreed to continue collecting from individual taxpayers the annual payment that has always gone to the church. But now the tax will be an optional checkoff box on the tax return. The government will allocate the money collected to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish and other faiths as well as the Lutherans, with each taxpayer directing where his or her taxes should go.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Switzerland====
There is no official state church in [[Switzerland]]; however, all the 26 cantons (states) financially support at least one of the three traditional denominations — [[Roman Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], or [[Protestant]] — with funds collected through taxation. Each canton has its own regulations regarding the relationship between church and state. In some cantons, the church tax (up to 2.3 per cent) is voluntary but in others an individual who chooses not to contribute to church tax may formally have to leave the church. In some cantons private companies are unable to avoid payment of the church tax.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Tithes and tithe law in England before reform===
Excerpts from [[Sir William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'':

====Definition and classification and those liable to pay tithes====
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . tithes; which are defined to be the tenth part of the increase, yearly arising and renewing from the profits of lands, the stock upon lands, and the personal industry of the inhabitants:
:the first species being usually called ''predial,''&lt;ref&gt;from praedium, a farm&lt;/ref&gt; as of corn, grass, hops, and wood;
:the second ''mixed'', as of wool, milk, pigs, &amp;c, consisting of natural products, but nurtured and preserved in part by the care of man; and of these the tenth must be paid in gross:
:the third ''personal'', as of manual occupations, trades, fisheries, and the like ; and of these only the tenth part of the clear gains and profits is due.
...
in general, tithes are to be paid for every thing that yields an annual increase, as corn, hay, fruit, cattle, poultry, and the like; but not for any thing that is of the substance of the earth, or is not of annual increase, as stone, lime, chalk, and the like; nor for creatures that are of a wild nature, or ''ferae naturae'', as deer, hawks, &amp;c, whose increase, so as to profit the owner, is not annual, but casual.&lt;ref name = 'BlackstoneII'&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackstone |first=William |title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] vol II |date=1766 |place=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====History====
&lt;blockquote&gt;We cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first introduced into this country.  Possibly they were contemporary with the planting of Christianity among the Saxons, by Augustin the monk, about the end of the fifth century.  But the first mention of them, which I have met with in any written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held A.D. 786, wherein the payment of tithes in general is strongly enjoined. This canon, or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their parliamentary conventions of estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the bishops, dukes, senators, and people. Which was a few years later than the time that Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous division of them into four parts ; one to maintain the edifice of the church, the second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial clergy.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Beneficiaries====
&lt;blockquote&gt;And upon their first introduction (as hath formerly been observed), though every man was obliged to pay tithes in general, yet he might give them to what priests he pleased; which were called ''arbitrary'' consecrations of tithes: or he might pay them into the hands of the bishop, who distributed among his diocesan clergy the revenues of the church, which were then in common. But, when dioceses were divided into parishes, the tithes of each parish were allotted to its own particular minister; first by common consent, or the appointment of lords of manors, and afterwards by the written law of the land.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|26}}

...It is now universally held, that tithes are due, of common right, to the [[parson]] of the [[parish]], unless there be a special exemption. This parson of the parish, we have formerly seen, may be either the actual [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]], or else the [[wikt:appropriator|appropriator]] of the [[Benefice#Church of England|benefice]]: appropriations being a method of endowing monasteries, which seems to have been devised by the regular clergy, by way of substitution to arbitrary consecrations of tithes.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Exemptions====
&lt;blockquote&gt;We observed that tithes are due to the parson of common right, unless by special exemption: let us therefore see, thirdly, who may be exempted from the payment of tithes ... either in part or totally, first, by a real composition; or secondly, by custom or prescription.

First, a real composition is when an agreement is made between the owner of the lands, and the parson or vicar, with the consent of the ordinary and the patron, that such lands shall for the future be discharged from payment of tithes, by reason of some land or other real recompence given to the parson, in lieu and satisfaction thereof.

Secondly, a discharge by custom or prescription, is where time out of mind such persons or such lands have been, either partially or totally, discharged from the payment of tithes. And this immemorial usage is binding upon all parties, as it is in its nature an evidence of universal consent and acquiescence; and with reason supposes a real composition to have been formerly made. This custom or prescription is either ''de modo decimandi'', or ''de non decimando''.

A ''modus decimandi'', commonly called by the simple name of a ''modus'' only, is where there is by custom a particular manner of tithing allowed, different from the general law of taking tithes in kind, which are the actual tenth part of the annual increase. This is sometimes a pecuniary compensation, as twopence an acre for the tithe of land : sometimes it is a compensation in work and labour, as that the parson shall have only the twelfth cock of hay, and not the tenth, in consideration of the owner's making it for him: sometimes, in lieu of a large quantity of crude or imperfect tithe, the parson shall have a less quantity, when arrived to greater maturity, as a couple of fowls in lieu of tithe eggs ; and the like. Any means, in short, whereby the general law of tithing is altered, and a new method of taking them is introduced, is called a ''modus decimandi'', or special manner of tithing.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

A prescription ''de non decimando'' is a claim to be entirely discharged of tithes, and to pay no compensation in lieu of them.  Thus the king by his prerogative is discharged from all tithes. So a vicar shall pay no tithes to the rector, nor the rector to the vicar, for ''ecclesia decimas non folvit ecclesiae''. But these ''personal'' to both the king and the clergy ; for their tenant or lessee shall pay tithes of the same land, though in their own occupation it is not tithable.  And, generally speaking, it is an established rule, that in ''lay'' hands, ''modus de non decimando non valet''. But spiritual persons or corporations, as monasteries, abbots, bishops, and the like, were always capable of having their lands totally discharged of tithes, by various ways: as
#By real composition :
#By the pope's [[Papal bull|bull]] of exemption :
#By unity of possession ; as when the rectory of a parish, and lands in the same parish, both belonged to a religious house, those lands were discharged of tithes by this unity of possession :
#By prescription ; having never been liable to tithes, by being always in spiritual hands :
#By virtue of their order; as the [[Knights Templars|knights templars]], [[cistercians]], and others, whose lands were privileged by the pope with a discharge of tithes. Though, upon the dissolution of abbeys by [[Henry VIII]], most of these exemptions from tithes would have fallen with them, and the lands become tithable again; had they not been supported and upheld by the statute 31 Hen. VIII. c. 13. which enacts, that all persons who should come to the possession of the lands of any abbey then dissolved, should hold them free and discharged of tithes, in as large and ample a manner as the abbeys themselves formerly held them. And from this original have sprung all the lands, which, being in lay hands, do at present claim to be tithe-free: for, if a man can shew his lands to have been such abbey lands, and also immemorially discharged of tithes by any of the means before-mentioned, this is now a good prescription ''de non decimando''. But he must shew both these requisites ; for abbey lands, without a special ground of discharge, are not discharged of course ; neither will any prescription ''de non decimando'' avail in total discharge of tithes, unless it relates to such abbeylands.&lt;ref name = "BlackstoneII" /&gt;{{rp|31–32}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Islam==
{{main article|Zakāt}}
[[Zakāt]] ({{lang-ar|زكاة}} {{IPA-ar|zækæːh|}}) or "alms giving", one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], is the giving of a small percentage of one's assets to [[charity (practice)|charity]]. It serves principally as the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] contribution to poor and deprived Muslims, although others may have a rightful share. It is the duty of an Islamic state not just to collect zakat but to distribute it fairly as well.

Zakat is payable on three kinds of assets: wealth, production, and animals. The more well-known zakat on wealth is 2.5 per cent of accumulated wealth, beyond one's personal needs. Production (agricultural, industrial, renting, etc.), is subject to a 10 per cent or 5 per cent zakat (also known as Ushur (عُشر), or "one-tenth"), using the rule that if both labor and capital are involved, 5% rate is applied, if only one of the two are used for production, then the rate is 10 per cent. For any earnings, that require neither labor nor capital, like finding underground treasure, the rate is 20 per cent. The rules for zakat on animal holdings are specified by the type of animal group and tend to be fairly detailed.&lt;ref name=ghamidi&gt;The book ''Meezan'', by Javed Ahmed Ghamidi, published by Al-Mawrid, 2002, Lahore, Pakistan&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims fulfill this religious obligation by giving a fixed percentage of their surplus wealth. Zakat has been paired with such a high sense of righteousness that it is often placed on the same level of importance as performing the five-daily repetitive ritualised prayer ([[salat]]).&lt;ref name=zysow&gt;{{citation |last= Zysow |first= A. Zakāt |title= Encyclopaedia of Islam |edition= Second |editor1= P. Bearman |editor2= Th. Bianquis |editor3= C.E. Bosworth |editor4= E. van Donzel |editor5= W.P. Heinrichs |publisher= Brill |year= 2009}}.{{page needed|date=October 2014}} Available from [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-1377 Brill Online] (subscription).&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims see this process also as a way of purifying themselves from their greed and selfishness and also safeguarding future business.&lt;ref name=zysow/&gt; In addition, Zakat purifies the person who receives it because it saves him from the humiliation of begging and prevents him from envying the rich.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Neal. Islam; A Concise Introduction. Richmond; Curzon Press. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Because it holds such a high level of importance the "punishment" for not paying when able is very severe. In the 2nd edition of the ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' it states, "...the prayers of those who do not pay zakat will not be accepted".&lt;ref name=zysow/&gt; This is because without Zakat a tremendous hardship is placed on the poor which otherwise would not be there. Besides the fear of their prayers not getting heard, those who are able should be practicing this third pillar of Islam because the Quran states that this is what believers should do.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 2 verse 155, "be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss on goods, lives, and fruits. But give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere."&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Muslims (able-bodied adult males of military age) living in an Islamic state are required to pay [[Jizya]], this exempts them from military service and they do not pay Zakat.

Typically "The Not" was a piece of wood, a ruler or a stick, often inscribed with the letters "WN". This was given to the first pupil to be heard speaking Welsh. When another child was heard using Welsh, "The Not" was taken from its current holder and given to the latest offender. Whoever was in possession of "The Not" was encouraged to pass it on to any of their Welsh-speaking classmates by informing the teacher that they had caught someone else speaking Welsh. The pupil in possession at the end of the day was subjected to a [[flogging]] or other punishment (some reports suggest the punishment was administered at the end of the week, or at the end of each lesson).&lt;ref name="BBC not"/&gt;

===Effects===
The effect of "The Not" was to stigmatise the use of the Welsh language among children, and engender the idea that [[English language|English]], as the preferable [[medium of instruction]], was the language of moral progress and opportunity.

Although this was never official government policy, the practice and wider social changes of the nineteenth century saw many Welsh speakers come to view the speaking of Welsh as a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="BBC not"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/language_education.shtml|title=Welsh and 19th century education|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
The use of "The Not" was recorded as early as the 18th century, and there is strong evidence of numerous incidents in both Anglican and Nonconformist schools throughout [[Carmarthen]], [[Ceredigion]] and [[Meirionnydd]], it was commonly known as the 'cwstom', the 'Welsh stick' or the 'Welsh lead' (if a lump of [[lead]] was used).&lt;ref&gt;The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales.

===Widespread Use and Cultural Impact===

''"Among other injurious effects, this custom has been found to lead children to visit stealthily the houses of their school-fellows for the purpose of detecting those who speak Welsh to their parents, and transferring to them the punishment due to themselves."''

The most frequent use of the Welsh Not in schools appears to be in the first decades following the publication of the government's [[Treachery of the Blue Books|Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales]] in 1847.

The reports noted that schools in Wales were inadequate, with English monoglot teachers and English textbooks in use in areas where the children spoke only Welsh. It concluded that the Welsh as a race were "ignorant", "lazy" and "immoral", and that one of the main causes of this was the continuing use of the "evil" Welsh language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Education in Wales. |date=1847 |location=London |url=https://archive.org/details/reportsofcommiss00greaiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reports had great influence in Wales, becoming known as ''Brad y Llyfrau Gleision'' (the Treachery of the Blue Books) among Welsh speakers, and supporting the removal of Welsh as a moral endeavour. In linking the Welsh language with low educational standards and poor morality, the report also highlighted the effective use of the "Welsh Not" and, while it did not officially endorse it's use, it popularised the method as an effective tool for educators throughout Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/SEW00004b/frames?part=body&amp;div=19&amp;locale=en&amp;mode=reference|title=Reports of the commissioners of enquiry into the state of education in Wales|chapter=Part 3: North Wales, comprising Anglesey, Carnarvon, Denbigh, Flint, Meirioneth and Montgomery - Report|page=19|author=|year=1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Use===
{{quote box|

''"The speaking of Welsh in school was strictly forbidden; any boy or girl guilty of the offence was given the Welsh Not, which he or she handed on to the next offender, the unfortunate one who held the Welsh Not at the end of the school session becoming the scapegoat who bore the punishment for the sins of all. Mother, being a lively child, was in frequent possession of the Welsh Not, but was never allowed to pay the penalty; a chivalrous boy cousin always asked for it in Welsh and took the punishment himself."''

The use of the "Welsh Not" appears to have decreased with the introduction of [[compulsory education]] in the later decades of the 19th century. After the [[School board (England &amp; Wales)|school boards]] were absorbed by the [[county councils]] following the [[Local Government Act 1888]], instruction in Welsh became the norm in [[primary schools]] in Welsh-speaking areas. However, incidents of the "Welsh Not" were still reported.&lt;ref&gt;John Davies, ''A History of Wales'', Penguin, 1994, {{ISBN|0-14-014581-8}}, p 455&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Morgan Edwards]] describes his experience of the Welsh Not in school in [[Llanuwchllyn]] in his book ''Clych Atgof''.

[[Susan Jones]], [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]], claimed in 2010 that the use of the Welsh Not, including [[caning]] as the punishment, persisted in some schools in her constituency until "as recently as the 1930s and 1940s".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/comment/newsid_8734000/8734105.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=A bevy of maidens|date=29 June 2010|last=Lowther|first=Ed|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman in a village in [[Wrexham Maelor]] stated that the Welsh Not was in use in her school in the 1940s. In 2018 Gwyn James, then living in another Wrexham Maelor village, and a monoglot Welsh speaker as a child, was reported to have had the board placed around his neck in school in the 1930s for not using English in the classroom.
