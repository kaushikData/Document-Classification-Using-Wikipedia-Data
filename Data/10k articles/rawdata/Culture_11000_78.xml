'''Ambush Bug''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] who has appeared in several [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. His real name is supposedly '''Irwin Schwab''', but he has mental problems that prevent him from truly understanding reality around him, so even his true identity might be no more than a delusion on his part. His origin is disputed, although the most commonly accepted origin is that Brum-El (a historical allusion to [[Beau Brummel]], as well as a reference to [[Superman]]'s father [[Jor-El]]) of the planet Schwab sent his clothes from his supposedly doomed planet, hoping that his wardrobe would survive, only to have it intercepted by a [[Spider-Man|giant radioactive space spider]]. In the resulting crash, only two articles of clothing survived: the Ambush Bug suit, which was subsequently found by Irwin Schwab; and "Argh!Yle!", an argyle sock with a [[Doctor Doom]]-like complex, complete with metal mask.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | contribution=Ambush Bug | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=13 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Created by artist [[Keith Giffen]] as an intentionally silly character, Ambush Bug first appeared in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #52 (Dec. 1982)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 199 |quote = [Ambush Bug] made his debut in the pages of ''DC Comics Presents'' #52...[by] writer Paul Kupperberg and artist Keith Giffen.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would make appearances in several other [[Superman]]-related comic books in the early 1980s. [[Paul Kupperberg]], who wrote Ambush Bug's first story, recalled, "as Keith was in the office, he sat in on the plotting and offered up Ambush Bug as an antagonist. The Bug is entirely Keith's creation ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Browning|first=Michael |title=The Doom Patrol Interviews: Paul Kupperberg|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65 |page=43 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giffen has stated that both Ambush Bug and [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] were derived from [[Lunatik]], a character he created in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeAngelo|first=Daniel |date=July 2013|title=The Not-Ready-For-Super-Team Players: A History of the Defenders|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|page=10 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to positive reader reaction to the character's first appearance, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] directed Giffen to create another Ambush Bug story for ''DC Comics Presents'' #59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callahan|first=Timothy |title=The Substitute Heroes in the Spotlight |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65|page=70 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Ambush Bug was a villain, named after a type of insect, and dressed in a green, skintight suit (with two orange antennae) that cover his whole body. Inside his hollow antennae, he carries miniature robot bugs that possess the ability to teleport him around. After attacking Superman and other heroes, Ambush Bug decides instead to be a [[superhero]] as well. He also fancies himself Superman's friend, which only annoys the hero even more than his early villainy. The costume then becomes permanently affixed to his body, and he gains the power to teleport by himself. While trying to fix one of the miniature bugs, it explodes, causing a chain reaction and a blast that destroys all of the bugs and tints Ambush Bug's costume temporarily black; he then becomes capable of teleporting even without the bugs (briefly considering changing his moniker to Black Beetle instead).

Ambush Bug became popular enough to be featured in two comic book miniseries and several specials, plotted and pencilled by Keith Giffen and scripted by [[Robert Loren Fleming]]. The series contains many comic book-enthusiast and DC in-jokes and satire; series editor Julius Schwartz is also a character in the book.

During his own 4-part series in 1985, he picks up a doll and, thinking it is alive, "adopted" it as a partner called "Cheeks, The Toy Wonder", complete with its own costume.

In 2001, he made his first appearance as part of a superhero group (albeit a small one), the "Justice League of Anarchy", which also included [[Plastic Man]], the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], [[Harley Quinn]], [['Mazing Man]], and the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]. This group of DC Universe troublemakers made a one-panel cameo in a series exploring variations on the [[Justice League|JLA]] acronym, ''JLA: Justice League of Amazons''.

Ambush Bug is largely considered an absurd character and is rarely used by other writers, though he still exists in the DC Universe and occasionally still appears in some DC Comics. His popularity amongst creators has led to many "cameos", sometimes with as little as his antennae being visible. In 2006, he appeared as part of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'s short-lived [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #24. His powers appeared in proxy in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' #32. [[Jimmy Olsen]] briefly gains the appearance of Ambush Bug and subconsciously uses his power of "Dumb [[Luck]]" to locate [[Forager (comics)|Forager]].

After being championed by DC Coordinating Editor [[Jann Jones]], a new six-issue Ambush Bug miniseries, ''[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]'', debuted in 2008, plotted and pencilled by Giffen, and written by Fleming, with Jones herself serving as editor. The final issue was published almost a year after the rest of the series. [[Dan DiDio]] claims to have lost issue #6 and instead they skipped it to finish off with issue #7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091102-Didio-10-Questions.html | title=10 Answers and One Question with DC's Dan DiDio | last=Rogers | first=Vaneta | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambush Bug was seen in the new ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' series in 2010 at the end of issue #9, arriving with his luggage and Cheeks. He appeared semi-regularly until the series ended.

Ambush Bug made another appearance, in issue #46 of the outside of regular DC continuity ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' series, cover date January 2012.

Ambush Bug is now a news reporter in the feature "Channel 52" that appears in the back of all [[The New 52|New 52]] publications, in which characters acting as correspondents summarize recent events in an in-universe style. Ambush Bug, however, is the only character who appears in costume and, as is typical for his appearances since his creation, appears to understand that he is in a comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comic Book Resources |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=43436|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and weapons==
[[Image:Action563 p.jpg|thumb|A series of panels describing Ambush Bug's suit being grafted to him. It also contains a reference to [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|black]] costume.]]
Ambush Bug's primary power is teleportation. At first, this was a function of his suit; he was limited to teleporting to where small receiver bugs were located. Later, after an explosion, Ambush Bug internalized this power. It became apparent, in ''DC Comics Presents'' #81, that the Bug used to have to say "Simon says" to teleport, but it is no longer necessary. Ambush Bug is also aware of his fictionality and aware of events in other publishers' comic books. He once was shown being able to follow the internal dialogue between Firestorm's component personalities. Ambush Bug also shows surprising agility and skill at unarmed combat, such as gouging the eyes of enemies attacking him from behind or knocking out members of the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]] with a single blow. His unusual way of thinking is also a great advantage and often allows him to guess opponents' tactics and outmaneuver them, humiliating them in the process.

Despite all of this, Ambush Bug is simply a skinny man in the costume and can be defeated with surprising ease by more ridiculous characters. Serious foes, like [[Batman]] or [[Superman]], have great difficulty dealing with him, but other lunatics can duel with him easily.

==Other versions==

===Amalgam Comics===
In the continuity of [[Amalgam Comics]], '''Ambush the Lunatik''' is a combination of Ambush Bug and [[Marvel Comics]]'s [[Lunatik]], an equally insane character, also created by Giffen. An intergalactic bounty hunter, his sole appearance is in ''Lobo the Duck'' #1 (April 1997).

===''Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl''===
In ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl]]'', a heavily armored Ambush Bug is a member of a version of the [[Justice Society of America]] backed by [[Lex Luthor]] and led by [[Wonder Woman]].

==="Flashpoint"===
In the alternate timeline of the 2011 "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, the "Ambush Bugs" are a group of insect-themed heroes gathered together to fight the Amazons. Their members are [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]], [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], Cockroach, and Canterbury Cricket. All but the Canterbury Cricket are killed in a confrontation with the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: The Cantebury Cricket'' (June 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
Ambush Bug appears in the series finale of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' titled "Mitefall!", voiced by [[Henry Winkler]]. Here, he tries to thwart [[Bat-Mite]]'s attempts to make the show [[jump the shark]] and force its cancellation while assisting Batman and [[Aquaman]] in fighting [[Gorilla Grodd]]. In the end, the executives do cancel the show. After Bat-Mite sees the trailer for the new Batman- uh,BatGIRL series, Ambush Bug appears next to Bat-Mite stating that because the upcoming series will be dark, Bat-Mite will not be in it. This causes this show's Bat-Mite to white out in the process. Ambush Bug helps organize a wrap party for the whole cast in the Bat Cave.

===Video games===
* Ambush Bug appears in the ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by Tracy W. Bush. He breaks the [[fourth wall]] by mentioning that he is in your "video game" and also allows both heroes and villains access to the Vault, a special room players can visit once a day to get money and clothes. In The Death of Superman episode, he offers missions to collect comic books scattered over Doomed Metropolis.
* In ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked]]'', he will occasionally appear in the Watchtower and state that he's in another game.
* Ambush Bug appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Sam Riegel]]. A side mission involves the player exterminating [[Reach (comics)|Reach]] drones for him. Feeling guilty afterwards, he keeps five as his pets and names them Amber, Bushetta, Buggy, Shmuggy and Darren.

'''''Beginning of the End''''' is a 1957 [[independent film|independently made]] American [[black-and-white]] [[science fiction film|science fiction]] giant insects film, produced and directed by [[Bert I. Gordon]]. It stars [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]], [[Peggie Castle]], and [[Morris Ankrum]]. The film's storyline concerns an agricultural scientist (Graves) who has successfully grown gigantic vegetables using [[radiation]]. Unfortunately, the vegetables are eaten by [[locust]]s (the swarming phase of short-horned [[grasshopper]]s), which quickly grow to a gigantic size and attack the nearby city of [[Chicago]]. ''Beginning of the End'' is generally known for its "atrocious" [[special effect]]s and is considered to be one of the most poorly written and acted science fiction films of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Warren325326"&gt;Warren, ''Keep Watching the Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties,'' 1997, p. 325-326.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film opens with newspaper [[photojournalist]] Audrey Aimes (Castle) accidentally stumbling upon a small town ([[Ludlow, Illinois]]) which has been inexplicably destroyed. All 150 people in the town are missing, and the evidence indicates they are dead. Incredibly, the local fields are also barren, as if a swarm of locusts had eaten all the crops. Aimes suspects that the military is covering something up, and travels to a nearby [[United States Department of Agriculture]] experimental farm to learn what creature might have caused the agricultural destruction. She meets Dr. Ed Wainwright (Graves), who is experimenting with radiation as a means of growing gigantic fruits and vegetables to end world hunger. Dr. Wainwright reports that there have been a number of mysterious incidents nearby, and that locusts have eaten all the radioactive wheat stored in a nearby [[Silo|grain silo]].

Gigantic mutant locusts rampage over the countryside.  Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes begin to track down the source of the mysterious occurrences, and quickly discover that the locusts which ate the grain have grown to the size of a [[Bus|city bus]]. The monsters have eaten all the crops in the area, and now are seeking human beings as a means of sustenance. It is also clear that they are headed for the city of Chicago.  Wainwright and Aimes meet with General Hanson (Ankrum), Colonel Sturgeon (Henry), and Captain Barton (Seay) to strategize a solution. [[Machine gun]] and artillery fire seem ineffective against the creatures, and there are far too many to effectively deal with all at once.  The [[United States Army]] and [[Illinois National Guard]] are called upon to help protect the city.  But the monsters quickly invade Chicago, and begin to feast on human flesh as well as several buildings.

General Hanson concludes that the only way to destroy the beasts ''en masse'' is to use a [[nuclear weapon]] and destroy Chicago. However, Dr. Wainwright realizes that the locusts are warm-weather creatures. He concludes that he might be able to lure the locusts into [[Lake Michigan]]. There, the cold water will incapacitate them, and they will drown.  The lure itself will be a decoy locust [[mating call]], generated electronically with test-tone oscillators.  The plan is put into effect, and it works at the last possible moment.  The monstrous locusts drown, but Dr. Wainwright and Ms. Aimes wonder if other insects or animals might have eaten other radioactive crops.

==Production==
Films with a [[list of science fiction themes|science fiction theme]] were an uncommon but well-established genre of motion picture long before the 1950s. By one film historian's count, the "modern" era of science fiction film began in 1951 with the release of ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' and ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]''.&lt;ref name="Warrenxiv"&gt;Warren, ''Keep Watching the Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties,'' 1997, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was re-released theatrically. ''King Kong'' proved immensely popular, holding its own against new releases such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (which later won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]).&lt;ref name="Erb"&gt;Erb, ''Tracking King Kong: A Hollywood Icon in World Culture,'' 2009, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pomerance, ''American Cinema of the 1950s: Themes and Variations,'' 2005, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; ''King Kong'' earned $2 million to $3 million (estimates vary) that year, roughly double the box office gross of its initial release and making the re-release very highly profitable for [[RKO Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Erb" /&gt; In response to the success of ''King Kong'', many film studios rushed science fiction-themed films into production.&lt;ref name="Warrenxiv" /&gt; The following year saw the release of four highly influential motion pictures: ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'', ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'', and ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''. The financial success of ''The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'' (distributed by [[Warner Bros.]]) sparked an interest in giant monster films, and in 1954 Warner Bros. released another very profitable monster film, ''[[Them!]]''&lt;ref name="Warrenxiv" /&gt; With the success of these two films, giant insect pictures became a distinct [[genre|subgenre]] of science fiction films in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Warrenxiv" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Everman205"&gt;Everman, ''Cult Horror Films: From 'Attack of the 50 Foot Woman' to 'Zombies of Mora Tau','' 1993, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beginning of the End'' was financed by [[American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres]] (AB-PT). The company had been formed in February 1953 when the [[American Broadcasting Company]] and [[United Paramount Theatres]] merged.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, ''A.B.C., United Paramount Merge in $25,000,000 Deal," ''New York Times,'' May 24, 1951; Loftus, "Paramount, A.B.C. Cleared to Merge," ''New York Times,'' February 10, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1956, AB-PT (sometimes also called "Am-Par") announced the formation of a movie studio, and revealed a slate of six films a year in January 1957.&lt;ref&gt;"AB-PT to Enter Film Prod'n At Same Time Goldenson Predicts 8,000 Houses to Fold," ''Variety,'' September 24, 1956; "Filming Planned by Theatre Chain," ''New York Times,'' September 22, 1956; Pryor, "6 Films Planned by Am-Par Corp.," ''New York Times,'' January 28, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio's focus was on low-budget features which it could place in its theatres in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Southern United States|South]].&lt;ref name="Heffernan"&gt;Heffernan, ''Ghouls, Gimmicks, and Gold: Horror Films and the American Movie Business: 1953–1968,'' 2004, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; AB-PT hoped to expand to a yearly slate of 20 pictures, and signed a distribution deal with [[Republic Pictures]] to get them into theatres.&lt;ref name="Ryfle"&gt;Ryfle, ''Godzilla: The Unauthorized Biography,'' 1998, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beginning of the End'' went into production in 1956, the first of the "boom years" for science fiction films in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;By one count, there were 25 science fiction-themed motion pictures released in America that year, followed by 34 in 1957 and 36 in 1958. After 1958, the number of releases tapered off, until by 1963 there genre was uncommon again. See: Warren, ''Keep Watching the Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties,'' 1997, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Its production was a direct outcome of the success of ''Them!''&lt;ref name="Everman205"/&gt;

AB-PT announced on November 29, 1956, that it had approved production of its first film, ''Beginning of the End''&lt;ref name="VarietyStarting"&gt;"AB-PT Starting Prod'n Sans Gov't Greenlight," ''Variety,'' November 30, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; and announced on December 2, 1956, that production would begin immediately.&lt;ref name="ScheuerStarts"&gt;Scheuer, "ABC-Paramount Starts Production Experiment," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 3, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; The company said it had hired 34-year-old Bert I. Gordon to direct and produce.&lt;ref name="ScheuerStarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hardy166"&gt;Hardy and Gifford, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies,'' 1986, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young43"&gt;Young, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Film: Ali Baba to Zombies,'' 1997, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian214"&gt;Lucian and Coville, ''Smokin' Rockets: The Romance of Technology in American Film, Radio, and Television, 1945–1962,''  2002, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon had gotten his start as a [[Film producer|supervising producer]] for [[television advertisement|televised commercials]] and [[Television program|network TV shows]], had produced his first [[feature film]] (''[[Serpent Island]]'') in 1954, and directed his first feature film (''[[King Dinosaur]]'') in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, ''The Dinosaur Filmography,'' 2002, p. 178; McGee, ''Fast and Furious: The Story of American International Pictures,'' 1984, p. 75; Wright, ''Horrorshows: The A-to-Z of Horror in Film, TV, Radio and Theater;'' 1986, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson89"&gt;Johnson, ''Cheap Tricks and Class Acts: Special Effects, Makeup and Stunts From the Films of the Fantastic Fifties,'' 1996, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon claims he neither directed nor produced ''Serpent Island,'' but there is much evidence to the contrary. Additionally, while [[Tom Gries]] is credited with being the director by some film historians, others argue that Gordon was the director and Gries only had input. See the discussion in: Dixon, ''Lost in the Fifties: Recovering Phantom Hollywood,'' 2005, p. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was already set, according to press reports,&lt;ref name="ScheuerStarts" /&gt; with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' claiming that Bert I. Gordon had already completed the script.&lt;ref name="VarietyStarting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VarietyGraves"&gt;"Graves, Peg Castle in Am-Par's 'Beginning'," ''Variety,'' December 3, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is confirmed by at least modern source as well. See: Hardy and Gifford, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies,'' 1986, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Press sources noted that the studio was clearly attempting to cash-in on the science fiction movie craze.&lt;ref name="ScheuerStarts" /&gt; However, the final screenplay is credited to Fred Frieberger (a veteran writer of B movies) and Lester Gorn.&lt;ref name="Young43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian214" /&gt; The screen story bears a striking resemblance to the 1904 [[H. G. Wells]] novel ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]''.&lt;ref name="Warren326" /&gt; (Gordon would adapt this novel twice more, once for [[Embassy Pictures]] in 1965's ''[[Village of the Giants]]'' and again for [[American International Pictures]] in 1976's ''[[The Food of the Gods (film)|The Food of the Gods]]''.)&lt;ref name="Warren326" /&gt;

Casting was complete within two weeks of the start of production. In late November, AB-PT said actress [[Mala Powers]] was being considered for the female lead.&lt;ref name="VarietyStarting" /&gt; But on December 2, the studio revealed that Peter Graves and Peggie Castle had been cast as the leads.&lt;ref name="ScheuerStarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VarietyGraves" /&gt; Three days later, AB-PT announced that Don C. Harvey, Morris Ankrum, Pierre Watkin, Ralph Sanford, and Richard Benedict had also been cast.&lt;ref name="ScheuerBack"&gt;Scheuer, "John Beal Back in Film," ''Los Angeles Times,'' December 6, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio also said that Pat Dean, its "sexboat" discovery (and a former dancer at the [[El Rancho Vegas]] [[hotel]] and [[casino]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]) would also appear in the picture.&lt;ref name="ScheuerBack" /&gt; Larry Blake, Duane Cress, James Douglas, Eileen Jannsen, John Kranston, Ann Loos, and Jeanne Wood were added to the cast a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;"'Beginning' for Seven," ''Variety,'' December 12, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Ankrum, Henry, and Seay were cast because they usually played military men in B movies, roles they portrayed in ''Beginning of the End'' as well.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Film: Ali Baba to Zombies,'' 1997, p. 61; Warren, ''Keep Watching the Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties,'' 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

John A. Marta, a veteran [[cinematography|cinematographer]], and Aaron Stell, a long-time [[Film editing|film editor]], also worked on the film.&lt;ref name="Young43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian214" /&gt; Marta had shot close to 150 [[B movies]] for Republic Pictures by this time,&lt;ref&gt;"New DVD's" ''New York Times,'' July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which is probably why he was hired (given AB-PT's relationship with that studio and Marta's fast-and-quick shooting style). Albert Glasser composed the musical score.&lt;ref name="Young43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian214" /&gt; Glasser worked in the same office building where Gordon had his offices, and Gordon admired his score for the 1956 [[war film]] ''[[Huk (film)|Huk!]]'' (a B movie from Pan Pacific Productions).&lt;ref name="Larson81"&gt;Larson, ''Musique Fantastique: A Survey of Film Music in the Fantastic Cinema,'' 1985, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon had already used Glasser to score his 1957 monster movie ''[[The Cyclops (film)|The Cyclops]]''.&lt;ref name="Larson81" /&gt; Glasser wrote the musical score for ''Beginning of the End'' as well as five more of Gordon's films.&lt;ref name="Larson81" /&gt; Glasser was paid $4,000 for his work on ''The Cyclops'', which may indicate how much he was paid for the musical score for ''Beginning of the End.''&lt;ref name="Weaver104"&gt;Weaver, Brunas, and Brunas, ''Science Fiction Stars and Horror Heroes: Interviews With Actors, Directors, Producers and Writers of the 1940s Through 1960s,'' 2006, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The musical soundtrack included the song "Natural, Natural Baby."&lt;ref name="Young43" /&gt; The [[Art director#In film|art director]] was Walter Keller.&lt;ref name="Lucian214" /&gt;

It is not clear what the budget for the picture was, although descriptions often use the term "low budget" or "ultra-low-budget." According to a statement by AB-PT President [[Leonard Goldenson]] in 1957, the average cost of the AB-PT pictures greenlit to date was $300,000.&lt;ref name="PlansShift"&gt;"ABPT Plans Shift to 'Quality' Prod's; $1,000,000 Budgets," ''Variety,'' September 24, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, ''Invaders From Mars'' was budgeted at $150,000,&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, ''The Science Fiction Film Reader,'' 2004, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms'' cost $400,000,&lt;ref&gt;Kalat and Kaisha, ''A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series,'' 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; ''It Came From Outer Space'' cost $532,000,&lt;ref&gt;Payment, ''Introducing "It Came From Outer Space",'' 2007, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Them!'' came in at under $1 million,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, ''Science Fiction Film Directors: 1895–1998,'' 2000, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1953's ''The War of the Worlds'' cost $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Cornea, ''Science Fiction Cinema: Between Fantasy and Reality,'' 2007, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming began December 3, 1956.&lt;ref name="ProductionChart"&gt;"Film Production Chart," ''Variety,'' December 14, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting took place on the Republic Pictures [[backlot]] at 4024 Radford Avenue in [[Los Angeles, California]] (built by [[Mack Sennett]] and now home to [[CBS Studio Center]]).&lt;ref name="ProductionChart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weaver145"&gt;Weaver, ''Earth vs. the Sci-Fi Filmmakers: 20 Interviews,'' 2005, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dangcil, ''Hollywood Studios,'' 2007, p. 91; Schneider, ''Edgar Rice Burroughs and the Silver Screen: Vol. IV, The Locations,'' 2008, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Peter Graves said Gordon "was okay, he was a good director."&lt;ref name="Weaver145" /&gt; He also had praise for actress Peggie Castle, and said he felt privileged to be working with an actor of Morris Ankrum's stature.&lt;ref name="Weaver145" /&gt;

Gordon himself provided the special effects for the film.&lt;ref name="Hardy166" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Young43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian214" /&gt; According to composer Glasser, Gordon literally worked out of his home garage.&lt;ref name="Weaver104" /&gt; [[Animation|Animated]] grasshoppers were considered, but the idea rejected as too costly.&lt;ref name="Bright"&gt;[http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/45/dontstep.php Vieira, "Don't Step on It! Killer Bugs, Babes, and Beasts in 1950s Drive-in Cinema,"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Bright Lights Film Journal,'' August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; So Gordon relied heavily on [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]], [[Matte (filmmaking)|static mattes]], and [[Rear projection effect|rear projection]] effects for the film.&lt;ref name="Warren326"/&gt; But his most important effort was one he had used in ''King Dinosaur'': placing live creatures on still photographs, and blowing air at them to encourage the creatures to move.&lt;ref name="Johnson89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warren326"&gt;Warren, ''Keep Watching the Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties,'' 1997, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon purchased 200 non-hopping, non-flying live grasshoppers in Texas (which had recently seen an outbreak of a species of exceptionally large locusts) for the film.&lt;ref name="Warren326" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson251"&gt;Johnson, ''Cheap Tricks and Class Acts: Special Effects, Makeup and Stunts From the Films of the Fantastic Fifties,'' 1996, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer242"&gt;Fischer, ''Science Fiction Film Directors: 1895–1998,'' 2000, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tinee"&gt;Tinee, "2 Local Boys Now in Films Revist City," ''Chicago Tribune,'' May 19, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; But when he attempted to bring them into [[California]] for filming, state agricultural officials required that every single one of the animals be inspected and sexed.&lt;ref name="Warren326" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer242" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tinee" /&gt; He later described his efforts:&lt;ref name="Johnson251" /&gt;
:I had to get my grasshoppers from Waco, Texas. They had the only species large enough to carry focus. I could only import males because they didn't want the things to start breeding. They even had someone from the agricultural department or some place like that come out to take a head count, or wing count. The grasshoppers turned cannibalistic.
Gordon kept the grasshoppers in a box for only a few days, but during that time the grasshoppers devoured one another and only 12 were left when Gordon finally got around to shooting them.&lt;ref name="Warren326" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson251" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer242" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parla"&gt;Parla, and Mitchell, "Talking Eye To Eye With Duncan 'Dean' Parkin (1993 Interview)," ''Filmfax,'' October 1996 – January 1997, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon also considered building miniatures for the grasshoppers to climb on, but this, too, was deemed too expensive.&lt;ref name="Bright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parla" /&gt; Instead, Gordon used still photographs of the [[Wrigley Building]] and other noted Chicago landmarks and simply filmed the grasshoppers moving about on top of the photograph.&lt;ref name="Johnson89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt104"&gt;Pratt, ''Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!'', 2004, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; When the monsters are supposed to be wounded or killed by gunfire, Gordon merely tipped the photograph and the grasshoppers slid down it.&lt;ref name="Johnson89" /&gt; According to one film historian, "the effect looks (almost) real" until one of the grasshoppers steps off the "building" into what is supposed to be thin air.&lt;ref name="Johnson89" /&gt;

==Release==
''Beginning of the End'' premiered in Chicago on June 16, 1957.&lt;ref name="Weaver145" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Locale"&gt;"City Locale for Science Fiction Film," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 16, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Stars Peter Graves and Peggie Castle were both on hand for the premiere.&lt;ref name="Locale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TineeFull"&gt;Tinee, "Full Summer of Film Fare on Its Way," ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 23, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened widely in 244 theaters in the South and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] on June 20.&lt;ref name="Heffernan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TineeWild"&gt;Tinee, "'Beginning of the End' Is Both Wild and Weird," ''Chicago Tribune,'' June 20, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The studio owned about 500 theaters at the time. See: "ABPT Plans Shift to 'Quality' Prod's; $1,000,000 Budgets," ''Variety,'' September 24, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; It played as part of a [[double feature]] with ''[[The Unearthly]]'' (a film based loosely on 1932's ''[[Island of Lost Souls (1932 film)|Island of Lost Souls]]'' and 1956's ''[[The Black Sleep]]''), another AB-PT production.&lt;ref name="Heffernan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryfle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian214" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TineeFull"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oversized"&gt;"Oversized Insects Go on Rampage," ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 19, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; As planned, it was distributed by Republic Pictures.&lt;ref name="Oversized" /&gt; Two [[tagline]]s were used to promote the film.  The first was "New Thrills! New Shocks! New Terror!"&lt;ref name="Halliwell92"&gt;Halliwell and Walker, ''Halliwell's Film Guide,'' 1994, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; This tagline is depicted on the film poster (see the infobox, above). The other tagline used was "The screen's first full-length science-fiction feature with real-live creatures!"&lt;ref name="Young43" /&gt; There is some discrepancy as to how long the film ran.  Some sources cite 73 minutes,&lt;ref name="Halliwell92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maltin105"&gt;Maltin, ''Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide,'' 2008, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; some 74 minutes,&lt;ref name="Young43" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucian214" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Broderick"&gt;Broderick, ''Nuclear Movies...,'' 1991, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and some 76 minutes.&lt;ref name="Pratt104" /&gt;

The film was a modest hit, and profitable for AB-PT.&lt;ref name="Warren326" /&gt; For example, in its first week playing in [[San Francisco, California]], it made $16,000—just behind the top-ranked movie of the week for the area, the reissue of ''[[Bambi]]'' (which grossed $18,500).&lt;ref&gt;"Reissued 'Bambi' Out-Pulls New Product On Frisco 1st-Run Front," ''Variety,'' August 16, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's debut in Los Angeles saw its gross reach $16,500, although this was a soft movie-going market.&lt;ref&gt;"L.A. 1st Run Biz Droops; 189G Week," ''Variety,'' September 24, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beginning of the End'' proved an apt title for its parent studio.  AB-PT shuttered its operations immediately after releasing the film, for reasons which are still unclear.&lt;ref name="Ryfle" /&gt; Gordon's work for AB-PT landed him a new contract with American International Pictures (AIP).&lt;ref name="Warren326" /&gt; The week ''Beginning of the End'' opened, Gordon began shooting his next feature film, ''[[The Amazing Colossal Man]]'', for AIP.&lt;ref&gt;"Movieland Events," ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 17, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Beginning of the End'' made Bert I. Gordon famous for his giant monster films.&lt;ref&gt;Rajewski, ''Introducing the Deadly Mantis,'' 2007, p. 33; Lisanti, ''Fantasy Femmes of Sixties Cinema: Interviews With 20 Actresses From Biker, Beach, and Elvis Movies,'' 2001, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics and film historians point out that the film is only one of many which drew heavily on most Americans' fear about atomic weapons, open-air nuclear tests, and the possibility of nuclear war.&lt;ref name="Warren325326" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Broderick" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoell, ''Creature Features: Nature Turned Nasty in the Movies,'' 2008, p. 53-54; Evans, ''Celluloid Mushroom Clouds: Hollywood and the Atomic Bomb,'' 1998, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derry"&gt;Derry, ''Dark Dreams: A Psychological History of the Modern Horror Film,'' 1977, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsutsui"&gt;Tsutsui, "Looking Straight at ''[[Them!]]'': Understanding the Big Bug Movies of the 1950s," ''Environmental History,'' April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Beginning of the End'' had very little of the metaphorical creativity of films such as ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' or ''[[Them!]]''&lt;ref name="Ryfle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derry" /&gt; A more recent assessment, however, concludes that the film taps more deeply into 1950s Americans' worries over invasive species and growing unease over pesticides (like DDT).&lt;ref name="Tsutsui" /&gt;

The film received extensive negative reviews at the time of its release and by modern film historians. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was particularly negative. Calling the movie "derivative", the industry trade publication said, "Summarizing the plot of ''Beginning of the End'' is like rehashing the story of several dozen similar films."&lt;ref name="VarietyReview"&gt;"Film Reviews: 'Beginning of the End'," ''Variety,'' July 3, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication felt that not much effort had been put into the film. "Even taken on its own terms—as a low-budget exploitation feature—''Beginning of the End'' hardly reflects the best effort of a major theatre circuit."&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; It called the special effects "obvious" and decried the use of stock footage.&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; The reviewer felt the screenplay was "ludicrous" and cliché-ridden.&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; The magazine believed Peter Graves had turned in a decent performance, but described Peggie Castle's performance as "unconvincing" and Morris Ankrum's as "artificial".&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; The cinematography and editing were, it concluded, average.&lt;ref name="VarietyReview" /&gt; Mae Tinnee, reviewing the motion picture for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' had several negative comments. "The film obviously was made on a shoestring budget, and the people in it are no more than props for the magnified insects. I doubt if it will fool anyone. But youngsters will probably think it's great stuff."&lt;ref name="TineeWild" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was far harsher in its assessment. Its unsigned review concluded: "The audience is cheated in the production. The conclusion is never in doubt and the process shots are so obvious that one is startled the first time a buffalo-sized grasshopper hits the screen but never again. And at no time are there more than a half-dozen of the things shown at once, although the script avers that there are thousands about and more coming."&lt;ref name="Oversized" /&gt; As of 2008, ''Beginning of the End'' is still "one of the most excoriated creature features."&lt;ref name="Schoell53"&gt;Schoell, ''Creature Features: Nature Turned Nasty in the Movies,'' 2008, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Maltin]] summed up his review in one word: "awful".&lt;ref name="Maltin105" /&gt; Another recent film guide called it "Bottom-of-the-sci-fi-barrel rubbish, very boring to watch."&lt;ref name="Halliwell92" /&gt; One review pointed out that Gordon didn't even bother to hide the mountains in the background of the shots (Central Illinois is mostly flat prairie land).&lt;ref&gt;Nagro, "Bugshow," ''Pest Control Technology,'' July 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also been upset with film's lack of horrifying images.&lt;ref name="Schoell54"&gt;Schoell, ''Creature Features: Nature Turned Nasty in the Movies,'' 2008, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The derivative nature of the picture has also upset some critics. Critics say the film covered almost the same ground as the far superior monster movie ''Them!'',&lt;ref name="Derry" /&gt; and it is clear that Gordon merely wanted to "cash in" on giant bug craze rather than come up with a story that was fresh and creative.&lt;ref name="Fischer242" /&gt;

There have been some positive reviews, however. One modern critic said "the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we still get a thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects."&lt;ref name="Pratt104" /&gt; Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: "As in ''[[The Deadly Mantis|Deadly Mantis]]'', the ''complete'' disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as is the notion of 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraft]], although it is not exploited as well as it could have been."&lt;ref name="Schoell54" /&gt; Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: "The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know."&lt;ref name="Bright" /&gt; Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. "I think they played OK. ... All of that was ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who 'bought' it and loved it."&lt;ref name="Weaver145" /&gt;

''Beginning of the End'' has become somewhat infamous because of its notoriously poor production values and unrealistic plot. The movie was parodied in the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|11th season]] of the hit animated television program ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode "[[E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)]]." In that episode, [[Homer Simpson]] grows giant vegetables using radioactive materials, and automatically assumes that any animal eating the food will become monstrous.&lt;ref name="Alberti"&gt;Alberti, ''Leaving Springfield: 'The Simpsons' and the Possibilities of Oppositional Culture,'' 2004, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Homer even attempts to recall ''Beginning of the End'' as evidence of his claim, although he misremembers the title as ''Grasshopperus'' and the star as [[Chad Everett]] (another blond, all-American actor similar to Peter Graves).&lt;ref name="Alberti" /&gt;

==Home video releases==
''Beginning of the End'' was released on [[DVD]] in March 2003 by [[Image Entertainment]]. However, this print was considered "smeary" and not a very high quality issue.&lt;ref name="Pratt104" /&gt;

The film was the basis of an episode of the cable television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' (MST3K) during its fifth season.&lt;ref&gt;Beaulieu,  ''The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide,'' 1996, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; This episode of MST3K was released on DVD in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Cain,  "Which First on DVDs?", ''Decatur Herald and Courier,'' January 12, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circumpolar coastal human population distribution ca. 2009.png|thumb|upright=2|Circumpolar coastal human population distribution ca. Hi 2009 (includes both indigenous and non-indigenous)]]

==Prehistory==
The earliest inhabitants of North America's central and eastern Arctic are referred to as the [[Arctic small tool tradition]] (AST) and existed c. 2500 BC. AST consisted of several [[Paleo-Eskimo]] cultures, including the [[Independence I culture|Independence cultures]] and [[Pre-Dorset]] culture.&lt;ref name="Hoffecker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffecker|first=John F. |title=A prehistory of the north: human settlement of the higher latitudes|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005 |page=130|isbn=0-8135-3469-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_rL5F4EAaFkC&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbon"&gt;Gibbon, pp. 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dorset culture]] ([[Inuktitut]]: ''Tuniit'' or ''Tunit'') refers to the next inhabitants of central and eastern Arctic. The Dorset culture evolved because of technological and economic changes during the period of 1050–550 BC. With the exception of the [[Quebec]]/[[Labrador]] peninsula, the Dorset culture vanished around 1500 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorset/[[Thule people|Thule culture]] transition dates around the 9th–10th centuries. Scientists theorize that there may have been cross-contact of the two cultures with sharing of technology, such as fashioning harpoon heads, or the Thule may have found Dorset remnants and adapted their ways with the predecessor culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe the Thule displaced the Dorset.

==Historical and contemporary peoples==
By 1300, the [[Inuit]], present-day Arctic inhabitants and descendants of Thule culture, had settled in west Greenland, and moved into east Greenland over the following century. Over time, the Inuit have migrated throughout the Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland, Russia and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml |title=First Nations Culture Areas Index |work=the Canadian Museum of Civilization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Circumpolar North indigenous peoples include the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Evenks]], [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]], [[Khanty people|Khanty]], [[Koryaks]], [[Nenets people|Nenets]], [[Sami people|Sami]], [[Yukaghir people|Yukaghir]], and [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], who still refer to themselves as [[Eskimo]] which means "snowshoe netters", not "raw meat eaters" as it is sometimes mistakenly translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/cultures/the_americas/arctic_peoples.aspx |title=Arctic Peoples |work=British Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students''' (CSFES) is a [[non-profit organization]] which Danielle Grijalva started in the [[United States of America]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826071004/http://csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html |date=2013-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee was created to protect foreign children who could be abused both physically and mentally if not put into a safe home.

== Origins ==
Grijalva had worked as an area representative for CCI (Center for Cultural Interchange),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10news.com/about/10news-leadership-award-winner-danielle-grijalva ABC10news, 2008 Jul 03, Leadership Award Winner Danielle Grijalva]&lt;/ref&gt; a foreign-exchange program for student that is based in [[Illinois]]. As an area representative she had the task of ensuring the safe placement of [[Student exchange program|exchange students]] travelling to the United States. As she gained experience as a representative, Ms. Grijalva learned that not all exchange students were placed with safe host-families.

In 2004, Danielle Grijalva resigned from CCI in protest when she found that another coordinator in the same agency had knowingly placed two boys from non-English speaking backgrounds in the home of a [[pederast]] who immediately began to groom them with gay pornography (which constitutes a crime in California), to provide them alcohol (which is against the law), and to deprive them of bathroom privacy. This was the eighth time that this man had been allowed to host boys.

Grijalva was appalled when she found that her agency was totally disinterested in what had happened to the boys, but threatened her with a lawsuit if she continued her concerns. The agency then concocted the allegations that the boys were expelled from high school for downloading pornography from their host father's computer.  The school principal contacted the Police Department and local [[Child Protective Services]]. Police, not the agency, removed the boys from the home. Their report claimed that when the officer went to the door, the man who answered stood there with his pants around his legs.

When she expressed concerns about future students being placed in this man's home, the manager allegedly said, "Now, Danielle, we cannot discriminate against homosexuality.  Back off!"

The president of the agency interfered with law enforcement stating that the boys concocted the allegations; because, they were accustomed to having a swimming pool in their back yard and wanted to be placed in a house that had one. The manager refused to change the placement and, hearing their allegations, notified police that the boys had attempted to steal from their host when they were caught looking for their passports and return tickets to go home. They, in common with most others in this situation, were instructed to sign a statement that the breakdown of the placement was due entirely to their own bad behavior, and they were told that they would be denied future access to the US if they refused to sign. This is sheer bullying; because, agencies do not have the power to prevent return visits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/22CFR/HTML/22CFR/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-3590/0-0-0-4552.html § Sec. 62. 25 Secondary school students]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the boys did not know that they were being blackmailed and they signed. This of course prevents them from suing their abusers and the agencies.

When in Grijalva wrote to inform the German agencies responsible for sending the boys to the US, she received an aggressive response. When she persisted and wrote again, she received a one-sentence reply: "When we told you we didn't wish to hear from you, we meant it."{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Activities ==
Grijalva received so many complaints from parents and students that she set up a website which has attracted more and more horror stories. She established the International Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students (CSFES), enlisting the support of others who were aware of the problems. CSFES became a registered charity in 2007, by which time its filing cabinets were full of complaints from parents along with newspaper reports of exchange students raped, molested, and exposed to every type of extortion. CSFES has no power other than its ability to support parents and students, to publicise the actions of unscrupulous agencies using media, to lobby politicians and to lodge complaints with government and exchange agency officials who invariably blame students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html Committee for Safety of Foreign Exchange Students] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826071004/http://csfes.org/CSFES_Recognition.html |date=2013-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSFES maintains that every exchange student deserves a safe exchange experience. To ensure this, Ms. Grijalva tries to educate various government agencies, the exchange organizations themselves and potential host-families.&lt;ref&gt;

Unfortunately, not all exchange students end up in safe host-families. CSFES then steps in and acts as an advocate for exchange students in the US. Due to the efforts of CSFES, many exchange students who have felt alone in difficult circumstances have been able to achieve their goal of a good experience.

Since the beginning, Ms. Grijalva has gained the attention of the US media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2009570258_apusexchangestudentwatchdog.html The Seattle Times, 2009 Jul 30, Calif. mom exposes abuses of exchange students]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/07/15/us.exchange.students/index.html CNN.com/US, 2009 Jul 16, Exchange students live American nightmare]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone has been happy about this attention. Exchange organizations have filed lawsuits against CSFES because of its work.
Media in non-US countries have contacted CSFES to get their take on the way the exchange industry works in the US. CSFES have become the go-to fount of information that has been needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/jobb/Sexpress_-tyveri-og-utnytting-2741873.html Bergens Tidende, 2012 Jul 30, Sexpress, tyvery og utnytting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14591">'''Creative Pedagogy''' is the science and art of creative teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A. G. (1989). On Creative Pedagogy. Higher Education Bulletin, 12, 29-34 (russ. Алейников А.Г. О креативной педагогике. Вестник высшей школы. 1989, 12, 29-34)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sub-field of [[Pedagogy]], opposed to [[Critical pedagogy]] (just as creative thinking for example in [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] is opposed to [[critical thinking]]). "In its essence, creative pedagogy teaches learners how to learn creatively and become creators of themselves and creators of their future." &lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A. (2013) Creative Pedagogy. Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. Springer: New York, NY, p.327.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disambiguation==

Creative Pedagogy should be differentiated (disambiguated) from Creative Education that is usually associated with teaching creativity as a subject (see [[Creative Education Foundation]]). Creative Pedagogy, on the contrary, can be applied to ANY subject, whether it is Math, Science, Language, or Economics and Finance. To some extent, one can state that subject does not matter, methodology (type of pedagogy) does: that’s why the introduction of creative methodologies changes the process of teaching/learning.

==Definition==

The founder of Creative Pedagogy, Dr. [[Andrei Aleinikov]], defined it in the form of formula of invention – a strict word pattern used to describe inventions for patenting in technology:

:“Creative pedagogy that includes educational influence on the learner for acquisition of certain study material (subject) [as pedagogy in general] and differing from the above by the fact that in order to achieve higher efficiency of learning, the pedagogical influence is provided on the background of centrifugal above-the-criticism mutual activity in which the learner is raised from the object of [pedagogical] influence to the rank of a creative person, while the traditional (basic) study material is transformed from the subject to learn into the means of achieving some creative goal, and the extra study material includes the description and demonstration of the heuristic methods and techniques.”&lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A. G. (1989). On Creative Pedagogy. Higher Education Bulletin, 12, 29-34 (russ. Алейников А.Г. О креативной педагогике. Вестник высшей школы. 1989, 12, 29-34)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Creative Pedagogy got noticed and cited by numerous educators - see external links below. The authors of Encyclopedic Dictionary not only included an article on Creative Pedagogy, but also commented on its unusual form – the formula of invention.&lt;ref&gt;Popov, V.V. (1995) Creative Pedagogy. In the Encyclopedic Dictionary “Technical Creativity: theory, methodology, practice.”  A.I. Polovinkin, V.V. Popov. (Eds). Moscow: Logos, 165-167 (russ. Попов В.В. Креативная педагогика. В энциклопедическом словаре "Техническое творчество: теория, методология, практика". (Под ред. А.И. Половинкина, В.В. Попова). - М.: Изд-во "Логос", 1995, 165-167)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

See [[Pedagogy]] and [[Creativity]]

==Goal (Mission)==

The goal of Creative Pedagogy is to transform ANY subject class (course, program, school) into a creative teaching process that would produce creative learners (life learners) – much more efficient learners than those produced by traditional school. This transformation of the traditional class (course, program, school) is called “creative orientation.” &lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A.G. Creative Pedagogy and Creative Meta-Pedagogy. Progress of Education. Vol. LXV, No 12, July 1991, p. 274; See also, an example of creative orientation - Aleinikov, A.G. (1990) Grammar of Creation and Creation Grammar (Creatively Oriented Theoretical Grammar and History of English). Ministry of Defense Military Institute: Moscow (russ: (Алейников, А.Г. (1990) Созидание грамматики и грамматика созидания (Креативно-ориентированный курс теоретической грамматики и истории английского языка), Военный Институт Министерства Обороны: Москва).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
A typical objection to the introduction of Creative Pedagogy is the following, “Every pedagogy is creative.” Some obvious counter examples to the word “every” are the so-called [[rote learning]] or, for instance, teaching by physical punishment - both very far from creative pedagogy.

Despite the slogans and inspiring practices of the great educators of the past like [[Jan Amos Komensky]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Maria Montessori]], [[Anton Makarenko]], etc.), despite the wishes of parents and guardians, the type of pedagogy depends on the requirements of the society.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey was one of the first thinkers to realize the influence of the rapid changes of the modern world on education, and to aim at recognizing the needs of individual with the new needs of his society. Dewey, J. (1899) The School and Society, Chicago: University Press (2nd edition, 1915). Durkheim, later stressed that since each society determines its own educational system, the methods and aims of education will vary according to the society in which they originate. Thus society seeks to train the kind of human being it needs for the particular stage of civilization. Durkheim, E. (1903) Pédagogie et Sociologie. Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale. Janvier, 1903. This paper was reprinted along with some other early lectures of Durkheim in a book entitled Education et Sociologie. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative pedagogy states: "Certain periods of history required certain pedagogies. History of education shows that the type of pedagogy usually depends on the needs of the society.
:* Society of the ancient times needed followers. So the training expressed in the phrases, “Do after me! Do as I do!” worked best. This pre-pedagogy produced hunters, fishermen, gatherers, warriors, etc. Nowadays, it is known as “on the job training.”
:* In Ancient Greece, speakers were needed. Speakers were trained in rhetoric classes, in public discussions. Speech training pedagogies were used.
:* Early capitalist society needed craftsmen and then workers. Technical schools were organized, and they employed training methodologies for technical teaching.
:* Developed capitalism needed more knowledgeable professionals, like engineers, doctors, and teachers. As a response to this need, pedagogy of knowledge acquisition and testing spread to schools, colleges, and universities.
:* The twentieth century put forward the need in problem solvers. Naturally, there appeared problem-oriented education as well as schools for creative problem solving. Creative pedagogy grew out of them to reflect and explain the trend.

All these types of pedagogy can be dominant at a certain time, but they do exist and coexist in contemporary education as well. This century, however, has been many times called the century of creativity and innovation, so as society matures, there are more and more creative people, and the need in educating such people is becoming more vivid." &lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A. (2013). Creative Pedagogy, Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. Springer: New York, NY, pp.328-329.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence and growth of the [[Creative Class]]&lt;ref&gt;Florida, R. (2003). The Rise of the Creative Class, North Melbourne, Australia: Pluto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is a reality. That’s why there appeared Creative Pedagogy as pedagogy aiming at the upbringing of a creator (a creative person) capable of meeting the constantly growing complexity and accelerating development of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A. G. (1990) Creative Pedagogy and Creative MetaPedagogy, The Progress of Education, Vol. LXV, No. 12, 274-280&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative Pedagogy generalized the research in the field of creativity ([[Graham Wallas]], [[Alex Osborn]], [[J.P. Guilford]], [[Sid Parnes]], [[Ellis Paul Torrance]], etc.) and put it into the classroom to improve the teaching/learning process. Creative Pedagogy is the result of applying the studies of creative process to the education process itself.

As The Encyclopedia of Creativity article on Humane Creativity states, "Creative Pedagogy, as a trend in science, generalizes and explains everything from music and art classes to creatively-oriented courses so thoroughly gathered and precisely described by Alex Osborn."&lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov A. (1999), Humane Creativity, Encyclopedia of Creativity, Mark A. Runco and Steven R. Pritzker (Eds.), San Diego, London…: Academic Press, Vol. 1, 837-844&lt;/ref&gt; Creative Pedagogy generalizes:
:* art (creativity) classes
:* technical creativity
:* psychology of creativity
:* Creative Problem Solving
:* creatively-oriented courses

The next natural step after the creation of Creative Pedagogy was to check whether the theory and practice of creative teaching is teachable. Creative MetaPedagogy – the science and art of teaching teachers how to teach creatively appeared in 1990-1992.&lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A. G. (1990) Creative Pedagogy and Creative MetaPedagogy, The Progress of Education, Vol. LXV, No. 12, 274-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A.G. (1992). Creative metapedagogy: D-day. Alma-Mater. Higher Education Bulletin, 1992, 1, 34-39 (russ. Алейников А.Г. Креативная мета-педагогика. Время “Ч”. Alma Mater// Вестник высшей школы. 1992, 1, 34-39)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some examples of the first Creative Pedagogy applications==

:* Creatively-oriented Linguistics, Military Institute, Moscow, Russia, 1984-92
:* Creative Management, Center for Creative Research, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], Moscow, Russia, 1990-1992
:* Word Origins and Usage (ENG2210), Effective Communication (COM1110), Psychology of Creativity (PSY3390), Foundations of Creative Education (EDU6625), [[Troy University]], Montgomery, Alabama, 1994-2006.

By 2006, Creative Pedagogy and Creative MetaPedagogy in the form of numerous programs for teachers, managers,  educational and business leaders, spread from the U.S.A. to Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, and Thailand. In Russia, where it was published first, it also received further development as "collective creative pedagogy" by [[I.P. Ivanov]]. A very interesting statement about the goal of creative pedagogy can be found in the work of [[TRIZ]] specialists B. Zlotin and A. Zusman, "Creative pedagogy is an attempt to replace the battle between the teacher and students with the child's struggle for self-perfection. The teacher is the child's assistant and ally in this struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Zlotin, B. and Zusman, A. (2005). TRIZ and Pedagogy, Ideation International, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Creative pedagogy borrowed from [[TRIZ]] one of its most powerful methods - [[Ideal Final Result]] (IFR) to create the model of Ideal Education, Ideal Teacher and Ideal Learner. Progressive journals popularize and develop the ideas of creative pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Arich, E. "Creative Education." All About Education Magazine. http://www.greateducation.ru/creative-pedagogy-28th-anniversary/ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satyendra Nath Mishra. (2012). Rejoinder: teacher, teacher, where are you? Drishtikon: A Management Journal. 3 (2), 3-8. See http://www.publishingindia.com/drishtikon/8/rejoinder-teacher-teacher-where-are-you-/155/1227/ OR http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/82602865/rejoinder-teacher-teacher-where-are-you&lt;/ref&gt; Innovative schools, like Skolkovo School, Novosibirsk, Russia, build their new programs on creative pedagogy principles.&lt;ref&gt;Long-term Program of development for the Skolkovo school in Novosibirsk in 2012-2020 (russ: Долгосрочная Программа развития Школы Сколково в Новосибирске на 2012-2020 учебные годы). See: http://um-ka.com/Skolkov/files/Progr_Razvitia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Creative Pedagogy becomes well spread - it is used for monograph titles and programs names. The concept is studied and taught at the university level (see further reading list). Finally, the new encyclopedia, dedicated entirely to creative pedagogy and titled Creative Pedagogy Encyclopedia is being produced under the leadership of V.V. Popov.

The recently published article "Creative Pedagogy" in the Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, describes the principles, methodologies, and models of creative pedagogy mentioned above. It also graphically presents how creative pedagogy together with the neighboring concept of creative [[andragogy]] create the common area that can be named Creagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Aleinikov, A. (2013) Creative Pedagogy. Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. Springer: New York, NY. pp.326-339&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Culture''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|tʃ|ər}}) is the [[social behavior]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[Society|societies]]. Culture is considered a central concept in [[anthropology]], encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social [[learning]] in human [[society|societies]]. [[Cultural universals]] are found in all human societies; these include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[Tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of [[social organization]] (including practices of [[political organization]] and social [[institutions]]), [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] (both [[writing|written]] and [[oral literature|oral]]), and [[science]] comprise the [[intangible cultural heritage]] of a society.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995|title=Sociology|last=Macionis|first=John J|last2=Gerber|first2=Linda Marie|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|oclc=652430995|isbn=978-0137001613|location=Toronto|language=English|page=53|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995|archive-date=August 18, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[humanities]], one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in [[the arts]], sciences, [[education]], or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been seen to distinguish [[civilization]]s from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in [[Social class|class-based]] distinctions between a [[high culture]] of the social [[elite]] and a [[low culture]], [[popular culture]], or [[folk culture]] of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to [[cultural capital]]. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by [[ethnicity|ethnic groups]] to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as [[body modification]], [[clothing]] or [[jewelry]]. [[Media culture|Mass culture]] refers to the [[Mass production|mass-produced]] and [[mass media]]ted forms of [[consumer culture]] that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as [[Marxism]] and [[critical theory]], have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a [[false consciousness]], and such perspectives are common in the discipline of [[cultural studies]]. In the wider [[social sciences]], the theoretical perspective of [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialism]] holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in [[human evolution|evolved biological]] dispositions.

When used as a [[count noun]], a "culture" is the set of customs, [[tradition]]s, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, [[multiculturalism]] values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a [[subculture]] (e.g. "[[bro culture]]"), or a [[counterculture]]. Within [[cultural anthropology]], the ideology and analytical stance of [[cultural relativism]] holds that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.

The modern term "culture" is based on a term used by the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] in his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or ''"cultura animi,"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZcOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA273|title=Tusculanes|last=Cicéron|first=Marcus Tullius Cicero|last2=Bouhier|first2=Jean|date=1812|publisher=J.

[[Samuel Pufendorf]] took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, "''refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original [[Barbarian|barbarism]], and through artifice, become fully human."''&lt;ref name=velkley&gt;{{Cite book|title=Being after Rousseau: philosophy and culture in question|last=Velkley|first=Richard L|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|oclc=47930775|isbn=978-0226852560|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|location=Chicago|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, philosopher [[Edward S. Casey]] wrote, "The very word ''culture'' meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin ''colere'', 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and ''cultus'', 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensive to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sorrells|first1=Kathryn|title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|date=2015|publisher=Sage|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1412927444}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- Ref provided is based purely on ASIN from earlier, incomplete, citation.

Culture described by [[Richard Velkley]]:&lt;ref name=velkley/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing [[Rousseau]]'s criticism of "[[modernity|modern]] [[liberalism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]". Thus a contrast between "culture" and "[[civilization]]" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the words of anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]], it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."{{sfn|Tylor|1974|loc=1}} Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/9294719|title=Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability|last=James|first=Paul|last2=Magee|first2=Liam|last3=Scerri|first3=Andy|last4=Steger|first4=Manfred|date=2015|isbn=978-1138025721|oclc=942553107|page=53|publisher=Routledge|location=London|language=en|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626015736/http://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_|archive-date=June 26, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with [[symbol]]s and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of [[behavioral modernity]] in humans around 50,000 years ago, and is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social [[interaction]] and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.

[[Raimon Panikkar]] identified 29 ways in which [[cultural change]] can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], renovation, [[reconception]], reform, innovation, [[revivalism]], revolution, [[mutation]], progress, [[diffusion]], osmosis, borrowing, [[eclecticism]], [[syncretism]], modernization, [[indigenization]], and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Pluralism: An Indian Christian Perspective|last=Panikkar|first=Raimon|editor-last=Pathil|editor-first=Kuncheria|date=1991|publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|ISPCK]]|isbn=978-8172140052|oclc=25410539|pages=252–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress. [[Rein Raud]], building on the work of [[Umberto Eco]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]], has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are judged by their [[cognitive adequacy]] and endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question.&lt;ref name="meaning-in-action" /&gt;

[[Cultural invention]] has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the [[World population|human population]] explosion, among other factors. [[Culture change|Culture repositioning]] means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|date=2015-07-03|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–50|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506|issn=1366-8803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both [[social structure]]s and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|title=Culture Change: Processes of Change|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|date=2006|website=Culture Change|publisher=Palomar College|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027181934/http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|archive-date=October 27, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[structuration]].)

Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new [[schema (psychology)|cultural models]], and spurring or enabling [[generative actor|generative action]]. These social shifts may accompany [[ideology|ideological]] shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. [[feminist movement]] involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last [[ice age]], plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of [[agriculture]], which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Heather|date=November 20, 1998|title=The Slow Birth of Agriculture|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5393/1446|journal=Science|language=en|volume=282|issue=5393|page=1446|doi=10.1126/science.282.5393.1446|issn=0036-8075|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807163436/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5393/1446|archive-date=August 7, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]], the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, [[hamburger]]s, fast food in the United States, seemed exotic when introduced into China.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} "Stimulus diffusion" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. [[Diffusion of innovations]] theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.

[[Acculturation]] has different meanings, but in this context it refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened to certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and to many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of [[colonization]]. Related processes on an individual level include [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and [[transculturation]]. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different culture and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.

==Early modern discourses==

===German Romanticism===
[[File:Johann gottfried herder.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Herder]] called attention to national cultures.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of "enlightenment" similar to the concept of ''[[bildung]]'': "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1784. "Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?" (German: "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?") ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', December (Berlin Monthly)&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: ''Sapere aude'', "Dare to be wise!" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of ''bildung'': "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|title=The German Bildung Tradition|last=Eldridge|first=Michael|publisher=[[UNC Charlotte]]|access-date=2017-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123162257/http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|archive-date=January 23, 2009|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Bastian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Bastian]] developed a universal model of culture.]]
In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], scholars in [[Germany]], especially those concerned with [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as "[[world view|worldview]]" (''Weltanschauung'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humboldt, Worldview, and Language|last=Underhill|first=James W.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.

In 1860, [[Adolf Bastian]] (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adolf Bastian and the psychic unity of mankind|last=Köpping|first=Klaus-Peter|date=2005|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3825839895|oclc=977343058}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of "elementary ideas" (''Elementargedanken''); different cultures, or different "folk ideas" (''Völkergedanken''), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|title=Biography of Adolf Bastian, ethnologist|last=Ellis|first=Ian|website=Today in Science History|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806215336/https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|archive-date=August 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

===English Romanticism===
[[File:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|left|upright|British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] viewed "culture" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal.]]

In the 19th century, [[Humanism|humanists]] such as [[English people|English]] poet and essayist [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|title=Culture and Anarchy|last=Arnold|first=Matthew|date=1869|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106012655/http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of culture is also comparable to the [[German people|German]] concept of ''bildung'': "...culture being a pursuit of our total [[perfection]] by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."&lt;ref name=anarchy /&gt;

In practice, ''culture'' referred to an [[elite]] ideal and was associated with such activities as [[art]], [[European classical music|classical music]], and [[haute cuisine]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1983), p. 90. Cited in {{Cite book|title=Understanding popular music|last=Roy|first=Shuker|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415107235|oclc=245910934|page=5}} argues that contemporary definitions of culture fall into three possibilities or mixture of the following three:
* "a general process of intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic development"
* "a particular way of life, whether of a people, period, or a group"
* "the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity".&lt;/ref&gt; As these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from lat. ''civitas'', city). Another facet of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement was an interest in [[folklore]], which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between [[high culture]], namely that of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]], and [[low culture]]. In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1981, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|upright|British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense.]]

Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with [[anarchy]]; other Europeans, following [[philosophy|philosophers]] [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature." According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and "uncivilized." According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to [[Herbert Spencer]]'s theory of [[Social Darwinism]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s theory of [[cultural evolution]]. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.

Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and [[sophistication]] of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature.&lt;!-- i.e. American Transcendentalism?? --&gt; These critics considered [[folk music]] (as produced by "the folk," i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed [[indigenous peoples]] as "[[noble savage]]s" living [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified [[capitalism|capitalist]] systems of [[Western culture|the West]].

In 1870 the anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the [[evolution of religion]]. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.&lt;ref&gt;McClenon, pp. 528–29&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

For sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|title=Georg Simmel on individuality and social forms: selected writings|last=Simmel|first=Georg|editor-last=Levine|editor-first=Donald N|date=1971|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226757766|location=Chicago|page=xix|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912194431/https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, culture in the [[sociology|sociological]] field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, [[non-material culture]] or [[material culture]].&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53" /&gt; Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar Germany]] (1918–1933), where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] focusing on words, artifacts and symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=June 5, 1996|website=Lingua Franca|access-date=October 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326152500/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|archive-date=March 26, 2007|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Physicist [[Alan Sokal]] published a paper in a journal of cultural sociology stating that gravity was a social construct that should be examined hermeneutically. See [[Sokal affair]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]]. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Is any research confirms this claim/trend? Otherwise, can this claim be backed up by any major work about this new vein with many substantive contributors (handbook, encyclopedia, periodic dedicated to this new vein, etc.)? In addition, it would be highly beneficial if anyone knowledgeable about this new vein should write at least an additional (even small) section on the psychological / cognitive perspective on culture.|date=July 2018}}

===Early researchers and development of cultural sociology===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Karl Marx: His Life and Environment|last=Berlin|first=Isaiah|last2=Ryan|first2=Alan|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195103267|oclc=611127754|location=New York|language=English|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]) with the growing discipline of [[anthropology]], wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

==Cultural studies==
In the [[United Kingdom]], sociologists and other scholars influenced by [[Marxism]] such as [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1932–2014) and [[Raymond Williams]] (1921–1988) developed [[cultural studies]]. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified "culture" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, [[food]], sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by [[relations of production]], which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Raymond|date=1983|title=Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/keywords-a-vocabulary-of-culture-and-society/oclc/906396817|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=87–93, 236–38|language=English|journal=|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912193349/https://www.worldcat.org/title/keywords-a-vocabulary-of-culture-and-society/oclc/906396817|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/ways-of-seeing/oclc/780459348|title=Ways of seeing|last=Berger|first=John|date=1972|publisher=Peter Smithn|isbn=978-0563122449|oclc=780459348|language=English|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912191748/https://www.worldcat.org/title/ways-of-seeing/oclc/780459348|archive-date=September 12, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of [[popular culture]]; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. [[Richard Hoggart]] coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] or CCCS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Studying Culture – Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart|journal=Media, Culture, and Society|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|title=Cultural hallmark|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=September 23, 2007|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 30, 2016|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031030223/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|archive-date=October 31, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who succeeded Hoggart as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stuart Hall|last=James|first=Procter|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415262675|oclc=318376213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as "[[Western culture|Western civilization]]" or "[[globalism]]."

From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], Tony Jefferson, and [[Angela McRobbie]], created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine [[political economy]], [[communication]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], [[museum studies]], and [[art history]] to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Cultural Studies|last=Sardar|first=Ziauddin|last2=Van Loon|first2=Borin|last3=Appignanesi|first3=Richard|date=1994|publisher=Totem Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1840465877|oclc=937991291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies is concerned with the [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]] and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to "fit in" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.

In the context of cultural studies, the idea of a ''text'' includes not only [[written language]], but also [[film]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[fashion]] or [[hairstyle]]s: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Myths of Oz: reading Australian popular culture|last=Fiske|first=John|last2=Turner|first2=Graeme|last3=Hodge|first3=Robert Ian Vere|date=1987|publisher=Allen and Unwin|isbn=978-0043303917|oclc=883364628|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of "culture." "Culture" for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional [[high culture]] (the culture of [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://proxy2.hec.ca/login?url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/hecm/Doc?id=10439450|title=The dialogic imagination four essays|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail Mikhaĭlovich|last2=Holquist|first2=Michael|date=1981|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|language=English|oclc=872436352|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[popular culture]], but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is [[comparative cultural studies]], based on the disciplines of [[comparative literature]] and cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|date=2015|website=Purdue University Press|language=en|access-date=October 30, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805230001/http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|archive-date=August 5, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, [[E.P. Thompson]], and [[Raymond Williams]], and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the [[University of Birmingham]]. This included overtly political, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] views, and criticisms of [[popular culture]] as "capitalist" [[mass culture]]; it absorbed some of the ideas of the [[Frankfurt School]] critique of the "[[culture industry]]" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and [[Paul Gilroy]].

In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Qualitative Communication Research Methods|last=Lindlof|first=Thomas R|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan C|date=2002|publisher=Sage|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0761924937|oclc=780825710|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, [[mass culture]]; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of [[fandom]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a [[Marxist]] model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the [[Frankfurt School]], but especially from the [[structuralism|structuralist]] Marxism of [[Louis Althusser]] and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the ''production'' of [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]]. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies [[power (social and political)|power]] as residing with those producing [[cultural artifact]]s. In a Marxist view, those who control the [[means of production]] (the economic ''base'') essentially control a culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Other approaches to cultural studies, such as [[feminist]] cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book ''Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman'' (by Paul du Gay ''et al.''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX-kksNNdFIC|title=Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman|editor1-last=du Gay|editor1-first=Paul|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0761954026|oclc=949857570|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian [[Griselda Pollock]] contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of [[art history]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. The writer [[Julia Kristeva]] is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical [[French feminism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrakis|first=Panagiotis|last2=Kostis|first2=Pantelis|date=2013-12-01|title=Economic growth and cultural change|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|volume=47|pages=147–57|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117193727/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218|archive-date=January 17, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency orientation" of the societies: performance orientation, [[future orientation]], assertiveness, power distance and uncertainty avoidance.
# The second covers the variables that represent the "social orientation" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism and human orientation.
In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by [[Rein Raud]],&lt;ref name="meaning-in-action"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Rein|first=Raud|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1509511242|oclc=944339574|date = 2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of meanings), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.

'''Culture of Palestine''' is the culture of the [[Palestinian people]], located across [[Historic Palestine]] as well as in the [[Palestinian diaspora]]. Palestinian culture is influenced by the many diverse cultures and religions which have existed in historic Palestine, from the early [[Canaan|Canaanite]] period onward.

[[File:Bethlehengirlsintraditionaldresspre1918.jpg|thumb|upright|Girls in Bethlehem costume pre-1885]]

Foreign travelers to Palestine in late 19th and early 20th centuries often commented on the rich variety of costumes among the Palestinian people, and particularly among the [[fellaheen]] or village women. Until the 1940s, a woman's economic status, whether married or single, and the town or area they were from could be deciphered by most Palestinian women by the type of cloth, colors, cut, and [[embroidery]] motifs, or lack thereof, used for the robe-like dress or "thoub" in Arabic.&lt;ref name=Aramco&gt;{{cite web|title=Woven Legacy, Woven Language|author=Jane Waldron Grutz|publisher=Saudi Aramco World|date=January–February 1991|accessdate=2007-06-04|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219004053/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199101/woven.legacy.woven.language.htm|archive-date=2007-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] led to a disruption in traditional modes of dress and customs, as many women who had been displaced could no longer afford the time or money to invest in complex embroidered garments.&lt;ref name="Embroidering Identities"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saca|first1=Iman|title=Embroidering Identities: A Century of Palestinian Clothing|date=2006|publisher=THE ORIENTAL INSTITUTE MUSEUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO|isbn=1-885923-49-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; New styles began to appear the 1960s.

==Folk tales==

Traditional storytelling among Palestinians is prefaced with an invitation to the listeners to give blessings to God and the Prophet Mohammed or the Virgin Mary as the case may be, and includes the traditional opening: "There was, in the oldness of time ..." Formulaic elements of the stories share much in common with the wider Arab world, though the rhyming scheme is distinct. There are a cast of supernatural characters: Jinss and Djinns who can cross the Seven Seas in an instant, giants, and ghouls with eyes of ember and teeth of brass.

Traditional Palestinian songs have no set lyrics but rather a set rhythm to them, allowing for improvised folk poetry lyrics. A form of this style of folk singing is [[Ataaba]]; it consists of 4 verses, following a specific form and meter. The distinguishing feature of ataaba is that the first three verses end with the same word meaning three different things, and the fourth verse serves as a conclusion. The Ataaba continues to be performed at weddings and festivals in [[Arab localities in Israel]], the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Performance of Jewish and Arab Music in palestine Today: A Special Issue of the Journal Musical Performance|first1=Amnon|last1=Shiloah|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1997|isbn=978-90-5702064-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

Traditional [[Architecture of Palestine|Palestinian architecture]] covers a vast historical time frame and a number of different styles and influences over the ages. The urban architecture of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] prior to 1850 was relatively sophisticated. While it belonged to greater geographical and cultural context of the [[Levant]] and the [[Arab world]], it constituted a distinct tradition, "significantly different from the traditions of [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] or [[Egypt]]." Nonetheless, the Palestinian townhouse shared in the same basic conceptions regarding the arrangement of living space and apartment types commonly seen throughout the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. The rich diversity and underlying unity of the architectural culture of this wider region stretching from the [[Balkans]] to [[North Africa]] was a function of the exchange fostered by the [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]]s of the [[trade routes]], and the extension of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman rule]] over most of this area, beginning in the early 16th century through until the end of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Fuchsp173&gt;Ron Fuchs in Necipoğlu, 1998, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arch survey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hadid|first1=Mouhannad|title=Architectural styles survey in Palestinian territories|date=2002|publisher=Palestinian National Authority Ministry of Local Government|url=http://www.molg.pna.ps/ecb/studies/architecture/arch.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv

Palestine's history of rule by many different empires is reflected in Palestinian cuisine, which has benefited from various cultural contributions and exchanges. Generally speaking, modern Palestinian dishes have been influenced by the rule of three major Islamic groups: the Arabs, the [[Persian cuisine|Persian]]-influenced Arabs, and the [[Turkey|Turks]].&lt;ref name="CDN"&gt;[http://www.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=1729&amp;ed=115&amp;edid=115 Revisiting our table...] Nasser, Christiane Dabdoub, ''This week in Palestine'', Turbo Computers &amp; Software Co.

The cuisine of the Ottoman Empire, which incorporated Palestine as one of its provinces between 1512 and 1514, was partially made up of what had become by then a rich Arab cuisine. After the [[Crimean War]], many foreign communities (namely the [[Bosnian cuisine|Bosnians]], [[Greek cuisine|Greeks]], [[French cuisine|French]] and [[Italian cuisine|Italians]]) began settling in the area; Jerusalem, Jaffa and Bethlehem were the most popular destinations for these groups.

Palestinian cuisine is divided into three regional groups: the Galilee, West Bank and Gaza area. Cuisine in the Galilee region shares much in common with Lebanese cuisine, due to extensive communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. Galilee inhabitants specialize in producing a number of meals based on the combination of [[bulgur]], spices and meat, known as ''kibbee'' by Arabs. ''Kibbee'' has several variations including it being served raw, fried or baked.&lt;ref name="TWP2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IMEU2&gt;{{cite web|title=How many countries recognize Palestine as a state?|publisher=Institute for Middle East Understanding|date=2006–2007|accessdate=2008-02-27|url=http://imeu.net/news/article0065.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011090548/http://imeu.net/news/article0065.shtml|archivedate=2007-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Musakhan]]'' is a common main dish that originated in the [[Jenin]] and [[Tulkarm]] areas of the northern West Bank.

The cuisine of the Gaza Strip is influenced both by neighboring Egypt and its location on the Mediterranean coast. The staple food for the majority of the inhabitants in the area is fish. Gaza has a major fishing industry and fish is often served either grilled or fried after being stuffed with [[cilantro]], garlic, red peppers, cumin, and then marinated in a mix of [[coriander]], red peppers, cumin, and chopped lemons.&lt;ref name="Haddad"&gt;[http://www.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=1726&amp;ed=115&amp;edid=115 The Foods of Gaza] [[Laila el-Haddad|al-Haddad, Laila]], ''This week in Palestine.

The long history of the Arabic language and its rich written and oral tradition form part of the Palestinian literary tradition as it has developed over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries.

Since 1967, most critics have theorized the existence of three "branches" of Palestinian literature, loosely divided by geographic location: 1) from inside Israel, 2) from the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]], 3) from among the [[Palestinian diaspora]] throughout the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name=Salaita&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scattered like seeds: Palestinian prose goes global|author=Steven Salaita|date=1 June 2003|journal=Studies in the Humanities|accessdate=2007-09-06|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-17848_ITM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From among those Palestinians who became [[Arab citizens of Israel]] after the passage of the Citizenship Law in 1952, a school of resistance poetry was born that included poets like [[Mahmoud Darwish]], [[Samih al-Qasim]], and [[Tawfiq Zayyad]].&lt;ref name=Shahin41/&gt; The work of these poets was largely unknown to the wider Arab world for years because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab governments. This changed after [[Ghassan Kanafani]], another Palestinian writer in exile in Lebanon, published an anthology of their work in 1966.&lt;ref name=Shahin41/&gt; Palestinian poets often write about a sense of loss and existence in the diaspora.&lt;ref name=Shahin41/&gt;

'''Deadheads for Obama''' is the name given to the February 4, 2008 reunion [[concert]] of three former members of the [[Grateful Dead]] at [[The Warfield]] in [[San Francisco]].  The show, performed one day before the [[Super Tuesday]] primary elections, was an act of support for Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]], and featured former Dead members [[Phil Lesh]], [[Bob Weir]], and [[Mickey Hart]], as well as [[John Molo]], [[Jackie Greene]], [[Steve Molitz]], [[Mark Karan]] and [[Barry Sless]].

The show marked the first time Lesh, Weir and Hart had shared the stage since 2004, and was simulcast on [[Iclips.net|the iClips Network]].

Deadheads for Obama is also a 350 member grassroots organization founded in February 2007 through Barack Obama's website; one year before the concert of the same namesake. This group collectively raised more than $150,000 for the Obama campaign.

==Setlist==
After a videotaped introduction by Barack Obama, the band played "[[Playing in the Band]]" into "Brown-Eyed Women", and continued the first set with other Grateful Dead staples "Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo", "New Minglewood Blues", and a cover of "[[Come Together]]" by [[the Beatles]].

A short speech by Phil Lesh was followed by a four-song acoustic second set, featuring more classic Dead songs like "[[Friend of the Devil]]" and "Deal".  Then the band plugged in again to play an extended third set, including New Orleans classic "[[Iko Iko]]" (in honor of [[Mardi Gras]]), and ending with a reprise of the opener, "Playing in the Band", and an encore of "U.S. Blues".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dead.net/features/news/general-news/bob-phil-mickey-and-friends-rock-barack-warfield Lambert, Gary. "Bob, Phil, Mickey and Friends Rock for Barack at the Warfield", Dead.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete setlist was:
* First set: "Playing in the Band", "Brown-Eyed Women", "Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo", "New Minglewood Blues", "Come Together"
* Second set (acoustic): "Deep Elem Blues", "Friend of the Devil", "Deal", "Ripple"
* Third set: "[[China Cat Sunflower]]", "The Wheel", "The Other One", "[[Sugaree]]", "Eyes of the World", "Throwing Stones", "Iko Iko", "Playing in the Band" reprise
* Encore: "U.S. Blues"

==Change Rocks==
Hart, Lesh, and Weir reunited again in support of the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama presidential campaign]], this time joined by Bill Kreutzmann, on October 13, 2008, in the [[Bryce Jordan Center]] at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]], playing a concert called "Change Rocks". [[Warren Haynes]] provided guitar and vocal support for the reunion, and [[Jeff Chimenti]] played keyboards.  The performance was preceded by a set of music by members of [[the Allman Brothers Band]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/10/14/the-dead-reunite-for-obama-at-scorching-penn-state-benefit-gig/ "The Dead Reunite for Obama at Scorching Penn State Benefit Gig", ''Rolling Stone'', October 14, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hYe1qLDbm8FrwN8IFzvqN03-aIPAD93Q8MD81 "Surviving Members of Grateful Dead Rock for Obama", Associated Press, October 14, 2008]{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set list was: "[[Truckin']]", "U.S. Blues", "Help on the Way", "Slipknot!", "Franklin's Tower",
"[[Playing in the Band]]", "[[Dark Star (song)|Dark Star]]", "[[St. Stephen (song)|St. Stephen]]", "Unbroken Chain", "The Other One", "Throwing Stones", and "Playing in the Band" reprise, with an encore of "[[Touch of Grey]]" and "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dead.net/features/news/change-rocks-setlist "Change Rocks: The Setlist" on dead.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential inauguration ball==
On January 20, 2009, the Dead played at one of the 10 official balls for the [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|Inauguration of President Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/01/15/barack-obama-selects-the-dead-for-inauguration-ball-it-was-quite-an-honor/ "Barack Obama Selects the Dead for Inaugural Ball", ''Rolling Stone'', January 15, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.relix.com/Features/Daily_News/The_Dead_Reunite_at_Mid-Atlantic_Inagural_Ball__200901213651.html Greenhuas, Mike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''Demythologization''' as a [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] approach to religious texts seeks to separate cosmological and historic claims from philosophical, ethical and theological teachings. [[Rudolf Bultmann]] (1884-1976) introduced the term ''demythologization'' (in German: ''[[w:de:Entmythologisierung|Entmythologisierung]]'') in this context,&lt;ref&gt;
Rudolf Bultmann, ''New Testament and Mythology and Other Basic Writings'' (1984), p. 3
&lt;/ref&gt;
but the concept has earlier precedents.

== Spinoza's hermeneutic approach to Scripture ==
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|right|142px|[[Baruch Spinoza]]]]
In his 1677 ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] argues that any event in Scripture which is inconsistent with natural laws must be interpreted either as unreliable testimony or as a metaphorical or allegorical representation of a moral teaching. Because the masses are "wholly ignorant of the workings of nature",&lt;ref&gt;6:22&lt;/ref&gt; they are prone to interpret any natural event they can't explain as a miracle, and this "ridiculous way of expressing ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;6:36&lt;/ref&gt; often finds its way into Scripture. Scripture aims not at narrating things in terms of their natural causes, but rather at exciting the "popular imagination" in order to "impress the minds of the masses with devotion."&lt;ref&gt;6:73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore it speaks inaccurately of God and of events, seeing that its object is not to convince the reason, but to attract and lay hold of the imagination. If the Bible were to describe the destruction of an empire in the style of political historians, the masses would remain unstirred.&lt;ref&gt;6:85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In order to correctly interpret scripture we must understand the opinions and judgments of the ancients and learn common "Jewish phrases and metaphors."&lt;ref&gt;6:105&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise we will be prone to "confound actual events with symbolical and imaginary ones."&lt;ref&gt;6:98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many things are narrated in Scripture as real, and were believed to be real, which were in fact only symbolical and imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;6:98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Kant's ''Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone'' ==
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|142px|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]]'s 1793 ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason|Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone]]'' argues that the [[New Testament]] teaches a hermeneutic strategy in which "not scriptural scholarship but the pure religion of reason must be the law's interpreter."&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Part 1, Section 1, “The Christian religion as a natural religion,” as translated by Theodore M. Greene&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jesus] claims that not the observance of outer civil or statutory churchly duties but the pure moral disposition of the heart alone can make man well-pleasing to God (Mt 5:20-48); … that injury done one’s neighbor can be repaired only through satisfaction rendered to the neighbor himself, not through acts of divine worship (Mt 5:24). Thus, he says, does he intend to do full justice to the Jewish law (Mt 5:17); whence it is obvious that not scriptural scholarship but the pure religion of reason must be the law’s interpreter, for taken according to the letter, it allowed the very opposite of all this.&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Part 1, Section 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kant understood the [[Pharisees]] to have interpreted the [[Old Testament]] as a statutory religion, and he claims that the New Testament intends to replace statutory religion with a "moral religion," which combines all duties into a single universal rule, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Part 1, Section 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever, over and above good life-conduct, man fancies that he can do to become well-pleasing to God is mere religious delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Part 2, Section 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Such delusions, Kant argues, must be abandoned to fulfill the New Testament's demand for a rational religion.

== Bultmann's ''New Testament and Mythology'' ==
[[File:Rudolf Bultmann Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|142px|[[Rudolf Bultmann]]]]
The German theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] argues in his 1941 ''New Testament and Mythology'' that it is no longer plausible to demand that Christians accept the "mythical world picture" of the [[New Testament]].&lt;blockquote&gt;We cannot use electric lights and radios and, in the event of illness, avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament and Mythology and Other Basic Writings'' (1984), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;To interpret New Testament mythology in cosmological terms, as a description of the universe, is not plausible. This interpretation must be superseded by an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] interpretation that "discloses the truth of the [[kerygma]] as kerygma for those who do not think mythologically."&lt;ref&gt;p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Can the Christian proclamation today expect men and women to acknowledge the mythical world picture as true? To do so would be both pointless and impossible. It would be pointless because there is nothing specifically Christian about the mythical world picture, which is simply the world picture of a time now past which was not yet formed by scientific thinking. It would be impossible because no one can appropriate a world picture by sheer resolve, since it is already given with one’s historical situation.&lt;ref&gt;p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[American English]] the derby shoe may be referred to as a [[Blucher shoe|blucher]], although technically the blucher is  a different design of shoe where only eyelet tabs (not larger quarters) are sewn onto a single piece vamp. 

In modern colloquial English, the derby shoe may be referred to as "bucks," when the upper is made of [[Buckskin (leather)|buckskin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atailoredsuit.com/mens-dress-shoes-types.html#whitebuck The White Buck Dress Shoe], ATailoredSuit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The derby became a popular sporting and hunting boot in the 1850s. By the turn of the [[20th century fashion|20th century]], the derby had become appropriate for wear in town.&lt;ref&gt;Flusser, Alan. ''Dressing the Man'' [[Harper Collins]], 2002, pg 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eunsan byeolsinje''' is Korea's traditional shamanism ceremony which is selected as the ninth [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property of Korea]] next to [[Ganggang sullae]]. It is performed mainly in eunsanri eunsanmyeon [[Chungcheongnam-do]] Buyeo Korea by a shaman.

==History==
In eunsanmyeon Chungcheongnam-do Buyeo, shaman have a ritual for a mountain spirit every beginning of the year and have a special a ritual for ghosts every other year. There is a mountain in the north of the Eunsan Market about 70–80 meters high and there are a shrine at the south of the mountain. It was started to console the ghosts of the town for the health of local residents. According to the writing of the shrine, Eunsan Province was a battle field in Baekje and the ghosts of soldiers were remained to make an infectious disease and natural disaster. So people in town made the shrine to stop disaster.

==Procedures==
'''Eunsan byeolsinje''' is held every other year. The annual ceremony which is held at Byeolshindang, the shrine, is called Sanje and the other biennial ceremony, Byeolsinje, is much bigger than the Sanje. Once the performance date is determined, the ceremony maintains before and after the main performance. The total ceremony is about ten days but today it is usually 8 days long. It took place at Byeolsindang, the shrine and march the town. 

==Transmission==
Like many other local festivals in Korea, Eunsan byeolsinje also stopped during the era under the colonial administration of imperial Japan and restarted with Korean independence. Currently, Cha Jin-yong, Park Chang-gu, and Hwang Nam-hee were additionally designated as holders of Eunsan byeolsinje and they are preserving and transmitting the play.

The '''Filipino value system''' or '''Filipino values''' refers to the set of [[values (heritage)|values]] or the [[value system]] that a majority of the Filipino have historically held important in their lives. This Philippine values system includes their own unique assemblage of consistent [[ideologies]], [[moral codes]], [[ethics|ethical practices]], [[etiquette]] and [[personal and cultural values|cultural and personal values]] that are promoted by their society. As with any society though, the values that an individual holds sacred can differ on the basis of religion, upbringing and other factors.

As a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly [[Christianity]]) and commercial relationships.&lt;ref name=CAPH&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/philippines/41.htm ''Social Values and Organization''], Philippines, country studies.us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical basis==

Filipino values are, for the most part, centered at maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of "''Hiya''", roughly translated as 'a sense of shame', and "''Amor propio''" or 'self-esteem'.&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chris Rowthorn |author2=Greg Bloom |title=Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaUR07G0yAcC |year=2006 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74104-289-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.&lt;ref name=Didache&gt;Hallig, Jason V. [http://didache.nts.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=277&amp;Itemid ''Communicating Holiness to the Filipinos: Challenges and Needs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015814/http://didache.nts.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=277&amp;Itemid |date=2011-07-20 }}, The Path to a Filipino Theology of Holiness, on pages 2 and 10, http://didache.nts.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the anthropologist Leonardo Mercado, the Filipino worldview is basically 'nondualistic'. Based on his linguistic analyses of Filipino value terms like ''[[loob]]'' (Cebuano ''buot''), he concludes that Filipinos desire harmony, not only in interpersonal relationships, but also with nature and religion, while still remaining nondichotomous.&lt;ref name="FCT"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rolando M. Gripaldo|title=Filipino cultural traits: Claro R. Ceniza lectures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXJe6vKMjroC|year=2005|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-225-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote
|text= "The Filipino wants to harmonize the object and the subject, while at the same time holding both as distinct."
|sign= ''Elements of Filipino Philosophy'' (1974), Leonardo Mercado, [[Divine Word Missionaries|SVD]]
}}

Florentino Timbreza, a cultural philosopher, concludes in his book ''Pilosopiyang Pilipino'' (1982) that Filipino values are based on the significance of the world to man. Life experiences dictate the philosophy of the Filipino, augmented by other sources like proverbs, folk sayings, folk tales, and the like.&lt;ref name="FCT" /&gt;

==Models of the Filipino values==

F. Landa Jocano identified two models of the Filipino value system. The first is the '''exogenous model''' or the '''foreign model''', while the second is the '''indigenous model''' or the '''traditional model'''. The foreign model is described to be a "legal and formal" model. The indigenous model is described as a "traditional and non-formal" model or guide but is deeply embedded in the [[subconscious]] of the Filipinos.&lt;ref name=Didache /&gt;

The foreign model was inherited by Filipinos from [[Western cultures]], particularly from the [[Spaniards]] and the [[United States|Americans]]. An example of a foreign or exogenous influence is [[bureaucracy]] exhibited in the [[government of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Didache /&gt;

==Elements and composition of Filipino values==
Based on studies, surveys, opinions, anecdotes, and other literatures made by experts and researchers in relation to '''Filipino social values''' or '''Filipino core values''', along with the [[Filipino character]] or [[Filipino identity]] of a person or an individual known as the Filipino, the Filipino value system are found to possess inherent key elements.

One can note how ''Hiya'' (propriety/dignity)'', [https://tl.wiktionary.org/wiki/pakikisama Pakikisama]''(companionship/esteem)'','' and ''[[Utang na loob]]''(gratitude/solidarity), are merely '''Surface Values'''—readily seen and observed values exhibited and esteemed by many Filipinos. These three values are considered branches from a single origin—the actual '''Core Value''' of the Filipino Personality—''Kapwa''. It means 'togetherness', and refers to community, or not doing things alone. ''Kapwa'' has two categories, ''Ibang Tao'' (other people) and ''Hindi Ibang Tao'' (not other people). The Surface Values spin off of the Core Value through the '''Pivotal Aspect''' of ''Pakikiramdam,'' or shared inner perception ("Feeling for another").

Other notable key elements or motivations are [[optimism]] about the future, [[pessimism]] with regards to present situations and events, the concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.&lt;ref name="CRVP2"&gt;Talisayon, Serafin. [http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-7/chapter_xiii.htm ''Filipino Values''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417164213/http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-7/chapter_xiii.htm |date=2016-04-17 }}, Chapeter XIII, Teaching Values in the Natural and Physical Sc54654
iences in the Philippines, crvp.orgp&lt;/ref&gt;

The values of Filipinos specifically upholds the following items: solidarity of the family unit, security of the Philippine economy, orientation to small-groups, personalism, the concepts of "''[[loob]]''" or "''[[kalooban]]''" (meaning "what’s inside the self", the "inner-self", or the "actual personal feelings of the self"), existence and maintenance of smooth [[interpersonal relationships]], and the sensing of the feelings or needs of others (known as ''pakikiramdam''). In a larger picture, these values are grouped into general clusters or "macroclusters": namely, the relationship cluster, the social cluster, the livelihood cluster, the inwardness cluster, and the optimism cluster.&lt;ref name="CRVP2"/&gt;

==Enumeration of Filipino values==

=== Human activities ===

This is the shared sense of identity and consciousness of the 'other'. It means treating others with respect and dignity as an equal, not someone below the individual.

=== Family orientation ===

The basic and most important unit of a Filipino's life is the family. Unlike in Western countries, young Filipinos who turn 18 are not expected to move out of their parents' home. When a Filipino's parents are old and cannot take care of themselves, they are cared for in their children's homes and are very rarely brought by their children to Homes for the Aged. The practice of separating the elderly from the rest of the family, while common in Western countries, is often looked down upon in Filipino society. Family lunches with the whole clan with up to 50 people, extending until the line of second cousins, are not unusual. The Filipino puts a great emphasis on the value of family and being close to one's family members.

=== Joy and humor ===

This famous trait is the ability of Filipinos to find humour in everything. It sheds light on the optimism and positivity of Filipinos in whatever situation they are in so as to remain determined in going through struggles or challenges. It serves as a coping technique, the same way a child who has fallen laughs at himself/herself to hide his/her embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pagbabalik-Loob|last = Maggay|first = Melba|date = 1993|journal = Moral Recovery and Cultural Reaffirmation|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flexibility, adaptability, and creativity ===

Studies show that Filipinos often have an aversion to a set of standardised rules or procedures; They are known to follow a "natural clock" or organic sense of time—doing things in the time they feel is right. They are present-oriented: which means that one attends to a task or requirement at the time it is needed and does not worry much about future engagements. This allows the Filipino to adapt and be flexible in doing the tasks at times not bound to a particular schedule or timeframe. This allows them think on their feet and be creative in facing whatever challenge or task they have even when it is already right in front of them.

=== Faith and religiosity ===

The Philippines is approximately 85 percent Christians (mostly Roman Catholics ), 10 percent Muslim, and 5 percent 'other' religions, including the Taoist-Buddhist religious beliefs of Chinese and the 'indigenous' animistic beliefs of some peoples in upland areas that resisted 300 years of Spanish colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Christianity in the Philippines|url = http://www.seasite.niu.edu/crossroads/russell/christianity.htm|website = www.seasite.niu.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reflection of the Filipinos' strong faith in God as seen in their various practices. This includes the numerous church holidays they observe, the customary (and obligatory) Sunday Mass, the individual's basis of their moral standpoints, the influence of the Church on the minds, actions, and opinions of the majority, importance of the Sacraments, praying at almost any possible time of the day, the extreme practices during Holy Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Will these 10 traditional Holy Week practices survive? |work=The Philippine Star |url = http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/2015/04/03/1440221/will-these-10-traditional-holy-week-practices-survive|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ability to survive ===

The Filipinos as a people who have been constantly under the rule of numerous powerful countries has over time, developed a sense of resourcefulness or the ability to survive with whatever they have. They have the extraordinary ability to make something out of almost nothing. If a Filipino was given just a screwdriver, plastic bagseut, and some tape, he would still be able to build a bird tree, especially for the sake of survival, and provided that he be allowed to hunt for some needed surrounding material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Life and Times of the Filipino-American: The Resourcefulness of the Filipino|url = http://filipinoamericanpinay.blogspot.com/2012/07/resourcefulness-of-filipino.html|website = Life and Times of the Filipino-American|date = 2012-07-10|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hard work And Industriousness ===

With resourcefulness comes hard work. Filipinos are very determined and persevering in accomplishing whatever they set their minds to. &lt;blockquote&gt;Filipinos over the years have proven time and time again that they are a people with an industrious attitude. Sadly, this is seen by others as Filipinos being only useful as domestic helpers, working abroad to help their families in the country. This is also present in the country’s workforce particularly the farmers. Even with little support, technological weaknesses and the country’s seasonal typhoons, the Filipino farmer still strives to earn their daily meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASIAN JOURNAL {{!}} The best traits of Filipinos that we should be proud of|url = http://asianjournalusa.com/the-best-traits-of-filipinos-that-we-should-be-proud-of-p10881-67.htm|website = asianjournalusa.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hospitality ===
[[Alien (law)|Foreigners]] who come to visit the Philippines speak of Filipinos going out of their way to help them when lost, or the heartwarming generosity of a Filipino family hosting a visitor in their poverty-stricken home. Meanwhile, most foreigners who attend Filipino gatherings abroad (which are frequently organized for hundreds of reasons) testify to the warmth and friendliness of Filipinos as they experience that feeling of “belongingness.” Indeed, the legendary Filipino hospitality is not limited to the Philippines. It is everywhere wherever there are Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global nation Inquirer: What Filipinos can be proud of|url = http://globalnation.inquirer.net/45875/what-filipinos-can-be-proud-of|website = globalnation.inquirer.net|accessdate = 2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-specific values==

In relation to parenthood, bearing male and female children depends on the preferences of the parents based on the expected roles that each gender would assume once grown up. Both genders are expected to become responsible members of the family and their society. [[Women in the Philippines]] are expected to become caring and nurturing mothers for their own children.&lt;ref name=CCSF&gt;MLY. [http://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Philippine_Studies/event2.html ''Keynote Speech''], City College of San Francisco in the Conference on "''The Filipino Family in the 21st Century: Issues and Challenges''", ccsf.edu, October 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Female Filipinos are also expected to lend a hand in household work. They are even anticipated to offer assistance after being married. On the other hand, [[men in the Philippines|Filipino men]] are expected to assume the role of becoming the primary source of income and financial support of his family.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

'''Gender inequality''' is the idea and situation that [[men]] and [[women]] are not equal. Gender inequality refers to unequal treatment or perceptions of individuals wholly or partly due to their [[gender]]. It arises from differences in [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Gender systems]] are often [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] and hierarchical. Gender inequality stems from distinctions, whether empirically grounded or socially constructed. Women lag behind men in many domains, including education, labor market opportunities and political representation and in pay.

==Natural gender differences==
{{main|Gender differences in humans}}
Natural differences exist between the sexes base on biological and anatomic factors, most notably differing reproductive roles. Biological differences include [[chromosome]]s and [[hormone|hormonal]] differences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Wood, Julia. Gendered Lives. 6th. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a natural difference also in the relative physical strengths (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger than any given woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maughan RJ, Watson JS, Weir J |year=1983 |title=Strength and cross-sectional area of human skeletal muscle |url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/338/1/37.abstract |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=338 |issue=1 |pages=37–49 |pmid=6875963 |pmc=1197179 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frontera, Hughes, Lutz, Evans |year=1991 |title=A cross-sectional study of muscle strength and mass in 45- to 78-yr-old men and women |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/644 |journal =J Appl Physiol |volume=71 |issue=2|pages=644–50 |pmid=1938738|doi=10.1152/jappl.1991.71.2.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Samaras 2007 33–61"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Human body size and the laws of scaling |last= Samaras|first= Thomas|year=2007 |publisher=Nova Science|location=New York|isbn= 978-1-60021-408-0|pages= 33–61|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PCU0RwDI6c4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women live significantly longer than men,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html|title=Life expectancy at birth, Country Comparison to the World|publisher=US [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=n.d.|website=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=12 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not clear to what extent this is a biological difference - see [[Life expectancy#gender differences|Life expectancy]].

{{Main|Gender pay gap}} 
The gender pay gap is the average difference between men's and women's aggregate [[wage]]s or [[salary|salaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-08-01|title=Using education to reduce the wage gap between men and women|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000370|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=412–416|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2011.04.006|issn=1053-5357|last1=Miki|first1=Malul|last2=Yuval|first2=Fany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap is due to a variety of factors, including differences in education choices, differences in preferred job and industry, differences in the types of positions held by men and women, differences in the type of jobs men typically go into as opposed to women (especially highly paid high risk jobs), differences in amount of work experiences, difference in length of the work week, and breaks in employment. These factors resolve 60% to 75% of the pay gap, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women's lower willingness and ability to negotiate salary and [[sexual discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |author=CONSAD Research Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patten, Eileen|website=Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/|title=On Equal Pay Day, key facts about the gender pay gap|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Blau&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francine D.

[[Human capital]] theories refer to the education, knowledge, training, experience, or skill of a person which makes them potentially valuable to an employer. This has historically been understood as a cause of the gendered wage gap but is no longer a predominant cause as women and men in certain occupations tend to have similar education levels or other credentials. Even when such characteristics of jobs and workers are controlled for, the presence of women within a certain occupation leads to lower wages. This earnings discrimination is considered to be a part of pollution theory. This theory suggests that jobs which are predominated by women offer lower wages than do jobs simply because of the presence of women within the occupation. As women enter an occupation, this reduces the amount of prestige associated with the job and men subsequently leave these occupations. The entering of women into specific occupations suggests that less competent workers have begun to be hired or that the occupation is becoming [[deskilling|deskilled]]. Men are reluctant to enter female-dominated occupations because of this and similarly resist the entrance of women into male-dominated occupations.&lt;ref name="Stratification"&gt;Massey, Douglas. "Categorically Unequal: The American Stratification System." NY: Russell Sage Foundation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

The gendered income disparity can also be attributed in part to [[occupational segregation]], where groups of people are distributed across occupations according to ascribed characteristics; in this case, gender.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Occupational gender segregation can be understood {{who|date=October 2012}} to contain two components or dimensions; horizontal segregation and vertical segregation. With horizontal segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as men and women are thought to possess different physical, emotional, and mental capabilities. These different capabilities make the genders vary in the types of jobs they are suited for. This can be specifically viewed with the gendered division between manual and non-manual labor.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} With vertical segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as occupations are stratified according to the power, authority, income, and prestige associated with the occupation and women are excluded from holding such jobs.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

As women entered the workforce in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated based on the amount femininity or masculinity presupposed to be associated with each occupation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Census data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (mail carriers, bartenders, bus drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Based on the census data, women occupy the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]] jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional [[gender role]]s that causes gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, Charles, E. Social Inequality. 6th. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US gender pay gap, by sex, race-ethnicity-2009.png|thumb|330px|Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, by sex, race, and ethnicity, U.S., 2009.&lt;ref name="bls 2009"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“The gender wage gap is an indicator of women’s earnings compared with men’s. It is figured by dividing the average annual earnings for women by the average annual earnings for men.” (Higgins et al., 2014) 
Scholars disagree about how much of the male-female wage gap depends on factors such as experience, education, occupation, and other job-relevant characteristics. Sociologist Douglas Massey found that 41% remains unexplained,&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt; while CONSAD analysts found that these factors explain between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of the raw wage gap.&lt;ref name="CONSAD wage gap"&gt;{{cite web|author1=CONSAD research corp. |title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2015 |date=12 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CONSAD also noted that other factors such as benefits and overtime explain "additional portions of the raw gender wage gap".

The [[glass ceiling]] effect is also considered a possible contributor to the gender wage gap or income disparity. This effect suggests that gender provides significant disadvantages towards the top of job hierarchies which become worse as a person’s career goes on. The term glass ceiling implies that invisible or artificial barriers exist which prevent women from advancing within their jobs or receiving promotions. These barriers exist in spite of the achievements or qualifications of the women and still exist when other characteristics that are job-relevant such as experience, education, and abilities are controlled for. The inequality effects of the glass ceiling are more prevalent within higher-powered or higher income occupations, with fewer women holding these types of occupations. The glass ceiling effect also indicates the limited chances of women for income raises and promotion or advancement to more prestigious positions or jobs. As women are prevented by these artificial barriers, from either receiving job promotions or income raises, the effects of the inequality of the glass ceiling increase over the course of a woman’s career.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, Seth Ovadia and Reeve Vanneman. "Social Forces: The Glass Ceiling Effect." Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] is also cited as a cause for income disparities and gendered [[inequality in the workplace]]. Statistical discrimination indicates the likelihood of employers to deny women access to certain occupational tracks because women are more likely than men to leave their job or the labor force when they become married or pregnant. Women are instead given positions that dead-end or jobs that have very little mobility.&lt;ref name="Burstein, Paul 1994"&gt;Burstein, Paul. "Equal Employment Opportunity: Labor Market Discrimination and Public Policy." Edison, NJ: Aldine Transaction, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Third World countries such as the Dominican Republic, female entrepreneurs are statistically more prone to failure in business. In the event of a business failure women often return to their domestic lifestyle despite the absence of income. On the other hand, men tend to search for other employment as the household is not a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Sherri Grasmuck and Rosario Espinal. "Market Success or Female Autonomy?" Sage Publications, Inc, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender earnings ratio suggests that there has been an increase in women’s earnings comparative to men. Men’s plateau in earnings began after the 1970s, allowing for the increase in women’s wages to close the ratio between incomes. Despite the smaller ratio between men and women’s wages, disparity still exists. Census&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ Census]&lt;/ref&gt; data suggests that women’s earnings are 71 percent of men's earnings in 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, and Reeve Vanneman. The American People Census 2000: Gender Inequality at Work. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gendered wage gap varies in its width among different races. Whites comparatively have the greatest wage gap between the genders. With whites, women earn 78% of the wages that white men do. With African Americans, women earn 90% of the wages that African American men do.

There are some exceptions where women earn more than men: According to a survey on gender pay inequality by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], female workers in the Gulf state of [[Bahrain]] earn 40 percent more than male workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedior.com/hr-portal/recruitment-news/women-earn-less-than-men-across-the-globe.html?c=3052 Women 'earn less than men across the globe'], Vedior, 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) reveals the wage gap between Cambodian women factory workers and other male counterparts. There was a $25 USD monthly pay difference conveying that women have a much lower power and being devalued not only at home but also in the workplace.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/theresa-de-langis/what's-woman-worth-wages-and-democracy-in-cambodia|title=What's a woman worth?: wages and democracy in Cambodia|date=2015-02-01|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional education and careers===
The gender gap also appeared to narrow considerably beginning in the mid-1960s. Where some 5% of first-year students in professional programs were female in 1965, by 1985 this number had jumped to 40% in law and medicine, and over 30% in dentistry and business school.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, Claudia, and Lawrence F. Katz. "On The Pill: Changing the course of women's education." The Milken Institute Review, Second Quarter 2001: p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the highly effective [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was available, women planning professional careers, which required a long-term, expensive commitment, had to "pay the penalty of abstinence or cope with considerable uncertainty regarding pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |last2=Katz |first2=Lawrence F. |year=2002 |title=The Power Of The Pill: Contraceptives And Women's Career And Marriage Decisions |url= |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |page=731 |doi=10.1086/340778|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.6514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control over their reproductive decisions allowed women to more easily make long-term decisions about their education and professional opportunities. Women are highly underrepresented on boards of directors and in senior positions in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161242/http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf|date=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, with reliable birth control, young men and women had more reason to delay marriage. This meant that the marriage market available to any women who "delay[ed] marriage to pursue a career... would not be as depleted. Thus the Pill ''could'' have influenced women's careers, college majors, professional degrees, and the age at marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |year=2006 |title=The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education, And Family |url= |journal=American Economic Review |volume=96 |issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on sexism in science and technology fields have produced conflicting results. Corinne et al. found that science faculty of both sexes rated a male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than an identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corinne |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students |journal=PNAS |volume=109|issue= 41|pages=16474–16479|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109 |pmid=22988126 |pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and Ceci, however, found that science and technology faculty of both sexes "preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles" for tenure-track positions.&lt;ref name="Williams and Ceci STEM sexism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wendy|last2=Stephen|first2=Ceci|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|journal=PNAS|date=28 April 2015|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360–5365|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.abstract|accessdate=30 October 2015|pmid=25870272|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|pmc=4418903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show parents are more likely to expect their sons, rather than their daughters, to work in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field – even when their 15-year-old boys and girls perform at the same level in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;What Lies Behind Gender Inequality in Education? 2015, s.n., S.l.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender inequality in relationships====
Gender equality in relationships has been growing over the years but for the majority of relationships, the power lies with the male.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Hooff|first=Jenny H.|title=Rationalising inequality: heterosexual couples' explanations and justifications for the division of housework along traditionally gendered lines|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now men and women present themselves as divided along gender lines. A study done by Szymanowicz and Furnham, looked at the cultural stereotypes of intelligence in men and women, showing the gender inequality in self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szymanowicz|first=Agata|author2=Adrian Furnham|title=Do intelligent women stay single? Cultural stereotypes concerning the intellectual abilities of men and women|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study showed that females thought if they revealed their intelligence to a potential partner, then it would diminish their chance with him. Men however would much more readily discuss their own intelligence with a potential partner. Also, women are aware of people’s negative reactions to IQ, so they limit its disclosure to only trusted friends. Females would disclose IQ more often than men with the expectation that a real true friend would respond in a positive way. Intelligence continues to be viewed as a more masculine trait, than feminine trait. The article suggested that men might think women with a high IQ would lack traits that were desirable in a mate such as warmth, nurturance, sensitivity, or kindness. Another discovery was that females thought that friends should be told about one’s IQ more so than males. However, males expressed doubts about the test’s reliability and the importance of IQ in real life more so than women. The inequality is highlighted when a couple starts to decide who is in charge of family issues and who is primarily responsible for earning income. For example, in Londa Schiebinger’s book, "Has Feminism Changed Science?", she claims that "Married men with families on average earn more money, live longer and happier, and progress faster in their careers," while "for a working woman, a family is a liability, extra baggage threatening to drag down her career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, statistics had shown that "only 17 percent of the women who are full professors of engineering have children, while 82 percent of the men do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempts in equalizing household work====
Despite the increase in women in the labour force since the mid-1900s, traditional gender roles are still prevalent in American society. Women may be expected to put their educational and career goals on hold in order to raise children, while their husbands work. However, women who choose to work as well as fulfill a perceived gender role of cleaning the house and taking care of the children. Despite the fact that different households may divide chores more evenly, there is evidence that supports that women have retained the primary caregiver role within familial life despite contributions economically. This evidence suggest that women who work outside the home often put an extra 18 hours a week doing household or childcare related chores as opposed to men who average 12 minutes a day in childcare activities.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen, and Jennifer Marshall. Issues of Gender. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; One study by van Hooff showed that modern couples, do not necessarily purposefully divide things like household chores along gender lines, but instead may rationalize it and make excuses.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"/&gt;  One excuse used is that women are more competent at household chores and have more motivation to do them. Another is that some say the demands of the males’ jobs is higher.

There was a study conducted at an "urban comprehensive school". They were asked questions regarding their views in sexual inequality. Many parents were for the equal pay for men and women. They also were in favor for men to help with the housework. In this study, the majority of the people who were interviewed wanted gender equality and more people wants a change in gender roles. Where men stay home, cleans, and cooks while the women can work and help support the family.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Gender roles have changed drastically over the past few decades. In the article, it says that in 1920-1966, there was data recorded that women spent the most time care-tending with the home and family. There was a study made with the gender roles with the males and females, The results showed that as women spend less time in the house, men have taken over the role as the mother. The article also said that women who work spend less time within the house and with their children if they have any. Furthermore, men are taking the roles of women in the homes and its changing as time goes on. Robin A. Douthitt, the author of the article, "The Division of Labor Within the Home: Have Gender Roles Changed?" concluded by saying, "(1) men do not spend significnatly more time with chil- dren when their wives are employed and (2) employed women spend signifi- cantly less time in child care than their full-time homemaker counterparts, over a 10-year period both mothers and fathers are spending more total time with children." (703).{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Gender inequalities in relation to technology====
One survey showed that men rate their technological skills in activities such as basic computer functions and online participatory communication higher than women.  However, it should be noted that this study was a self-reporting study, where men evaluate themselves on their own perceived capabilities.  It thus is not data based on actual ability, but merely perceived ability, as participants' ability was not assessed. Additionally, this study is inevitably subject to the significant bias associated with self-reported data.&lt;ref&gt;Eszter Hargittai, What Causes Variation in Contributing to Participatory Web Sites?&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrary to such findings, a carefully controlled study that analyzed data sets from 25 developing countries led to the consistent finding that the reason why fewer women access and use digital technology is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions and ongoing discrimination with respect to employment, education and income.&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"/&gt; When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions, ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and health services.

=== Property inheritance ===
Many countries have laws that give less inheritance of ancestral property for women compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womanstats.org/substatics/Property%20Rights%20in%20Law%20and%20Practice%20for%20Women_2011tif_wmlogo3.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], {{Quran-usc|4|11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural marginalization ===
Gender inequalities often stem from social structures that have institutionalized conceptions of gender differences.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Marginalization]] occurs on an individual level when someone feels as if they are on the fringes or margins of their respective society. This is a social process and displays how current policies in place can affect people. For example, media advertisements display young girls with easy bake ovens (promoting being a housewife) as well as with dolls that they can feed and change the diaper of (promoting being a mother).

=== Gender stereotypes ===
{{main|Gender stereotypes}}
{{see also|Category:Feminism and the arts}}
Cultural stereotypes, which can dictate specific roles, are engrained in both men and women and these [[stereotype]]s are a possible explanation for gender inequality and the resulting gendered wage disparity. Women have traditionally been viewed as being caring and nurturing and are designated to occupations which require such skills.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} While these skills are culturally valued,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} they were typically associated with domesticity, so occupations requiring these same skills are not economically valued.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Men have traditionally been viewed as the main worker in the home, so jobs held by men have been historically economically valued and occupations predominated by men continue to be economically valued and earn higher wages.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

Gender Stereotypes influenced greatly by gender expectations, different expectations on gender influence how people determine their roles, appearance, behaviors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Annual Review of Psychology Gender Stereotypes|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|volume = 69|pages = 275–298|last=Ellemers|first=Naomi|date=27 September 2017|doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011719|pmid = 28961059}}&lt;/ref&gt; When expectations of gender roles deeply rooted in people's mind, people' values and ideas started to be influenced and leading to situation of stereotypes, which actualize their ideas into actions and perform different standards labelling the behaviors of people. Gender stereotypes limit opportunities of different gender when their performance or abilities were standardizing according to their gender-at-birth, that women and men may encounter limitations and difficulties when challenging the society through performing behaviors that their gender "not supposed" to perform. For example, men may receive judgments when they trying to stay at home and finish housework and allow their wives to go out and work instead, as men are expected to be work outside for earning money for the family.  The traditional concepts of gender stereotypes are being challenged nowadays in different societies and improvement could be observed that men could also be responsible for housework, women could also be construction worker in some societies. It is still a long process when traditional concepts and values have deep-rooted in people's mind, that higher acceptance towards gender roles and characteristics is homely to be gradually developed.

===Biological fertilisation stereotypes===
Bonnie Spanier coined the term hereditary inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=London|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0674005440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her opinion is that some scientific publications depict human fertilization such that sperms seem to actively compete for the "passive" egg, even though in reality it is complicated (e.g. the egg has specific active membrane proteins that select sperm etc.)

===Sexism and discrimination===
Gender inequality can further be understood through the mechanisms of [[sexism]]. [[Discrimination]] takes place in this manner as men and women are subject to prejudicial treatment on the basis of gender alone. Sexism occurs when men and women are framed within two dimensions of social cognition.

Discrimination also plays out with networking and in preferential treatment within the economic market. Men typically occupy positions of power within the job economy. Due to taste or preference for other men because they share similar characteristics, men in these positions of power are more likely to hire or promote other men, thus discriminating against women.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

Starr conducted a study in the US that found that the prison sentences that men serve are on average 63% longer than those that women serve when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history.

In the 2013 [[Academy Awards]], 140 men were nominated for an award, but only 35 women were nominated. No woman was nominated for directing, cinematography, film editing, writing (original screenplay), or original score that year. Since the Academy Awards began in 1929, only seven women producers have won the Best Picture category (all of whom were co-producers with men), and only eight women have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. [[Lina Wertmuller]] (1976), [[Jane Campion]] (1994), [[Sofia Coppola]] (2004), and [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (2012) were the only four women to be nominated for Best Director, with Bigelow being the first woman to win for her film ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''. 77%  of the Academy Awards' voters are male.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"/&gt;

A group of Hollywood actors have launched their own social movement titled #AskMoreOfHim. This movement is built on the basis of men speaking out against sexual misconduct against females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/18/02/harvard-edcast-ask-more-him|title=Harvard Edcast Ask More of Him|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A number of male activists, specifically in the film industry, have signed an open letter explaining their responsibility in the ownership of their actions, as well as calling out the actions of others. The letter has been signed and supported by Friends actor David Schwimmer, shown above, among many others. The Hollywood Reporter published their support saying, “We applaud the courage and pledge our support to the courageous women — and men, and gender non-conforming individuals — who have come forward to recount their experiences of harassment, abuse and violence at the hands of men in our country. As men, we have a special responsibility to prevent abuse from happening in the first place...

== Impact and counteractions ==
Gender inequality and discrimination are argued to cause and perpetuate poverty and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] in society as a whole.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Nicola Jones, Rebecca Holmes, Jessica Espey 2008.

Gender Equity Indices seek to provide the tools to demonstrate this feature of [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Poverty has many different factors, one of which is the gender wage gap.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Women are more likely to be living in poverty and the wage gap is one of the causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html|title=Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many difficulties in creating a comprehensive response.&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Nicola Jones and Rebecca Holmes 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4943&amp;title=gender-politics-social-protection Gender, politics and social protection]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued{{By whom|date=March 2016}} that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) fail to acknowledge gender inequality as a cross-cutting issue.  Gender is mentioned in MDG3 and MDG5: MDG3 measures gender parity in education, the share of women in wage employment and the proportion women in national legislatures.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  These targets are significantly off-track.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Addressing gender inequality through [[social protection]] programmes designed to increase [[Gender equity|equity]] would be an effective way of reducing gender inequality, according to the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI).&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the ODI argue for the need to develop the following in social protection in order to reduce gender inequality and increase growth:&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Community childcare to give women greater opportunities to seek employment
* Support parents with the care costs (e.g. South African child/disability grants)
* Education stipends for girls (e.g. Bangladesh’s Girls Education Stipend scheme)
* Awareness-raising regarding [[gender-based violence]], and other preventive measures, such as financial support for women and children escaping abusive environments (e.g. NGO pilot initiatives in Ghana)
* Inclusion of programme participants (women and men) in designing and evaluating social protection programmes
* Gender-awareness and analysis training for programme staff
* Collect and distribute information on coordinated care and service facilities (e.g. access to [[micro-credit]] and micro-entrepreneurial training for women)
* Developing monitoring and evaluation systems that include sex-disaggregated data
The ODI maintains that society limits governments' ability to act on economic incentives.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

NGOs tend to protect women against gender inequality and [[structural violence]].

During war, combatants primarily target men.  Both sexes die however, due to disease, malnutrition and incidental crime and violence, as well as the battlefield injuries which predominately affect men.&lt;ref&gt;Ormhaug ''et al'' say "In a widely respected study on war mortality in Kosovo, Spiegel and Salama (2000) found that men were 8.9 times more likely to die from war-related trauma than women, which coincides with men being systematically targeted."&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2009 review  of papers and data covering war related deaths disaggregated by gender concluded "It appears to be difficult to say whether more men or women die from conflict conditions overall."&lt;ref name="Ormhaug"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Armed Conflict Deaths Disaggregated by Gender |author=Christin Ormhaug, in collaboration with Patrick Meier and Helga Hernes|publisher=PRIO|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio also depends on the type of war, for example in the [[Falklands War]] 904 of the 907 dead were men.  Conversely figures for war deaths in 1990, almost all relating to civil war, gave ratios in the order of 1.3 males per female.

Another opportunity to tackle gender inequality is presented by modern [[information and communication technologies]].

Given that digital information and communication technologies have the potential to provide access to employment, education, income, health services, participation, protection, and safety, among others ([[ICT4D]]), the natural affinity of women with these new communication tools provide women with a tangible bootstrapping opportunity to tackle social discrimination.

Gender inequality is a result of the persistent discrimination of one group of people based upon gender and it manifests itself differently according to race, culture, politics, country, and economic situation.  It is furthermore considered a causal factor of violence against women.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}   While gender discrimination happens to both men and women in individual situations, discrimination against women is an entrenched, global pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], rape and violence against women and girls is used as a tool of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|title=Rape Epidemic Raises Trauma of Congo War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/world/africa/07congo.html?ref=congothedemocratirepublicof|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  In Afghanistan, girls have had acid thrown in their faces for attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Filins|first=Dexter|title=A School Bus for Shamsia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23school-t.htm|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerable focus has been given to the issue of gender inequality at the international level by organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[World Bank]], particularly in developing countries.  The causes and effects of gender inequality vary geographically, as do methods for combating it.

===Asia===
{{See also|Sex-selective abortion}}
One example of the continued existence of gender inequality in Asia is the "[[Missing women of China|missing girls]]" phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristoff|first=Nicholas D.|title=The Women's Crusade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|date=August 23, 2009|website=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many families desire male children in order to ensure an extra source of income. In China, females are perceived as less valuable for labor and unable to provide sustenance." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Kevin|title=The Missing Girls from China|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Fall 2014 – Winter 2015|volume=36|issue=2|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, gender inequality also reflected in educational aspect in rural China . Gender inequality existed because of gender stereotypes in rural China, families may consider that is useless for girls to acquire knowledge at school because they will marry someone one day and their major responsibility is to take care of housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannum|first=Emily|last2=Kong|first2=Peggy|last3=Zhang|first3=Yuping|title=Family sources of educational gender inequality in rural China: A critical assessment|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=29|issue=5|pages=474–486|doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2009.04.007|pmid=20161037|pmc=2753976|year=2009|url=http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12627}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people have expectations on the gender roles, that considering marriage is the major goals of a girl's life in rural China, gender inequality easily existed to limit the rights and opportunities of women.

=== Cambodia ===
A Cambodian said, "Men are gold, women are white cloth", emphasizing that women had a lower value and importance compared to men.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt; In Cambodia, approximately 15% (485,000 hectares) of land was owned by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asian culture, there is a stereotype that women usually have lower status than men because males carry on the family name and hold the responsibilities to take care of the family. Females have a less important role, mainly to carry out domestic chores, and taking care of husbands and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coedu.usf.edu/zalaquett/mcdp/Asian%20handout.htm|title=Characteristics of  the Traditional Asian Family|website=www.coedu.usf.edu|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also the main victims of  poverty as they have little or no access to education, low pay and low chances owning assets such as lands, homes or even basic items.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt;

In Cambodia, the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MoWA) was formed in 1998 with the role of improving women's overall power and status in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The Global Gender Gap Report put out by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) in 2013 ranks nations on a scale of 0 to 1, with a score of 1.0 indicating full gender equality. A nation with 35 women and 65 men in political office would get a score of 0.538 as the WEF is measuring the gap between the two figures and not the actual percentage of women in a given category. While Europe holds the top four spots for gender equality, with [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] ranking 1st through 4th respectively, it also contains two nations ranked in the bottom 30 countries, [[Albania]] at 108 and [[Turkey]] at 120. The [[Nordic countries|Nordic Countries]], for several years, have been at the forefront of bridging the gap in gender inequality. Every Nordic country, aside from [[Denmark]] who is at 0.778, has reached above a 0.800 score. In contrast to the Nordic nations, the countries of Albania and Turkey continue to struggle with gender inequality. Albania and Turkey failed to break the top 100 nations in 2 of 4 and 3 of 4 factors, respectively. However, despite the disparity, European nations continue to make advances in the many factors that are used to determine a nation's gender gap score.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Western Europe ====
[[Western Europe]], a region most often described as comprising the non-communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylemanual.natgeo.com/home/E/europe-geographical-and-political|title=EUROPE, GEOGRAPHICAL AND POLITICAL - National Geographic Style Manual|website=stylemanual.natgeo.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; has, for the most part been doing well in eliminating the gender gap. Western Europe holds 12 of the top 20 spots on the Global Gender Gap Report for overall score. While remaining mostly in the top 50 nations, four Western European nations fall below that benchmark. [[Portugal]] is just outside of the top 50 at number 51 with score of 0.706 while Italy (71), Greece (81) and Malta (84) received scores of 0.689, 0.678 and 0.676, respectively.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Eastern Europe ====
A large portion of [[Eastern Europe]], a region most often described as the former communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; resides between 40th and 100th place in the Global Gender Gap Report. A few outlier countries include [[Lithuania]], which jumped nine places (37th to 28th) from 2011 to 2013, [[Latvia]], which has held the 12th spot for two consecutive years, Albania and Turkey.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

===India===
{{main|Gender inequality in India}}
India ranking remains low in gender equality measures by the World Economic Forum, although the rank has been improving in recent years.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf 2011 Gender Gap Report] World Economic Forum, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down into components that contribute the rank, India performs well on political empowerment, but is scored near the bottom with China on [[sex selective abortion]]. India also scores poorly on overall female to male [[literacy]] and health rankings. India with a 2013 ranking of 101 out of 136 countries had an overall score of 0.6551, while Iceland, the nation that topped the list, had an overall score of 0.8731 (no gender gap would yield a score of 1.0).&lt;ref name="Global Gender Gap Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Gender Gap Report 2013|url=http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=31 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331190253/http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|archivedate=31 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequalities impact India's sex ratio, women's health over their lifetimes, their educational attainment, and economic conditions. It is a multifaceted issue that concerns men and women alike.

The labor force participation rate of women was 80.7% in 2013.&lt;ref name=undp&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Report for 2012|url=https://data.undp.org/dataset/Table-4-Gender-Inequality-Index/pq34-nwq7|publisher=United Nations Development Project|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Lockwood of the [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, in a 2009 report wrote that female labor participation is lower than men, but has been rapidly increasing since the 1990s. Out of India's 397 million workers in 2001, 124 million were women, states Lockwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India is on target to meet its [[Millennium Development Goal]] of gender parity in education before 2016.&lt;ref name="in.one.un.org"&gt;http://in.one.un.org/task-teams/gender-equality-and-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  UNICEF's measures of attendance rate and Gender Equality in Education Index (GEEI) attempt to capture the quality of education.&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalther, E.

=== United States ===
{{main|Gender inequality in the United States}}
The [[World Economic Forum]] measures gender equity through a series of economic, educational, and political benchmarks.  It has ranked the United States as 19th (up from 31st in 2009) in terms of achieving gender equity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=World Economic Forum|year=2009|volume=Global Gender Gap Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Department of Labor has indicated that in 2009, "the median weekly earnings of women who were full-time wage and salary workers was... 80 percent of men's".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Stats on Women Workers |url=http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |website=U.S. Department of Labor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426194948/http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Justice found that in 2009, "the percentage of female victims (26%) of intimate partner violence was about 5 times that of male victims (5%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Crime Victimization Survey, 2010|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The United States ranks 41st in a ranking of 184 countries on maternal deaths during pregnancy and childbirth, below all other industrialized nations and a number of developing countries"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW 2011 website|url=http://www.cedaw2010.org/index.php/about-cedaw/cedaw-by-the-numbers|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women only represent 20% of members of Congress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Political affiliations and behaviors ====
Existing research on the topic of gender/sex and politics has found differences in political affiliation, beliefs, and voting behavior between men and women, although these differences vary across cultures. Gender is omnipresent in every culture, and while there are many factors to consider when labeling people "Democrat" or "Republican"—such as race and religion—gender is especially prominent in politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croucher|first=Stephen M.|last2=Spencer|first2=Anthony T.|last3=McKee|first3=Connie|date=2014-03-15|title=Religion, Religiosity, Sex, and Willingness to Express Political Opinions: A Spiral of Silence Analysis of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.890001|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying gender and political behavior poses challenges, as it can be difficult to determine if men and women actually differ in substantial ways in their political views and voting behavior, or if biases and stereotypes about gender cause people to make assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditonto|first=Tessa M.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Allison J.|last3=Redlawsk|first3=David P.|date=2013-05-14|title=Gender Stereotypes, Information Search, and Voting Behavior in Political Campaigns|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=335–358|doi=10.1007/s11109-013-9232-6|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, trends in voting behavior among men and women have been proven through research.

Research shows that women in postindustrial countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany primarily identified as conservative before the 1960s; however, as time has progressed and new waves of feminism have occurred, women have become more left-wing due to shared beliefs and values between women and parties more on the left.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|last2=Norris|first2=Pippa|date=2000-01-01|title=The Developmental Theory of the Gender Gap: Women's and Men's Voting Behavior in Global Perspective|journal=International Political Science Review / Revue Internationale de Science Politique|volume=21|issue=4|pages=441–463|jstor=1601598|doi=10.1177/0192512100214007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in these countries typically oppose war and the death penalty, favor gun control, support environment protection, and are more supportive of programs that help people of lower socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voting behaviors of men have not experienced as drastic of a shift over the last fifty years as women in their voting behavior and political affiliations. These behaviors tend to consistently be more conservative than women overall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These trends change with every generation, and factors such as culture, race, and religion also must be considered when discussing political affiliation. These factors make the connection between gender and political affiliation complex due to intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate gender also plays a role in voting behavior. Women candidates are far more likely than male candidates to be scrutinized and have their competence questioned by both men and women when they are seeking information on candidates in the beginning stages of election campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Democrat male voters tend to seek more information about female Democrat candidates over male Democrat candidates. Female Republican voters tend to seek more information about female Republican candidates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For this reason, female candidates in either party typically need to work harder to prove themselves competent more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Challenges to women in politics ====
Overall, [[politics in the United States]] are dominated by men, which can pose many challenges to women who decide to enter the political sphere.  As the number of women participants in politics continue to increase around the world, the gender of female candidates serves as both a benefit and a hindrance within their campaign themes and advertising practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Yu-Kang|date=2014|title=Gender stereotypes as a double-edged sword in political advertising Persuasion effects of campaign theme and advertising style|url=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|doi=10.2501/IJA-33-2-203-234|pmid=|access-date=|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching challenge seems to be that—no matter their actions—women are unable to win in the political sphere as different standards are used to judge them when compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics|last=Parry-Giles|first=Shawn|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in particular that exemplifies varying perceptions between male and female candidates is the way female candidates decide to dress and how their choice is evaluated. When women decide to dress more masculine, they are perceived as being "conspicuous." When they decide to dress more feminine, they are perceived as "deficient."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flicker|first=Eva|date=2013|title=Fashionable (dis-)order in politics: Gender, power and the dilemma of the suit|url=|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|doi=10.1386/macp.9.2.201_3|pmid=|access-date=|volume=9|issue=2|pages=201–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, women in politics are generally expected to adhere to the masculine standard, thereby validating the idea that gender is binary and that power is associated with masculinity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Nickie|date=2014-07-01|title=Doing Gender, Practising Politics: Workplace Cultures in Local and Devolved Government|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=368–380|doi=10.1111/gwao.12042|issn=1468-0432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated by the points above, these simultaneous, mixed messages create a "double-bind" for women. Some scholars go on to claim that this masculine standard represents symbolic violence against women in politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Political knowledge is a second area where male and female candidates are evaluated differently and where political science research has consistently shown women with a lower level of knowledge than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2011-01-01|title=Do Women and Men Know Different Things? Measuring Gender Differences in Political Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=73|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1017/S0022381610000897|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this finding is the argument that there are different areas of political knowledge that different groups consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpini|first=Michael|last2=Keeter|first2=Scott|year=1993|title=Measuring Political Knowledge: Putting First Things First|jstor=2111549|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1179–1206|doi=10.2307/2111549|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this line of thought, scholars are advocating the replacement of traditional political knowledge with gender-relevant political knowledge because women are not as politically disadvantaged as it may appear.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A third area that affects women's engagement in politics is their low level of political interest and perception of politics as a "men's game."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robert G.|date=2005-12-01|title=Religion, Race, and Gender Differences in Political Ambition|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X05050154|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=null|issue=4|pages=577–596|doi=10.1017/S1743923X05050154|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite female candidates' political contributions being equal to that of male candidates, research has shown that women perceive more barriers to office in the form of rigorous campaigns, less overall recruitment, inability to balance office and family commitments, hesitancy to enter competitive environments, and a general lack of belief in their own merit and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawless|first=Jennifer|last2=Fox|first2=Richard|date=2008|title=Why are women still not running for public office?|url=|journal=Issues in Governance Studies|volume=16|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male candidates are evaluated most heavily on their achievements, while female candidates are evaluated on their appearance, voice, verbal dexterity, and facial features in addition to their achievements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Steps needed for change ====
Several forms of action have been taken to combat institutionalized sexism. People are beginning to speak up or "talk back" in a constructive way to expose gender inequality in politics, as well as gender inequality and under-representation in other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who have delved into the topic of institutionalized sexism in politics have introduced the term "undoing gender." This term focuses on education and an overarching understanding of gender by encouraging "social interactions that reduce gender difference."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some feminists argue that "undoing gender" is problematic because it is context-dependent and may actually reinforce gender. For this reason, researchers suggest "doing gender differently" by dismantling [[gender norm]]s and expectations in politics, but this can also depend on culture and level of government (e.g. local versus federal).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another key to combating institutionalized sexism in politics is to diffuse gender norms through "gender-balanced decision-making," particularly at the international level, which "establishes expectations about appropriate levels of women in decision-making positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Maria|last2=Amancio|first2=Ligia|last3=Alves|first3=Helder|date=2013|title=Gender and politics: The relevance of gender on judgments about the merit of candidates and the fairness of quotas|url=|journal=Portuguese Journal of Social Science|doi=10.1386/pjss.12.2.133_1|pmid=|access-date=|volume=12|issue=2|pages=133–149|hdl=10071/14575}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this solution, scholars have started placing emphasis on "the value of the individual and the importance of capturing individual experience." This is done throughout a candidate's political career—whether that candidate is male or female—instead of the collective male or female candidate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Rose|date=2013-03-01|title=A Feminist Scientific Approach to the Analysis of Politics and Gender|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X12000761|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=9|issue=1|pages=110–115|doi=10.1017/S1743923X12000761|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five recommended areas of further study for examining the role of gender in U.S. political participation are (1) realizing the "intersection between gender and perceptions"; (2) investigating the influence of "local electoral politics"; (3) examining "gender socialization"; (4) discerning the connection "between gender and political conservatism"; and (5) recognizing the influence of female political role models in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Richard L.|date=2011-03-01|title=Studying Gender in U.S. Politics: Where Do We Go from Here?|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X10000589|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=7|issue=1|pages=94–99|doi=10.1017/S1743923X10000589|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that gender is intricately entwined in every societal institution, gender in politics can only change once gender norms in other institutions change, as well.

'''''Genroku bunka''''' or '''Genroku culture''' is the [[culture]] of the early [[Edo period]] (1603–1867), especially the [[Genroku]] era (1688–1704). Known as a period of luxurious display, the arts were increasingly patronized by a growing and powerful [[merchant]] class.

== Arts ==
[[File:Beauty looking back.jpg|thumb|''Beauty Looking Back'', by [[Hishikawa Moronobu]]]]
It is generally felt{{By whom|date=July 2010}} that the Genroku era marks the high point of Edo period culture. Two representative artists of Genroku culture are [[Rimpa school]] artists [[Ogata Kōrin]] and [[Hishikawa Moronobu]], who is regarded as the founder of [[Ukiyo-e]]. The term “Rimpa” (琳派) is an amalgamation of the last syllable of “Kōrin”. [[Torii Kiyonobu I]] was another Ukiyo-e artist.

== Novels and poetry ==
The main elements of the emerging bourgeois culture were brought to their first flowering in [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]], in the area called [[Kamigata]]. Examples are the [[bunraku|jōruri]] and [[kabuki]] plays of [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], the [[Ukiyozōshi]] of [[Ihara Saikaku]], and the poetic essays and [[haiku]] of [[Matsuo Bashō]].

== Kabuki ==
[[Aragoto]]-style actor [[Ichikawa Danjūrō I]], [[wagoto]]-style actor [[Sakata Tōjūrō I]], and [[onnagata]] actor [[Yoshizawa Ayame I]] are famous kabuki actors of the Genroku era.

[[File:The Great Seal of Scotland under HM Elizabeth II.jpg|thumb|350px|The Great Seal of Scotland under [[Elizabeth II]] in red [[beeswax]].]]

The '''Great Seal of Scotland''' ({{lang-gd|Seala Mòr na h-Alba}}) allows the monarch to authorise official documents without having to sign each document individually. Wax is melted in a metal mould or matrix and impressed into a wax figure that is attached by cord or ribbon to documents that the monarch wishes to make official. The earliest [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] impression, in the Treasury of [[Durham Cathedral]], is believed to be the Great Seal of [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]] and dates to 1094.

==History==
The [[Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor]] had the custody of the King's Seal. &lt;ref&gt;See list for years AD1057-1794, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–82 in  "A political index to the histories of Great Britain and Ireland" by Robert Beatson: https://archive.org/stream/apoliticalindex02beatgoog#page/n88/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly, the continuation of the Great Seal of Scotland was guaranteed by the [[Treaty of Union]] which provided that "a Seal in Scotland after the Union be alwayes kept and made use of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have usually passed the Great Seal of Scotland, and which only concern Offices, Grants, Commissions, and private Rights within that Kingdom". Hence, the [[Scotland Act 1998]] refers to the current seal as "the seal appointed by the Treaty of Union to be kept and made use of in place of the Great Seal of Scotland". Nevertheless, the seal is still commonly referred to as the Great Seal of Scotland.

Section 12 of the [[Treason Act 1708]], still in force today, makes it [[treason]] in Scotland to counterfeit the seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Ann/7/21/section/XII|title=Treason Act 1708|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the Great Seal is a responsibility of the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]]. The reverse of the seal shows the monarch on horseback, but is not changed from reign to reign—the current version is that engraved in 1911 for the accession of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The obverse is inscribed "ELIZABETH II D G BRITT REGNORVMQVE SVORVM CETER REGINA CONSORTIONIS POPULORUM PRINCEPS F D" and the figure on it is the same as on the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;The inscription is abbreviated Latin for "Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God of the Britains and of Her Other Kingdoms Queen, Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, Defender of the Faith". See [[Great Seal of the Realm]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Seal is administered by the ''Keeper of the Great Seal'', one of the [[Great Officers of State]]. From 1885 this office was held by the [[Secretary for Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/48-49/61/section/8/enacted|title=Secretary for Scotland Act 1885|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; later the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. It transferred in 1999 to the [[First Minister of Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;Scotland Act 1998, section 45(7)&lt;/ref&gt; whose place in the [[order of precedence in Scotland]] is determined by his or her office as Keeper of the Great Seal. In practice the Seal is in the custody of the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland, who has been appointed as Deputy Keeper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9112">An [[urban legend]] falsely stating that government-sponsored refugees receive more monetary support from the government than a country's own pensioners originated in Canada in 2004 and has since spread to other countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].

==Canadian origin==

This urban myth has its origins in a 2004 ''[[Toronto Star]]'' article. On March 11, 2004, the ''Toronto Star'' published an article about the resettlement of a group of refugees from [[Somalia]] to [[Hamilton, Ontario]].  The article focused on the Canadian government's new strategy to divert immigrant and refugee settlement away from the most popular destinations of [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Vancouver]].  The article also described the support that the Somali refugees would receive from the [[Government of Canada]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A single person receives $1,890 from the federal government as start-up allowance, along with $580 monthly social assistance, depending on how soon the person is able to find employment. They also each receive a night lamp, table, a chair and a single bed from the government.&lt;ref&gt;Keung, N. (2004, Mar 11). New refugee plan eyes small cities: Newcomers settle with old friends. ''Toronto Star''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 12, the day following the publication of the article, Nicholas Keung, the reporter who wrote the original article, received a "polemic" e-mail from a reader.&lt;ref name="Sellar, D. 2004"&gt;Sellar, D. (2004, Nov 27). Can we dispel this urban myth? Toronto Star, p. H.06.&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the e-mail mistakenly concluded that refugees receive a monthly allowance from the federal government greater than the monthly allowance received by pensioners. This e-mail was also copied to 100 other recipients.  When the reporter tried to respond to the e-mail to correct the mistake, he found that the address no longer existed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sellar, D. (2004, Nov 27). Can we dispel this urban myth? ''Toronto Star'', p. H.06.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, a [[letter to the editor]] appeared in the ''Toronto Star'' in response to Keung's article.  The letter stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think the effort to resettle refugees in smaller communities is an excellent effort. These refugees may find it easier to integrate into a smaller community especially if accompanied by some of their compatriots. I also find it interesting that the federal government provides a single refugee with a monthly allowance of $1,890 and each can also get an additional $580 in social assistance for a total of $2,470. This compares very well to a single pensioner who after contributing to the growth and development of Canada for 40 years can only receive a monthly maximum of $1,012 in old age pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement. Maybe our pensioners should apply as refugees?&lt;ref&gt;Pay pensioners same as refugees? (2004, Mar 12). ''Toronto Star''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Toronto Star'' published this letter without checking the facts or the original article for clarification.&lt;ref name="Sellar, D. 2004"/&gt;

Following the publication of the letter to the editor and the distribution of the forwarded e-mail, the ''Toronto Star'' was bombarded with e-mails from readers who felt that something should be done to ensure that pensioners received their fair due by the government.  After investigating the matter and realizing that a mistake had been made, the [[ombudsman]] of the paper published an article on November 27, 2004, correcting the conclusion that refugees received more than pensioners. "In hindsight, the ombud now wishes he'd issued a speedy clarification to help set the record straight", he wrote. "But with information (and misinformation) moving at a warp speed on the Internet, I doubt there was a silver bullet for the problem".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This apology and correction of the mistake had little impact on the circulation of the newly born urban myth.  The same letter to the editor appeared with minor alterations in over 50 newspapers, online newsletters, blogs, and discussion forums in the next three years.  Six newspapers printed the same letter with slight alterations more than once on different dates and from different authors.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Alberni Valley Times]]'' printed the letter on Jan 13, 2006, and Jun 28, 2006. The ''[[Barrie Advance]]'', ''[[Midland-Penetanguishine Mirror]]'', and ''[[Orillia Today]]'' published the letter first on Feb 11, 2005, and again on Jul 7, 2006. The facts of the letter were corrected by another reader whose letter was published by all three newspapers on Jul 14, 2006. The ''[[Welland Tribute]]'' published the letter on Jan 28, 2005, and again on Aug 12, 2006. A local member of parliament corrected the facts in a letter which was published on Aug 18, 2006. The letter was published three times by the ''[[Windsor Star]]'': on Mar 20, 2004; Mar 24, 2006; and on Aug 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately; Citizenship and Immigration Canada published an online fact sheet on the issue in November 2006 to try to counter the spread of the false information.&lt;ref&gt;Citizenship and Immigration Canada. (2006, Nov 22, 2006). Just the facts: financial assistance for refugees from [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=105&amp;t=11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian government response==
&lt;ref name="www.cic.gc.ca"&gt;See [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=105&amp;t=11 http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=105&amp;t=11]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] dismissed this rumour stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Refugees don't receive more financial assistance from the federal government than Canadian pensioners. A letter to the editor of a Canadian newspaper contained this incorrect information. In it, a one-time, start-up payment provided to some refugees in Canada was mistaken for an ongoing, monthly payment. Unfortunately, although the newspaper published a clarification, the misleading information had already spread widely over e-mail and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/facts/aid.asp http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/facts/aid.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no indication that this has had any impact as the letter has continued to appear on the Internet and the original email has been altered in some cases by replacing the Canadian context with an American one.&lt;ref name="snopes.com"&gt;See [http://www.snopes.com/politics/immigration/refugees.asp http://www.snopes.com/politics/immigration/refugees.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; Many conservative politicians and commentators, however, have embraced this urban legend in a general sense.

==Appearance in Australian media==
In 2008, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] program ''[[Media Watch (TV series)|Media Watch]]'' documented several appearances of the hoax in [[Australia]]'s mainstream media, beginning with ''[[The Cairns Post]]'' which published letters to the editor containing the claims, and using the same figures as the original Canadian email, in August 2007 and February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2191987.htm Viral emails in Queensland 1], ''[[Media Watch (TV series)|Media Watch]]'' ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC1]]), 17 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ''Media Watch'' story, the same letters appeared two months later in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' in [[Brisbane]] and ''[[The West Australian]]'' in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2216729.htm Does no-one listen to Media Watch?], ''[[Media Watch (TV series)|Media Watch]]'' ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC1]]), 14 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, 2008, [[2GB]] [[Talk radio|talkback radio]] host [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] read the email on air, and was critical of ''Media Watch'' when the program contacted him to advise him of the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2229663.htm Viral Overload], ''[[Media Watch (TV series)|Media Watch]]'' ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC1]]), 28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Australia|Australian government]]'s [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)|Department of Immigration and Citizenship]] responded to a letter in the ''[[Sunraysia Daily]]'', drawing attention to the email's Canadian origins, and stating that benefits paid to refugees were on the same basis and at the same rate as those to any Australian resident.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Sandi: [http://www.immi.gov.au/media/letters/letters08/le08003.htm Refugees not paid more than pensioners - hoax email], [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia)]], 21 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in UK media==
In 2012 a version of the letter started circulating on Facebook, in the form of an open letter to "Prime Minister the RT HON. David Cameron MP".

'''Jean Despres''' (1903–1988) was a [[perfume]] industry businessman, known for his work with [[Coty, Inc.]]

The French-born Jean Despres came to [[New York City|New York]] in 1921 working for Coty Inc. Starting as a shipping clerk, he went on to become a travelling salesman, covering thousands of miles on the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] across America to sell Coty [[perfume]]s and gift sets.  He soon became a sales manager, and in 1942 was appointed [[Executive Vice President]] of Coty, Inc.  He held this position for more than 25 years when [[Pfizer]] purchased Coty in 1968.

Coty, Inc., was a French perfume company created by wealthy[[François Coty]], proprietor of ''[[Le Figaro]]'', the French daily newspaper headquartered on the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]], [[France]] and owner of numerous chateaux and villas in France and Corsica. Coty died in 1934.   Jean Despres led Coty in New York with Philippe Cortney, brother-in-law of Mrs.Coty-Cotnareanu. He founded the Fragrance Foundation in New York, for the perfume industry, serving as its president. When he retired he appointed Anette Greene. He was a founder of the Toilet Goods Association Inc., [[Washington, D.C.]] and served as its president in the 1960s, attending its annual meetings until 1987, a year before his death.

With the expansion of [[department stores]] in the 1930s and 1940s, he created "in-store" displays and "in-store" merchandising staff, which evolved into the cosmetics counters of today.

He was a founding member of the [[Coty American Fashion Critics' Awards]], along with Grover Whalen, created to encourage and honor American talent and American [[fashion designer]]s.  The awards presentation ceremony initially took place at the Metropolitan Club (where he was a member for 50 years) subsequently moved to  the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and eventually held at Alice Tully Hall, [[Lincoln Center]]. He joined the New York Athletic Club when it opened in 1924, was a director of the French Hospital in New York City, of Coty International, the French-American Chamber of Commerce, Compagnie de St. Gobain and Lilly Dache, Inc., a Chevalier of the Confrerie des Chevaliers de Tastevin, and resident of New York City, Poundridge, NY, Delray Beach, Florida and Meudon, France. In the 1940s he became an American Citizen.

Despres married [[Hatmaking|milliner]] and fashion designer [[Lilly Daché]] in [[Palm Beach, Florida]] on March 13, 1931, a happy, loving  marriage for more than 53 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18483">'''Korean beauty standards''' are a distinct feature of [[Korean culture]]. In 2015, [[South Korea]] became the only Eastern Asian country (among many European and American countries like [[Brazil]], [[US]], [[Italy]], [[Colombia]], and others) that entered into the top 10 "countries with the highest rate of cosmetic surgeries" in the world based on the global survey by ISAPS (the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISAPS International Survey on Aesthetic/Cosmetic Procedures Performed in 2015 {{!}} isaps.org |url = https://www.isaps.org/Media/Default/global-statistics/2016%20ISAPS%20Results.pdf|website = isaps org }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of Korean [[beauty]] criteria include slim figures, a small face, V-shaped jaw, [[double eyelid surgery|double eyelids]] that exemplify innocence, [[aegyo-sal]] (making the under eye bags puffy), small lips, straight eyebrows, large eyes and flawless skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Plastic Surgery in South Korea {{!}} Seoul TouchUp|url = https://www.seoultouchup.com/plastic-surgery-in-korea/|website = Seoul TouchUp {{!}} Korean Plastic Surgery Clinics + Trips|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean beauty standards have varied influences, and [[K-pop]] is one of the biggest impacts. K-pop has become globalized and exposed around the world; aside from the music, the physical appearance of idols portray have impacted the beauty standards in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unrealistic Beauty Standards: Korea's Cosmetic Obsession|url = http://seoulbeats.com/2015/03/unrealistic-beauty-standards-koreas-cosmetic-obsession/|website = seoulbeats.com|accessdate = 2015-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural pressure  == 
Korean students are not allowed to wear [[make-up]] and jewellery in school. Students, especially girls, have low self-esteem about their appearance and are eager to be more beautiful than others. Some decide to have cosmetic surgery to change their facial features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = For many South Koreans, beauty standards represent a cultural struggle|url = https://thevarsity.ca/2017/03/05/for-many-south-koreans-beauty-standards-represent-a-cultural-struggle/|website = thevarsity ca|accessdate = 2017-03-05|first = Eugene Carol Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent ‘official’ statistic put the percentage of Koreans undergoing cosmetic surgery in 2008 at around 20% among young girls. This is significant as it shows how popular cosmetic surgery is in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Ruth|last2=Elfving-Hwang|first2=Joanna|date=2012-06-01|title=Gender, Globalization and Aesthetic Surgery in South Korea|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1357034X12440828|journal=Body &amp; Society|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=58–81|doi=10.1177/1357034X12440828|issn=1357-034X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies require a photo, height, and even family backgrounds of the applicants as part of the hiring process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stress dominates every aspect of life in South Korea|url = https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/generation-emigration/stress-dominates-every-aspect-of-life-in-south-korea-1.2837362|website =www.irishtimes.com|accessdate = 2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Korean women are more critical of their body image, many are not satisfied with how they present themselves. There is low-self esteem and less satisfaction in comparison to women from the United States based on the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1077727X06286419 | volume=34 | title=Cross-Cultural Comparisons of Appearance Self-Schema, Body Image, Self-Esteem, and Dieting Behavior Between Korean and U.S. Women | journal=Family and Consumer Sciences Research Journal | pages=350–365 | last1 = Jung | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauty is often seen as a means for socioeconomic success in the rapidly modernized and post-war [[economy of South Korea]], which has seen a sluggish growth rate for jobs after its economic boom period. This has left Korea with a highly [[Skilled worker|skilled]] and educated workforce to compete for a short supply of job opportunities and chances for [[upward social mobility]]. Koreans view investments in beauty such as cosmetic products, services and medical beauty treatments such as plastic surgery, dermatology, and cosmetic dentistry as a means of [[cultural capital]] to achieve an edge over peers for social and economic advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Why is plastic surgery so popular in South Korea?|url = https://myseoulsecret.com/why-is-plastic-surgery-popular-korea/| website = My Seoul Secret - Korean Plastic Surgery Trip Advisor |accessdate = 2017-10-26|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beauty products==
{{main|Cosmetics in Korea}}
Women in South Korea spend more money on cosmetics than women in any other Asian country. In 2015, South Korea exported more than 2.64 billion dollars of cosmetic goods. It is much higher than in 2014 where they exported around 1.91 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35408764|title=The key ingredients of South Korea's skincare success|last=Arthur|first=Golda|date=2016-01-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most popular products used in Korean are BB (blemish balm) creams, CC (color correction) creams, serums, essences, ampoules, sea weed face masks, and scrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.db07.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE%7CA460483622&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=lincclin_ecc&amp;it=r&amp;p=GRGM&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1|title=Asian Beauty Standards and Products Make Way for Innovation and Influence Markets in the West|last=|first=|date=|website=go.galegroup.com.db07.linccweb.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean beauty products contain ingredients not commonly found in Western products such as snail extract. In 2011 BB cream hit the shelves in America, which was previously exclusively used in Korea had a massive effect. In 2014, the US market for BB cream was around 164 million dollars.

A massive difference between American and Korean beauty is how they achieve beauty. Americans mostly have a three-step beauty regime which includes cleansing, tone, and moisturization. Koreans on the other hand have a ten step beauty regime which includes makeup remover and oil cleanser, water-based cleanser, exfoliation, toner, essences, serums, booster and ampoules, sheet masks, eye cream, moisturizer, and lastly [[Sunscreen|sun protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.korean.com.ph/skin-care-routine/|title=Korean Skin Care Routine|last=|first=|date=|website=Korean|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian cosmetics are gaining an increasing amount of success in the beauty industry. The Euromonitor International predict that by the year of 2019, around 80% of global [[Skin care|skincare]] revenue will come from Asia. At the moment there is more Asian beauty products in the West specifically from East Asia, especially South Korea and Japan.

==Tattoos in Korea==

[[Tattoo|Tattoos]] are frowned upon in Korea. There is a tattoo movement but it is relatively small. The tattoo movement remains underground since it is a small movement. Most of the people you see with tattoos are artists, musicians, gangsters, and foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eatyourkimchi.com/tattoos-in-korea/|title=TL;DR - Tattoos in Korea - Eat Your Kimchi|date=2012-06-27|work=Eat Your Kimchi|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tattoos are not allowed on Korean television. If someone with tattoos is on television they are asked to cover up the tattoos with clothes such as a long sleeve shirt. They will even [[Censorship|blur out]] the tattoos if they can visually see them.

For someone in Korea to legally (official certified) give tattoos in Korea they must be a doctor. A doctor is the only legal person to give tattoos to the general public.

Most tattoo parlors are not advertised to the general public in a straightforward manner like a neon sign saying "tattoos here". Most of the time, a person must be in contact with someone who knows where to find a tattoo artist. Most tattoo parlors are in apartment buildings. The apartment buildings would most often have sterilization machine and clean leather seats. The few places that advertise themselves to the public have a similar setup but are more open in the eye of the public. These sites often get [[Police raid|raided]] by the police, get expensive [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], and are even forced to close down. You can also find travelling tattoo artists who are more likely go to the clients’ house or have the client come to their house.

== Plastic surgery in Korea ==
[[Plastic surgery]] in Korea is not only socially accepted but estimates have shown that one in three South Korean women between the age of 19 and 49 have had at least one surgery. Double eyelid surgery (also known as blepharoplasty) is the most common procedure, with which an eyelid crease is created to make the eye look bigger. This type of surgery or rhinoplasty is typically given as a high school [[graduation]] gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/about-face|title=About Face : Why is South Korea the world’s plastic-surgery capital?|last=Marx|first=Patricia|date=March 23, 2015 |website=https://www.newyorker.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the differences in the facial bone structure of Asians, who have a wider, flatter facial bone structure than their western counterparts, facial bone contouring surgeries are extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Park|first=Sanghoon|title=Why Facial Bone Contouring Surgery?: Backgrounds|date=2017-06-14|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-10-2726-0_1|work=Facial Bone Contouring Surgery|pages=3–6|publisher=Springer Singapore|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-2726-0_1|isbn=9789811027253|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; V-line surgery (jaw and chin reduction) and cheekbone (zygoma) reduction surgeries are used to change the [[Facial Contouring|facial contour]]. Most celebrities are required to undergo these surgeries to trim the cheekbones, jaw and chin to create an oval shaped face which is considered to be the Korean standard of facial beauty. 

With the rise in social acceptance of plastic surgery, shows like “LET ME IN” where complete surgery makeovers are given to unfortunate participants like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJjMkMiM0og&amp;feature=youtu.be Huh Ye Eun] who have suffered due to deformities, are transformed and given a new lease of life. Shows like those have spread the popularity of Korean plastic surgery worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Column/view?articleId=140726|title=“Let Me In”|last=Soelistyo|first=Liliek|date=September 20, 2016|work=Korea.net|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea has also seen an increasing influx of people wanting to have facial bone contouring surgeries due to the advanced techniques and clinical expertise of the Korean surgeons. Various advances in facial bone contouring surgeries like the T-osteotomy technique&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Tae Sung|last2=Kim|first2=Hye Young|last3=Kim|first3=Tak Ho|last4=Lee|first4=Ji Hyuck|last5=Park|first5=Sanghoon|date=March 2014|title=Contouring of the Lower Face by a Novel Method of Narrowing and Lengthening Genioplasty|url=https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006534-201403000-00013|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|language=en|volume=133|issue=3|pages=274e–282e|doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000438054.21634.4a|issn=0032-1052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Tae Sung|last2=Kim|first2=Hye Young|last3=Kim|first3=Takho|last4=Lee|first4=Ji Hyuck|last5=Park|first5=Sanghoon|date=October 2014|title=Importance of the Chin in Achieving a Feminine Lower Face|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00001665-900000000-98482|journal=The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery|pages=1|doi=10.1097/scs.0000000000001096|issn=1049-2275}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first published book on facial bone contouring surgeries further illustrates the advanced surgery methods used by Korean surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004601615|title=Facial bone contouring surgery : a practical guide|date=2017|publisher=Springer|others=Park, Sanghoon,|isbn=9789811027260|location=Singapore|oclc=1004601615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Korean beauty standards v.s. Chinese beauty standards ==
{{See also|Chinese ideals of female beauty}}
For the well-known Korean beauty standards, the first things that come into the public's mind would probably be pale skins, small face, and slim figures. However, these days in China, the beauty trend is also known as having the skin "not only be pale, but as white as possible", "ideally small face which is e dan lain 鵝蛋臉 (translated into shaped like an upside down goose egg)", and with slim bodies "hopefully tall with long legs, small feet and a [[Pippa Middleton]] style bottom".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.englishfirst.com/esl-jobs/chinese-beauty-standards/|title=Chinese beauty standards - English First|date=2018-06-15|work=English First|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Korean and Chinese beauty standards may sound quite similar, some details of these categories can still help to distinguish the differences between Koreans and Chinese easily. First of all, contemporary Korean beauty standards of eye makeup have shifted from traditional "sexy" [[cat eye]] to a "cuter" and more innocent puppy eye. The point of makeup is to "purposefully create puffy under eyes, which are called the aegyo-sal (translated into the baby fat under the eye)". Some people even tried to do plastic surgery for it. According to Allure, "People think it makes your eyes look brighter and more youthful".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allure.com/story/korean-beauty-trends|title=3 Korean Beauty Trends I'm Dying to Try|last=Nast|first=Condé|work=Allure|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative Korean idol for the puppy eyes can be [[Chou Tzu-yu]] from Twice under the JYP entertainment.

On the other hand, big and cute eyes are also popular among the Chinese beauty trends. However, since "50% of the Chinese girls have single eyelids, which they consider unattractive",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://martalivesinchina.wordpress.com/2017/08/07/beauty-standards-in-china/|title=Beauty standards in China|date=2017-08-07|work=Marta lives in China|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese girls tend to do eye surgery or use makeup techniques to make their eyes look as large as possible. For eye makeup, Chinese women tend to use darker eyeliners, such as black or dark brown, to exaggerate their eyes, whereas the Korean girls tend to pursue a more natural eye makeup by using lighter color eyeliners to create dedicated eyes. Moreover, Chinese beauty trends also introduce the puppy eyes as the Wo Chan 臥蟬 (translated into lying silkworm) to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.backchina.com/blog/250647/article-233494.html|title=卧蚕眼，颜值超凡！ - kylelong的日志|website=www.backchina.com|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known as a 4 to 7 millimeter puff that lies under the under eyelashes that look like a silkworm, which make the girls look cute and sweet when they smile. According to the Chinese traditional [[face reading]], the people with Wo Chan臥蟬 are born to have good lives with good fortunes for their relationships and business.

Having a slim figure is probably one of the most important part in both Korean and Chinese beauty standards. However, the ways the idols from these two countries to keep fit are very different. The famous Korean singer IU under Leon entertainment is well-known for her [[Dieting|diet]] plan, which she only has "one apple for breakfast, one sweet potato for lunch, and a cup of protein for dinner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thekoreandiet.com/iu-diet-weight-loss/|title=The IU diet and her weight loss explained - The Korean Diet|date=2017-06-05|work=The Korean Diet|access-date=2018-10-29|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though she is already known to the public as slim and tiny; only 162 centimeters tall and weighing around 45 kilograms, before important events, she would drink 3 liters of waters for 5 days straight to make her face look small on the 7th day. (6) "And on the seventh day, you are basically a [[skeleton]]," she emphasized, adding that "this way, you can go from thin to skeleton-skinny".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mnews.joins.com/article/22121703?IgnoreUserAgent=y#home|title=IU Reveals Her "Skeleton-skinny Diet Regime"|date=2017-11-16|work=JoongAng Ilbo|access-date=2018-10-29|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; To look skinny on TV, the Korean idols would try all kinds of diets to keep their faces small and legs slim, which starts a trend for the girls all around Korean to follow these diet plans in order to be called "skinny and beautiful".

On the other hand, a famous Chinese actress Zheng Shuang 鄭爽 is known for her skinny zombie-like body, who is 168 centimeters tall but only weighs around 37 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohwonews.com/125182/|title=1.68米鄭爽體重只剩37公斤，曝女星瘦成殭屍的背後內幕 {{!}} OHWO新聞|website=www.ohwonews.com|language=zh-TW|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese beauty standards, women should be as skinny as possible where people can see their bones. However, instead of eating less, most of the Chinese actresses chose to not eat at all or only eat 7 grains of rice one day to lose weight. One of the trends that happened a few years ago was called the [[A4 paper|A4]] waist challenge, or the ant waist challenge, which the women hold up sheets of paper and take selfies - they "win" if the paper entirely obscures their waist, and the standard paper size is only {{Convert|21|cm|}} across."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35892789|title=Why would anyone take the A4 skinny waist challenge?|date=2016-03-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film about the Noh theater, ''Gendai no No'' (''Modern Noh''), which was begun by the director during a break in the shooting of ''Ran'', but was abandoned after about fifty minutes were filmed, is being completed according to Kurosawa's script and notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-2682 |title=Unfinished Kurosawa Film to be Unveiled in 2010|author=Jason Gray |date=2008-03-03 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="involvement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akirakurosawa.info/other-movies-involving-kurosawa |title=Other Movies with Kurosawa's Involvement&amp;nbsp;— Akira Kurosawa Information |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As producer===
Note: Data for the remainder of this filmography is derived primarily from the complete filmography created by Kurosawa's biographer, Stuart Galbraith IV,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=651–751}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplemented by [[IMDB]]'s Kurosawa page.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0000041|Akira Kurosawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the following films that Kurosawa directed, he also received a production credit:
* ''Stray Dog'' (associate producer)
* ''Throne of Blood'' (co-producer)
* ''The Lower Depths'' (producer)
* ''The Hidden Fortress'' (co-producer)
* ''The Bad Sleep Well'' (co-producer)
* ''Yojimbo'' (associate producer)
* ''Sanjuro'' (associate producer)
* ''High and Low'' (associate producer)
* ''Red Beard'' (associate producer)
* ''Dodesukaden'' (executive producer and producer)
* ''Kagemusha'' (producer).

In addition, Kurosawa received a production credit on one film that he himself did not direct: ''Haru no tawamure'' (1949) (''Spring Flirtation''), written and directed by Kajiro Yamamoto, on which he served as an associate producer.

===As screenwriter===
Kurosawa wrote or co-wrote the screenplays for all the films he himself directed. However, to supplement his income, he also wrote scripts for other Japanese directors throughout the 1940s, and even through the 1950s and part of the 1960s, long after he had become world-famous. He also worked on the scripts for two Hollywood productions he was slated to direct, but which, for complex reasons, were completed by and credited to other directors (although he reportedly did shoot some scenes for ''Tora tora tora!'', the footage from which has apparently not survived). Finally, near the end of his life, he completed scripts he intended to direct but did not live to make, which were then filmed by others. A table of all these screenplays is given below; all titles are Japanese productions unless otherwise noted.

In addition, Kurosawa wrote the following unproduced scripts, composed during the pre-war period in the 1930s and also the wartime period in the 1940s, either when he was still an assistant director or had just graduated to full director. Some of these won prizes in screenwriting contests, establishing his reputation as a promising talent even though they were never filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As editor===
Kurosawa edited all his own films, though he only occasionally took screen credit for it. There are, however, only a few instances in which he edited the work of others, as listed below.

* ''Horse'' (1941) (''Uma''), directed by Kajiro Yamamoto (also second unit director, co-writer (uncredited), co-director (uncredited))
* ''[[Snow Trail]]'' (1947) (''Ginrei no hate''), directed and co-edited by [[Senkichi Taniguchi]] (also co-writer)
* ''The Hiba Arborvitae Story'' (1955)  (''Asunaro monogatari'') (also co-writer), directed by Hiromichi Horikawa
* ''Legacy of the 500,000'', AKA ''500,000'' (1963) (''Gojuman-nin no isan'') (uncredited), directed by [[Toshiro Mifune]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Mifune, directing his first film, was not confident of this suspense thriller's reception, so he hired Kurosawa to travel to the location and re-edit the footage. The latter agreed to do this more as a favor to his favorite actor than because of any belief in the project. The picture was a modest box-office success, but a critical disaster, and Mifune never directed another film.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=364–370, 703}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nogami|pp=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theater work==
During the mid-to-late 1940s, for the first and apparently the only time in his career, Akira Kurosawa involved himself in a number of theater-related projects.

* ''Shaberu'' (''Talking'')&amp;nbsp;– In 1945, immediately after the war, Kurosawa wrote a one-act play entitled ''Talking'', for, in his words, "Kawaguchi's troupe" (presumably meaning playwright [[Matsutarō Kawaguchi]], who was prominent at this time and who also worked in the film industry). The central character of the drama is a fish merchant who, during the war, greatly admires Prime Minister [[Hideki Tōjō|Tōjō]]. In emulation of his patriarchal hero, the merchant plays the tyrant at home, but when the war ends, his angry family members air their long pent-up grievances against him. Kurosawa called it "a comic treatment of... Japanese who all begin talking at once", because "we who had been able to express nothing of what we were thinking up to that time [the end of the war] all began talking at once."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1982|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seven Samurai|loc=DVD featurette: ''My Life in Cinema'' (''Waga Eiga Jinsei''): Interview of Akira Kurosawa by Nagisa Oshima)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yoidore Tenshi'' (''Drunken Angel'')&amp;nbsp;– During the Toho strike of 1948, when Kurosawa could not work, he wrote and directed a stage adaptation of his acclaimed 1948 film (see above), with Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune playing the same roles they played in the movie. The production ran for brief periods in a number of Japanese cities, apparently with great success.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Galbraith|p=98"&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Drunken Angel|loc=DVD featurette "It Is Wonderful to Create"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Predlozhenia'' (''[[A Marriage Proposal]]'') by [[Anton Chekhov]]&amp;nbsp;– Also during the Toho strike, Kurosawa directed a production of this popular early Chekhov farce. Neither the actors who appeared in the production nor its reception by the public is known.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Galbraith|p=98"/&gt;

==Television work==
Shortly before the theatrical release of ''[[Dodesukaden]]'', a TV documentary about horses called ''Uma no Uta'' (''Song of the Horse''), directed by Kurosawa, was broadcast in Japan on August 31, 1970. (Kurosawa otherwise totally avoided working in television.) Almost nothing is known about this documentary and, as of August 2010, it is not available on home video in any form.&lt;ref name="involvement"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|pp=486–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Prior to writing the screenplay to his film, ''Stray Dog'' (''Nora Inu'', 1949), Kurosawa created, in about six weeks, a novel based on the same story (presumably also called ''Stray Dog''), which he never published. It was written in the style of one of his favorite writers, the French crime author [[Georges Simenon]]. Writing it was supposed to help him compose the script as quickly as possible, but he found that writing the screenplay took even longer than usual because of the complex differences between literature and film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1982|pp=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, inspired by the memoir of one of his heroes, [[Jean Renoir]], he began to publish in serial form his autobiography, entitled ''[[Gama no abura]]'' (''An Oily Toad''). The book deals with the period from the director's birth to his winning the Golden Lion for ''[[Rashomon]]'' from the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1951; the period from 1951 through 1980 is not covered. The title of the book is a reference to a legend according to which, if one places a deformed toad in a box full of mirrors, it will become so afraid of its own reflection that it will begin to sweat, and this sweat allegedly had medicinal properties. Kurosawa compared himself to the toad, nervous about having to contemplate, through the process of writing his life story, his own multiple "reflections." It was published as a book in Japan in 1981, and in English translation the following year under the title ''[[Something Like an Autobiography]]''. The book's appearance coincided with the revival of interest in Kurosawa's work following the international release of ''[[Kagemusha]].'' ({{ISBN|0394509382}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1982|p=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Galbraith|p=561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, his book, ''Yume wa tensai de aru'' (''A Dream Is a Genius'') was published posthumously. It has not been translated into English, except for Chapter 3. This chapter consists of a selection of 100 of the director's favorite films, listed in chronological order, with detailed commentaries on each film, all given at the request of Kurosawa's daughter, Kazuko. (Since he deliberately limits himself to one film per director, however, the list emerges as more of a "favorite directors" list than a "greatest films" list.) This chapter, but not the remainder of the book, can be found in English on the Internet. ({{ISBN|4163555706}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurosawa|1999|loc=Chapter 3, found at: http://ww.criterionforum.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=7192; translation: Noriyo Hoozawa-Arkenau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Complete Drawings'' (with text in Japanese) was published by Shogakukan in 1999. ({{ISBN|4096996114}})

The screenplays of many of Kurosawa's films have been published in English. For further information, consult the Wikipedia articles relating to the individual films.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35015">'''[[Genetically modified crops]]''' are plants used in [[agriculture]], the [[DNA]] of which has been modified using [[genetic engineering]] techniques.  In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. As of 2015, 26 plant species have been genetically modified and approved for commercial release in at least one country. The majority of these species contain genes that make them either tolerant to herbicides or resistant to insects. Other common traits include virus resistance, delayed ripening, modified flower colour or altered composition. In 2014, 28 countries grew GM crops, and 39 countries imported but did not grow them.&lt;ref name="isaaa19years"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/infographics/19yearsofbiotechcrops/19%20Years%20of%20Biotech%20Crops%20in%20the%20World.pdf | title=19 Years of Biotech Crops in the World | publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) | work=isaaa.org | date=2014 | accessdate=15 February 2016 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.isaaa.org%2Fresources%2Finfographics%2F19yearsofbiotechcrops%2F19%2520Years%2520of%2520Biotech%2520Crops%2520in%2520the%2520World.pdf&amp;date=2016-02-15 | archive-date=15 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[Regulation of the release of genetically modified organisms|Regulations regarding the commercialisation of genetically modified crops]] are mostly conducted by individual countries. For cultivation, environmental approval determines whether a crop can be legally grown. Separate approval is generally required to use GM crops in food for human consumption or as animal feed.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/ | title=Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms | publisher=Library of Congress | work=loc.gov | date=9 Jun 2015 | accessdate=15 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/ |title=Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms &amp;#124; Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GM crops were first planted commercially on a large scale in 1996, in the US, China, Argentina, Canada, Australia, and Mexico.&lt;ref name="isaaa19years"/&gt; Some countries have approved but not actually cultivated GM crops, due to public uncertainty or further government restrictions, while at the same time, they may import GM foods for consumption. For example, Japan is a leading GM food importer, and permits but has not grown GM food crops. The [[European Union]] regulates importation of GM foods, while individual member states determine cultivation.&lt;ref name="loc-eu"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/eu.php | title=Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms: European Union | publisher=Library of Congress | work=loc.gov | date=9 Jun 2015 | accessdate=15 February 2016 | author=Papademetriou, Theresa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, separate regulatory agencies handle approval for cultivation ([[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]) and for human consumption ([[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]).&lt;ref name="loc-us"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/usa.php | title=Restrictions on Genetically Modified Organisms:United States | publisher=Library of Congress | work=loc.gov | date=9 Jun 2015 | accessdate=15 February 2016 | author=Acosta, Luis }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The [[European Food Safety Authority]] provides guidelines for each genetically modified crop, but the member states have flexibility on allowing cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4778_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Two genetically modified crops have been approved for food use in some countries, but have not obtained approval for cultivation. A GM Melon engineered for delayed [[senescence]] was approved in 1999 and a herbicide tolerant [[GM wheat]] was approved in 2004.

==Genetically modified crops cultivated in 2014==

In 2014, 181.5 million hectares of genetically modified crops were planted in 28 countries. Half of all GM crops planted were genetically modified soybeans, either for herbicide tolerance or insect resistance. Eleven countries grew modified soybean, with the USA, Brazil and Argentina accounting for 90% of the total hectarage. Of the 111 hectares of soybean grown worldwide in 2014, 82% was genetically modified in some way. Seventeen countries grew a total of 55.2 million hectares of genetically modified maize and fifteen grew 23.9 hectares of genetically modified cotton. Nine million hectares of genetically modified canola was grown with 8 million of those in Canada. Other GM crops grown in 2014 include Alfalfa (862 000 ha), sugar beet (494 000 ha) and papaya (7 475 ha). In Bangladesh a [[BT Brinjal|genetically modified eggplant]] was grown commercially for the first time on 12ha.&lt;ref name="isaaa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/49/default.asp |title=Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2014 - ISAAA Brief 49-2014 |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of GM crops have been modified to be resistant to selected herbicides, usually a glyphosate or glufosinate based one. In 2014, 154 million hectares were planted with a herbicide resistant crop and 78.8 million hectares had insect resistant. This include 51.4 million hectares planted in thirteen countries that contained both herbicide tolerance and insect resistance. Less than one million hectares contained other traits, which include providing virus resistance, delaying senescence, modifying flower colour and altering the plants composition. Drought tolerant maize was planted for just the second year in the USA on 275 000 hectares.&lt;ref name="isaaa2"/&gt;

=== Herbicide tolerance ===

Genetically modified crops engineered to resist herbicides are now more available than conventionally bred resistant varieties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They comprised 83% of the total GM crop area, equating to just under 8% of the [[arable land]] worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=USA |pmid=23457026 |title=Pleiotropic effects of herbicide-resistance genes on crop yield: a review. - PubMed - NCBI |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2016-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approval has been granted to grow crops engineered to be resistant to the herbicides [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=28&amp;GMTrait=2,4-D%20herbicide%20tolerance |title=GM Events with 2,4-D herbicide tolerance&amp;#124; GM Approval Database |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dicamba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=27&amp;GMTrait=Dicamba%20herbicide%20tolerance |title=GM Events with Dicamba herbicide tolerance&amp;#124; GM Approval Database |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[glufosinate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=1&amp;GMTrait=Glufosinate%20herbicide%20tolerance |title=GM Events with Glufosinate herbicide tolerance&amp;#124; GM Approval Database |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[glyphosate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=2&amp;GMTrait=Glyphosate%20herbicide%20tolerance |title=GM Events with Glyphosate herbicide tolerance&amp;#124; GM Approval Database |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sulfonylurea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=4&amp;GMTrait=Sulfonylurea%20herbicide%20tolerance |title=GM Events with Sulfonylurea herbicide tolerance&amp;#124; GM Approval Database |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[oxynil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=3&amp;GMTrait=Oxynil%20herbicide%20tolerance |title=GM Events with Oxynil herbicide tolerance&amp;#124; GM Approval Database |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mesotrione]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=31&amp;GMTrait=Mesotrione%20Herbicide%20Tolerance |title=GM Events with Mesotrione Herbicide Tolerance&amp;#124; GM Approval Database |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[isoxaflutole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=26&amp;GMTrait=Isoxaflutole%20herbicide%20tolerance |title=GM Events with Isoxaflutole herbicide tolerance&amp;#124; GM Approval Database |publisher=ISAAA.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most herbicide resistant GM crops have been engineered for glyphosate tolerance, in the USA 93% of soybeans and most of the GM maize grown is glyphosate tolerant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jerry M Green |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ps.3727/full |title=Current state of herbicides in herbicide-resistant crops - Green - 2014 - Pest Management Science - Wiley Online Library |publisher=Onlinelibrary.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insect resistance===
Most currently available genes used to engineer insect resistance come from the ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' bacterium. Most are in the form of [[delta endotoxin]] genes known as cry proteins, while a few use the genes that encode for [[vegetative insecticidal protein]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-06892-3_10|title=Plant Biotechnology|last=Fleischer|first=Shelby J.|last2=Hutchison|first2=William D.|last3=Naranjo|first3=Steven E.|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319068916|editor-last=Ricroch|editor-first=Agnès|pages=115–127|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-06892-3_10|editor-last2=Chopra|editor-first2=Surinder|editor-last3=Fleischer|editor-first3=Shelby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insect resistant crops target various species of [[coleopteran]] (beetles)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=5&amp;GMTrait=Coleopteran%2520insect%2520resistance|title=GM Events with Coleopteran insect resistance{{!}} GM Approval Database- ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lepidoptera]]n (moths).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtrait/default.asp?TraitID=6&amp;GMTrait=Lepidopteran%2520insect%2520resistance|title=GM Events with Lepidopteran insect resistance{{!}} GM Approval Database- ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only gene commercially used to provide insect protection that does not originate from ''B. thuringiensis'' is the [[Cowpea]] [[trypsin inhibitor]] (CpTI).

===Stacked traits===
Many varieties of GM crops contain more than one resistance gene. This could be in the form of multiple insect resistant genes, multiple herbicide tolerance genes or a combination of the herbicide and insect resistant genes. [[SmartStax|Smartstax]] is a brand of GM maize that has eight different genes added to it, making it resistant to two types of herbicides and toxic to six different species of insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/smartstax-maize-germany-approval-428/|title=Monsanto’s SmartStax maize ‘to be approved for growth in October’ in EU|language=en-EN|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other modified traits===
While most crops are engineered to resist insects or tolerate herbicides some crops have been developed for other traits. Flowers have been engineered to display colours that they cannot do so naturally (in particular the [[Blue rose|blue color in roses]]). A few crops, like the [[genetically modified papaya]], are engineered to resist viruses. Other modifications alter the plants composition, with the aim of making it more nutritious, longer lasting or more industrially useful. Recently crops engineered to tolerate drought have been commercialised.

{{nihongo|'''Loose socks'''|ルーズソックス|rūzu sokkusu}} are a style of baggy [[sock]] worn by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] high school girls, as part of ''[[kogal]]'' culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/721378/Filling-the-gap.html |title=Filling the gap |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Sam |last=Wallace | location=London | date=24 October 1998 |accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of socks has also become popular among American teens and college students who are fans of Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]]. These socks come in a variety of styles—defined by the knitting pattern of the upper. The two most popular styles are the traditional 2×2 rib knit (pictured) and tube-style loose socks, which are thigh-high length tube socks worn pushed down around the ankles. 

They were adopted as a fashion which flattered plump calves and also expressed rebellious deviation from Japan's strict [[dress code]] for [[Japanese school uniform|school uniforms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-iaiARtuCaIC&amp;pg=PA810 |title=Japan: The Rough Guide |first=Jan |last=Dodd |author2=Simon Richmond  |publisher=Rough Guides |location=London |edition=1st |date=1999 |page=810 |isbn=9781858283401 |oclc=441275694}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as an inspiration for photography by [[Akira Gomi]]. They are also used in Japanese fashions like Kogal and Fairy Kei.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2381">The '''Magellanic Premium''', also known as the '''Magellanic Gold Medal''' and '''Magellanic Prize''' is awarded for major contributions in the field of navigation (whether by sea, air, or in space), astronomy, or natural philosophy.

The Premium was established in 1786 through a grant by [[Jean-Hyacinthe Magellan]] ({{lang-pt|João Jacinto de Magalhães}}). [[Benjamin Franklin]], then President of the [[American Philosophical Society]], accepted it and established the terms of reference under which it would be given.

In the 217 years since Magellan offered the Premium, the APS has awarded on only 33 occasions (as of 2008): twelve for navigation, twelve for natural philosophy, and eight for astronomy.

{{Divine Mercy}}
[[File:Peterborough Psalter c 1220-25 Mercy and Truth.jpg|thumb|''Mercy and Truth'' are shown together in a 13th-century representation of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Psalms#85|Psalm 85 (10)]]]]
'''Mercy''' ([[Middle English]], from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] ''merci'', from [[Medieval Latin]] ''merced-'', ''merces'', from [[Latin]], "price paid, wages", from ''merc-'', ''merxi'' "merchandise") is [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[forgiveness]], and [[kindness]] in a variety of ethical, religious, social, and [[Law|legal]] contexts.

The concept of a merciful God appears in various religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]. Performing acts of mercy as a component of religious beliefs is also emphasized through actions such as the giving of alms, and care for the sick and [[Works of Mercy]].

In the social and legal context, mercy may refer both to compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. mercy shown by a judge toward a convict), or on the part of a humanitarian third party, e.g., a mission of mercy aiming to treat war victims.&lt;ref name=Sarat &gt;Sarat, Austin and Hussain, Nasser. ''Forgiveness, mercy, and clemency'', 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-5333-4}} pp. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Menke&gt;Menke, Christopher. ''Reflections of equality'' by Christoph Menke 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-4474-2}} p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
"Mercy" can be defined as "compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender or to one subject to one's power"; and  also "a blessing that is an act of divine favor or compassion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mercy "Mercy", Merriam-Webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; "To be at someone's mercy" indicates a person being "without defense against someone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/at+the+mercy+of "At the mercy of", McGraw-Hill Dictionary of American Idioms and Phrasal Verbs. © 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and ethics==
[[File:Spirit of Compassion.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''Spirit of Compassion'', commemorating [[World War I]], [[National War Memorial (South Australia)|South Australia]], 1931]]
In a judicial context mercy is often termed "clemency". It is a sovereign prerogative that resides in the executive and is entirely discretionary. [[John Locke]] defined it as "the power to act according to discretion, for the public good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Second Treatise on Civil Government'', (C.B MacPherson, ed.), Indianapolis, Indiana. Hackett, 1980, §§ 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] explained that "The very nature of clemency is that it is grounded solely in the will of the dispenser of clemency. He need give no reasons for granting it or for denying it."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Sapp'', 118 F. 3d 460, 465 (6th Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
===Christianity===
{{see also|Works of Mercy}}
Hebrews 4:16 says, "So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help."&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 4:16, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Grace and mercy are similar in that both are free gifts of God and both are dispensed absent any merit on the part of the recipient. Grace is the favor of God, a divine assistance. Grace is what one receives that they do not deserve while mercy is what one receives when they do ''not'' get that which they deserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/christiancrier/2014/03/17/what-is-the-difference-between-mercy-and-grace/ Wellman, Jack. "What Is The Difference Between Mercy and Grace?"], ''Patheos'', March 17, 2104&lt;/ref&gt; 

An emphasis on mercy appears in the [[New Testament]], for example in the [[Magnificat]] &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:46-55|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] (Song of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:68-79|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Luke's Gospel]], and in the [[Beatitudes]] in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#5:7|Matthew 5:7]]: "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 /&gt; In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Ephesians#2:4|Ephesians 2:4]] [[Apostle Paul]] refers to the mercy of God in terms of salvation: "God, being rich in mercy,... even when we were dead through our sins, made us alive together with Christ".

[[Psalm 117]] calls upon all nations to praise the Lord, and that on account of his "merciful kindness". This is quoted by the Apostle Paul in Romans 15:11 to show that God has now fulfilled this prophecy and promise through Jesus Christ, who has been merciful in giving his life as a sacrifice for his people, both Jew and Gentile. Thus St Peter writes in 1 Peter 2:9,10:
:''But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.''

This devotional element of mercy as part of the Christian tradition was echoed by [[Saint Augustine]] who called mercy "ever ancient, ever new".&lt;ref name=Mauriello149 &gt;''Mercies Remembered'' by Matthew R Mauriello 2011 {{ISBN|1-61215-005-5}} page 149-160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine]], ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', Book X, 27&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Works of Mercy]] (seven corporal and seven spiritual works) are part of the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 /&gt;

Now permanently enshrined at the [[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Vilnius)|Divine Mercy Sanctuary of Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref name=Withyou548 &gt;''Am With You Always'' by [[Benedict Groeschel]] 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-58617-257-2}} page 548&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' ("Rich in Mercy") Pope John Paul II examines the role of mercy—both God's mercy, and also the need for human mercy.&lt;ref name=Dives&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_30111980_dives-in-misericordia_en.html Pope John Paul II. ''Dives in misericordia'', November 30, 1980, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees in the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#15:11|Luke 15:11-32]]) "the essence of the divine mercy".&lt;ref name=Dives/&gt; Having squandered his patrimony, justice would dictate that the prodigal should only expect to be received back as a hireling. The figure of the father is analogous to God as Father, who goes beyond the requirements of justice to welcome his son with compassion.

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] emphasizes the importance of the [[Works of Mercy]] (item 2447) and in [[Roman Catholic]] teachings, the mercy of God flows through the work of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Apostoli105 &gt;''We Believe in the Holy Spirit'' by Andrew Apostoli 2002 {{ISBN|1-931709-31-9}} pages 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Catechism2447 &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a7.htm#2447 Vatican website Catechism item 2447]&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic [[liturgy]] includes frequent references to mercy, e.g., as in ''[[Kyrie|Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison]]'': Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08714a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: ''Kyrie Eleison'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy has also been an important subject of Christian [[iconography]]. Since the [[Middle Ages]], many representations in art encouraged people to practice the [[works of mercy]] and, as the art historian [[Ralf van Bühren]] explains using the example of [[Caravaggio]], helped "the audience to explore mercy in their own lives".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples. The relevance of art history to cultural journalism]'', in ''Church, Communication and Culture'' 2 (2017), pp. 63-87, quotation from pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, there was new focus on mercy in the Roman Catholic Church, partly due to the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion.&lt;ref name=Withyou548 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ball175 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; The primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one's own heart towards those in need of it.&lt;ref name=Ball175 &gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|0-87973-910-X}} page 175&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Pope John Paul II]] was a follower of the Divine Mercy devotion, due to Saint [[Mary Faustina Kowalska]] (1905–1938), who is known as the ''[[Faustina Kowalska|Apostle of Mercy]]''.&lt;ref name=Butler &gt;''Butler's lives of the saints: the third millennium'' by Paul Burns, Alban Butler 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-86012-383-5}} page 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drake85 &gt;''Saints of the Jubilee'' by Tim Drake 2002 {{ISBN|978-1-4033-1009-5}} pages 85-95&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of Roman Catholic [[shrines]] are specifically dedicated to Divine Mercy, e.g.
the [[Divine Mercy Sanctuary (Krakow)|Basilica of Divine Mercy]] in Krakow Poland, and the [[National Shrine of The Divine Mercy (Stockbridge, Massachusetts)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_07061997_sr-faustina_en.html Vatican website: Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt; During the dedication of the Basilica of Divine Mercy John Paul II quoted [[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul|the Diary of Faustina]] and called mercy the "greatest attribute of God Almighty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20020817_shrine-divine-mercy_en.html  Vatican website: Dedication of the Shrine of Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] the title "Most Merciful" (al-Rahman) is one of the [[names of Allah]] and Compassionate (al-Rahim), is the most common name occurring in the [[Quran]]. Rahman and Rahim both derive from the root Rahmat, which refers to tenderness and benevolence.&lt;ref name=Rafiabadi &gt;''World religions and Islam: a critical study, Part 1'' by Hamid Naseem Rafiabadi, 2003 Sarup and Sons Publishers {{ISBN|81-7625-414-2}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of mercy, the giving of alms ([[zakat]]) is the fourth of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]] and one of the requirements for the faithful.&lt;ref name=Hooker&gt;Hooker, Richard (July 14, 1999). "arkan ad-din the five pillars of religion". Washington State University. {{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203124633/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/5PILLARS.HTM |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The Hebrew word  for mercy is ''Rachamim'' which is always in plural form so that it literally means "mercies". "Mercy includes showing kindness to those who don’t deserve it, and forgiving those that deserve punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shema.com/gods-attributes-the-mercy-of-god-3043/ Rabbi Loren. "God’s Attributes: The Mercy of God", Congregation Shema Yisrael]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercy is one of the defining characteristics of [[God]]. Exodus 34:6 says: "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness."&lt;ref&gt;''After the exile'' by John Barton, David James Reimer 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-86554-524-3}} page 90&lt;/ref&gt; This is also emphasized in the context of the Babylonian exile in Isaiah: "For the Lord has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his suffering ones. But Zion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me, my Lord has forgotten me.' Can a woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you." (Isaiah 49:13-15) Also: "It is good to pray and fast, to be merciful and just." (Tobit 12:8) 

When [[David]], because of his sin, was told to choose between a three-year famine, pursuit by his enemies for three months, or a three-day pestilence, he chose the pestilence saying, "Let us fall by the hand of God, for he is most merciful; but let me not fall by the hand of man."&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 24:14, NAB&lt;/ref&gt; Psalm 103:8 praises God for his mercy.

===Other religions and beliefs===
[[Kwan Yin]] the bodhisattva of mercy and compassion, is one of the best known and most venerated [[Bodhisattva]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''Guan Yin: goddess of compassion'' by Kok Kiang Koh 2004 {{ISBN|981-229-379-5}} pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karuṇā]] (often translated as "compassion") is part of the beliefs of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. Karuṇā is present in all schools of Buddhism and in Jainism it is viewed as one of the reflections of universal friendship.

The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] described God as being "all-merciful and eternally benevolent" in his [[Parvardigar Prayer|O Parvardigar]] prayer, and he held that we can approach God through the "invocation of His mercy."&lt;ref&gt; Kalchuri, Bhau (1986). ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher''. '''18'''. Myrtle Beach: Manifestation, Inc. p. 5986.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6974">'''Metaphor''' (drawing a ''similarity'' between two things) '''and metonymy''' (drawing a ''[[wikt:contiguity|contiguity]]'' between two things) are two fundamental opposite poles along which a discourse with [[human language]] is developed.&lt;ref name="Jakobson56"/&gt; It has been argued that the two poles of similarity and contiguity are fundamental ones along which the human brain is structured; in the study of human language the two poles have been called [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]], while in the study of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] they have been called [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt; In linguistics, they are connected to the paradigmatic and syntagmatic poles.&lt;ref name="Dirven"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dirven|first1=René|editor1-last=Dirven|editor1-first=René|editor2-last=Pörings|editor2-first=Ralf|title=Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast|date=2003|publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=9783110173741|pages=75–112|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMBJVVahacIC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=syntagm+metonymy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JAz4IBKLAi&amp;sig=0BVE1lQtLvFUsrRKsqAmYA_98rE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0idynydrMAhXBTSYKHf7sD2oQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=syntagm%20metonymy&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2016|chapter=Metonymy and Metaphor: Different Mental Strategies of Conceptualisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple metaphor-metonymy had a prominent role in the renewal of the field of rhetoric in the 1960s. In his 1956 essay, "The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles", [[Roman Jakobson]] describes the couple as representing the possibilities of linguistic selection (metaphor) and combination (metonymy); Jakobson's work became important for such French [[structuralism|structuralists]] as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="Dirven" /&gt; In his essay, Jakobson also argues that metaphor is the basis for poetry, especially as seen in [[Romanticism#Romantic literature|literary Romanticism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], whereas metonymy forms the basis for [[literary realism|Realism in literature]].&lt;ref name="Poles"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jakobson|first1=Roman|editor1-last=Dirven|editor1-first=René|editor2-last=Pörings|editor2-first=Ralf|title=Metaphor and Metonymy in Comparison and Contrast|date=1956 |publisher=de Gruyter|isbn=9783110173741|pages=41–48|edition=revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMBJVVahacIC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=jakobson+metonymy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT_9qM0NrMAhVB6CYKHdx-AMoQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jakobson%20metonymy&amp;f=false |accessdate=14 May 2016|chapter=The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the unconscious: condensation and displacement==
According to [[Freud]]'s work (1900), [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] and [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] (from German ''Verdichtung'' and ''Verschiebung'') are two closely linked concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631207535_chunk_g97806312075356_ss1-35 BlackwellReference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], through the dynamic movement of [[cathexis]] (charge of libido, mental or emotional energy), it is possible that an idea (image, memory, or thought) passes on its whole charge to another idea; Freud called this process "displacement." It is also possible that a single idea takes the whole charge of more than one other ideas; Freud called this process "condensation."&lt;ref name="Szondi1956p50"&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] (1956) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_u3QAAAAMAAJ ''Ich-Analyse''], subtitled ''Die Grundlage zur Vereinigung der Tiefenpsychologie.'' Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 1956, Kapitel I ''Das Unbewußte im Lichte der Psychoanalyse S. Freuds'', ''V. Die Phänomenologie des Unbeweßten nach S.Freud'' p.50  quotation: {{quotation|Ad.2 Die Beweglichkeit der Besetzungsintensitäten.&lt;BR /&gt;
Im System ''Unbewußt'' kann eine Vorstellung ihren ganzen Besetzungsbetrag, d. h. die ganze Libidomenge, an eine andere Vorstellung abgeben. Freud nennt diesen Vorgang «''Verschiebung''».&lt;BR /&gt;
Im Ubw ist es ferner möglich, daß eine einzige Vorstellung die ganze Libido-besetzung mehrerer anderer Vorstellungen an sich nimmt. Freud spricht in diesem Fall von «''Verdichtung''».&lt;BR /&gt;
Die beiden Vorgänge - Verschiebung und Verdichtung - tragen den  Sammelnamen: ''psychischer Primärvorgang''. Dieser ist für das ''Ubw'' charakteristisch und steht im Gegensatz zu dem ''Sekundärvorgang'', der sich im ''Vorbewußt'' abspielt.&lt;BR /&gt;
Die Verschiebung und die Verdichtung sind die führenden Vorgänge im Unbewußten im besonderen bei der Traumarbeit. Sie sind eben ''primäre'' Prozesse des ''Ubw''. Träume erhalten aber häufig eine nachträgliche Fassade dadurch, daß die Traumbestandteile ''nachträglich'' zu einer «Traumkomposition» zusammengefügt werden. FREUD hegt die Meinung, daß diese Fassade, diese Traumkomposition, sekundärer Natur sei, indem diese sekundäre Zusammenfassung «''auf den bereits vorgebildeten Trauminhalt erst nachträglich einwirke''»(1). Diese ''sekundäre'' Bearbeitung der primären Trauminhalte soll sich im ''Vbw'' abspielen. Die primären Vorgänge in ''Ubw'' werden eben durch den Charakter der Verschiebung und Verdichtung agnosziert.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a condensation is when more than one displacement occurs towards the same idea.

In 1957, [[Jacques Lacan]], inspired by an article by linguist [[Roman Jakobson]], argued that the unconscious has the same structure of a language, and that condensation and displacement are equivalent to the [[poetic function]]s of [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]].&lt;ref name="Jakobson56"&gt;[[Roman Jakobson]] and Halle, Morris (1956) ''Two Aspects of Language and Two Types of Aphasic Disturbances in Fundamentals of Language.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">{{For|the minimal unit of meaning in linguistics|morpheme}}

The term '''morphome''' refers to a function in linguistics which is purely [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] or has an irreducibly morphological component.  The term was introduced by [[Martin Maiden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|title=Morphological autonomy and diachrony|journal=Yearbook of Morphology|date=2004|issue=2004|pages=137–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Mark Aronoff]]'s identification of morphomic functions and the morphomic level—a level of linguistic structure intermediate between and independent of [[phonology]] and [[syntax]].  In distinguishing this additional level, Aronoff makes the empirical claim that all mappings from the morphosyntactic level to the level of phonological realisation pass through the intermediate morphomic level.

== Typology of morphomic patterns ==
Functions defined at the morphomic level are of many qualitatively different types.

One example is the different ways the [[perfect participle]] can be realised in English––sometimes, this form is created through [[suffix]]ation, as in ''bitten'' and ''packed'', sometimes through a process of [[ablaut]], as in ''sung'', and sometimes through a combination of these, such as ''broken'', which uses ablaut as well as the suffix ''-n''. Since these processes, which achieve the same result, are of different categories, it is not possible to call the formation of the perfect participle in English a suffix, so it must be assumed that it exists as an abstract category on the morphomic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aronoff|first=Mark|title=Morphology by Itself|year=1994|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another is the division of [[lexemes]] into distinct inflectional classes. Inflectional classes present distinct morphological forms, but these distinctions bear no meaning beyond signalling inflectional patterns; they are internal to morphology, and thus morphomic.

Martin Maiden's theory of morphomes has been mostly developed with regard to the Romance languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1029319590|title=The romance verb : morphomic structure and diachrony|last=1957-|first=Maiden, Martin,|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191056390|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|oclc=1029319590}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he identified many examples of morphomic stem distributions.

A different typology of morphomic patterns has been put forth by Erich Round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Round|first=Erich R.|title=Rhizomorphomes, meromorphomes, and metamorphomes|date=2015-03-01|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198723769.001.0001/acprof-9780198723769-chapter-3|work=Understanding and Measuring Morphological Complexity|pages=28–52|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198723769.003.0003|isbn=9780198723769|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes rhizomorphomes, which are a property of roots (corresponding to the traditional notion of inflectional class), metamorphomes, which are a property of paradigms, a set of cells which behave in a particular way (corresponding to the morphome in Maiden's terms, such as patterns of stem distribution), and meromorphomes, which are a property of exponents, and have only been identified for now in [[Kayardild language|Kayardild]] and related languages.

'''''Mr. Wong''''' is an [[internet television]] series which debuted in 2000 and lasted 13 episodes (an unaired 14th episode was made available for the DVD release{{fact|date=September 2018}}). It features the adventures of a [[Chinese American]] [[butler]] for a wealthy socialite [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] named Miss Pam.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title= Drawing Power |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2000-06-23|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276517,00.html|accessdate=2011-11-20|first=Noah|last=Robischon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously worked as a butler for [[Bing Crosby]] and often mourns him.  It has developed a [[cult following]] whilst being hosted on the website [[Icebox.com]], which also features independently made cartoons such as [[Queer Duck]].

==Film==

In September 2000 a direct to video film adaptation of Mr. Wong called "Crap Attack" was in negotiation between IceBox Incorporated and [[Artisan Entertainment]], however, when the film was publicly announced by Artisan president [[Bill Block]] the [[National Council of Asian Pacific Americans]] initiated a letter-writing campaign that successfully convinced Artisan to drop the project. The Coalition later took out an advertisement in Daily Variety criticizing the cartoon and thanking Artisan for abandoning the movie project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death to Mr. Wong|url=http://usasians-articles.tripod.com/articles-mrwong.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asian-American groups object to "Mr. Wong"|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/3671946/asian-american-groups-object-mr-wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artisan Ends Talk To Turn "Mr. Wong" Into Film|url=https://variety.com/2000/digital/news/artisan-ends-talks-to-turn-wong-into-video-1117787632/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IceBox's Mr. Wong Direct-To-Video Plans Melt|url=http://www.awn.com/news/home-entertainment/icebox-s-mr-wong-direct-video-plans-melt|publisher=AWN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Métis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|eɪ|ˈ|t|iː}}) are members of ethnic groups native to [[Canada]] and parts of the [[United States]] that trace their descent to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North Americans]] and [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlers]]. Originally the term applied to French-speaking [[mixed-race]] families, especially in the Red River area of what became [[Manitoba, Canada]]; in the late 19th century in Canada, those of mixed English descent were classified separately as [[Mixed Blood]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/pasttopresent/settlement/first_peoples_metis.html "The Metis"], Alberta Settlement, last updated 05 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 20th century, the [[Métis in Canada]] have been recognized as a distinct [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal people]] under the [[Constitution Act of 1982]]; they number 451,795 as of 2011.&lt;ref name="Aboriginal Identity 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130508/dq130508a-eng.htm?HPA|title=The Daily — 2011 National Household Survey: Aboriginal Peoples in Canada: First Nations People, Métis and Inuit|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller communities identifying as Métis exist [[Métis in the United States|in the U.S.]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Jacqueline; Brown, Jennifer S.

In ''The New Peoples: Being and Becoming Métis in North America'', pp. 3–18. Minnesota Historical Society Press. {{ISBN|0873514084}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word derives from the French adjective ''métis'', also spelled ''metice'', referring to a hybrid, or someone of mixed ancestry.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{Cite OED|Metis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Robert"&gt;{{cite book|last = Robert|first = Paul |year = 1973 |title = Dictionnaire alphabétique et analogique de la langue française|location = Paris|publisher = Dictionnaire LE ROBERT|isbn= 978-2-321-00858-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1080}} In the 16th century, French colonists used the term ''métis'' as a noun for people of mixed European and indigenous American parentage in New France (Quebec) and [[La Louisiane]] in North America; at the time, it applied generally to French-speaking people who were of partial ethnic French descent. (It is related to the Spanish term "[[Mestizo]]", which has the same meaning.)&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/métis|title=MÉTIS : Etymologie de MÉTIS|language=French|trans-title=Etymology of MÉTIS|website=Ortolang|publisher=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later came to be used for people of mixed European and indigenous backgrounds in other French colonies, including [[Guadeloupe]] in the Caribbean;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James Alexander|first1=Simone A.|title=Mother Imagery in the Novels of Afro-Caribbean Women|date=2001|publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]|isbn=082626316X|pages=14–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] in West Africa;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Hilary|title=The Métis of Senegal: Urban Life and Politics in French West Africa|date=2013|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=0253007054|pages=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algeria]] in North Africa;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorcin|first1=Patricia M. E.|title=Algeria &amp; France, 1800–2000: Identity, Memory, Nostalgia|date=2006|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]|isbn=0815630743|pages=80–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the former [[French Indochina]] in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robson, Kathryn and Jennifer Yee|title=France and "Indochina": Cultural Representations|date=2005|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|isbn=0739108409|pages=210–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin America, a similar word is ''[[mestizo]]'' in Spanish-speaking countries, and in Portuguese-speaking countries, ''[[mestiço]]'' is also used. The English word ''mestee'' is a corruption of the [[Middle French]] ''mestis'' (the letters 's' both pronounced at the start of the Middle French period, and both silent at the end of the Middle French period).

It has also been used to refer to people of mixed race born generally to indigenous women and French men in [[New France]]. The [[Métis in Canada]] married within their own group, and over time, created a distinct culture and ethnicity of their own. In former French colonies where slavery was part of society, a group known as ''gens du couleur libre'' ([[free people of color]]) developed from unions between African or mixed-race women and French male colonists. In New Orleans, the system of [[plaçage]] was well developed in the eighteenth century, in which women in these relationships received some protection by contracts, often negotiated by their mothers. Often the men freed the women, if they were enslaved, and their mixed-race children, if born into slavery. Property settlements were also part of the relationship, and the men sometimes provided for education of sons, sometimes in France.

[[File:Métis and Red River carts.jpg|thumb|Métis drivers and [[Red River cart]]s]]
The term ''mestee'' was widely used in the antebellum United States for mixed-race individuals, according to Jack D. Forbes. {{citation needed|date=November 2018}} It was used for people of European and Native American ancestry, as well as European and African, and for those who were tri-racial. In the 19th century and up until 1930, United States census takers recorded people of color as [[mulatto]], also meaning mixed race. 

After the American Civil War, the term "mestee" gradually fell into disuse when millions of slaves were emancipated as [[freedmen]]. As conservative whites in the South worked to re-establish white supremacy, they imposed [[Jim Crow]] laws after regaining control of state legislatures. In the early 20th century, they passed more stringent laws establishing the "[[one-drop rule]]". By this anyone with any known Sub-Saharan African ancestry was legally "Black", a more restrictive definition than had previously operated in the South, especially on the frontier. Scholar [[Jack D. Forbes]] has attempted to revive "mestee" as a term for the mixed-race peoples who were established as free before the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6aLAeB5QiHAC |first=Jack |last=Forbes|title=Africans and Native Americans: The Language of Race and the Evolution of Red-Black Peoples|location=Champaign, IL |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-06321-3|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, since the early 20th century the term Metis has been applied in various ways. ''Metisaje'' was used from the 1920s to the 1960s in some Latin American countries to indicate cultural hybridity, and at times to invoke a nationalist sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acheraïou|first1=A|title=Questioning Hybridity, Postcolonialism and Globalization|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=0230305245|pages=139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural "Hybridity" theorists have used the term "métissage" to examine postcolonial themes, including [[Francoise Lionnet|Françoise Lionnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hybridity in Contemporary Postcolonial Theory|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/61414.pdf|publisher=State University of New York Press, Albany, 2007|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creolite|Creolité]] is a cultural and literary movement that has common threads with "métis" identity, and has been a counterpoint to the [[Négritude]] movement, although it has also been used to indicate "race and gender specific" themes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James Alexander|first1=Simone A.|title=Mother Imagery in the Novels of Afro-Caribbean Women|date=2001|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=082626316X|pages=15–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' indicates that there is no complete consensus for the definition of Métis in Canada. The Canadian Encyclopedia's definition of Métis was not developed in consultation with Métis people or communities. It uses the following definition:&lt;ref name="cdnencyc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Written with a small m, ''métis'' is the French word for "mixed", and it is used here in a general sense for people of dual Indian-White ancestry. Capitalized, ''Métis'' generally refers to people of the post-contact indigenous people, the Métis Nation. It may variously refer to a distinctive socio cultural heritage, a means of ethnic self-identification, and sometimes a political and legal category, more or less narrowly defined.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== History of Métis in Canada ===
The Métis Nation is considered to be rooted in what is known as the "Métis Homeland," an area ranging from northwestern Ontario and moving westward across the prairies. In this area, fur trappers married indigenous  [[Cree]] and [[Saulteaux]] women. A distinct ethnicity developed, as mixed-race descendants married within this group and remained involved with fur trapping and trading. They also began to farm in the [[Red River of the North]] area. 

People of "mixed ancestry," although not of the Métis Nation, have a distinct history of their own. These unions began in the east, extending from the Atlantic coast to the [[Great Lakes]]. The fur trade and colonial development drew French [[voyageurs]] and [[coureurs des bois]] to the west, along with the later [[Hudson's Bay Company]] employees. Wintering partners of the fur trading companies typically took [[country wife|country wives]] for their months away from the eastern cities.

After the fall of New France to the British 1763, many mixed-race populations continued to establish themselves, often specializing in the fur trade and related hunting. Some served as interpreters, as they often were fluent in both indigenous and European languages. English and Scottish traders married indigenous women, often the daughters of high-ranking chiefs, forming an elite mixed society. As the eighteenth century ended, the fur trade moved westward into the Plains. 

The Métis Nation promoted their distinct and unique Indigenous identity in 1812, when [[Cuthbert Grant]] led a battle in the [[Pemmican War]], flying the Métis flag. Many treaties throughout Canada were being negotiated in the nineteenth century, including in Ontario with the [[Robinson–Huron treaty]]. In 1870 the Métis at [[Red River Rebellion|Red River]], led by [[Louis Riel]], resisted Canada's efforts to take over this area from the Hudson's Bay Company. They negotiated entry into Canada as the province of [[Manitoba]], with promises to protect their land and rights. In 1885, the Métis resisted Canadian colonialism with the [[North-West Rebellion]]. The Métis were defeated and Riel was hanged as a traitor to Canada, but his role in history is controversial.

Métis in the Métis Nation homeland received scrip under Section 32 of the Manitoba Act,and in the Northwest Territory via a series of Scrip Commissions that accompanied the negotiators of the numbered treaties in the Northwest Territory. Because scrip could only be applied to surveyed land, many Metis could not use it to purchase the unsurveyed land on which they were already living.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.scribd.com/doc/18197649/Metis-Rights-and-Land-Claims-in-Canada&lt;/ref&gt; They often moved onto the road allowances, where no roads had yet been built. The term "Road Allowance people" was used to describe these disposessed Metis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/158271876/Metis-Scrip-Images-and-Description]&lt;/ref&gt; Racism toward Métis peoples in the west was prevalent during a large part of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

In 1982, Métis were included as a distinct [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous people]] in the Canadian constitution. They are defined as an ethnic group with their own culture, distinct from [[First Nations]] and [[Inuit]] peoples. Métis peoples have formed a variety of political organizations to promote their interests, and lobby the federal government through their primary national political association, the [[Métis National Council]] (MNC).

In 2003, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled in ''R.V. Powley'' that a family of Métis people in Ontario had the right to hunt moose as part of their Métis aboriginal rights. This case was funded by the [[Métis Nation of Ontario]] (MNO), a provincial affiliate of the MNC. The case established that the Métis had a history in Ontario, which was long debated by many people. The case also established the "Powley test", which helps to define who is Métis, and therefore eligible to rights as an aboriginal person.&lt;ref name="rvpowley"&gt;{{cite CanLII

On April 14, 2016, the Supreme Court in ''Daniels v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development)'' reached a landmark decision, ruling that Métis and non-status Indians are "Indians" for the purpose of s 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/metis-ruling/article29628869/|title=Métis, non-status Indians win Supreme Court battle over rights|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2018|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Daniels v Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development)|link = Daniels v.

The '''Nanjing Anti-African protests''' were mass demonstrations and riots against [[Africa]]n students in [[Nanjing]], [[China]], which lasted from December 1988, to the following January.

==Background==
Animosity towards African students was a late-1980s occurrence. There were no such cases of animosity in the 1960s, when scholarships provided by the Chinese government allowed many students from China-friendly African countries to study in [[Beijing]]. This policy was originally based on the idea of third world solidarity and [[Mao Zedong]]'s linking of the fight against American and Soviet [[imperialism]] with [[Marxist]] [[class conflict|class war]]. Many of these African students were given larger educational grants than native Chinese students, and hostility towards the Africans was a regular occurrence. Most of these students returned to their home countries before reaching the end of their courses due to poor living conditions and the political uncertainties of the Mao era. From the mid-1970s, China allowed African students to study outside of Beijing.

As well as resentment about the larger [[stipend]]s given to African students, hostility from Chinese students towards Africans also flared up when there was contact between African men and Chinese women. In an incident in [[Shanghai]] in 1979, African students were attacked after playing loud music and making sexual remarks to Chinese women. These clashes became more common during the 1980s and sometimes led to arrests and deportations of African students. Cultural differences in dating habits added to the tensions.

==Nanjing protests==
On December 24, 1988 two male African students were entering their campus at [[Hohai University]] in Nanjing with two Chinese women. The occasion was a [[Christmas Eve]] party. A quarrel between one of the Africans and a Chinese security guard, who had suspected that the women the African students tried to bring into the campus were prostitutes and refused their entry, led to a brawl between the African and Chinese students on the campus which lasted till the morning, leaving 13 students injured. 

300 Chinese students, spurred by false rumors that a Chinese man had been killed by the Africans, broke into and set about destroying the Africans' dormitories, shouting slogans. Part of the destruction involved setting fire to the Africans' dormitory and locking them in. The President of the University had to order the fire department to take action.

After the police had dispersed the Chinese students, many Africans fled to the railway station in order to gain safety at various African embassies in Beijing. The authorities prevented the Africans from boarding the trains so as to question those involved in the brawl. Soon their numbers increased to 140, as other African and non-African foreign students, fearing violence or simply by sympathy, arrived at the first-class waiting room at the station asking to be allowed to go to Beijing. 

By this time, Chinese students from HoHai University had joined up with students from other Nanjing universities to make up a 3000-strong demonstration that called on government officials to prosecute the African students and reform the system which gave foreigners more rights than the Chinese. On the evening of  December 26, the marchers converged on the railway station while holding banners calling for [[human rights]] and political reform. Chinese police managed to isolate the non-Chinese students from the marchers and moved them by force to a military guest house in Yizheng outside Nanjing. The protests were declared illegal, and riot police were brought in from surrounding provinces to pacify the demonstrators, which took several more days.

The African students and their sympathisers were removed from Yizheng to another military guesthouse closer to Nanjing on New Year's Eve, and were returned to their universities the following day.

==Aftermath==
In January, three of the African students were deported for starting the [[Punch (combat)|brawl]]. The other students returned to [[Hohai University]] and were required to follow new regulations, including a night-time curfew, having to report to university authorities before leaving the campus, and having no more than one Chinese girlfriend whose visits would be limited to the lounge area. Guests were still required to be registered.

Anti-African demonstrations spread to other cities, including [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristof, Nicholas D. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/05/world/africans-in-beijing-boycott-classes.html?pagewanted=1 Africans in Beijing Boycott Classes]." ''New York Times'' January 5, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiananmen Square protests==
The Nanjing protests were groundbreaking dissidence for China and  went from solely expressing concern about alleged improprieties by African men to increasingly calling for democracy or human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Construction of Racial Identities in China  by Frank Dikötter 1997 p86&lt;/ref&gt;  They were paralleled by burgeoning demonstrations in other cities during the period between the Nanjing and the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], with some elements of the original protests that started in Nanjing still evident in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], such as banners proclaiming "Stop Taking Advantage of Chinese Women" even though the vast majority of African students had left the country by that point.&lt;ref&gt;Huff Post, 07/13/2009 [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/phillip-martin/the-stain-on-chinas-pro-d_b_214982.html The Stain on China’s Pro-Democracy Movement: A Final Word About Tiananmen By Phillip Martin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The road to Tienanmen Square,  p105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Flying Dragon by Ruixi Ai (ISBN: 9781105768903) p31&lt;ref&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Museum of Funeral History''' is a museum in [[Houston, Texas]], that contains a collection of artifacts and relics that aim to "educate the public and preserve the heritage of death care." The 35,000-square-foot museum opened in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thetraveltrolley.com/2012/07/museum-shows-that-death-is-a-celebration-of-life/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum is home to "the country's largest collection of funeral service artifacts and features renowned exhibits on one of man's oldest cultural customs," according to its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmfh.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; For its hallmark exhibit, Celebrating the Lives and Deaths of the Popes, the Museum collaborated with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to highlight the ceremonies surrounding papal funerals.

A '''neologism''' ({{IPAc-en|n|iː|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|ɪ|z|əm}}; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] νέο- ''néo-'', "new" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech, utterance") is a relatively recent or isolated term, word, or phrase that may be in the process of entering common use, but that has not yet been fully accepted into mainstream language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=James M.|editor1-last=Malmkjær|editor1-first=Kirsten|title=The Linguistics encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-43286-X|page=601|edition=Ebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific person, publication, period, or event. In the process of language formation, neologisms are more mature than [[protologism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gryniuk|first1=D|title=On Institutionalization and De-Institutionalization of Late 1990s Neologisms|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=150|quote=This process [of lexicalization] does not seem to be coincidental because neologisms themselves are prone to go through certain stages of transformation. They begin as ''unstable'' creations (otherwise called ''protologisms''), that is, they are extremely new, being proposed, or being used only by a small subculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Neologisms are often created by combining existing words (see [[compound noun and adjective]]) or by giving words new and unique [[suffix]]es or [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es. [[Portmanteaux]] are combined words that are sometimes used commonly. "Brunch" is an example of a portmanteau word (breakfast + lunch).  [[Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll's]] "snark" (snake + shark) is also a portmanteau. Neologisms also can be created through [[abbreviation]] or [[acronym]], by intentionally [[rhyme|rhyming]] with existing words or simply through playing with sounds.

Neologisms can become popular through [[memetics]], by way of [[mass media]], the [[Internet]], and [[word of mouth]], including academic discourse in many fields renowned for their use of distinctive [[jargon]], and often become accepted parts of the language. Other times, however, they disappear from common use just as readily as they appeared. Whether a neologism continues as part of the language depends on many factors, probably the most important of which is acceptance by the public. It is unusual, however, for a word to enter common use if it does not resemble another word or words in an identifiable way.

When a word or phrase is no longer "new", it is no longer a neologism. Neologisms may take decades to become "old", however. Opinions differ on exactly how old a word must be to cease being considered a neologism.

==Sources==
Popular examples of neologism can be found in science, fiction, branding, literature, linguistic and popular culture. Examples include ''[[laser]]'' (1960) from '''L'''ight '''A'''mplification by '''S'''timulated '''E'''mission of '''R'''adiation, ''[[robotics]]'' (1941), ''[[agitprop]]'' (1930).

==History and meaning==
The term ''neologism'' is first attested in English in 1772, borrowed from French ''néologisme'' (1734).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neologism|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00322941|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|format=draft revision|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proponent of a new word or doctrine may be called a neologist.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Neologists might{{vague|date=September 2017}} study cultural and ethnic vernacular.

The term ''neologism'' has a broader meaning that includes not only "an entirely new lexical item" but also an existing word whose meaning has been altered.&lt;ref name="palgrave"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckermann|first1=Ghilʻad|title=Language contact and lexical enrichment in Israeli Hebrew|date=2003|url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1403917232|page=3|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sally Barr Ebest ''Writing from A to Z: the easy-to-use reference handbook'' 1999– p. 449  "A neologism is a newly coined word or phrase or a new usage of an existing word or phrase."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Bowker, Jennifer Pearson ''Working With Specialized Language'' 2002 p. 214 "Neologisms can also be formed in another way, however, by assigning a new meaning to an existing word."&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the latter process is called ''semantic shifting'',&lt;ref name="palgrave"/&gt; or ''semantic extension''.&lt;ref&gt;Ole Nedergaard Thomsen ''Competing models of linguistic change: evolution and beyond'' 2006 – p. 68 "Extensions, by contrast, are applications of extant means in new usage. Note that since individual speakers differ in their command of their shared tradition of speaking, one person's Extension may be experienced by another as a Neologism"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Picone ''Anglicisms, Neologisms and Dynamic French'' 1996 – p. 3 "Proceeding now to the task of defining terms, I will begin with the more general term 'neologism'. ...A neologism is any new word, morpheme or locution and any new meaning for a pre-existent word, morpheme or locution that appears in a language. ... Likewise, any semantic extension of a pre-existent word, morpheme or locution.. but is also, by accepted definition, a neologism."&lt;/ref&gt; Neologisms are distinct from a person's ''[[idiolect]]'', one's unique patterns of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation.

Neologisms are usually introduced when an individual or individuals find that a specific notion is lacking a term in a language, or when the existing vocabulary is insufficiently detailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mesthrie|first1=Rajend|title=Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics|date=1995|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law, governmental bodies, and technology have a relatively high frequency of acquiring neologisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solan|first1=Lawrence|title=The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law|date=2012|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greiffenstern|first1=Sandra|title=The Influence of Computers, the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication on Everyday English|date=2010|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another trigger that motivates neologists and protologists to coin a neologism is in order to disambiguate a previously existing term that may have been obscure or vague due to having multiple senses.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, Robert. "Shadow of a Doubt: A Phantom Caesura in Horace Odes 4.14." Classical Journal, The 109.4 (2014): 407-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
Neologisms may come from a word used in the narrative of a book. Examples include "[[grok]]" from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]; "[[McJob]]" from ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'' by [[Douglas Coupland]]; "[[cyberspace]]" from ''[[Neuromancer]]'' by [[William Gibson]]&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Robin. 2003: "The Generative Edge." Foundation 87 (2003): 73–93.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Quark#Etymology|quark]]" from [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

The title of a book may become a neologism, for instance, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (from the title of [[Joseph Heller]]'s novel). Alternatively, the author's name may give rise to the neologism, although the term is sometimes based on only one work of that author. This includes such words as "[[Orwellian]]" (from [[George Orwell]], referring to his novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'') and "Kafkaesque" (from [[Franz Kafka]]).

Names of famous characters are another source of literary neologisms, e.g. ''[[quixotism|quixotic]]'' (referring to the [[Don Quixote|title character]] in ''[[Don Quixote de la Mancha]]'' by [[Cervantes]]), ''[[Ebenezer Scrooge|scrooge]]'' (from the main character in [[Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'') and ''[[pollyanna]]'' (from [[Eleanor H. Porter]]'s book of the same name).

== Popular culture ==
Culture and technology use are major drivers in neologism development.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, L. J. (2005). The meaning of e- : neologisms as markers of culture and technology /.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forgue, Guy (1979). "American Neologisms as a Reflection of Cultural Change since 1945". ''Proceedings of a Symposium on American Literature'': 199–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of recent pop-culture neologisms include Canadian "[[Snowmageddon]]", Russian "[[Monstration]]".

In these instances, words are used in small communities then spread through the use of social media. "Doggo-Lingo" specifically has spread primarily through [[Facebook]] group and [[Twitter]] account use.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boddy, Jessica (April 23, 2017). [https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/04/23/524514526/dogs-are-doggos-an-internet-language-built-around-love-for-the-puppers "Dogs Are Doggos: An Internet Language Built Around Love For The Puppers"]. ''National Public Radio''.&lt;/ref&gt; The suspected origin of this way of referring to dogs stems from a Facebook group created in 2008 and gaining popularity in 2014 in Australia. The Facebook group called DogSpotting posts pictures of dogs that members have seen with amusing captions, often using Doggo-Lingo. In Australian English it is common to use [[Diminutives in Australian English|diminutives]], often ending in –o, which could be where doggo-lingo was first used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term has grown so that [[Merriam-Webster]] has acknowledged its use but notes the term needs to be found in published, edited work for a longer period of time before it can be deemed a new word making it the perfect example of a neologism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use and over-use of brand names is another example of neologism creation. The terms "coke" or "[[cola]]" may be used in reference to any [[Coca-Cola]] like beverage regardless of brand. [[Kleenex]] is used in reference to any facial tissue. [[Xerox]] or xerox-ing is used in reference to any [[photocopier]] or action of photocopying.&lt;ref&gt;Sayadi, Forough (April 2011). [http://translationjournal.net/journal/56neologisms.htm "The Translation of Neologisms"]. ''Translation Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neologisms can also originate entirely online from [[social media]] and other forms of [[Mass media|Internet media]].

== Translations ==
Because neologisms originate in one language, translations between languages can be difficult.

In the scientific community, where English is the predominant language for published research and studies, like-sounding translations (referred to as 'naturalization') are sometimes used.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linder | first1 = Daniel | year = 2016 | title = Non-native scientists, research dissemination and English neologisms: What happens in the early stages of reception and re-production? | url = | journal = Iberica | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 35–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the English word is used along with a brief explanation of meaning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
The four translation methods are emphasized in order to translate neologisms: transliteration and transcription, the use of analogues, calque and loan translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://termcoord.eu/2015/06/the-translation-of-english-neologisms/|title = The Translation of English Neologisms|website = Terminology Coordination Unit [DGTRAD] |publisher = European Parliament|date = 22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When translating from English to other languages, the naturalization method is most often used.&lt;ref&gt;Lindblad, Jonathan. 2017. "Translation strategies of H.P. Lovecraft’s neologisms into Japanese." ''Networked Digital Library of Theses &amp; Dissertations''&lt;/ref&gt; The most common way that professional translators translate neologisms is through the [[Think aloud protocol]] (TAP), wherein translators find the most appropriate and natural sounding new word through speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moghadas | first1 = Seyed | year = 2014 | title = A Model for Cognitive Process of Neologisms Translation | url = | journal = International Journal of English Language and Translation Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 4–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This way, translators are able to use potential translated neologisms in sentences and test them with different structures and syntax. Correct translations from [[English for specific purposes]] into other languages is crucial in various industries and legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Hui | year = 2014 | title = A Probe Into Translation Strategies of Tech English Neologism in Petroleum Engineering Field | url = | journal = Studies in Literature and Language | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 33–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerremans | first1 = Koen | year = 2014 | title = Studying the Dynamics of Understanding and Legal Neologisms within a Linguistically Diverse Judicial Space: The Case of Motherhood in Belgium | url = | journal = International Conference; Meaning in Translation: Illusion of Precision''. | volume = 231 | issue = | pages = 46–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaccurate translations can lead to 'translation asymmetry' or conceptual misunderstandings which can lead to miscommunication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many technical glossaries of English translations exist to combat this issue in the medical, judicial, and technological fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Navarro | first1 = F | year = 2008 | title = Controversies in dermatology: One-Hundred Fifty English Words and Expressions in Dermatology That Present Difficulties or Pitfalls for Translation Into Spanish | url = | journal = Actas dermosifiliográficas (English Edition) | volume = 99 | issue = 5| pages = 349–362 | doi=10.1016/s1578-2190(08)70268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
In [[psychiatry]] and [[neuroscience]], the term ''neologism'' is used to describe words that have meaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Neologisms|url=|journal=History of Psychiatry|volume=20|issue=4|pages=480–496|last1=Berrios|first1=G. E.|doi=10.1177/0957154x08348532}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of neologisms may also be due to [[aphasia]] acquired after [[brain damage]] resulting from a [[stroke]] or [[Traumatic brain injury|head injury]].&lt;ref&gt;B Butterworth, Hesitation and the production of verbal paraphasias and neologisms in jargon aphasia. Brain Lang, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theology]], a neologism refers to a relatively new doctrine (for example, [[Transcendentalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9VDCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=theology+neologism&amp;q=neologism#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Constructing Local Theologies|date=15 September 2015|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=9781608336111|edition=30th Anniversary|language=en|chapter=1|last1=Schreiter|first1=Robert J.|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">{{distinguish|The Old Wives' Tale (play)}}
An '''old wives' tale''' is a supposed truth which is actually spurious or a superstition. It can be said sometimes to be a type of [[urban legend]], said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered [[superstition]], [[folklore]] or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives' tales often center on women's traditional concerns, such as [[pregnancy]], [[puberty]], [[social relations]], [[health]], [[herbalism]] and [[nutrition]].

== Origins ==
In this context, the word ''wife'' means "woman" rather than "married woman". This usage stems from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|{{wt|ang|wif}}}}'' ("woman") and is akin to the [[German language|German]] ''{{linktext|Weib|lang=de}}'' (also meaning "woman"). This sense of the word is still used in [[Modern English]] in constructions such as ''[[midwife]]'' and ''[[fishwife]]''.

Old wives' tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviors, usually of children, or to share knowledge of [[traditional medicine|folk cures]] for ailments ranging from [[toothaches]] to [[dysentery]].

The concept of old wives' tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the [[King James Bible]] was published with the following translation of the [[Apostle Paul]] writing to his young protégé [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], "But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness" ([[I Timothy]] 4:7 [[KJV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=1Ti&amp;c=4&amp;v=7&amp;t=KJV#7|title=1 Timothy 4:7 (KJV)|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== The oral tradition ===

Old wives' tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or [[coming of age]] easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don't do certain things.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 15 May 2010, Greer, Germaine. "Grandmother's footsteps" http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/may/15/germaine-greer-old-wives-tales&lt;/ref&gt;

These tales have often been collected by literate men, and turned into written works. Fairy tales by [[Giambattista Basile|Basile]], [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]], and the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]] have their roots in the oral tradition of women. These male writers took the stories from women, with their plucky, clever heroines and heroes, and turned them into [[morality tale]]s for children.&lt;ref&gt;Zipes, Jack. ''The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood'', Routledge, 1993 {{ISBN|0-415-90834-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese - Flask - Walters 491632 (square).jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Jingdezhen porcelain]] moonflask with [[underglaze]] blue and red. [[Qianlong]] period, 1736 to 1796]] 
[[File:Franz Anton Bustelli Liebesgruppe 1756-4.jpg|thumb|[[Nymphenburg porcelain]] group modelled by [[Franz Anton Bustelli]], 1756]]
'''Porcelain''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɔːr|s|əl|ᵻ|n}}) is a [[ceramic]] material made by heating materials, generally including [[kaolinite|kaolin]], in a [[kiln]] to temperatures between {{convert|1200|and|1400|°C|°F|-2}}. The toughness, strength, and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of [[pottery]], arises mainly from [[Vitrification#In ceramics|vitrification]] and the formation of the mineral [[mullite]] within the body at these high temperatures.  Though definitions vary, porcelain can be divided into three main categories: [[hard-paste porcelain|hard-paste]], [[soft-paste porcelain|soft-paste]] and [[bone china]]. The category that an object belongs to depends on the composition of the paste used to make the body of the porcelain object and the firing conditions.

Porcelain slowly evolved in China and was finally achieved (depending on the definition used) at some point about 2,000 to 1,200 years ago, then slowly spread to other East Asian countries, and finally Europe and the rest of the world. Its manufacturing process is more demanding than that for [[earthenware]] and [[stoneware]], the two other main types of pottery, and it has usually been regarded as the most prestigious type of pottery for its delicacy, strength, and its white colour.  It combines well with both glazes and paint, and can be modelled very well, allowing a huge range of decorative treatments in tablewares, vessels and [[figurine]]s.  It also has many uses in technology and industry.

The European name, porcelain in English, come from the old Italian ''porcellana'' ([[cowrie shell]]) because of its resemblance to the surface of the shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/147941?redirectedFrom=porcelain#eid29267813|title=Porcelain, n. and adj.|last=|first=|date=|website=Oxford English Dictionary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 Jun 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porcelain is also referred to as '''china''' or '''fine china''' in some English-speaking countries, as it was first seen in imports from China.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "China"; An Introduction to Pottery. 2nd edition. Rado P. Institute of Ceramic / Pergamon Press. 1988. Usage of "china" in this sense is inconsistent, &amp; it may be used of other types of ceramics also.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Properties]] associated with porcelain include low [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]; considerable [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[hardness]], [[toughness]], whiteness, [[Translucent|translucency]] and [[resonance]]; and a high resistance to chemical attack and [[thermal shock]].

[[File:Centro de flores (Porcelana Buen Retiro, MAN 1982-85-5) 01.jpg|thumb|Flower centrepiece, 18th century, Spain]]

Porcelain has been described as being "completely vitrified, hard, impermeable (even before glazing), white or artificially coloured, translucent (except when of considerable thickness), and resonant".&lt;ref&gt;''Harmonized commodity description and coding system: explanatory notes, Volume 3'', 1986, Customs Co-operation Council, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term "porcelain" lacks a universal definition and has "been applied in an unsystematic fashion to substances of diverse kinds which have only certain surface-qualities in common".&lt;ref&gt;Definition in ''The Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities'' defines, Burton, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;  

Traditionally, East Asia only classifies pottery into low-fired wares (earthenware) and high-fired wares (often translated as porcelain), without the European concept of stoneware, which is high-fired but not generally white or translucent.  Terms such as "proto-porcelain", "porcellaneous" or "near-porcelain" may be used in cases where the ceramic body approaches whiteness and translucency.&lt;ref&gt;Valenstein, S. (1998). ''[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/38422/rec/3 A handbook of Chinese ceramics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909025246/http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/38422/rec/3 |date=September 9, 2016 }}'', pp. 22, 59-60, 72, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. {{ISBN|9780870995149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A high proportion of modern porcelain is made of the variant [[bone china]].

== Materials ==
{{further information|Pottery}}
[[Kaolin]] is the primary material from which porcelain is made, even though clay minerals might account for only a small proportion of the whole. The word ''paste'' is an old term for both the unfired and fired materials. A more common terminology for the unfired material is "body"; for example, when buying materials a potter might order an amount of porcelain body from a vendor.

The composition of porcelain is highly variable, but the clay mineral [[kaolinite]] is often a raw material. Other raw materials can include [[feldspar]], [[ball clay]], glass, [[bone ash]], [[steatite]], [[quartz]], [[petuntse]] and [[alabaster]].

The clays used are often described as being long or short, depending on their [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In [[soil mechanics]], plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe the ease with which a clay may be worked. 

Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability. Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.

=== Methods ===
The following section provides background information on the methods used to form, decorate, finish, glaze, and fire ceramic wares.

==== Forming ====
{{Main article|Pottery#Methods of shaping|Ceramic forming techniques}}

==== Glazing ====
Unlike their lower-fired counterparts, porcelain wares do not need [[ceramic glaze|glazing]] to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining. Many types of glaze, such as the iron-containing glaze used on the celadon wares of [[Longquan celadon|Longquan]], were designed specifically for their striking effects on porcelain. [[Biscuit porcelain]] is unglazed.

==== Decoration ====
[[File:Verseuse phénix Musée Guimet 2418.jpg|thumb|[[Song dynasty]] [[celadon]] porcelain with a ''[[fenghuang]]'' spout, 10th century, China]]
Porcelain wares may be decorated under the glaze using pigments that include cobalt and copper or over the glaze using coloured [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]]. Like many earlier wares, modern porcelains are often [[biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]]-fired at around {{convert|1,000|°C|°F}}, coated with glaze and then sent for a second [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]]-firing at a temperature of about {{convert|1,300|°C|°F}} or greater. Another early method is "once-fired", where the glaze is applied to the unfired body and the two fired together in a single operation.

==== Firing ====
In this process, "green" (unfired) ceramic wares are heated to high temperatures in a [[kiln]] to permanently set their shapes.  Porcelain is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware so that the body can vitrify and become non-porous.

== History ==

=== Chinese porcelain ===
{{Main article|Chinese ceramics}}
Porcelain originated in China, and it took a long time to reach the modern material. Until recent times, almost all East Asian porcelain was of the hard-paste type. There is no precise date to separate the production of proto-porcelain from that of porcelain.  Although proto-porcelain wares exist dating from the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC), by the time of the Eastern [[Han dynasty]] period (206 BC–220 AD), glazed ceramic wares had developed into porcelain, which Chinese defined as high-fired ware.&lt;ref name=kelun&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelun|first=Chen|title=Chinese porcelain: Art, elegance, and appreciation|year=2004|publisher=Long River Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-59265-012-5|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOEfZtcSaFEC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528183403/http://books.google.com/books?id=zOEfZtcSaFEC|archivedate=2013-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia" /&gt;  By the late [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618 AD) and early [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD) the additional Western requirements of whiteness and translucency had been achieved,&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 66&lt;/ref&gt; in types such as [[Ding ware]].  The wares were already exported to the [[Islamic world]], where they were highly prized.&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/porcelain.aspx#3|title=''Porcelain''|publisher=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] Sixth Edition. 2008|accessdate=2008-06-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302182136/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/porcelain.aspx#3|archivedate=2009-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cheng /&gt;
[[File:Bowl with dragons, phoenixes, gourds, and characters for happiness.jpg|thumb|left|Bowl with dragons, phoenixes, gourds, and characters for happiness. From the [[Peabody Essex Museum]].]]

Eventually, porcelain and the expertise required to create it began to spread into other areas of East Asia. During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279 AD), artistry and production had reached new heights. The manufacture of porcelain became highly organised, and the kiln sites excavated from this period could fire as many as 25,000 wares.&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;Temple, Robert K.G. (2007). ''The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention'' (3rd edition). London: André Deutsch, pp. 104-5. {{ISBN|978-0-233-00202-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Xing ware is regarded as among the greatest of the Tang dynasty porcelain, Ding ware became the premier porcelain of the Song dynasty.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Nigel |title=Chinese Glazes: Their Origins, Chemistry, and Recreation |publisher=A. &amp; C. Black |publicationplace=London |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4081-4025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD), porcelain wares were being [[Chinese export porcelain|exported]] to Europe. Some of the most well-known [[Chinese ceramics#Types of Chinese porcelain wares|Chinese porcelain art styles]] arrived in Europe during this era, such as the coveted "[[blue-and-white]]" wares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David Harris|title=Looking at European ceramics : a guide to technical terms|year=1993|publisher=The J.

In 1517, Portuguese merchants began direct trade by sea with the Ming dynasty, and in 1598, Dutch merchants followed.&lt;ref name=cheng&gt;{{cite book|last=Te-k'un|first=Cheng|title=Studies in Chinese ceramics|year=1984|publisher=Chinese University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-201-308-7|pages=92–93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3die4xQmNzQC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202180418/https://books.google.com/books?id=3die4xQmNzQC|archivedate=2017-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some porcelains were more highly valued than others in imperial China. The most valued types can be identified by their association with the court, either as tribute offerings, or as products of kilns under imperial supervision.&lt;ref name=Rawson&gt;Rawson, Jessica "Chinese Art", 2007, publisher:the British Museum Press, London, {{ISBN|978-0-7141-2446-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Yuan dynasty]], the largest and best centre of production has made [[Jingdezhen porcelain]].  During the Ming dynasty, Jingdezhen porcelain become a source of imperial pride.  The [[Yongle emperor]] erected a white porcelain brick-faced pagoda at Nanjing, and an exceptionally smoothly glazed type of white porcelain is peculiar to his reign. Jingdezhen porcelain's fame came to a peak during the Qing dynasty.

=== Japanese porcelain ===
[[File:Japanese - Figurine ("Okimono") of a Lion with a Ball - Walters 491757.jpg|thumb|[[Hirado ware]] [[okimono]] (figurine) of a lion with a ball, Japan, 19th century]]
[[File:Nabeshima Dish with Hydrangea Design, c. 1680-1720, Arita, Okawachi kilns, hard-paste porcelain with cobalt and enamels - Gardiner Museum, Toronto - DSC00496.JPG|thumb|[[Nabeshima ware]] dish with [[hydrangea]]s, c. 1680-1720, Arita, Okawachi kilns, hard-paste porcelain with cobalt and enamels]]

Although the Japanese elite were keen importers of Chinese porcelain from early on, they were not able to make their own until the arrival of Korean potters that were taken captive during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)]].  They brought an improved type of kiln, and one of them spotted a source of porcelain clay near [[Arita, Saga|Arita]], and before long several kilns had started in the region. At first their wares were similar to the cheaper and cruder Chinese porcelains with underglaze blue decoration that were already widely sold in Japan; this style was to continue for cheaper everyday wares until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Harris, &amp; Clark, 163-164; Watson, 260&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japanese export porcelain|Exports to Europe]] began around 1660, through the Chinese and the [[Dutch East India Company]], the only Europeans allowed a trading presence. Chinese exports had been seriously disrupted by civil wars as the Ming dynasty fell apart, and the Japanese exports increased rapidly to fill the gap. At first the wares used European shapes and mostly Chinese decoration, as the Chinese had done, but gradually original Japanese styles developed. 

[[Nabeshima ware]] was produced in kilns owned by the families of feudal lords, and were decorated in the Japanese tradition, much of it related to textile design.  This was not initially exported, but used for gifts to other aristocratic families. [[Imari ware]] and [[Kakiemon]] are broad terms for styles of export porcelain with overglaze "enamelled" decoration begun in the early period, both with many sub-types.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Harris, &amp; Clark, 164-165; Watson, 261&lt;/ref&gt;

A great range of styles and manufacturing centres were in use by the start of the 19th century, and as Japan opened to trade in the second half, exports expanded hugely and quality generally declined. Much traditional porcelain continues to replicate older methods of production and styles, and there are several modern industrial manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Harris, &amp; Clark, 165; Watson, 261&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European porcelain ===
[[File:Fonthill vase by Barthelemy Remy 1713.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The [[Fonthill vase]] is the earliest Chinese porcelain object to have reached Europe. It was a Chinese gift for [[Louis the Great of Hungary]] in 1338.]]
[[File:Lettre du pere Entrecolles 1712 du Halde 1735.jpg|thumb|Section of a letter from [[Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles]] about Chinese porcelain manufacturing techniques, 1712, re-published by [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde]] in 1735]]
These exported Chinese porcelains were held in such great esteem in Europe that in English ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly–used synonym for the Italian term ''porcelain''. The first mention of porcelain in Europe is in ''[[Il Milione]]'' by [[Marco Polo]] in XII sec.&lt;ref&gt;cap. CLVIII dell'edizione a cura di L.F. Benedetto, 1928; cap. 153 dell'edizione a cura di V. Pizzorusso Bertolucci&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from copying Chinese porcelain in ''[[faience]]'' ([[Tin-glazed pottery|tin glazed]] [[earthenware]]), the soft-paste [[Medici porcelain]] in 16th-century [[Florence]] was the first real European attempt to reproduce it, with little success.

Early in the 16th century, Portuguese traders returned home with samples of kaolin, which they discovered in China to be essential in the production of porcelain wares. However, the Chinese techniques and composition used to manufacture porcelain were not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="temple" /&gt; Countless experiments to produce porcelain had unpredictable results and met with failure.&lt;ref name="temple" /&gt; In the German state of Saxony, the search concluded in 1708 when [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]] produced a hard, white, translucent type of porcelain specimen with a combination of ingredients, including kaolin and [[alabaster]], mined from a Saxon mine in [[Colditz]].&lt;ref name=burns /&gt;&lt;ref name=richards&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Sarah|title=Eighteenth-century ceramic: Products for a civilised society|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-4465-6|pages=23–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoNAQAAIAAJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528192105/http://books.google.com/books?id=vgoNAQAAIAAJ|archivedate=2013-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a closely guarded trade secret of the Saxon enterprise.&lt;ref name=richards /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wardropper|first=Ian|title=News from a radiant future: Soviet porcelain from the collection of Craig H. and Kay A.

==== Meissen ====
[[File:Teller Schwanenservice.jpg|thumb|[[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] plate from the huge and famous [[Swan Service]], 1737-1742]]
Von Tschirnhaus and [[Johann Friedrich Böttger]] were employed by [[Augustus II the Strong]] and worked at [[Dresden]] and [[Meissen]] in the German state of Saxony. Tschirnhaus had a wide knowledge of science and had been involved in the European quest to perfect porcelain manufacture when, in 1705, Böttger was appointed to assist him in this task. Böttger had originally been trained as a pharmacist; after he turned to alchemical research, he claimed to have known the secret of transmuting dross into gold, which attracted the attention of Augustus. Imprisoned by Augustus as an incentive to hasten his research, Böttger was obliged to work with other alchemists in the futile search for transmutation and was eventually assigned to assist Tschirnhaus.&lt;ref name=burns&gt;{{cite book|last=Burns|first=William E.|title=Science in the enlightenment: An encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=978-1-57607-886-0|pages=38–39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4H9_Zvp80nAC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120134818/https://books.google.com/books?id=4H9_Zvp80nAC|archivedate=2015-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first results of the collaboration between the two was the development of a red stoneware that resembled that of [[Yixing clay|Yixing]].

A workshop note records that the first specimen of hard, white and vitrified European porcelain was produced in 1708. At the time, the research was still being supervised by Tschirnhaus; however, he died in October of that year. It was left to Böttger to report to Augustus in March 1709 that he could make porcelain. For this reason, credit for the European discovery of porcelain is traditionally ascribed to him rather than Tschirnhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Gleeson, Janet. ''The Arcanum'', an accurate [[historical fiction|historic novel]] on the greed, obsession, murder and betrayal that led to the creation of Meissen porcelain. Bantam Books, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen factory]] was established in 1710 after the development of a kiln and a glaze suitable for use with Böttger's porcelain, which required firing at temperatures of up to {{convert|1400|°C|°F|0}} to achieve translucence. Meissen porcelain was ''once-fired'', or ''green-fired''. It was noted for its great resistance to [[thermal shock]]; a visitor to the factory in Böttger's time reported having seen a white-hot teapot being removed from the kiln and dropped into cold water without damage. Although widely disbelieved this has been replicated in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;BBC4 How it works: Ep 3. Ceramics how they work 16 Apr 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Soft paste porcelain ====

[[File:Chantilly porcelain 1750 1760.jpg|thumb|[[Chantilly porcelain]], soft-paste, 1750-1760]]
{{Main article|Soft-paste porcelain}}
The pastes produced by combining clay and powdered glass ([[frit]]) were called ''Frittenporzellan'' in Germany and ''frita'' in Spain.  In France they were known as ''pâte tendre'' and in England as "soft-paste".&lt;ref&gt;Honey, W.B., ''European Ceramic Art'', Faber and Faber, 1952, p.533&lt;/ref&gt; They appear to have been given this name because they do not easily retain their shape in the wet state, or because they tend to slump in the kiln under high temperature, or because the body and the glaze can be easily scratched.

;France
Experiments at [[Rouen]] produced the earliest soft-paste in France, but the first important French soft-paste porcelain was made at the [[Saint-Cloud factory]] before 1702. Soft-paste factories were established with the [[Chantilly porcelain|Chantilly manufactory]] in 1730 and at [[Mennecy]] in 1750. The [[Vincennes porcelain factory]] was established in 1740, moving to larger premises at [http://manufacturedesevres.culture.gouv.fr/site.php?type=P&amp;id=20 Sèvres]&lt;ref&gt;Munger, Jeffrey (October 2004). "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sevr/hd_sevr.htm Sèvres Porcelain in the Nineteenth Century] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903081028/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sevr/hd_sevr.htm |date=September 3, 2016 }}". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 31 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in 1756. Vincennes soft-paste was whiter and freer of imperfections than any of its French rivals, which put Vincennes/Sèvres porcelain in the leading position in France and throughout the whole of Europe in the second half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/porf/hd_porf.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508063931/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/porf/hd_porf.htm |date=May 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Italy
[[Doccia porcelain]] of [[Florence]] was founded in 1735 and remains in production, unlike [[Capodimonte porcelain]] which was moved from [[Naples]] to [[Madrid]] by [[Charles III of Spain|its royal owner]], after producing from 1743-1759.  After a gap of 15 years [[Naples porcelain]] was produced from 1771 to 1806, specializing in [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. All these were very successful, with large outputs of high-quality wares.  In and around [[Venice]], Francesco Vezzi was producing from around 1720 to 1735; survivals are very rare, but less so than from the Hewelke factory, which only lasted from 1758 to 1763. The Cozzi factory fared better, lasting from 1764 to 1812. The Le Nove factory produced from about 1752 to 1773, then was revived from 1781 to 1802.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 102-105: Le Corbellier, 1-29&lt;/ref&gt;     

; England
The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by Thomas Briand to the [[Royal Society]] in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula. In 1749, Thomas Frye took out a [[patent]] on a porcelain containing bone ash.  This was the first [[bone china]], subsequently perfected by [[Josiah Spode]].

In the twenty-five years after Briand's demonstration, a number of factories were founded in England to make soft-paste table-wares and figures:

==== Other developments ====
[[William Cookworthy]] discovered deposits of kaolin in [[Cornwall]], making a considerable contribution to the development of porcelain and other whiteware ceramics in the United Kingdom. Cookworthy's [[Plymouth Porcelain|factory at Plymouth]], established in 1768, used kaolin and [[china stone]] to make porcelain with a body composition similar to that of the Chinese porcelains of the early 18th century.

=== Hard paste ===
{{Main article|Hard-paste porcelain}}

Hard-paste porcelain came from East Asia, specifically China, and some of the finest quality porcelain wares are from this category. The earliest European porcelains were produced at the [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen factory]] in the early 18th century; they were formed from a paste composed of [[kaolin]] and [[alabaster]] and fired at temperatures up to {{convert|1400|°C|°F|0}} in a wood-fired kiln, producing a porcelain of great hardness, translucency, and strength.&lt;ref name=richards /&gt; Later, the composition of the Meissen hard paste was changed and the alabaster was replaced by [[feldspar]] and [[quartz]], allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures. Kaolinite, feldspar and quartz (or other forms of [[silica]]) continue to constitute the basic ingredients for most continental European hard-paste porcelains.

=== Soft paste ===
{{Main article|Soft-paste porcelain}}
Soft-paste porcelains date back from the early attempts by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and [[frit]]. Soapstone and lime were known to have been included in these compositions. These wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing [[kaolin]] clay at high temperatures. As these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation, or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures, they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality. 

Formulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz, feldspars, nepheline syenite or other feldspathic rocks. These were technically superior, and continue to be produced. Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains.&lt;ref name=reed /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Old China Book|year=1903|isbn=978-1-4344-7727-9|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1W96CstNfEgC|author=N.

The English had read the letters of [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles]], which described Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail.&lt;ref name=burton /&gt; One writer has speculated that a misunderstanding of the text could possibly have been responsible for the first attempts to use bone-ash as an ingredient of English porcelain,&lt;ref name=burton /&gt; although this is not supported by researchers and historians.&lt;ref&gt;''Science Of Early English Porcelain''.

== Other uses ==

=== Electric insulating material ===
[[File:Insulator.jpg|thumb|175px|Porcelain insulator for medium-high voltage]]
Porcelain and other [[ceramic materials]] have many applications in engineering, especially [[ceramic engineering]]. Porcelain is an excellent insulator for use at [[high voltage]], especially in outdoor applications, see [[Insulator (electricity)#Material]]. Examples include: terminals for [[high-voltage cable]]s, bushings of [[power transformer]]s, insulation of high frequency [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] and many other components.

=== Building material ===
[[File:Dakinbldg.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Dakin Building]], Brisbane, California using porcelain panels]]
Porcelain can be used as a [[building material]], usually in the form of [[tile]]s or large rectangular panels. Modern porcelain tiles are generally produced by a number of recognised international standards and definitions.&lt;ref&gt;“New American Standard Defines Polished Porcelain By The Porcelain Tile Certification Agency.” Tile Today No.56, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porcelain tile as defined in ASTM C242 – 01(2007) Standard Terminology of Ceramic Whitewares and Related Products published by ASTM International.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers are found across the world&lt;ref&gt;’Manufacturers Of Porcelain Tiles’ Ceram.World Rev. 6, No.19, 1996 … ‘The main manufacturers of porcelain tiles in Italy, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and the Americas are listed.’&lt;/ref&gt; with Italy being the global leader, producing over 380 million square metres in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;”Italian Porcelain Tile Production At The Top” Ind.Ceram. 27, No.2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Historic examples of rooms decorated entirely in porcelain tiles can be found in several European palaces including ones at [[Galleria Sabauda]] in [[Turin]], Museo di Doccia in [[Sesto Fiorentino]], [[Museo di Capodimonte]] in Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2792293957101026524 Porcelain Room, Aranjuez] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} Comprehensive but shaky video&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]].

=== Bathroom fittings ===
[[File:Bourdaloue dsc02723.jpg|thumbnail|right|Porcelain Chamber Pots from Vienna.]]
Because of its durability, inability to rust and impermeability, glazed porcelain has been in use for personal hygiene since at least the third quarter of the 17th century. During this period, porcelain chamber pots were commonly found in higher-class European households, and the term "bourdaloue" was used as the name for the pot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-bourdaloue.htm |title=What is a Bourdaloue? |first= |last= |work=wisegeek.com |year=2014 |accessdate=27 March 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213055214/http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-bourdaloue.htm |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">The '''rhythm band''' is one of the primary methods of introducing children to playing music.  Children are given [[maracas]], [[tambourine]]s, [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]s, [[claves|rhythm sticks]] and other [[idiophone]]s with which to beat out a simple [[rhythm]] while the teacher plays a song, usually on the [[piano]]. Alternatively, the teacher does not play a melody but also a rhythm instrument, so that only rhythms are played. Children can also make a rhythm band "just for fun" for themselves, without a teacher.

[[File:Maracas &amp; Trillerpfeife.ogg|thumb|Very loud maracas, complemented with a whistle, are suitable instruments for an ear-deafening loud rhythm band.]]

[[File:Rhythmband.ogg|thumb|An ear-deafening loud rhythm band with very loud rhythm instruments and noisemakers]]
If the participants like very loud music, [[noisemaker]]s like the [[pea whistle]], the [[Recorder_(educational_uses)#Unconventional_uses|recorder head joint]], the [[vuvuzela]] or the [[ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]] can be included into the rhythm band, as well as other very loud rhythm instruments like the [[snare drum]].

Rhythm bands are usually found in [[nursery school]]s or [[kindergarten]]s, but of course children also can make a rhythm band at home. Melodic instruments are introduced to the children in the first or second year of regular school. But in principle, a rhythm band can be made in every age, with more difficult rhrythms if the participants are older.

It is not uncommon for adult musical organizations to employ numerous rhythm players,  as in [[Latin American music]], or to distribute rhythm instruments for audience members to accompany a live performance.

'''Robert Christian Hansen''' (February 15, 1939 – August 21, 2014), known in the media as the "'''Butcher Baker'''", was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. Between 1971 and 1983, Hansen abducted, raped, and murdered at least 17 women in and around [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], hunting them down in the wilderness with a [[Ruger Mini-14]] and a knife. He was arrested and convicted in 1983 and was sentenced to 461 years and a [[life sentence]] without the possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref name="anchorage"&gt;[http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20140522/butcher-baker-robert-hansen-moved-anchorage-medical-treatment 'Butcher Baker' Robert Hansen moved to Anchorage for medical treatment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627040249/http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20140522/butcher-baker-robert-hansen-moved-anchorage-medical-treatment |date=June 27, 2014 }}, ''Alaska Dispatch''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ktuu.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klint|first1=Chris|title=Serial Killer Robert Hansen Dies in Anchorage|url=http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/serial-killer-robert-hansen-dies-in-anchorage/27664412|accessdate=August 21, 2014|agency=KTTU News|publisher=NBC|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Robert Hansen was born in [[Estherville]], [[Iowa]], in 1939. He was the son of a [[Danish people|Danish]] immigrant and followed in his father's footsteps as a baker. In his youth, he was skinny and painfully shy, afflicted with a [[stutter]] and severe [[acne]] that left him permanently scarred. Shunned by the attractive girls in school, he grew up hating them and nursing fantasies of cruel revenge. Throughout childhood and adolescence, Hansen was described as being quiet and a loner and he had an unhealthy relationship with his domineering father. He started to practice both hunting and [[archery]] and often found refuge in these pastimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Hansen enlisted in the [[United States Army Reserve]] and served for one year before being discharged. He later worked as an assistant drill instructor at a police academy in [[Pocahontas, Iowa]]. There, he began a relationship with a younger woman. He married her in the summer of 1960.

On December 7, 1960, he was arrested for [[arson|burning down]] a [[Pocahontas County, Iowa|Pocahontas County]] Board of Education school bus garage, for which he served 20 months of a three-year prison sentence in [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Oro|first= Rachel|title=Robert Hansen, convicted serial killer in Alaska, dies at 75|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/robert-hansen-dies-at-75-convicted-alaska-serial-killer/2014/08/22/cf2d2acc-2989-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005374/combined|title=''The Frozen Ground''|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife filed for divorce while he was incarcerated. Over the next few years, he was jailed several times for [[petty theft]]. In 1967, he moved to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], with his second wife, whom he had married in 1963 and with whom he had two children. In Anchorage, he was well liked by his neighbors and set several local hunting records.

== Investigation ==
On June 13, 1983, 17-year-old Cindy Paulson escaped from Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; while he was trying to load her into his [[Piper Super Cub]].&lt;ref name="Body Exhumed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newton|first1=Jennifer|title='We just want her to be identified': Body of Alaska serial killer victim exhumed 30 years after she was found dead|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2743173/Body-Alaska-serial-killers-victim-exhumed.html|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=Mail Online|publisher=Daily Mail|date=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told police he had offered her $200 to perform oral sex but that, when she got into the car, he pulled a gun on her and drove her to his home in [[Muldoon, Anchorage|Muldoon]]. There, he held her captive, [[torture|torturing]], [[rape|raping]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] her. She mentioned that, after he chained her by the neck to a post in the house's basement, Hansen took a nap on a nearby couch.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

When he awoke, he put her in his car and took her to [[Merrill Field]] airport, where he told her that he intended to "take her out to his cabin" (a shack in the [[Knik River]] area of the [[Matanuska Valley]] accessible only by boat or [[bush plane]]). Paulson, crouched in the back seat of the car with her wrists cuffed in front of her body, waited to escape until Hansen was busy loading the airplane's cockpit. While Hansen's back was turned, Paulson crawled out of the back seat, opened the driver's side door and ran toward nearby Sixth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She later told police that she had left her blue sneakers on the passenger side floor of the sedan's backseat, as evidence that she had been in the car. Hansen panicked and chased her, but Paulson made it to Sixth Avenue first and managed to flag down a passing truck. The driver, Robert Yount, alarmed by her disheveled appearance, stopped and picked her up. He drove her to the Mush Inn, where she jumped out of the truck and ran inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mushinn.com/index.html |title=Mush Inn Motel|website=www.mushinn.com|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she pleaded with the clerk to phone her boyfriend at the Big Timber Motel, the truck driver continued on to work, where he called the police to report the barefoot, handcuffed woman.

When [[Anchorage Police Department]] officers arrived at the Mush Inn, they were told that the young woman had taken a cab to the Big Timber Motel. APD officers arrived at Room 110 of the Big Timber Motel and found Cindy Paulson, still handcuffed and alone. She was taken to APD [[headquarters]], where she described the perpetrator. Hansen, when questioned by APD officers, denied the accusation, stating that Paulson was just trying to cause some trouble because he would not pay her [[extortion]] demands. Although Hansen had several prior run-ins with the law, his meek demeanour and humble occupation as a baker, along with a strong alibi from his friend John Henning, kept him from being considered as a serious suspect and the case went [[cold case|cold]].

Detective Glenn Flothe of the [[Alaska State Troopers]] had been part of a team investigating the discovery of several bodies in and around [[Anchorage]], [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] and the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] area. The first of the bodies was found by construction workers near Eklutna Road. The body, dubbed "[[Eklutna Annie]]" by investigators, has never been identified. Later that year, the body of Joanna Messina was discovered in a gravel pit near Seward and in 1982, the remains of 23-year-old Sherry Morrow were discovered, in a shallow grave near the [[Knik River]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Flothe now had three bodies and what looked like one killer.

He contacted [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Special Agent [[Roy Hazelwood]] and requested help with a [[offender profiling|criminal psychological profile]], based on the three recovered bodies. Hazelwood thought that the killer would be an experienced hunter with low [[self-esteem]], have a history of being rejected by women and would feel compelled to keep "souvenirs" of his murders, such as a victim's jewelry. He also suggested that the assailant might stutter. Using this profile, Flothe investigated possible suspects until he reached Hansen, who fit the profile and owned a plane.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported by Paulson's testimony and Hazelwood's profile, Flothe and the APD secured a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] to search Hansen's plane, cars and home. On October 27, 1983, investigators uncovered jewelry belonging to some of the missing women, as well as an array of firearms in a corner hideaway of Hansen's attic. Also found was an aviation map with little "x" marks on it, hidden behind Hansen's [[headboard (furniture)|headboard]].

When confronted with the evidence found in his home, Hansen denied it as long as he could but he eventually began to blame the women and tried to justify his motives. Eventually, confessing to each item of evidence as it was presented to him, he admitted to a spree of attacks against Alaskan women starting in 1971. Hansen's earliest victims were young women, usually between 16 and 19 and not sex workers, unlike the victims who led to his discovery.

* Megan Emerick, 17 (denied, but suspected because of x on aviation map, body not found)
* Mary Thill, 22 (denied, but suspected because of x on aviation map, body not found)

Of these 17 women, Hansen was only formally charged with the murder of four - Sherry Morrow, Joanna Messina, Eklutna Annie and Paula Goulding. He was also charged with the kidnapping and rape of Cindy Paulson.

== Imprisonment ==
[[File:SpringCreekEntrance.jpg|thumb|[[Spring Creek Correctional Center]], where Hansen was incarcerated for many years]]
Once arrested, Hansen was charged with [[assault]], [[kidnapping]], multiple weapons offenses, and [[theft]] and [[insurance fraud]]. The last charge was related to a claim filed with the insurance company over alleged theft of some trophies, whose funds he used to purchase the Super Cub. At trial, he claimed he later recovered the trophies in his backyard but forgot to inform the insurer.

Only after [[ballistics|ballistics tests]] returned a match between bullets found at the crime scenes and Hansen's rifle, did he enter into a [[plea bargain]]. He pleaded guilty to the four homicides the police had evidence for (Morrow, Messina, Goulding and Eklutna Annie) and provided details about his other victims, in return for serving his sentence in a federal prison, along with no publicity in the press. Another condition of the plea bargain was his participation in deciphering the markings on his aviation map and locating his victims' bodies. He confirmed the police theory of how the women were abducted, adding that he would sometimes let a potential victim go if she convinced him that she wouldn't report him to police. He indicated that he began killing in the early 1970s.

He showed investigators 17 grave sites, in and around [[Southcentral Alaska]], 12 of which were unknown to investigators. There remained marks on his map that he refused to give up, including three in [[Resurrection Bay]], near Seward (authorities suspect two of these marks belong to the graves of Mary Thill and Megan Emrick, whom Hansen has denied killing). The remains of 12 (of a probable 21) victims were exhumed by the police and returned to their families. Hansen was sentenced by [[jury]] to 461 years plus life in prison, without the possibility of parole. He was first imprisoned at the [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg]] in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1988, he was returned to Alaska and briefly incarcerated at [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]] Correctional Center in [[Juneau]]. He was also imprisoned at [[Spring Creek Correctional Center]] in [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] until May 2014, when he was transported to the [[Anchorage Correctional Complex]] for health reasons.&lt;ref name="anchorage" /&gt;

==Death==
Hansen died at the age of 75, at Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage on August 21, 2014, due to undisclosed, lingering health conditions.&lt;ref name="ktuu.com"/&gt;

==Media adaptations==

===Film===
* [[John Cusack]] portrayed Hansen in the film ''[[The Frozen Ground]]'' (2013), opposite [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sergeant Jack Halcombe (a character based on Glenn Flothe) and [[Vanessa Hudgens]] as victim Cindy Paulson.&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staskiewics|first= Keith|title=Serial Killer on the Big Screen|work=Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20515639,00.html|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt;
*''[[Naked Fear]]'' (2007) directed by Thom Eberhardt and starring Danielle De Luca is loosely based on characteristics apparent in the real-life modus operandi of Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen.

===Television===
Documentaries:
* ''[[The FBI Files]]'' episode, "Hunter's Game" (1999), depicts Hansen's murderous rampage.
* ''[[Crime Stories (TV series)|Crime Stories]]'' featured a full 2007 episode of the case.

* ''[[Hidden City (TV series)|Hidden City]]'' season 1, episode 12 ("Anchorage: Robert Hansen's Most Dangerous Game, the Legend of Blackjack Sturges, Eskimo Hu"; airdate February 21, 2012), on the [[Travel Channel]], covered the Hansen case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=TVGuide|title=Anchorage: Robert Hansen's Most Dangerous Game, the Legend of Blackjack Sturges, Eskimo Hu|date=February 21, 2012|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/hidden-city-2012/episode-12-season-1/anchorage-robert-hansens-most-dangerous-game-the-legend-of-blackjack-sturges-eskimo-hu/347657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TV series:
* "Mind Hunters" and "The Woods", two 2005 episodes of the [[CBS]] TV series ''[[Cold Case]]'', were inspired by Hansen's crimes.
* In [[Criminal Minds (season 5)|''Criminal Minds'' season 5]], episode 21 ("Exit Wounds"; airdate May 12, 2010), Hansen is referred to by name.
* Hansen's crimes also inspired [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)|''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', season 13]], episode 15 ("[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)#Episodes|Hunting Ground]]"; airdate February 22, 2012), which depicts a serial killer who hunts women like wild game before killing them.

'''Semimobile''' is an [[ethnological]] term for a practice noted among a number of [[Indigenous Peoples]] of the [[Upper Amazon]], such as the [[Urarina]][http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]. This symbiotic form of indigenous production, exchange and consumption articulates among nomadic patterns of residence, agricultural practices and extractive pursuits animated by the [[modernist]] desires of the [[global economy]].

'''Sheep farming''' is the raising and [[Selective breeding|breeding]] of [[Sheep|domestic sheep]]. It is a branch of [[animal husbandry]]. Sheep are raised principally for their meat ([[lamb and mutton]]), milk ([[sheep's milk]]), and fiber ([[wool]]). They also yield [[sheepskin]] and [[parchment]].

Sheep can be raised in range of temperate climates, including arid zones. Farmers build [[fence]]s, housing, [[shearing shed]]s and other facilities on their property, such as for water, feed, transport and pest control. Most farms are managed so sheep can [[grazing|graze]] pastures, sometimes under the control of a [[shepherd]] or [[sheep dog]].

The major sources of income for a farm will come from the sale of lambs and the [[Sheep shearing|shearing]] of sheep for their [[wool]]. Farmers can select from various [[List of sheep breeds|breeds]] suitable for their region and market conditions. When the farmer sees that a ewe (female adult) is showing signs of heat or [[estrus]], they can organise for mating with males. Newborn lambs are typically subject to tail [[Docking (animal)|docking]] and males may be [[castration|castrated]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheep101.info A Beginner's Guide to Raising Sheep] Sheep: A Beginner's Guide to Raising Sheep.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sheep production worldwide==
[[File:Sheep farming in Namibia (2017).jpg|thumb|300px|Sheep farming in [[Namibia]] (2017)]]
According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]] database of the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the top five countries by number of heads of sheep (average from 1993 to 2013) were: [[mainland China]] (146.5 million heads), [[Australia]] (101.1 million), [[India]] (62.1 million), [[Iran]] (51.7 million), and the former [[Sudan]] (46.2 million).&lt;ref name="FAOSTAT"&gt;[http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QA/E FAOSTAT] database.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the five countries with the largest number of heads of sheep were mainland China (175 million), Australia (75.5 million), India (53.8 million), the former Sudan (52.5 million), and Iran (50.2 million). In 2013, the number of heads of sheep were distributed as follows: 44% in Asia, 28.2% in Africa; 11.2% in Europe, 9.1% in Oceania, 7.4% in the Americas.

The top producers of sheep meat (average from 1993 to 2013) were as follows: mainland China (1.6 million); Australia (618,000), [[New Zealand]] (519,000), the [[United Kingdom]] (335,000), and [[Turkey]] (288,857).&lt;ref name="FAOSTAT"/&gt; The top five producers of sheep meat in 2013 were mainland China (2 million), Australia (660,000), New Zealand (450,000), the former Sudan (325,000), and Turkey (295,000).&lt;ref name="FAOSTAT"/&gt;

===U.S. sheep production===
In the [[United States]], inventory data on sheep began in 1867, when 45 million head of sheep were counted in the United States.&lt;ref name="ERS"&gt;[http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/sheep,-lamb-mutton/background.aspx Sheep, Lamb &amp; Mutton: Background], [[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[Economic Research Service]] (last updated May 26, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  The numbers of sheep peaked in 1884 at 51 million head, and then declined over time to almost 6 million head.&lt;ref name="ERS"/&gt;

Since the 1960s, per capita consumption of lamb and mutton declined from nearly 5 pounds to just about 1 pound, due to competition from poultry, pork, beef, and other meats.&lt;ref name="ERS"/&gt; Since the 1990s, U.S. sheep operations declined from around 105,000 to around 80,000 due to shrinking revenues and low rates of return.&lt;ref name="ERS"/&gt; According to the [[Economic Research Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the "sheep industry accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. livestock industry receipts."&lt;ref name="ERS"/&gt;

'''''The Dybbuk: An Opera in Yiddish''''' is an opera in three acts by American composer Solomon Epstein. The [[libretto]] was adapted by the composer from [[S. Ansky]]'s 1914 play ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' and is apparently the world's first original [[Yiddish language]] opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katzenell|first1=Jack|title=Yiddish Opera opens in Israel|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1999/Yiddish-Opera-Opens-in-Israel/id-528bbe05f8a7865409660db1fded1ff3|accessdate=29 April 1999|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was premiered and recorded at the [[Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater]], Tel Aviv, and at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev|Ben-Gurion University]], Beersheba, in May 1999. The opera was staged in a 70 minute abridged version using the composer's [[piano-vocal score]].

Yiddish, spoken mainly by European Jews up until World War II, is now an endangered language.

'''''The Pope and the Witch''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] title: ''Il Papa e la strega'')&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell 1999, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Satire|satirical]] play by [[Dario Fo]], first performed in 1989. It depicts the Pope as a paranoid, drug-addled idiot and the Vatican as corrupt.

Fo, an Italian actor-playwright awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], is known for aiming his sarcasm and slapstick comedy at authority, and in ''The Pope and the Witch'' he takes dead aim at the highest levels of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name='nytimes1'&gt;{{cite news|first=Lawrence|last=Van Gelder|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=990de2dc163af93ba25756c0a9669c8b63|title=THEATER REVIEW; A Nemesis Converts The Pope|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=200-05-18|accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
At the outset, the nameless pope, with 100,000 orphans waiting in St. Peter's Square and the world's press assembled for a news conference in the Vatican, is in the throes of paranoia, believing that the appearance of the children is sponsored by manufacturers of condoms in a plot to embarrass the Church.&lt;ref name='nytimes1'/&gt;

The witch, in nun's habit, turns up as an aide to the doctor summoned to treat the pope, and before long the Holy Father is seized with a paralytic affliction that, among other names, is known as ''a crucifixion stroke,'' leaving him with his arms outstretched.

==2006 U.S. incident==
In October 2006, top Catholic leaders in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]] took the rare step of collectively calling on [[University of Minnesota]] president, [[Robert Bruininks]], to reconsider the university's plan to stage a controversial play which they viewed as anti-Catholic.

Archbishop [[Harry Joseph Flynn|Harry Flynn]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis|Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis]], along with bishops from [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Crookston|Crookston]] to [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Winona|Winona]], wrote to Bruininks calling the play offensive to the state's 1.6 million Catholics. They urged Bruininks to rethink the staging of the play in March 2007.

'''Uri (Uli)''' is the name given to the traditional designs drawn by the [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]]. Uri drawings are strongly [[linear]] and do not have deep perspective; they do, however, balance positive and negative space.  Designs are frequently [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and are often painted spontaneously.  ''Uri'' generally is not sacred, apart from those images painted on the walls of [[shrine]]s and created in conjunction with some community rituals.

The drawing of ''uri'' was once practiced throughout most of [[Igboland]], although by 1970 it had lost much of its popularity, and was being kept alive by a handful of contemporary artists.  It was usually practiced by women, who would decorate each other's bodies with dark [[dye]]s to prepare for village events, such as [[marriage]], title taking, and [[funeral]]s; designs would sometimes be produced for the most important market days as well.  Designs would last about a week.

Most ''uri'' designs were named, and many differed among various Igbo regions.  Some were abstract, using patterns such as [[zigzag]]s and [[concentric]] [[circle]]s, while others stood for household objects like [[chair|stool]]s and [[Pottery|pots]].  Some represented animals such as [[Pythonidae|python]]s and [[lizard]]s; others showed plants, like [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] leaves, or heavenly bodies, including a crescent [[moon]] and [[star]]s.  Still other designs depicted cutting and other actions.

The use of ''uri'' was not limited to the human body.  Igbo women would also paint murals of designs on the walls of compounds and houses.  These generally used four colors which could be created from natural bases easily found in the area; [[black]] was made from [[charcoal]], [[red]]dish [[brown]] from the [[camwood]] tree, [[yellow]] from either soil or tree bark, and [[white]] from clay.  When the [[Great Britain|British]] invaded the area at the turn of the twentieth century, they brought with them a commercial [[Bluing (fabric)|laundry additive]] which some painters used to create [[blue]] pigment.  ''Uri'' was not only meant to express a specific message. It was also meant to beautify the female body and buildings to which it was applied, as beauty is equated with [[morality]] in Igbo culture.

Today the practice of ''uri'' is being kept alive by, among others, Anam people who continues to pass the knowledge and use the culture and the artists of the [[Nsukka group]], who have appropriated its designs and incorporated them into other media.

'''''Volver''''' ({{IPA-es|bolˈβeɾ}}, meaning "to go back") is a 2006 Spanish [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Pedro Almodóvar]]. Headed by actress [[Penélope Cruz]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] also starring [[Carmen Maura]], [[Lola Dueñas]], [[Blanca Portillo]], [[Yohana Cobo]], and [[Chus Lampreave]]. Revolving around an eccentric family of women from a wind-swept region south of [[Madrid]], Cruz plays Raimunda, a working-class woman forced to go to great lengths to protect her 14-year-old daughter Paula. To top off the family crisis, her mother Irene comes back from the dead to tie up loose ends.

The plot originates in Almodóvar's earlier film ''[[The Flower of My Secret]]'' (1995), where it features as a novel which is rejected for publication but is stolen to form the screenplay of a film named ''The Freezer''. Drawing inspiration from the [[Italian neorealism]] of the late 1940s to early 1950s and the work of pioneering directors such as [[Federico Fellini]], [[Luchino Visconti]], and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], ''Volver'' addresses themes like [[sexual abuse]], [[loneliness]] and [[death]], mixing the genres of [[farce]], [[tragedy]], [[melodrama]], and [[magic realism]]. Set in the [[La Mancha]] region, Almodovar's place of birth, the filmmaker cited his upbringing as a major influence on many aspects of the plot and the characters.

''Volver'' premiered at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]]. It received critical acclaim and ultimately won two awards at the festival, for Best Actress (shared by the six main actresses) and [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Screenplay]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4332959/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Volver |accessdate=2009-12-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's Spanish premiere was held on 10 March 2006 in [[Puertollano]], [[Spain]], where the filming had taken place. Cruz was nominated for the 2006 [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], making her the first Spanish woman ever to be nominated in that category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|first=Missy|last=Schwartz|url=http://ew.com/article/2006/11/03/penelope-cruzs-return-greatness/|title=Penelope Cruz's return to greatness|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=November 3, 2006|access-date=January 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Raimunda ([[Penélope Cruz]]) and Sole ([[Lola Dueñas]]) are sisters who grew up in Alcanfor de las Infantas, a small village in [[La Mancha]], but now both live in [[Madrid]]. Their parents had died in a fire three years before.

Sole returns for the funeral of her elderly, [[dementia]]-stricken Aunt Paula ([[Chus Lampreave]]). Aunt Paula's neighbour Agustina ([[Blanca Portillo]]) confesses to Sole that she has heard Paula talking to the ghost of their mother Irene ([[Carmen Maura]]). Sole encounters the ghost herself, and when she returns to [[Madrid]], she discovers that the ghost has stowed away in the trunk of her car. Sole agrees to let Irene stay with her: Sole operates a hair salon in her apartment, and Irene will assist her. Irene says that she wants to know why Raimunda hates her, and why she herself is afraid to reveal herself to Raimunda.

Meanwhile, Raimunda and her daughter Paula ([[Yohana Cobo]]) have a different death to cope with. Paula's father Paco (Antonio de la Torre) attempts to [[rape]] her, claiming that he is not really her father, and Paula stabs him in self-defense. Raimunda hides the corpse in the deep-freezer of a nearby restaurant with an absent owner, Emilio (Carlos Blanco). When members of a film crew happen upon the restaurant, Raimunda strikes a deal to cater for them, and finds herself back in the restaurant business.

Raimunda reveals to Paula that Paco was not her biological father, and promises to tell her the whole story later. Agustina is diagnosed with terminal [[cancer]] and goes to Madrid for treatment. Raimunda visits her in the hospital. Agustina asks Raimunda if she has seen her mother's ghost. Agustina hopes that the ghost will be able to tell her about her own mother, who disappeared three years before. Raimunda leaves Paula with Sole, rents a van and transports the freezer to a convenient spot by the river [[Júcar]]. While staying in Sole's apartment, Paula meets her grandmother's ghost and grows close to her. The next night, Agustina comes to the restaurant, and Raimunda reveals two startling secrets: her father and Agustina's mother were having an affair, and Agustina's mother disappeared on the same day that Raimunda's parents died.

Sole tells Raimunda that she has seen their mother's ghost, who is in the next room with Paula. Irene admits that she did not, in fact, die in the fire, and reveals the whole truth. The reason for Raimunda and Irene's estrangement is that Raimunda's father [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her, resulting in the birth of Paula; thus, Paula is Raimunda's daughter and her sister. Irene tells Raimunda that she did not know about the abuse until Aunt Paula told her about it, and never forgave herself for failing to stop it.

Irene explains that she found her husband in bed with another woman and started the fire that killed them both. The ashes that had been presumed to be Irene's were, in fact, the ashes of Agustina's mother, the woman with whom Irene's husband was having an affair. After the fire, Irene wandered for several days in the countryside, until she decided that she wanted to turn herself in. But first, she wanted to say goodbye to Paula, who had lost the ability to look after herself and with whom Irene had been living prior to setting the fire. Paula welcomed Irene home as if nothing had happened, and Irene stayed, caring for her sister and expecting that the police would come soon to arrest her. Due to the superstitious and closed nature of the community, however, the police never came and the residents, accustomed to tales of the dead returning, explained the rare sightings of Irene as "un fantasma", a ghost.

The family reunites at Aunt Paula's house. Irene reveals her presence to Agustina, who believes her to be a ghost. Irene pledges to stay in the village and care for Agustina as her cancer worsens, saying to Raimunda that it was the least that she could do after killing Agustina's mother. Raimunda visits her mother at Agustina's house, and the two embrace and promise to repair their relationship.

==Production==

===Origins===
''Volver'' was first developed by Pedro Almodóvar, based on a story actress [[Marisa Paredes]] told him during the production of their 1995 film ''[[The Flower of My Secret]]'', another film set in the [[La Mancha]] region.&lt;ref name="cineuropa-pa"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Carlo|last=D'Ursi|title=Interview with Pedro Almodóvar, Director| magazine=Cineuropa|publisher=Cineuropa.org| url=http://cineuropa.org/ffocusinterview.aspx?lang=en&amp;treeID=1205&amp;documentID=62911|date=March 14, 2006| accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story revolved around a heartbroken [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] man who opts to kill his mother-in-law in hopes of reuniting with his beloved wife, who left him and broke off contact, at her mother's funeral. Owning a restaurant, he leaves it in his neighbour's care, when he is about to kill his victim.&lt;ref name="cineuropa-pa"/&gt; Fascinated by the story and its background, Almodóvar decided on incorporating elements of it into the screenplay of ''The Flower of My Secret'', making it the plot of a movie-within-the-movie based on the main character's novel in the film.&lt;ref name="cineuropa-pa"/&gt; While working on the script for ''Volver'', he would however settle on outlining the role of the neighbour Raimunda, as the film's central character, while Emilio, the Puerto Rican, eventually became a supporting role only.&lt;ref name="cineactual"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Armando|last1=Pérez|first2=Jennifer|last2=Rey|title=Volver:Regreso A La Mancha|work=Cineactual|publisher=Cineactual.net|url=http://www.cineactual.net/volver-regreso-a-la-mancha/|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almodóvar says of the story that "it is precisely about death...More than about death itself, the screenplay talks about the rich culture that surrounds death in the region of [[La Mancha]], where I was born.

Penélope Cruz was the first reported to have landed one of the starring roles in ''Volver'', having previously worked with Almodóvar on his films ''[[Live Flesh (film)|Live Flesh]]'' (1997) and ''[[All About My Mother]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="offnews1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Penélope Cruz Meets Carmen Maura In "Volver", To Be Filmed On Madrid And Castilla La Mancha|url=http://www.clubcultura.com/clubcine/clubcineastas/almodovar/eng/engnoticias.htm|website=Clubcultura.com|date=May 16, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparing for her role, the actress watched [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealism films]] from the 1950s, many of them starring [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Claudia Cardinale]], to study "the Italian ''maggiorate''" that Almodóvar envisioned for her performance in the film.&lt;ref name="cineuropa-pa"/&gt; Cruz, who had to wear a prosthetic bottom while filming, noted the role of Raimunda as "the best gift an actress can get".&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web| first=Rebecca| last=Murray| url=http://movies.about.com/od/volver/a/volverpc101506.htm| title=Penelope Cruz Talks About "Volver"| website=[[About.com]]| date=May 16, 2005| accessdate=August 26, 2011| archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bcq1cAqD?url=http://movies.about.com/od/volver/a/volverpc101506.htm#| archive-date=2012-10-23| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carmen Maura, the star of Almodóvar's debut ''[[Pepi, Luci, Bom]]'' (1980) and five additional films with the director, was the first to be cast in the film alongside Cruz.&lt;ref name="offnews1"/&gt; Her engagement marked her first collaboration with Almodóvar after a period of 18 years and a reported fallout during the production of ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="cineuropa-cm"&gt;{{cite web|first=Carlo|last=D'Ursi|title=Interview with Carmen Maura, Actress|work=Cineuropa|publisher=Cineuropa.org|url=http://cineuropa.org/ffocusinterview.aspx?lang=en&amp;treeID=1205&amp;documentID=62913|date=March 14, 2006|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maura commented on the "[[Borderline personality disorder|borderline]] character" of Irene as a "very complicated [role to play]".&lt;ref name="cineuropa-cm"/&gt;

==Music==
The tango "Volver" by [[Carlos Gardel]] with lyrics by [[Alfredo Le Pera]] is converted to [[flamenco]] and is sung in the movie with the voice of [[Estrella Morente]] and [[lip sync]]ed by Penélope Cruz. The dance tune playing at the party prior to Raimunda's lip syncing is called "Good Thing" by the British three-piece indie-dance combo [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]].

==Reception==
===Box office===
In the US alone, the film had made $12,897,993 (15.4% of total) at the box office after 26.4 weeks of release in 689 theatres. The box office figure from the rest of the world is somewhere in the region of $71,123,059 (84.6% of total) according to [[Box Office Mojo]].

As of 22 January 2007 the film had grossed $12,241,181 at the Spanish box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&amp;id=volver.htm Volver (2006) – International Box Office Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from boxofficemojo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
[[File:Pedro Almodovar and Penélope Cruz 2.jpg|thumb|Almodóvar and Cruz on the red carpet at the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|2006 Prince of Asturias Awards]].]]''Fotogramas'', Spain's top film magazine, gave it a five-star rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotogramas.es/Peliculas/Volver/ Volver (2006)], Fotogramas.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its U.S. release, [[A. O. Scott]] made it an "NYT Critics' Pick" and wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= A. O.|last= Scott|authorlink=A. O. Scott|url= http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/movies/03volv.html|title=The Darkest of Troubles in the Brightest of Colors|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=new York Times Company|location=New York City|date=November 3, 2006|accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To relate the details of the narrative—death, cancer, betrayal, parental abandonment, more death—would create an impression of dreariness and woe. But nothing could be further from the spirit of ''Volver'' which is buoyant without being flip, and consoling without ever becoming maudlin. Mr. Almodóvar acknowledges misfortune—and takes it seriously—from a perspective that is essentially comic. Very few filmmakers have managed to smile so convincingly in the face of misery and fatality: Jean Renoir and Billy Wilder come immediately to mind, and Mr. Almodóvar, if he is not yet their equal, surely belongs in their company. ''Volver'' is often dazzling in its artifice—[[José Luis Alcaine]]'s ripe cinematography, Alberto Iglesias's suave, heart-tugging score— but it is never false. It draws you in, invites you to linger and makes you eager to return.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave it his top rating of {{Rating|4|4}} (four stars out of 4), calling it "enchanting, gentle, transgressive" and notes "Almodovar is above all a director who loves women—young, old, professional, amateur, mothers, daughters, granddaughters, dead, alive. Here his cheerful plot combines life after death with the concealment of murder, success in the restaurant business, the launching of daughters and with completely serendipitous solutions to (almost) everyone's problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink= Roger Ebert|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/volver-2006|title= Volver |newspaper=[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]|date= November 22, 2006|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the film has a "Certified Fresh" rating from critics at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], scoring a 92% based on 148 "fresh" reviews out of 161 critics, with the general consensus being "''Volver'' catches director Pedro Almodóvar and star Penélope Cruz at the peak of their respective powers, in service of a layered, thought-provoking film".&lt;ref&gt;{{Rotten-tomatoes|volver|Volver}}.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Women's cinema''' is a variety of topics bundled together to create the work of women in film.  This can include women filling behind the scene roles such as director, cinematographer, writer, and producer while also addressing the stories of women and character development through screenplays.

Renowned female directors include [[Kathryn Bigelow]], who is the only woman to receive an academy award for best director&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/08/kathryn-bigelow-oscars-best-director|title=Kathryn Bigelow makes history as first woman to win best director Oscar|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=2010-03-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, along with many other women directors from around the world such as [[Mary Harron]], [[Jane Campion]], [[Sofia Coppola]], and [[Catherine Hardwicke]].  Many successful cinematographers are also women, including [[Maryse Alberti]], [[Reed Morano]] and Zoe White. 

Women's cinema recognizes women's contributions all over the world, not only to narrative films but to documentaries as well.  Recognizing the work of women occurs through various festivals and awards, such as the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Cinema: The Contested Screen|last=Butler|first=Alison|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2002|isbn=9781903364277|location=|pages=1–3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women's cinema is a complex, critical, theoretical, and institutional construction", Alison Butler explains.  The concept has had its fair share of criticisms, causing some female filmmakers to distance themselves from it in fear of be associated with marginalization and ideological controversy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Famous women in film history==

===Silent films===
[[Alice Guy-Blaché]] was a film pioneer and likely the first female director. Working for the [[Gaumont Film Company]] in France at the time that the cinema was being invented, she created ''[[La Fée aux Choux]]'' (1896). The dates of many early films are speculative, but ''La Fée aux Choux'' may well be the first narrative film ever released.&lt;ref name="Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Joan|title=Alice Guy Blaché Cinema Pioneer|isbn=978-0-300-15250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as Gaumont's head of production from 1896 to 1906 and ultimately produced hundreds of [[silent film]]s in France and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/alice-guy-blache/|title=Education &amp; Resources – National Women's History Museum – NWHM|website=www.nwhm.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American-born director, [[Lois Weber]] was coached and inspired by Guy-Blaché and found success in creating silent films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/education-resources/biography/biographies/lois-weber/|title=Education &amp; Resources – National Women's History Museum – NWHM|website=www.nwhm.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber is well known for her films [[The Hypocrites (1915 film)|''Hypocrites'']] (1915), ''[[The Blot]]'' (1921), and ''[[Suspense (1913 film)|Suspense]]'' (1913). Weber's films often focus on difficult social issues. For instance, her film ''[[Where Are My Children?]] (1916)'' addresses the controversial issues of [[birth control]] and [[abortion]]. And she questioned the validity of [[capital punishment]] in ''[[The People vs. John Doe]]'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Lois_Weber.aspx|title=Lois Weber Facts, information, pictures |website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mabel Normand]] was another significant early female filmmaker. She started as an actress and became a producer-writer-director in the 1910s, working on the first shorts [[Charlie Chaplin]] did as [[The Tramp]] at [[Mack Sennett]]'s [[Keystone Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charliechaplin.com/en/filming/articles/212-Chaplin-at-Keystone-The-Tramp-is-Born|title=Charlie Chaplin : Chaplin at Keystone: The Tramp is Born|website=www.charliechaplin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further collaborated with Sennett on other Keystone films and, during the late 1910s and early 1920s, she had her own movie studio and production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harper Fussell| first = Betty| authorlink = Betty Fussell| publisher = Limelight Editions| edition=   Illustrated| year= 1992| title = Mabel: Hollywood's First I-Don't-Care Girl| isbn = 978-0-87910-158-9| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pd4nAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=isbn%3A9780879101589| accessdate = July 29, 2010| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women screenwriters were highly sought after in the early years of the cinema. [[Frances Marion]], [[Anita Loos]], and [[June Mathis]] all had successful careers in the silent and early-sound eras. Mathis was also the first female executive in [[Hollywood]].

In Sweden, [[Anna Hofman-Uddgren]] was that country's first female film maker—producing the silent film ''[[Stockholmsfrestelser]]'' in 1911. She also acted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marika V. Lagercrantz |chapter-url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-20370 |chapter=En oavslutad berättelse. Om varietéstjärnan Anna Hofmann |year=2009 |title=Kulturellt: Reflektioner i Erling Bjurströms anda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Hollywood===
As the American cinema became a highly commercialized industry in the 1920s and its content became more and more conventionalized, the opportunities for women producers and directors became fewer and fewer. By the time sound arrived in the US in 1927 and the years immediately after, women's roles behind the camera were largely limited to scriptwriters, costume designers, set decorators, make-up artists, and the like. And the industry's implementation of self-censorship in the form of the [[Hays Code]] in 1934 meant that topics such as birth control and abortion were taboo. [[Dorothy Arzner]] was the only woman director to survive in this unfriendly environment. She did so by producing well made but formally rather conventional films. Nevertheless, it is possible to trace feminist elements in her films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite av media|title=The Women Who Run Hollywood|author=Clara Kuperberg, Julia Kuperberg|year=2016|work= Wichita Films|format=documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics find her film, ''[[Dance, Girl, Dance]]'', about two women struggling to make it in show business, to be particularly interesting from a feminist perspective. When the film was selected for inclusion in the [[National Film Registry]], it was noted that "The dancers, played by [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Lucille Ball]], strive to preserve their own feminist integrity, while fighting for their place in the spotlight and for the love of male lead [[Louis Hayward]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2007.html Librarian of Congress Announces National Film Registry Selections for 2007], from the [[Library of Congress]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond ''Dance, Girl, Dance'', Arzner also worked with some of Hollywood's most formidable actresses—including [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Christopher Strong]]'' (1933) and [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937).

===Experimental and avant-garde cinema===
The experimental and avant-garde cinema is the genre considered to be closer to women filmmakers and one that also advances women themes. Annette Kuhn, for instance, noted such special affinity by citing that low investments of money and 'professionalism' have meant that it is more open than the mainstream film industry for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Cinema: The Contested Screen|last=Butler|first=Alison|publisher=Wallflower Press|year=2002|isbn=1903364272|location=London|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Pam Cook]] and [[Laura Mulvey]] also noted an alignment and alliance of experimental and avant-garde cinema with feminist interest and feminist politics. Specifically, Mulvey explained that mainstream or Hollywood films are unable to provide the experience of contradiction, reinforcing anti-realism and, this is where the avant-garde cinema is useful for women and feminism because they share "a common interest in the politics of images and problems of aesthetic language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Visual and Other Pleasures|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Palgrave|year=1989|isbn=9780333445297|location=New York|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's involvement in the experimental and avant-garde cinema started in the early twentieth century, although it was limited due to the constraints of the social conventions of this period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was only after the war when women became actively involved in this cinematic genre. [[Germaine Dulac]] was a leading member of the French avant-garde film movement after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41086659|title=The St. James women filmmakers encyclopedia : women on the other side of the camera|last=|first=|date=1999|publisher=Visible Ink Press|others=Unterburger, Amy L.|year=|isbn=9781578590926|location=Detroit|pages=122–124|oclc=41086659}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of [[Maya Deren]]'s visionary films, which belonged to the classics of experimental cinema and focused on the North-American avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45888927|title=Maya Deren and the American avant-garde|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|others=Nichols, Bill, 1942-|isbn=0520224442|location=Berkeley|oclc=45888927}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporaneous trend did not oppose the female filmmakers' entry into avant-garde filmmaking although, in its early years, they did not receive as much critical acclaim as their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Shirley Clarke]] was a leading figure of the independent American film scene in New York in the fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Thomas|date=2012|title=After the New American Cinema: Shirley Clarke's Video Work as Performance and Document|url=|journal=Journal of Film &amp; Video|publication-date=Spring–Summer 2012|volume=64|pages=57–64|via=Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is unusual, insofar as she directed outstanding experimental and feature films as well as documentaries. [[Joyce Wieland]] was a Canadian [[experimental film]] maker. The [[National Film Board of Canada]] allowed many women to produce non-commercial animation films. In Europe women artists like [[Valie Export]] were among the first to explore the artistic and political potential of [[video]]s.

== Impact on society ==

===Impact of second-wave feminism===
In the late sixties, when the second wave of [[feminism]] started, the New Left was at its height. Both movements strongly opposed the 'dominant cinema', i.e. Hollywood and male European bourgeois auteur cinema. Hollywood was accused of furthering oppression by disseminating sexist, racist and imperialist stereotypes. Women participated in mixed new collectives like [[Newsreel]], but they also formed their own film groups. Early feminist films often focused on personal experiences. A first masterpiece was ''[[Wanda (film)|Wanda]]'' by [[Barbara Loden]], one of the most poignant portraits of alienation ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ENELOW|first=SHONNI|date=September–October 2017|title=STRONGER TOGETHER|url=|journal=Film Comment|volume=53|pages=50–55|via=Film &amp; Television Literature Index with Full Text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism would reveal itself in different forms in films in the latter part of the 20th century such as with the idea of "sisterhoods" in movies, a good example of which is ''[[Steel Magnolias]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism, Femininity and Popular Culture|last=Hollows|first=Joanne|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|isbn=0719043956|location=Manchester, U.K. ; New York, N.Y.|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other concepts of second-wave feminism in films involved women's oppression and the difficulty in identifying with the idea of femininity. During this time, feminism in movies would also be represented as a counter-cinema&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema Book 3rd rev. edition|last=Cook|first=Pam (ed.)|last2=Anneke M.|first2=Smelik|publisher=London: British Film Institute|year=2007|isbn=9781844571925|location=London, U.K.|pages=492|chapter=Feminist Film Theory|chapter-url=https://repository.ubn.ru.nl//bitstream/handle/2066/44160/44160.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby filmmakers would attempt to intentionally deconstruct the model of the classical film. This style of feminist counter-cinema can be seen in the works of artists such as [[Sally Potter]]'s ''Thriller'' in 1979.

===Representing sexuality===
Resisting the oppression of female sexuality was one of the core goals of [[second-wave feminism]]. [[Abortion]] was still very controversial in many western societies and feminists opposed the control of the state and the church. Exploring female sexuality took many forms: focusing on long-time censured forms of sexuality ([[lesbianism]], [[sado-masochism]]) or showing heterosexuality from a woman's point of view.
[[Birgit Hein]], [[Elfi Mikesch]], [[Nelly Kaplan]], [[Catherine Breillat]] and [[Barbara Hammer]] are some of the directors to be remembered.

A film notable for its empathic portrayal of sex work is Lizzie Borden's ''[[Working Girls (1986 film)|Working Girls]]'' (1986). Molly, a white lesbian in a stable mixed-race relationship, is a Yale-educated photographer who has chosen to augment her income through sex work in a low-key urban brothel. We accompany Molly on what turns out to be her last day on the job, understanding her professional interactions with her "johns" through her perspective, a completely original point of view, since, until Borden's film, sex workers had largely been depicted stereotypically. The story's sympathetic, well-rounded character and situation humanizes sex work, and the film itself combats the anti-pornography stance touted by many second-wave feminists, which Borden rejects as repressive.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Glynis, Alexandra Devon, and Catehrina Tammaro. [http://www.kersplebedeb.com/mystuff/video/review/lizzie_borden.html "Anarcha-Filmmaker: An Interview with Lizzie Borden."] ''[[Kick It Over]]'' 18 (Spring 1987). Web. 30 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented. The roles that men play are the superhero, the wealthy business man or the all-powerful villain. When it comes to the roles females play they tend to be the housewife, the woman who can't obtain a man, the slut, or the secretary. The true comparison is masculinity versus femininity. The [[Bechdel test]] for film is a type of litmus test that examines the representation of women in media. The 3 factors tested are: 1. Are there at least 2 women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma &amp; Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or limits their role. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this norm, such as ''[[The Proposal (2009 film)|The Proposal]]'' or ''[[I Don't Know How She Does It]]''. Even in these two films, the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this norm, such as Katniss in ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|Hunger Games]]'' and Furiosa in ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''. These roles break the norm, as women typically are portrayed as dependent on other characters, over-emotional, and confined to low-status jobs  compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey &amp; Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and underrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Jocelyn Nicole, "The role of women in film: Supporting the men -- An analysis of how culture influences the changing discourse on gender representations in film" (2015).

=== Fear of entering cinematography ===
Many women fear(ed) even entering the film industry, let alone produce multiple pieces of work in the industry. It is said that both male and female workers believe hiring women into the industry is taking a big chance, or being risky.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handy|first=Jocelyn|last2=Rowlands|first2=Lorraine|date=2016-07-21|title=The systems psychodynamics of gendered hiring: Personal anxieties and defensive organizational practices within the New Zealand film industry|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018726716651690|journal=Human Relations|language=en|volume=70|issue=3|pages=312–338|doi=10.1177/0018726716651690|issn=0018-7267}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many discriminatory acts toward women during the hiring process into the industry such as age discrimination and providing them with lower pay rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Most women workers in the film industry only become freelancers, which in most cases prevents them from creating careers and making a living out of their film/cinematography passion.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wing-Fai|first=Leung|last2=Gill|first2=Rosalind|last3=Randle|first3=Keith|date=May 2015|title=Getting in, Getting on, Getting out? Women as Career Scramblers in the UK film and Television Industries|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12240|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1_suppl|pages=50–65|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12240|issn=0038-0261|via=Sage Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Wing-Fai, 2015). These are the fear tactics in place, whether purposely or not, to prevent women from thriving in the film industry.

However, there is much more gendered discrimination towards women after they receive the job and actually begin to help and/or produce work. Statistics show that there is not many women in senior positions in the industry.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Compared to the amount of women hired, it is clearly shown that women are not given the chance to keep their jobs for long periods of time. “However, it is notable that women lost their jobs at a rate that was six times that of men, indicating the particular and heightened vulnerability of women in the industry.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women are not being promoted into higher positions as often as their male counterparts and are not even given the chance to stay long enough to get promoted. These are multiple issues happening during the hiring process and even the post-hire experiences of women which may make other women fear entering the industry in the first place.

The way women are treated in the workplace are also evidence of the inequalities against them in the film industry. Women’s pay rates and expectations in their background/experience in cinematography is much different than male workers. There are many scenarios in the industry that displays the woman with more qualifications for the job than the man, yet earns less money for the same job than the man.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Deborah|last2=Pringle|first2=Judith K.|date=May 2015|title=Unmanageable Inequalities: Sexism in the Film Industry|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12239|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=1_suppl|pages=37–49|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12239|issn=0038-0261|via=Sage Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; “It is worth noting that women in this field are significantly better qualified than their male counterparts, with a greater proportion being graduates and an even more significant difference in the numbers of women, compared to men, with higher degrees (Skillset, 2010a: 6).”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Even the women who are overqualified are treated as if they are not, resulting in them working extra hard to become better and be rewarded as their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  All of these inequalities and discrimination toward women in the film industry creates a fear for women to even want to enter the industry.

===Resisting violence and violent resistance===
Resisting patriarchal violence was a key concern of second-wave feminism during the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinez|first=Pilar Rodriguez|date=November 2011|title=Feminism and Violence: The Hegemonic Second Wave’s Encounter with Rape and Domestic Abuse in USA (1970-1985)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0921374011430566|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume=23|issue=3|pages=147–172|doi=10.1177/0921374011430566|issn=0921-3740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many feminists of the second wave have taken part in the peace movements of the eighties, as had their foremothers in the older pacifist movements. The effects that war conflict had on women following the cold war was often overlooked. Post cold-war conflicts resulted in women being subjected to increased forms of torture, rape, and violence.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Citation|last=El-Bushra|first=Judy|title=Feminism, Gender, and Women's Peace Activism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781444306675.ch7|work=Gender Myths and Feminist Fables|pages=127–143|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|isbn=9781444306675|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an increase in women’s peace organizations and initiatives to protest violence against women, resulting in more criticism of the patriarchal cliché of the 'peaceable' woman.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; Women film directors documented the participation of women in anti-imperialist resistance movements. Inspired by the Hindu goddess Mother Kali--who is traditionally associated with sexuality, violence, and motherly-tenderness-- German filmmakers Birgit and Wilhelm Hein created their Kali Film, which depicts women as violent and threatening, the opposite of the innocent “caretaker” stereotype generally assigned to women characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bampfa.org/event/kali-film|title=Kali Film {{!}} BAMPFA|website=bampfa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers assembled found footage from 'trivial' genres, the only domain of cinema in which the portrayal of aggressive women was allowed. 

Filmmakers have also begun to take on representations of sexuality and gender in films directed specifically at college students. As campus sexual assault continues to pervade universities, filmmakers have started to create films that address these issues. In 2014 a group of students and faculty at Texas Tech University created the film series “Sexism | Cinema,” to provide education on violence against women and sexual abuse on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=John B.

=== Statistics ===
A study done by USC Annenberg researched what it meant to be a female in the film industry, no matter if they were working behind the scenes or were fictional characters.  USC Annenberg looked at two test groups for films, the top 100 films every year from 2007 to 2015 and the top 100 films in 2015.

For the top 100 films in 2015, women were leads and co-leads in 32 of them, while of the 32 films, only 3 of them included a race other than Caucasian.  Out of the thousands of speaking roles, only 32 characters were LGBT and of those characters, 40% of them were racially diverse.  Female characters were also three times more likely to be seen in a sexual context.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dr. Stacy|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|year=2016|title=Inequality in 800 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race/Ethnicity, LGBT, and Disability from 2007-2015|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Dr%20Stacy%20L%20Smith%20Inequality%20in%20800%20Films%20FINAL.ashx|journal=USC Annenburg|volume=|pages=1–6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the scenes had similar statistics to the female fictional characters.  Female directors, writers, and producers made up 19% of the 1,365 people that it took to create the top 100 films in 2015.  The percentage of female writers (11.8%) and producers (22%) can be seen as high compared to female directors (7.5%).  Of the 7.5% of female directors, three of them were African American and one was Asian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For the top 100 films every year from 2007 until 2015, of the 800 films, 4.1% were directed by females.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Documentaries ===
While there is still a gap between the percent of female and male filmmakers, women tend to be more involved in documentary films.  There is a higher percentage of women directing documentaries than women directing narrative films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauren|first=Martha|year=2013|title=The Celluloid Ceiling: Behind the Scenes Employment of Women on Top 250 Films of 2015|url=http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/2012_Celluloid_Ceiling_Exec_Summ.pdf|journal=Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celluloid ceiling ===
The Center of the Study of Women in Television and Film has dedicated 18 years to the study of women in the film industry.  An annual report is created, discussing how women have contributed to as filmmakers.  Most of the findings from the research shows that, statistically, it says the same from year to year.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|title=Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest earning movies of the past 20 years, with the exception of foreign films and reissues, have been monitored and studied by the Celluloid Ceiling to provide information on the contributions and employment of women on these films.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/research/|title=Research – Center for the Study of Women in Television &amp; Film|website=womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, as of 2017, “women comprised 18% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films."&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;The same study concluded that in 2017, 10 or more women were given one of these positions in 1% of films, compared to 10 or more men being hired for these jobs in 70% of films.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;Information from the Celluloid Ceiling shows that more women tend to be employed on film projects directed by women.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;According to the Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy, "in films with at least one female director, women comprised 53% of writers.

Just 34% of major characters and 33% of all speaking characters in the top 100 domestic grossing films were women.”

The group also contributes their time to creating articles discussing how women are viewed in film, not only as filmmakers but as fictional characters as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==African American women's cinema==
[[Julie Dash]]'s ''[[Daughters of the Dust]]'' (1991) was the first full-length film with general theatrical release written and directed by an [[African American]] woman. Since then there have been several African or African-American women who have written, produced or directed films with national release. [[Neema Barnette]] (''[[Civil Brand]]''), [[Maya Angelou]] (''[[Down in the Delta]]''), [[Kasi Lemmons]] (''[[Eve's Bayou]]''), [[Cheryl Dunye]] (''[[My Baby's Daddy]]''), [[Stephanie Allain]] (''[[Biker Boyz]]''), [[Tracey Edmonds]] (''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]''), [[Frances-Anne Solomon]] (''[[A Winter Tale]]'') and [[Dianne Houston]] (''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]''), [[Leslie Harris (director)|Leslie Harris]] ([[Just Another Girl on the IRT]]) are among these filmmakers. In 1994 Darnell Martin became the first African American woman to write and direct a film produced by a major studio when Columbia Pictures backed ''[[I Like It Like That (film)|I Like It Like That]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-23/entertainment/9410230140_1_story-of-lisette-linares-film-transvestite-brother|title=She Likes It Like That|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, [[Nnegest Likké]] is the first [[African American]] woman to write, direct and act in a full-length movie released by a major studio, ''[[Phat Girlz]]'' (2006) starring [[Jimmy Jean-Louis]] and [[Mo'Nique]].

==Africa==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">The '''world to come''', '''age to come''', and '''heaven on Earth''' are [[eschatological]] phrases reflecting the belief that the [[World (theology)|current world]] or [[Dispensation (period)|current age]] is flawed or [[curse]]d{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and will be replaced in the future by a better world, age, or [[paradise]]. The concept is related to but differs from the concepts of [[heaven]], the [[afterlife]], and the [[Kingdom of God]] in that heaven is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the afterlife is generally an individual's life after death, and the [[Kingdom of God]] could be in the present (such as [[Realized eschatology]]) or the future.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Hindu eschatology==

{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
In Hindu eschatology the current age is the [[Kali Yuga]], a period of decline. [[Kalki]] ('Destroyer of Filth') will appear to purge all evil, beginning a [[golden age]] of [[Satya Yuga]].

There have been a range of dates predicted, purportedly from different methods of calculation.&lt;ref name="Chandra"&gt;{{cite book|last = Chandra| first = Suresh| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses | publisher = Kindle Edition| date = Aug 15, 2012| location = | pages = | url =   | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri [[Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami]], for example, wrote 400 years ago in his ''Divya Maha Kala Gnana,'' or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Santanu Acharya |url=http://ww-iii.tripod.com/hindu.htm |title=Hindu Prophecies: Translations from the Kalki Purana |publisher=Ww-iii.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time of arrival of Kalki has not been consistently asserted by astrologers.&lt;ref name="Chandra"/&gt;

==Jewish eschatology==
[[File:Resurrection of the Dead vision.jpg|thumb|[[Resurrection of the dead]], fresco from the Dura-Europos synagogue]]
[[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|''HaOlam HaBa'']], or "the world to come", is an important part of [[Jewish eschatology]], although [[Judaism]] concentrates on the importance of ''HaOlam HaZeh'' ("this world").  The [[afterlife]] is known as ''Olam haBa'', ''[[Gan Eden#In Jewish eschatology|Gan Eden]]'' (the Heavenly Garden of Eden) and ''[[Gehenna|Gehinom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jews are told to live their lives on earth to the full, as their bodies will stay there but their souls live on. [http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/jewish-afterlife-beliefs.htm Jewish Afterlife Beliefs at SimpleToRemember.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html Afterlife at JewishVirtualLibrary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba: The Afterlife at JewFAQ.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Talmud]], any non-Jew who lives according to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] is regarded as a ''[[Ger toshav]]'' (righteous gentile), and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian eschatology==

{{main|Christian eschatology}}
Under [[Christian]] [[eschatology]], the phrase is found in the [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use#1988 ecumenical version .28ELLC.29|Nicene Creed (current Ecumenical version)]]: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christian-bible.com/Exegesis/creeds.htm |title=The Nicene Creed |publisher=Christian-bible.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|18:30|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|2:5|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|6:5|KJV}}. Other related expressions are "age to come" which is typically found in more recent translations, [[Kingdom of God]], [[Messianic Age]], [[Millennial Age]], [[The New Earth]] and [[New Jerusalem]], and [[dispensation of the fulness of times]] and possibly also [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].

==Zoroastrian eschatology==
In [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[eschatology]], the world to come is the ''[[frashokereti]]'', where the ''[[saoshyant]]'' will bring about a [[resurrection of the dead]] in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a [[last judgment]]. The ''[[yazata]]s'' [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All humankind—both the living and the resurrected dead—will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to [[hell]], where it will annihilate [[Angra Mainyu]] and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.
