      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5997">On May 1st, 2010, a ruptured [[ExxonMobil]] pipeline in the state of [[Akwa Ibom]], [[Nigeria]], spilled more than a million gallons into the [[Niger Delta|delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vidal|first=John|title=Nigeria's agony dwarfs the Gulf oil spill.

==Effects==
Many locals in the region attest to [[environmental damage]] that allegedly developed as a result of the leak. Past oil spills in the delta's creeks have been left to fester for decades, polluting the air, [[soil pollution|soil]], and [[water pollution|water]] of impoverished communities.&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt; Nigeria sees its future output growth largely in offshore fields and does not want spills there to compound its environmental woes.&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt; Checks by [[Sahara Reporters]] revealed that the fishermen reportedly hauled in fish killed in the ExxonMobil’s oil spill in a location about 20 kilometers from the shoreline and supplied the bad fish to unsuspecting members of the public.&lt;ref name=sahara /&gt; The Nigerian Environmental Rights Action group issued a demand for N51 billion ($100 Million) from ExxonMobil in Nigeria for their failure to compensate fishermen within the coastal areas who suffered devastating losses due to the oil company’s exploration activities and major oil spills.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web|last=JINN|title=Exxon Mobil Hit With $100 Million For Akwa Ibom Oil Spill Victims|url=http://justiceinnigerianow.org/niger-delta/exxon-mobil-hit-with-100-million-for-akwa-ibom-oil-spill-victims|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140121060835/http://justiceinnigerianow.org/niger-delta/exxon-mobil-hit-with-100-million-for-akwa-ibom-oil-spill-victims|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 January 2014|work=Justice in Nigeria Now|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thick balls of tar have also been sighted washed upon the shoreline as well as oil slicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vidal|first=John|title=Nigeria’s Agony Dwarfs Gulf Oil Spill|url=http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/nigerias-agony-dwarfs-gulf-oil-spill|work=The Guardian|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spill has only exacerbated the already growing problem of pollution in the Delta. The Nigerian government estimates there were over 7,000 spills, large and small, between 1970 and 2000, according to the [[BBC]].  That is approximately 300 spills a year, and some spills have been leaking for years.&lt;ref name=newsdesk /&gt; Vast swathes of the Delta have been seen covered with tar and stagnant lakes of crude due to oil spills of the past.&lt;ref name=newsdesk /&gt;

==Cleanup effort==
ExxonMobil of Nigeria was cited for the reported use of [[dispersants]] near the coast to contain the oil spill.&lt;ref name=justice /&gt;  These dispersants were considered a violation of environmental standards in the oil industry.&lt;ref name=justice /&gt; Rev. Samuel Ayadi, Akwa Ibom State Chapter Chairman of Artisan Fishermen Association of Nigeria (ARFAN), said that ExxonMobil was in the habit of using dangerous chemical dispersants which are scientifically proven to be toxic to human and aquatic life to clean up oil spills whenever they occur.&lt;ref name=sahara /&gt;  He also noted that dispersants were even more dangerous than crude oil because it breaks down the crude oil and sinks it to the sea bed where it kills fish eggs and fingerlings thereby wiping out generations of fish stock and other sea food and marine creatures that make up the food chain.&lt;ref name=sahara /&gt; 

==Controversy==
Following the May 1 spill, protests by women and youth in the local areas disrupted oil production at Mobil facilities for two days, with reports of soldiers beating protestors, including one woman who suffered a broken leg.&lt;ref name=justice /&gt; Those protests led to a May 20 meeting with stakeholders from the [[Akwa Ibom State Government]], Mobil, and core host communities.&lt;ref name=justice /&gt;  Among the topics raised was “the issue of the oil company playing one community against another.”&lt;ref name=justice /&gt;

Two severe [[power blackout]]s affected most of northern and eastern [[India]] on 30 and 31 July 2012. The 30 July 2012 blackout affected over 300&amp;nbsp;million people and was briefly the largest power outage in history by number of people affected, beating the January 2001 blackout in [[Northern India]] (230 million affected).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1096957.stm | work=BBC News | title=Massive power cut hits India | date=2 January 2001 | access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blackout on 31 July is the [[List of major power outages|largest power outage in history]].&lt;!-- As of March 2015 --&gt; The outage affected more than 620&amp;nbsp;million people, about 9% of the [[world population]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/31/india-blackout-electricity-power-cuts|title=India blackouts leave 700 million without power|date=31 July 2012|author=Helen Pidd|accessdate=31 July 2012|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-07-31/india-power-outage/56600520/1|author=Hriday Sarma and Ruby Russell|title=620 million without power in India after 3 power grids fail|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India's Mass Power Failure Worst Ever in World History |url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770631 |work=Outlook |agency=Press Trust of India |date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801052804/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770631 |archivedate=1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or half of [[Demographics of India|India's population]], spread across 22 states&lt;ref name=DH /&gt; in [[north India|Northern]], [[east India|Eastern]], and [[Northeast India]].

== Background ==
India is the world's third largest producer and consumer of electricity after the United States and China; however, the electrical infrastructure is generally considered unreliable.&lt;ref name="unreliablesme"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/smementor/news/indian-markets/how-businesses-pay-for-indias-unreliable-power-system-739304.html|title=How businesses pay for India's unreliable power system|date=2 August 2012|accessdate=3 August 2012|work=SME Mentor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unreliableabc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.com/International/wireStory/electricity-grids-fail-half-india-16899933|title=Indian Businesses Weather Blackouts, but at a Cost|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=3 August 2012|publisher=ABC News |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern [[electrical grid]] had previously collapsed in 2001.&lt;ref name=TheHindu /&gt; An estimated 27% of energy generated is lost in transmission or stolen,&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-01/worst-india-outage-highlights-60-years-of-missed-targets-energy.html |title=Worst India Outage Highlights 60 Years Of Missed Targets |author=Rajesh Kumar Singh and Rakteem Katakey |date=1 August 2012 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while peak supply falls short of demand by an average of 9%.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt; The nation suffers from frequent power outages that last as long as 10 hours.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt; Further, about 25% of the population, about 300 million people, have no electricity at all.&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt; Efforts are underway to reduce transmission and distribution losses and increase production.&lt;ref name=newindianexpress&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Rs-3600-crore-power-sector-plan-to-cut-Transmission-and-Distribution-loss/2013/07/26/article1702694.ece |title=Address power transmission and distribution losses |author=Express News Service |date=26 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2012, leading up to the failure, extreme heat had caused power use to reach record levels in [[New Delhi]]. Due to the late arrival of [[monsoon]]s, agricultural areas in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] drew increased power from the grid for running pumps irrigating [[paddy field]]s.&lt;ref name=HT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Power-grid-failure-FAQs/Article1-905428.aspx |title=Power grid failure: FAQs |date=31 July 2012 |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730213932/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Power-grid-failure-FAQs/Article1-905428.aspx |archivedate=30 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The late monsoon also meant that [[hydroelectricity|hydropower plants]] were generating less than their usual production.&lt;ref name=WP2 /&gt;

== Sequence of events ==

=== 30 July ===
At 02:35 [[Indian Standard Time|IST]] (21:05 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on 29 July), [[circuit breaker]]s on the 400 kV [[Bina Etawa|Bina]]-[[Gwalior]] line tripped. As this line fed into the [[Agra]]-[[Bareilly]] [[Electric power transmission|transmission section]], breakers at the station also tripped, and power failures cascaded through the grid. All major power stations were shut down in the affected states, causing an estimated shortage of 32 GW.&lt;ref name=TheHindu/&gt; Officials described the failure as "the worst in a decade".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/power-restored-to-most-of-north-india/ |title=Power Restored to Most of north India |author=Sruthi Gottipatti and Niharika Mandhana |date=30 July 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the collapse, [[Ministry of Power (India)|Power Minister]] [[Sushilkumar Shinde]] stated that the exact cause of the failure was unknown, but that at the time of the failure, electricity use was "above normal". He speculated that some states had attempted to draw more power than permitted due to the higher consumption. Spokesperson for [[PowerGrid Corporation of India|PowerGrid Corporation of India Limited]] (PGCIL) and the Northern Regional Load Dispatch Centre (NRLDC) stated that [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]] were the states responsible for the overdraw. PGCIL's chairman also stated that electrical service was restored "at a record time".&lt;ref name=TheHindu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3702075.ece?homepage=true |title=Worst outage cripples north India |author=Sujay Mehuddia and Smriti Rak Ramachandaran |date=30 July 2012 |work=[[The Hindu]] |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A senior director for an Indian power company described the outage as "a fairly large breakdown that exposed major technical faults in India's grid system. Something went terribly wrong which caused the backup safety systems to fail."&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

More than 300 million people, about 25% of India's population, were without power. Railways and some airports were shut down until 08:00.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19043972 |title=Power cut causes major disruption in northern India |date=30 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The busiest airport in South Asia, [[Delhi Airport]], continued functioning because it switched to back-up power in 15 seconds.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;&lt;ref name=B38/&gt; The outage caused "chaos" for Monday morning rush hour, as passenger trains were shut down and traffic signals were non-operational.&lt;ref name=TheHindu/&gt; Trains stalled for three to five hours.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Several hospitals reported interruptions in health services,&lt;ref name=TheHindu/&gt; while others relied on back-up generators.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Water treatment plants were shut down for several hours,&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; and millions were unable to draw water from wells powered by electric pumps.&lt;ref name=HT /&gt;

The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India ([[ASSOCHAM]]) stated that the blackout had "severely impacted" businesses, leaving many unable to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Power-failure-in-7-states-no-Metro-Trains-in-Delhi-today/Article1-904035.aspx |title=When the lights went out |date=31 July 2012 |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730105408/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Power-failure-in-7-states-no-Metro-Trains-in-Delhi-today/Article1-904035.aspx |archivedate=30 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil refineries in [[Panipat]], [[Mathura]] and [[Bathinda]] continued operating because they have their own captive power stations within the refineries and do not depend on the grid.&lt;ref name=TheHindu/&gt;

It took 15 hours to restore 80% of service.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

=== 31 July ===

== Prior disaster-proofing ==
Before the grid collapse, the private sector spent $29 billion to build their own independent power stations in order to provide reliable power to their factories. The five biggest consumers of electricity in India have private off-grid supplies. Indian companies have 35 GW of private off-grid generation capacity and plan to add another 33 GW to their off-grid capacity.&lt;ref name=B38&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-02/ambani-tata-islands-shrug-off-grid-collapse-corporate-india.html |title=Ambani, Tata 'Islands' Shrug Off Grid Collapse: Corporate India |author=Rajesh Kumar Singh and Rakteem Katakey |date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some villages that were not connected to the grid were not affected, such as Meerwada, [[Madhya Pradesh]] which had a 14&amp;nbsp;kW solar power station built by a United States-based firm for $125,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/as-power-grid-collapse-solar-village-shines/277841-3.html |title=Madhya Pradesh: As power grids collapse, solar village shines |date=3 August 2012 |publisher=IBN |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
On the day of the collapse, Power Minister Sushilkumar Shinde ordered a three-member panel to determine the reason for the failure and report on it in fifteen days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Greedy-states-send-power-grid-crashing/Article1-905597.aspx |title=Greedy states send power grid crashing |date=30 July 2012 |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=30 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731035918/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Greedy-states-send-power-grid-crashing/Article1-905597.aspx |archivedate=31 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism, he observed that India was not alone in suffering major power outages, as blackouts had also occurred [[2011 Southwest blackout|in the United States]] and [[2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout|Brazil]] within the previous few years.&lt;ref name=WP2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/power-grid-failure-makes-370m-swelter-in-dark-as-india-struggles-to-meet-its-vast-energy-needs/2012/07/30/gJQAY4afKX_story.html |title=Power grid failure makes 370M swelter in dark as India struggles to meet its vast energy needs |agency=Associated Press |date=30 July 2012 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the failure as adding urgency to [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh|Dr. Manmohan Singh]]'s plan for a US$400 billion overhaul of India's power grid. His plan calls for a further 76 gigawatts of generation by 2017,&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-M7YDKA0YHQ0X01-79TK1GQCDQF2C5AQ5A383U7GQR |title=Singh's $400 Billion Power Plan Gains Urgency as Grid Collapses |author=Kartikay Mehrotra and Andrew MacAskill |date=31 July 2012 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=31 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805054944/http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-M7YDKA0YHQ0X01-79TK1GQCDQF2C5AQ5A383U7GQR |archive-date=5 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; produced in part by nuclear power.

Rajiv Kumar, secretary general of the [[FICCI|Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry]] (FICCI) said, "One of the major reasons for the collapse of the power grid is the major gap between demand and supply. There is an urgent need to reform the power sector and bring about infrastructural improvements to meet the new challenges of the growing economy."&lt;ref name=WP3&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/india-blackout-on-second-day-leaves-600-million-without-power/2012/07/30/gJQA7j1LMX_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=India blackout, on second day, leaves 600 million without power |date=31 July 2012 |author= Simon Denyer and Rama Lakshmi|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2012, newly appointed Power Minister [[Veerappa Moily]] stated, "First thing is to stabilize the grid and it has to sustain. For that we will work out a proper strategy." He declined to blame specific states, saying, "I don't want to start with the blame game."&lt;ref name=J-IBO-GT-01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/dont-want-to-start-with-blame-game-moily/277050-37-64.html|title=Don't want to start with blame game: Veerappa Moily |date=1 August 2012 |publisher=IBN|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[India Against Corruption|Team Anna]], the supporters of anti-corruption activist [[Anna Hazare]], charged that this grid failure was a conspiracy to suppress the indefinite fast movement started on 25 July 2012 for the [[Jan Lokpal Bill]] and targeting [[Sharad Pawar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/team-anna-calls-grid-failure-a-conspiracy-targets-pawar/276445-37-64.html |title=Team Anna calls grid failure a conspiracy, targets Pawar |date=30 July 2012 |publisher=IBN |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-07-30/news/32942082_1_northern-grid-anna-hazare-metro-services |title=Team Anna sees conspiracy in northern power grid collapse |date=30 July 2012 |work=The Economic Times |agency=Press Trust of India |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some technology sources and [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) proposed that another widespread outage could be prevented by integrated network of [[Distributed generation|microgrids]] and [[distributed generation]] connected seamlessly with the main grid via a superior [[smart grid]] technology, which includes automated [[Power quality#Introduction|fault detection]], [[islanding]] and [[Power quality#Smart grids and power quality|self-healing]] of the network.&lt;ref name="moneycontrol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/smementor/mentorade/starting-up/power-crisisgrid-collapse-is-it-time-to-think--739976.html |title=Power crisis and grid collapse: Is it time to think different, small and local? |date=3 August 2012 |work=SME Mentor |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPF-S-01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428666/how-power-outages-in-india-may-one-day-be-avoided/ |author=Kevin Bullis|title=How Power Outages in India May One Day Be Avoided |date=31 July 2012 |publisher=technologyreview.com |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPF-S-02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sari-energy.org/PageFiles/What_We_Do/activities/smart_grid_vision_for_india_power_sector_june_2010/White_paper-Th_%20Smart_Grid_Vision_for_India/White_Paper_on_the_Smart_Grid_Vision_for_India_-_final.pdf |title=The smart grid vision for India's power sector |date=March 2010 |publisher=USAID India |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IPF-S-03&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1364032111004564-gr1.jpg |title= Enabling integrated network of microgrids and distributed power connected to the grid via Smart Grid technology with [self-healing]  |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
The three-member investigation committee consisted of S. C. Srivastava, A. Velayutham and A. S. Bakshi, and issued its report on 16 August 2012. It concluded that four factors were responsible for the two days of blackout:&lt;ref name=nic.in&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powermin.nic.in/pdf/GRID_ENQ_REP_16_8_12.pdf|title=Report of the Enquiry Committee on Grid Disturbance in Northern Region on 30th July 2012 and in Northern, Eastern &amp; North-Eastern Region on 31st July 2012|date=16 August 2012|work=powermin.nic.in|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Weak inter-regional power transmission corridors due to multiple existing outages (both scheduled and forced);
* High loading on 400 kV Bina–Gwalior–Agra link;
* Inadequate response by State Load Dispatch Centers (SLDCs) to the instructions of Regional Load Dispatch Centres (RLDCs) to reduce over-drawal by the Northern Region utilities and under-drawal/excess generation by the Western Region utilities;
* Loss of 400 kV Bina–Gwalior link due to mis-operation of its protection system.

The committee also offered a number of recommendations to prevent further failures, including an audit of the protection systems.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the motions of 293 galaxies in the cluster field suggested that Abell 520 was a cluster forming at the crossing of three filaments of the large scale structure

The surprising substructure of Abell 520 was reported in 2007 from a weak gravitational lensing study based on Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope (CFHT) imaging data. It was surprising because the study found the "dark core" with a significant amount of mass in the region, where there is no concentration of bright cluster galaxies. No conventional understanding of [[dark matter]] can explain this peculiar concentration of dark matter.&lt;ref name=NS-Aug2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=PW-Aug2007/&gt; One interesting interpretation is that the substructure may arise from non-gravitational interaction of dark matter.

However, in the year 2012 two international teams of astronomers published conflicting results on Abell 520. While one study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6683">'''Arc suppression''' is the reduction of sparks formed when current-carrying contacts are separated. The spark is a luminous discharge of highly energized electrons and ions, and is an [[electric arc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electric arc |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Electrical+arcing |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin |first=T.

==Uses==
[[File:Contacts - new and used.jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;br&gt;(left) Pristine contacts from a relay&lt;br&gt;(right) The nearly destroyed contacts from a relay operated under power for nearly 100,000 cycles]]
There are several possible areas of use of arc suppression methods, among them [[Sputter deposition|metal film deposition and sputtering]], [[Arc flash#Protecting personnel|arc flash protection]], electrostatic processes where electrical arcs are not desired (such as [[powder painting]], [[Air purifier|air purification]], [[Polyvinylidene fluoride|PVDF]] film poling) and contact current arc suppression. In industrial, military and consumer electronic design, the latter method generally applies to devices such as electromechanical power switches, relays and contactors. In this context, arc suppression is [[contact protection]].

=== Contact protection ===

Every time an electrical power device (for example: heaters, lamps, motors, transformers or similar power loads) turns on or off, its switch, relay or [[contactor]] transitions either from a closed to an open state (break arc) or from an open to a closed state (make arc &amp; bounce arc), under load, an electrical arc occurs between the two contact points (electrodes) of the switch.  The break arc is typically more energetic and thus more destructive.&lt;ref&gt;The National Association of Relay Manufacturers, Engineers’ Relay Handbook, NARM, 8th Edition, 1980, pg 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Perry L. |last=Martin |title=Electronic Failure Analysis Handbook |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=1999 |pages=16.1–16.29 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temperature of the resulting [[electric arc]] is very high (tens of thousands of degrees), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool and migrate with the current. The high temperature of the arc [[Dissociation (chemistry)|cracks]] the surrounding gas molecules creating ozone, carbon monoxide, and other compounds. The arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter.  This very activity causes the material in the contacts to degrade quickly, resulting in device failure.&lt;ref name="Contact Arc Phenomenon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1999|p=1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arc suppression is an area of interest in engineering because of the destructive effects of the electrical arc to electromechanical power switches, relays and [[contactor]]s’ points of contact.&lt;ref&gt;Tyco P&amp;B, Contact ARC Phenomenon, Tyco Electronics Corporation – P&amp;B, Winston-Salem, NC, Application Note 13C3203, pgs. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
[[File:Break arc on osciloscope.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Screen captures from an oscilloscope measuring the arc energy: current shown by &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue line&lt;/span&gt; (sinusoidal wave), 2V/div = 5A/div; voltage shown by &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red line&lt;/span&gt;,10V/div.&lt;br&gt;(left) Unsuppressed AC power electrical arc&lt;br&gt;(right) An identical arc with suppression.]]The efficacy of an arc suppression solution for [[contact protection]] can be assessed, by comparing the arc intensity with the help of the following methods:

*Visual Inspection of the arc: The electrical arc can be visually observed on an electromechanical power switch, relay and contactor, with visible contacts, while the contacts are opening and closing under load.
*Graphical representation of measurements obtained by an oscilloscope:  The electrical arc can be observed by using an oscilloscope to trace the voltage wave form across the contact terminals while the contacts are opening and closing under load.

== Common devices ==

Common devices used to prevent arcs are capacitors, [[snubber]]s, diodes, Zener diodes, [[varistor]]s, and transient voltage suppressors.&lt;ref&gt;Tyco P&amp;B, Relay Contact Life, Tyco Electronics Corporation – P&amp;B, Winston-Salem, NC, Application Note 13C3236, pgs. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Contact arc suppression solutions that are considered more effective:
#Two-wire contact arc suppressor
#[[Solid state relay]]s are not electromechanical, have no contacts, and, thus, do not create electrical arcs.&lt;ref&gt;The National Association of Relay Manufacturers, Engineers’ Relay Handbook, NARM, 8th Edition, 1980, Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Hybrid power relays
#Hybrid power contactors

==Benefits of Arc Suppression==

Arc suppression techniques can produce a number of benefits:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Features &amp; Benefits Arc Suppression | url = http://www.electronic-components.com.au/products-services/arc-suppression/ | accessdate = December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
#Minimised contact damage from arcing and therefore reduced maintenance, repair and replacement frequency.
#Increased Contact reliability. 
#Reduced heat generation resulting in less heat management measures such as venting and fans.
#Reduced Ozone and pollutant emissions.
#Reduced [[Electromagnetic Interference]] (EMI) from arcs - a common source of radiated EMI.

The '''Bartlett street lamp''' was an economical type of [[Lighting#History|lighting]] first patented and manufactured by J. W. Bartlett at 569 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Manhattan]] in New York City, in 1872. Bartlett claimed his street lamps cost less than a quarter of the $25 ''[[The New York Times]]'' had reported a competitor claimed they cost. The ''Times'' responded that the [[New York City Parks Department]] said that they actually paid more than that for each lamp, including the post and frame, that they used in parks, streets, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; The city of [[Troy, New York]] used the lamps beginning in 1872 to replace older models when they wore out.&lt;ref&gt;Classified Ad 2-No Title, March 28, 1874, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of use==
According to Bartlett, a portion of the economy of the Bartlett street lamp was derived from the iron frames used in their construction. Other efficient qualities included a greater thickness of glass and less need for repair. Unless an object collided with a Bartlett street lamp with sufficient force, it would likely glance off of it. Likewise, drops of rain did not affect them after they were lighted. The ''Times'' disputed those contentions, saying the lamps were frequently cracked or broken.&lt;ref name=new&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1872/02/04/78774824.pdf The Bartlett Street-Lamps], letter to the editor and response, ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 4, 1872, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lamplighter]]s preferred them because they were easy to light and clean. Bartlett Street Lamps diffused light nicely, according to an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;Classified Ad 8-No Title, ''The New York Times'', March 30, 1874, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovative manufacturer==
J.W. Bartlett presented a claim for $1,796 against the Department of Public Parks of New York City, in February 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Auditing The Accounts, '' The New York Times'', February 23, 1872, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By mid-1878 Bartlett introduced several devices which enabled lamplighting via electricity which he produced from an office at 950 Broadway. There were three inventions which each related to the other. One was an electric gas cock and lighter, which was controlled by the hand and which could be adjusted upon any gas fixture. The second was an automatic gas [[Stopcock|cock]] and [[lighter]] used in street lights and buildings. The third was an electric signal. As an experiment the lamps around [[Madison Square]] were fitted with automatic lighters. Each could be lighted or extinguished in a short time by placing a finger on the button of a battery at the office at 950 Broadway. Also the battery could be connected to a clock and the lights extinguished in just a moment.&lt;ref&gt;Lamp-Lighting By Electricity, ''The New York Times'', June 8, 1878, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing sites==
The ''Railroad, Telegraph and Steamship Builders' Directory'' of 1888 lists a Bartlett Street Lamp Co., at 35 Howard Street in New York. It also mentions Bartlett Street Lamp Mfg. Co., at 42 College Place in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''Railroad, Telegraph and Steamship Builders' Directory'', The Railway Directory Publishing Company, 1888, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Triassic lithostratigraphy Europe|short=1}}
Bunter Pebble Beds are [[sandstone]] deposits containing rounded pebbles. They can be found in [[Warwickshire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Devon]] and [[Dorset]] in [[England]]. They are thought to be alluvial deposits and, judging from the rounding of the mainly [[quartzite]] pebbles, to have resulted from prolonged transportation in a large and turbulent river, resulting in powerful abrasion. The deposits in the [[English Midlands]] are thought to have been transported in this way northwards from [[Brittany]], [[France]]. This supposed river has been called the "Budleighensis", after the Devon village of [[Budleigh Salterton]], a site where such deposits were discovered. The depositions took place in the lower [[Triassic]] period. Some newer conglomerates, e.g. near [[Ryton-on-Dunsmore|Ryton]] in Warwickshire, are thought to have arisen during the [[Ice Age]] by reworking and southward transportation of older deposits by ice flows.

The [[pebble]]s, also called [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]], which can be used as [[gravel]], as [[Construction aggregate|ballast]] or as [[cobblestone]]s, are mainly milky-white quartzite but can vary in colour and composition, including some that are hard, reddish-coloured sandstone. The sandstone in which these pebbles are deposited can be used for building or as an aggregate for [[cement]] or [[concrete]].

The name "Bunter" derives from the [[Germany|German]] term "[[Buntsandstein]]", "bunt" meaning "variegated" or "colourful", referring to the colour of the sandstone deposit, which varies from reddish to greenish. This sandstone is widespread across central Europe, notably in the [[Black Forest]] and [[Odenwald]] region of Germany, as well as the [[Vosges Mountains]] in northeastern France.

The sandstone can be hard enough for building, yet easy enough to "work", resulting in [[bridge]]s, [[castle]]s, [[cathedral]]s and [[Church (building)|churches]] constructed of reddish sandstone, throughout the relevant areas of Europe (e.g. Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, [[Alsace]] in France, Denmark, Poland). The land under which these beds lie is generally very well drained, creating heathlike conditions. Because of the drainage, the soil tends to be of low fertility. A notable area in Britain that has these characteristics is [[Cannock Chase]], a designated [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB).

The long [[slate|shingle]] [[tombolo]] of [[Chesil Beach]] in Dorset and the [[Portland Raised Beach|raised beach]] of [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], Dorset are partly composed of Bunter pebbles. As yet, no fully satisfactory and universally accepted geological explanation has been formulated to explain their precise origin and mode of transport, as each proposed theory has its difficulties.

A '''cartridge heater''' is a tube-shaped, heavy-duty, industrial [[Joule heating]] element used in the process heating industry, usually custom manufactured to a specific watt density,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omega.com/prodinfo/cartridgeheaters.html&lt;/ref&gt; based on its intended application.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.process-heating.com/Articles/Feature_Article/154bd7dd2f268010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____&lt;/ref&gt; Compact designs are capable of reaching a watt density of up to 50W/cm².&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freek-heaters.com/products/cartridge_heaters/cartridge_heaters.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.backermarathon.com/products/hotrod/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Cartridge heaters are found useful in many applications,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nexthermal.com/product/cartridge-heaters/high-watt-density-cartridge-heaters.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; such as:

* Seal bars
*Torpedo heaters for injection molding

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Construction==

Construction of a cartridge heater may be divided in 7 main parts:
* Heating coil
* Insulation
* Sheath
* Sealing
* Termination
* Lead wire type
* Watt density

===Heating coil===

The heating coil is the actual resistance which is where the electrical load occurs. The most common type of metal alloy used for this purpose is a nickel-chromium mixture, also known as [[nichrome]]. The nichrome wire is wound around a ceramic core, and the number of spirals per inch vary according to the requested watt density. Potential from an alternating current source, which can either be 2 phase or 3 phase, flows through the coiled nichrome wire, heating up the wire, which in turn, heats the cartridge heater sheath.

===Insulation===

Insulation is used to prevent the nichrome coil contacting the sheath, an event that would ground the resistance and could produce a catastrophic short-circuit, resulting in a melted sheath and a major equipment failure. Damage can be mitigated by installing a ground fault interrupting circuit. To prevent the coil from touching the sheath, the coil is inserted into the sheath, and immediately filled with [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO). To ensure the MgO fills the empty space between the sheath and the coil, the cartridge heater is filled under vibration.

===Sheath===

The sheath is the part of the cartridge heater which makes contact with the material or substance to be heated. Several metal alloys are used, depending on the type of application, such as highly acidic or corrosive environments. The most common types of sheaths are 304 [[stainless steel]], 316 stainless steel, and incoloy 800. Incoloy has the highest temperature rating, and is considered a [[superalloy]].

===Sealing===

After the cartridge heater has been filled with MgO, a seal is applied to the open end of the cartridge heater (where the nichrome coil was introduced). This prevents the coil and the MgO from coming out, as well as preventing contaminants such as plastic debris, air, or moisture from entering the heater.

===Termination===

Since cartridge heaters are installed in a wide variety of machines, manufacturers must design the heaters to meet certain clearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigchiefheaters.com/insert1h.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206013257/http://www.bigchiefheaters.com/insert1h.htm |archivedate=2011-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [dead link] The cartridge heaters might be terminated with the leads coming out straight, or in a right angle. Also, manufacturers must be careful that the leads are not exposed to temperatures higher than the maximum rating for the lead wire. In order to prevent lead wire damage from temperature, movement or contamination, the lead wire can be protected with a metal conduit, braided metal or silicone sleeves.&lt;ref&gt;http://freek-heaters.com/products/cartridge_heaters/options_for_cartridge_heaters.php&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lead wire type ===

Depending on the clearance and the design of the machine where the cartridge heater will be inserted, the type of wire used will vary. [[Fiberglass]] is the commonly used for cartridge heaters and other high-temperature applications, such as automotive wiring harnesses and industrial equipment. Other variants used are [[silicone]] impregnated fiberglass and [[silicone rubber]].

'''Centaur''' has been designed to be the [[upper stage]] of space [[launch vehicle]]s and is used on the [[Atlas V]]. Centaur was the world's first high-energy{{clarify|date=March 2018}} upper stage, burning [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX). Centaur has enabled the launch of some of [[NASA]]'s most important scientific missions during its 50-year history.

Centaur was the brainchild of [[Convair]] employees [[Karel Bossart]] (the man behind the [[SM-65 Atlas]], an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM)), and [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke]].&lt;ref name="Dawson2004"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dawson | first1=Virginia P. | last2=Bowles | first2=Mark D. | title=Taming Liquid Hydrogen: The Centaur Upper Stage Rocket 1958–2002 | year=2004 | publisher=NASA | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4230.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their design was essentially a smaller version of the Atlas, adopting its use of lightweight "[[stainless steel]] balloon" tanks whose structural rigidity was provided solely by the pressure of the propellants within. To keep the tanks from collapsing before the propellant was loaded, they were either kept in "stretch" or pressurized with nitrogen gas.

Existing Centaur stages are powered by one (Single Engine Centaur variant) or two (Double Engine Centaur variant) [[RL10]] rocket engines. The upcoming Centaur V will be powered by four RL10 engines.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==History==
In 1956, [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke]] of [[Convair]] began studying an LH2 upper stage rocket. The ensuing project began in 1958 as a joint venture among Convair, the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA), and the [[U.S. Air Force]]. In 1959, NASA assumed ARPA's role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/aclv3cb.html | title=Atlas Centaur LV-3C Development History}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed span|Development started at NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and later moved to the [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]], now the Glenn Research Center. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Centaur was proposed as a high energy upper stage for the [[Saturn I]], the [[Saturn IB]], and the [[Saturn V]] rockets under the designation "S-V" (pronounced "ess five") in accordance with the numbering of Saturn rocket stages. Centaur, however, never flew on any Saturn vehicle. The development work on Centaur proceeded slowly. The first test flight in May 1962 was unsuccessful.|date=June 2018}}

===Atlas-Centaur===
[[File:Surveyor 1 launch.jpg|thumb|An [[Atlas-Centaur]] rocket launches [[Surveyor 1]]|left]]

The Centaur was originally designed for use with the Atlas launch vehicle family, which shared its balloon structure. Known in early planning as the "high-energy upper stage", its eventual name was proposed by Ehricke, who was directing its development for [[General Dynamics]]. In recognition of the mythological [[Centaur (mythology)|half-man-half-horse Centaur]], the horse portion represented the "workhorse" [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]] as the "brawn" of the launch vehicle, while the man represented the "brain" of the combination in the Centaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Origin of NASA Names | author1=Helen T. Wells | author2=Susan H. Whiteley | author3=Carrie E. Karegeannes | publisher=NASA Science and Technical Information Office | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centaur was considered essential for both launching the [[Surveyor program|Surveyor]] probes and proving the viability of LH2 as a high energy fuel. Both were important to the [[Apollo program]]. The Surveyor probes were tasked with studying the [[lunar regolith]] and confirming the feasibility of crewed landings. LH2 had been selected as the ideal propellant for the Saturn I, IB, and V upper stages.&lt;ref name="Dawson2004"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Initial [[Atlas-Centaur]] launches used developmental versions, labeled Centaur-A through -C. The first launch on May 8, 1962, ended in an explosion 54 seconds after launch when insulation panels on the Centaur failed and caused the LH2 tank to rupture. After extensive redesigns, the next test on November 26, 1963, was successful.

On May 30, 1966, an Atlas-Centaur boosted the first Surveyor lander towards the Moon. The soft landing of ''[[Surveyor 1]]'' in the [[Ocean of Storms]] was NASA's first landing on any extraterrestrial body.&lt;ref name="Dawson2004"/&gt;{{rp|92}} {{citation needed span|This was followed by six more Surveyor missions over the next two years, with the Atlas-Centaur always performing as expected. These missions demonstrated the feasibility of reigniting a hydrogen engine in space, a capability vital to Apollo, and provided information on the behavior of LH2 in space.|date=June 2018}}

{{citation needed span|By the 1970s, Centaur was fully mature and had become the standard rocket stage for launching larger civilian payloads into high Earth orbit. In addition, it replaced the [[Atlas-Agena]] vehicle for NASA planetary probe missions. The U.S. Department of Defense meanwhile preferred to use the Titan booster family for its heavy lift needs.|date=June 2018}}

By the end of 1989, the Centaur-D had been used as the upper stage for 63 Atlas rocket launches, 55 of which were successful.&lt;ref name=GSPCentaur&gt;{{cite web | last=Krebs | first=Gunter | title=Centaur | work=Gunter's Space Page | url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_stage/centaur.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titan III-Centaur===
[[File:Titan 3E Centaur launches Voyager 2.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan IIIE-Centaur]] rocket launches [[Voyager 2]]]]

The Centaur stage was mated with the far more powerful [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan III]] booster in 1974, producing the [[Titan IIIE]] or Titan III-Centaur, with more than triple the payload capacity of Atlas-Centaur. This version of Centaur featured improved thermal insulation, allowing it to coast for five hours in orbit, up from the Atlas-Centaur's 30 minute maximum.&lt;ref name="Dawson2004"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

The first launch of Titan-Centaur in February 1974 was unsuccessful, with Centaur's engines failing to ignite after separation from the Titan booster. Without power, the Centaur was ordered to self-destruct by a [[range safety]] command. The original plan was to carry a simulated mockup of the $1 billion [[Viking program|Viking]] probe to be launched the following year. The ''Space Plasma High Voltage Experiment (SPHINX)'', which would have studied the interaction between spacecraft and high energy plasma, was instead added as a secondary payload and was destroyed. It was eventually determined that Centaur's engines had ingested an incorrectly installed clip from the oxygen tank.&lt;ref name="Dawson2004"/&gt;{{rp|145–146}}

The next Titan-Centaur flew in December 1974 and carried the joint [[West Germany|West German]]-American ''[[Helios 1]]'' probe to study the sun at close range. The West Germans were concerned that NASA was using the Helios launch as a second test flight of Titan/Centaur in preparation for the upcoming Viking missions. This concern gained believability when the Helios launch used an unnecessary two-burn profile, presumably a rehearsal for the Viking launch that needed the two burns. Centaur completed a further two burns after separation, proving the stage's in-space multi-restart capability.&lt;ref name="Dawson2004"/&gt;{{rp|149–150}}

In 1975, Titan-Centaur launched the ''[[Viking 1]]'' and ''[[Viking 2]]'' spacecraft to [[Mars]]. The original plan was to launch them on Saturn V rockets&lt;ref name="Dawson2004"/&gt;{{rp|154}} as the Vikings were the most massive interplanetary missions to date, with each including an orbiter and a lander. These missions were highly successful, with the ''Viking 1'' lander operating until 1982, and were the only NASA missions to study Mars until the ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' was launched in 1996.

These launches were followed by the 1976 launch of [[Helios 2 (NASA)|''Helios 2'']], another West German-U.S. solar probe that flew closer to the Sun than ''Helios 1''. ''Helios 2'' still holds the record for the highest speed of any spacecraft, with a [[Heliocentric orbit|heliocentric]] velocity of {{convert|70|km/s|mi/s kph mph}} at its closest approach to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.com/5786083/what-are-the-fastest-spacecrafts-ever-built | title=What are the fastest spacecraft we've ever built? | website=io9.com | accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Titan-Centaur's next two launches were the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft. ''Voyager 1'' visited [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. ''Voyager 2'' completed the [[Grand Tour program|"Grand Tour" of the outer planets]] by visiting Jupiter, Saturn, [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. A once-in-175-years alignment of those planets allowed gravitational assists to boost the probe from one planet to the next. ''Voyager 2'' was launched on August 20, 1977, followed 16 days later by ''Voyager 1''. ''Voyager 2'' is still the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus and Neptune. ''Voyager 1'' is the first spacecraft to have entered [[interstellar space]]. While the Titan-Centaur that launched ''Voyager 2'' performed flawlessly, the Titan booster used to launch ''Voyager 1'' had a hardware problem that caused a premature shutdown. The Centaur stage detected and successfully compensated for this problem, although Centaur ended its burn with less than 4 seconds of fuel remaining.&lt;ref name="Dawson2004"/&gt;{{rp|160}} This was the final launch of the Titan IIIE-Centaur.

===Shuttle-Centaur===
[[File:SHUTTLE-CENTAUR.JPG|left|thumb|Illustration of Shuttle-Centaur with Ulysses]]

With the introduction of the [[Space Shuttle]], NASA and the Air Force needed an upper stage to boost shuttle payloads out of low Earth orbit. The Centaur-G was developed for this purpose, with both [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] and [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] being modified to carry the stage. To enable its installation in shuttle payload bays, the diameter of the Centaur-G's hydrogen tank was increased to {{convert|14|ft}}. The diameter of its oxygen tank, however, remained at {{convert|10|ft}}. During its first mission on May 16, 1986, a Centaur-G was to have boosted the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'']] probe towards Jupiter. Just six days later, another Centaur-G would have boosted the ''[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]]'' probe towards Jupiter [[Gravitational assist|where it eventually - with an IUS - used the planet's gravity]] to reach a [[Orbital inclination|highly inclined]] solar orbit to observe the Sun's polar regions. A shortened version of the Centaur-G was planned to be used on shuttles carrying payloads for the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and for boosting the ''[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]]'' probe to Venus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920022007_1992022007.pdf | title=Graphite/Epoxy Composite Adapters for the Space Shuttle/Centaur Vehicle | author1=Harold J. Kasper | author2=Darryl S. Ring | publisher=Scientific and Technical Information Division of the NASA Office of Management | year=1980 | accessdate=December 15, 2013 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the development of the shuttle in the 1970s, NASA debated whether to use a solid-fueled [[Inertial Upper Stage]] (IUS) instead of a Centaur. An IUS was much lighter and safer than a Centaur. NASA was concerned, however, that the rough starting and extremely fast acceleration of a solid rocket motor could damage payloads. Unlike a Centaur, an IUS could not be turned off once ignited. In addition, an IUS would have a lower thrust than a Centaur, which meant that a shuttle would have to carry less complex payloads. However, the presence of several tons of volatile liquid hydrogen and oxygen on a shuttle was concerning, especially because no Centaur had been designed as a human-rated vehicle and lacked the safety features of both a shuttle and a Saturn upper stage. NASA was especially worried about a shuttle having to make an emergency landing with a fully fueled Centaur in its payload bay. The Centaur's weight would exceed the design capacity of the shuttle's landing gear, and there was no safe and reliable method for dumping the Centaur's fuel before the shuttle landed. In its favor, the Centaur had an excellent reliability record in recent years. As of April 1981, when the first shuttle flight occurred, a Centaur had failed to operate only twice in the 35 launches during the previous decade. Still, several astronauts were wary about flying a shuttle with a Centaur in its payload bay, and a few{{who|date=March 2018}} flat-out refused to do it. Ultimately, NASA decided that shuttles could carry Centaurs. Their superior performance and smoother engine starts versus an IUS were too important to disregard. Additionally, the Air Force needed a Centaur's extra power to launch its satellites during classified military shuttle missions. Another important factor was that the Titan-Centaur launch vehicle was the only alternative for planetary missions. The problem was that the Air Force controlled those vehicles, and two decades of those entities sharing a launch vehicle had proven that bad blood always resulted.

A Centaur, when carried in the shuttle payload bay, needs a complex airborne support system, known as the Centaur Integrated Support System (CISS). The CISS controls Centaur pressurization in flight and enables Centaur's cryogenic propellants to be dumped overboard quickly in the event of an [[Space Shuttle abort modes|abort]]. Shuttle-Centaur flights would have needed the shuttle's [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]] to run at 109 percent instead of the typical 104 percent, and the Shuttle would have had to orbit at its lowest possible altitude.&lt;ref name=Dawson2004 /&gt;{{rp|208–209}}

After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' accident]], and just months before the Shuttle-Centaur was scheduled to fly, NASA concluded that it was far too risky to fly the Centaur on the Shuttle.&lt;ref name="pd111211"/&gt; ''Galileo'', ''Ulysses'', and ''Magellan'' were boosted by the much less powerful solid-fueled IUS, with ''Galileo'' needing multiple gravitational assists from Venus and Earth to reach Jupiter.

===Titan IV-Centaur===
[[File:Titan 4B with Cassini-Huygens on board with the second launch attempt at Lauch Pad 40.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Titan IV|Titan-Centaur]] rocket launches [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini-Huygens]]]]

Termination of the Shuttle-Centaur program spurred the Air Force to create the [[Titan IV]]. In the 401A/B versions, the Centaur-T was used as its final stage. The diameter of its hydrogen tank was {{convert|14|ft}}. This vehicle was capable of launching the same payloads as the Shuttle-Centaur combination. In the Titan 401A version, a Centaur-T was launched nine times between 1994 and 1998. Titan-Centaur launched the [[Cassini Huygens|''Cassini-Huygens'']] probe to Saturn in 1997 on the debut flight of the Titan 401B, which launched an additional six times, with one failure. The last flight of the Titan IV/Centaur was in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Titan 4 Launch | url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/titan4_launch_030909.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708234022/http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/titan4_launch_030909.html|archive-date=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlas III===
Both versions of [[Atlas III]] used Centaur variants. Atlas IIIA used the Centaur II upper stage, developed for the Atlas II series. Atlas IIIB used a new version, Common Centaur.&lt;ref name=TCUSV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Upper_Stages/TheCentaurUpperStageVehicleHistory.pdf|title=The Centaur Upper Stage Vehicle|author1=Thomas J Rudman|author2=Kurt L Austad|publisher=Lockheed Martin|date=3 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlas V===
The [[Atlas V]] rocket currently uses the Common Centaur variant.&lt;ref name=TCUSV /&gt; In 2014, on the NROL-35 mission, Atlas V's Common Centaur first flew in a reengined configuration with an RL10-C-1 replacing its previous RL10-A-4-2. This engine is meant to be common between Centaur and the [[Delta Cryogenic Second Stage]] to reduce costs.&lt;ref name=NROL35Updates&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight101.net/atlas-v---nrol-35-launch-updates.html|title=Atlas V NROL-35 Launch Updates|publisher=Spaceflight 101|date=13 December 2014|access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFINROL35&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/defense/new-rl10c-engine-debuts-classified-nrol-35-launch/|title=new RL10C engine debuts on classified NROL-35 launch|author=Rae Botsford End|publisher=Spaceflight Insider|date=13 December 2014|access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; RL10-A-4-2 will continue to be used on some future flights. Atlas V launches using the Dual Engine Centaur configuration must use RL10-A-4-2 because the new engine is too wide to accommodate two side-by-side.&lt;ref name=SFINROL35 /&gt; To date, all Atlas V launches have used the Single Engine Centaur variant, however [[CST-100 Starliner]] and [[Dream Chaser]] missions will require the dual engine variant, because it allows a "flatter" trajectory which is safer for aborts.

As on Titan-Centaur, Atlas V 500 launches encapsulate the upper stage inside the payload fairing, to reduce aerodynamic loads. Atlas V 400 flights carry the fairing on top of Centaur, exposing it to the air.

===Vulcan-Centaur===
The new [[Vulcan (rocket)|Vulcan]] launch vehicle currently being developed by [[United Launch Alliance]] will initially fly with an upgraded variant of the Common Centaur stage flown on Atlas V known as Centaur V&lt;ref name=sn20171010&gt;

When the new ULA successor to the Atlas V was initially announced in 2015, it was slated to initially use a Centaur upper stage, but no mention was made at that time about an upgrade to a newer version.&lt;ref name=dp20150413/&gt;

==Design==
Centaur uses so-called "balloon tanks", made of stainless steel so thin they cannot support their own weight without pressurization. This tank design, with walls as thin as {{convert|0.03|inch}}, allowed for an extremely high ratio of fuel to dry mass, maximizing the stage's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stiennon |first1=Patrick J. G. |last2=Hoerr |first2=David M. |date=Jul 15, 2005 |title=The Rocket Company |publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] |page=93 |isbn=1-56347-696-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a common double-bulkhead to separate the LOX and LH2 tanks. The two stainless steel skins are separated by a 0.25&amp;nbsp;inch (6.4&amp;nbsp;mm) layer of fiberglass honeycomb. The extreme cold of the LH2 on one side creates a vacuum within the fiberglass layer,{{fact|date=June 2016}} decreasing the bulkhead's thermal conductivity, and thus reducing heat transfer from the relatively warm LOX to the super cold LH2.

Attitude control and ullage are provided by means of [[hydrazine]] [[monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] thrusters located around the stage. There are two 2-thruster pods and four 4-thruster pods, sixteen in total, fed from a pair of bladder tanks carrying 340 pounds of hydrazine. Tank pressurization, as well as some engine functions, use helium gas.&lt;ref name=TCUSV /&gt; The main propulsion system consists of one or two [[RL10]] engines. These engines can be restarted multiple times, given sufficient power, helium, and ullage propellant, allowing Centaur to perform complex orbital insertions and deorbit burns.

Common Centaur, on Atlas V, can accommodate secondary payloads using its Aft Bulkhead Carrier, a mounting fixture on the rear end of the stage, near the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Launch_Vehicles/ABC_Users_Guide_2014.pdf|title=Aft Bulkhead Carrier Auxiliary Payload User's Guide|publisher=United Launch Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
{{expandsection|this section is missing info on which Centaur version was used on the Atlas V, and also on the Centaur T which is mentioned earlier in the article|date=May 2018}}
===Centaur-D===
Centaur-D was the first Centaur version to enter operational service.&lt;ref name=AWC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Boosters/Centaur/Centaur.htm|title=Centaur Upper Stage Family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centaur II===
Centaur II was initially developed for use on the Atlas II series of rockets. It was also used on the Atlas IIIA.&lt;ref name=AWC /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCUSV /&gt;

===Centaur V===
In late 2017, ULA decided to bring elements of the ACES upper stage forward and begin work on Centaur V.  This upper stage would be expanded to the same {{convert|5.4|m|sp=us|adj=on}}-diameter of Vulcan core, using  a cluster of four LH2/LOX engines ([[BE-3U]] or [[RL-10]]), but not include the [[Integrated Vehicle Fluids]] (IVF) feature expected with ACES.
Bringing critical items from [[Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage|ACES]] to Centaur V, at this time, is expected to increase the lift capacity of the first generation Vulcan, so it can carry planned national security payloads. Centaur V would permit ULA to retire both the Atlas V and Delta IV rocket families on a faster schedule.

By March 2018, ULA had begun to publicly refer to the new [[Vulcan (rocket)|Vulcan]] first stage with the Centaur V second stage as the ''[[Vulcan Centaur]]''.&lt;ref name=“sn20180325”&gt;

== Current status ==
[[Image:Centaur upper stage of Atlas V rocket.jpg|A single-engine Centaur, being raised for mating to an [[Atlas V]] rocket|thumb|150px]]
{{As of|2009}}, derivatives of the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} Centaur-3, with one RL-10A4-2 engine, continue to be used as the upper stage of the [[Atlas V]] [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle|EELV]] rocket. There is an option to fly the Atlas V with a two engined Centaur, which is planned to be used for manned launches with the [[CST-100 Starliner]] and [[Dream Chaser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sierra Nevada books first launch for 'space SUV'|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1401/26sierranevada/#.UuaMbhAo5pg|publisher=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=28 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209204009/http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1401/26sierranevada/|archivedate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) had been working on an upper stage design concept that would bring the Delta and Centaur stages together into a single new cryogenic second stage design, called the [[Advanced Common Evolved Stage]], was originally intended as a lower-cost, more-capable and more-flexible upper stage that would supplement, and perhaps replace, the existing ULA (Lockheed Martin legacy) Centaur and the ULA (Boeing legacy) [[Delta IV#Vehicle description|Delta Cryogenic Second Stage]] (DCSS) upper stage vehicles. ACES design conceptualization has been underway at ULA for many years, and leverages design features of both the Centaur and Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) upper stages.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902&gt;{{cite web|last=Zegler |first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/publications/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference &amp; Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2011-01-25 |author2=Bernard Kutter |date=2010-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020010301/http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/publications/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the decision to discontinue both the Delta IV and Atlas V lines by the 2020s, ULA also abandoned work on replacing their upper stages. ACES will continue to be developed, and will be deployed on [[Vulcan (rocket)|Vulcan]].&lt;ref name=sn20150413 /&gt;

Although Centaur has a long and successful history in planetary exploration, it has had its share of problems, especially early on:
* May 8, 1962:  Centaur weather shield separated early; stage exploded. Footage of this was used in the film [[Koyaanisqatsi]].
* June 30, 1964:  RL-10 hydraulic actuator pump shaft broke, preventing one of the two RL-10 engines from vectoring.  This led to no roll control, and uncovering of LOX inlet.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Future uses ==
Performance levels for a planned Evolved Centaur based Phase 1 vehicles envelope all Atlas V capabilities. In certain circumstances a single Atlas booster vehicle with five solids and with an evolved Centaur upper-stage can replace a three-booster core [[Atlas V#Future developments|Atlas V-Heavy]] (HLV).  This has obvious reliability and cost benefits. Phase 2 vehicles open the door to a vastly higher performance capability. Up to 80 metric tons can be lifted to low earth orbit on a Phase 2 HLV vehicle&amp;nbsp;— a substantial fraction of a [[Saturn V]] or [[Space Launch System|SLS]] vehicle. This performance level, mandated only by NASA crewed exploration missions, can be achieved using hardware identical to that used for traditional commercial and USG missions thus allowing development and support costs to be diluted by rate.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Studies have been conducted showing the extensibility of the basic Centaur and Evolved Centaur designs to long duration space flight for exploration purposes and even for use as a Lunar Lander. Complementing these basic performance capabilities is the ability to rate the vehicle for crewed operation. Extensive work has been conducted showing that achieving this "man-rating" is straightforward and does not mandate wholesale design changes to the Centaur vehicle.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== Test bed for cryogenic fluid management experiments ===
By 2006, Lockheed Martin Space Systems had described the ability to use existing Centaur hardware, with little modification, as a test bed for in-space cryogenic fluid management techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/GLTRS/browse.pl?all/CR-2006-214410.html |title=Centaur Test Bed (CTB) for Cryogenic Fluid Management |last=Sakla |first=Steven |author2=Kutter, Bernard |author3=Wall, John |year=2006 |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619214938/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/GLTRS/browse.pl?all%2FCR-2006-214410.html |archivedate=2009-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Centaurs launched on Atlas have excess propellants, ranging from hundreds to thousands of pounds, which could be used for "rideshare" experiments flown as secondary payloads conducted after separation of the primary spacecraft.

In October 2009, the [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) performed an experimental [[low Earth orbit|on-orbit]] demonstration on a modified Centaur upper stage on the [[DMSP-18]] [[Atlas V#Atlas V launches&lt;!-- Atlas launch ID "AV-017" --&gt;|launch]] to improve "understanding of [[Propellant depot#Propellant settling|propellant settling]] and [[Slosh dynamics|slosh]], pressure control, [[RL10]] chilldown and RL10 two-phase shutdown operations.

The '''Chandrapur–Padghe HVDC transmission system''' is an [[HVDC]] connection&lt;ref&gt;Adhikari, T., Isacsson, G., Ambekar, V.D., The Chandrapur-Padghe HVDC Bipole Transmission, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] Symposium on HVDC, [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Chandrapur]] and [[Borivali-Padgha|Padghe]] (near [[Mumbai]]) in the state of [[Maharashtra]] in [[India]], which was put into service in 1999.

It connects the coal-fired [[Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station]] to the major load centre of Mumbai.  The project has a {{convert|752|km}} long bipolar overhead line.  The transmission voltage is ±500&amp;nbsp;kV and the maximum transmission power is 1,500&amp;nbsp;megawatts. The scheme uses [[thyristor]] valves, arranged in a single [[HVDC converter#Twelve-pulse bridge|twelve pulse bridge]] per pole.  The project was built by [[ABB Group|ABB]] and [[BHEL]], and is owned by [[Maharashtra State Electricity Board]] (MSEB).

The eastern (Chandrapur) [[HVDC converter station|converter station]] is located {{convert|20|km}} from the [[Chandrapur back to back HVDC converter station|Chandrapur back to back]] HVDC station. The close proximity of the two converter stations meant that the control systems needed to be carefully coordinated, a task made more challenging by the fact that the two stations were built by different manufacturers.  To address this problem a series of joint simulation studies, involving the control equipment from both converter stations connected to a common simulator, was performed.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, K.M., Aten, M., [http://www.e-cigre.org/bib/14_109_2000.pdf Two HVDC schemes in close proximity: a coordination study]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] Session, Paris, 2000, paper reference 14-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cyclic compound''' (''ring compound'') is a term for a [[chemical compound|compound]] in the field of [[chemistry]] in which one or more series of atoms in the compound is connected to form a [[Ring (chemistry)|ring]]. Rings may vary in size from three to many atoms, and include examples where all the atoms are carbon (i.e., are [[carbocycle]]s), none of the atoms are carbon (inorganic cyclic compounds), or where both carbon and non-carbon atoms are present ([[heterocyclic]] compounds). Depending on the ring size, the [[bond order]] of the individual links between ring atoms, and their arrangements within the rings, carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds may be [[aromatic compound|aromatic]] or non-aromatic, in the latter case, they may vary from being fully [[saturated compound|saturated]] to having varying numbers of multiple bonds between the ring atoms. Because of the tremendous diversity allowed, in combination, by the [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]]s of common atoms and their ability to form rings, the number of possible cyclic structures, even of small size (e.g., &lt;17 total atoms) numbers in the many billions. 
&lt;gallery caption="Cyclic compound examples: All-carbon (carbocyclic) and more complex [[natural product|natural]] cyclic compounds." widths="250 px" align=center&gt;
Image: Ingenol.svg| [[Ingenol]], a complex, [[terpene|terpenoid]] [[natural product]], related to but simpler than the [[paclitaxel]] that follows, which displays a complex ring structure including 3-, 5-, and 7-membered non-[[aromatic]], carbocyclic rings.
Image:First_four_cycloalkanes.png | [[Cycloalkane]]s, the simplest [[carbocycle]]s, including [[cyclopropane]], [[cyclobutane]], [[cyclopentane]], and [[cyclohexane]]. Note, elsewhere an [[organic chemistry]] shorthand is used where hydrogen atoms are inferred as present to fill the carbon's valence of 4 (rather than their being shown explicitly).
Image:Taxol.svg | [[Paclitaxel]], another complex, plant-derived [[terpene|terpenoid]], also a natural product, displaying a complex multi-ring structure including 4-, 6-, and 8-membered rings (carbocyclic and [[heterocyclic]], [[aromatic]] and non-aromatic).
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Adding to their complexity and number, closing of atoms into rings may lock particular atoms with distinct [[substituent|substitution]] (by [[functional group]]s) such that [[stereochemistry]] and [[chirality]] of the compound results, including some manifestations that are unique to rings (e.g., [[geometric isomers|configurational isomers]]). As well, depending on ring size, the three-dimensional shapes of particular cyclic structures—typically rings of 5-atoms and larger—can vary and interconvert such that [[conformational isomerism]] is displayed. Indeed, the development of this important chemical concept arose, historically, in reference to cyclic compounds. Finally, cyclic compounds, because of the unique shapes, reactivities, properties, and [[bioactivity|bioactivities]] that they engender, are the largest majority of all molecules involved in the biochemistry, structure, and function of [[living organism]]s, and in the man-made molecules (e.g., drugs, herbicides, etc.).

==Structural introduction==
A ''cyclic compound or ring compound'' is a [[chemical compound|compound]] at least some of whose atoms are connected to form a ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{JerryMarch}}.{{page needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|unknown}}{{page needed|date=June 2015}} Rings vary in size from 3 to many tens or even hundreds of atoms. Examples of ring compounds readily include cases where:
* all the atoms are carbon (i.e., are [[carbocycle]]s), 
* none of the atoms are carbon (inorganic cyclic compounds),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01141802 |title=Classification of inorganic cyclic compounds |journal=Journal of Structural Chemistry |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=350–8 |year=1961 |last1=Halduc |first1=I. }}&lt;/ref&gt; or where
* both carbon and non-carbon atoms are present ([[heterocyclic]] compounds).

Common atoms can (as a result of their [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]]s) form varying numbers of bonds, and many common atoms readily form rings. In addition, depending on the ring size, the [[bond order]] of the individual links between ring atoms, and their arrangements within the rings, cyclic compounds may be [[aromatic compound|aromatic]] or non-aromatic; in the case of non-aromatic cyclic compounds, they may vary from being fully [[saturated compound|saturated]] to having varying numbers of multiple bonds. As a consequence of the constitutional variability that is [[chemical thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] possible in cyclic structures, the number of possible cyclic structures, even of small size (e.g., &lt;17 atoms) numbers in the many billions.&lt;ref name = ReymondACR15&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ar500432k |pmid=25687211 |title=The Chemical Space Project |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=722–30 |year=2015 |last1=Reymond |first1=Jean-Louis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the closing of atoms into rings may lock particular [[functional group]]–[[substituent|substituted]] atoms into place, resulting in [[stereochemistry]] and [[chirality]] being associated with the compound, including some manifestations that are unique to rings (e.g., [[geometric isomers|configurational isomers]]);&lt;ref name=Reusch10&gt;William Reusch, 2010, "Stereoisomers Part I," In ''Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry,'' Michigan State University, see [http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/sterisom.htm#start], accessed 7 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, depending on ring size, the three-dimensional shapes of particular cyclic structures—typically rings of 5-atoms and larger—can vary and interconvert such that [[conformational isomerism]] is displayed.&lt;ref name=Reusch10/&gt;

==Nomenclature==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
IUPAC nomenclature has extensive rules to cover the naming of cyclic structures, both as core structures, and as substituents appended to [[alicyclic]] structures.{{vague|date=April 2015}}{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The term [[macrocycle]] is used when a ring-containing compound has a ring of 8 or more atoms.&lt;ref name=StillTet81&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)93273-9 |title=Chemical consequences of conformation in macrocyclic compounds |journal=Tetrahedron |volume=37 |issue=23 |pages=3981–96 |year=1981 |last1=Still |first1=W.Clark |last2=Galynker |first2=Igor }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DunitzPersp68&gt;J. D. Dunitz. Perspectives in Structural Chemistry (Edited by J. D. Dunitz and J. A. Ibers), Vol. 2, pp. l-70; Wiley, New York (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[polycyclic compound|polycyclic]] is used when more than one ring appears in a single molecule.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Naphthalene]] is formally a polycyclic, but is more specifically named as a  bicyclic compound. Several examples of macrocyclic and polycyclic structures are given in the final gallery below.

{{anchor|annular atom}}
The atoms that are part of the ring structure are called annular atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Christopher G.|last2=Press|first2=Academic|title=Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=9780122004001|page=120|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nauWlPTBcjIC&amp;pg=PA120|language=en|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbocycles==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
The vast majority of cyclic compounds are [[organic compound|organic]], and of these, a significant and conceptually important portion are composed of rings made only of carbon atoms (i.e., they are carbocycles).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Inorganic cyclic compounds==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Inorganic atoms form cyclic compounds as well. Examples include [[sulfur]], [[silicon]] (e.g., in [[silanes]]), [[phosphorus]] (e.g., in [[phosphane]]s and [[phosphoric acid]] variants), and [[boron]] (e.g., in triboric acid).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  When carbon in benzene is "replaced" by other elements, e.g., as in [[borabenzene]], [[silabenzene]], [[germanabenzene]], [[stannabenzene]], and [[phosphorine]], aromaticity is retained, and so [[Aromaticity#Atypical aromatic compounds|aromatic inorganic cyclic compounds]] are known and well-characterized.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Heterocyclic compounds==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Cyclic compounds that have both carbon and non-carbon atoms present are termed ([[heterocyclic]] compounds);{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} alternatively the name can refer to inorganic cyclic compounds, such as siloxanes and borazines, that have more than one type of atom in their rings.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature is recommended by the IUPAC for naming heterocycles, but many common names remain in regular use.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Aromaticity==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Cyclic compounds may or may not exhibit [[aromaticity]]; [[benzene]] is an example of an aromatic cyclic compound, while [[cyclohexane]] is non-aromatic. In organic chemistry, the term aromaticity is used to describe a cyclic (ring-shaped), planar (flat) molecule that exhibits unusual stability as compared to other geometric or connective arrangements of the same set of atoms. As a result of their stability, it is very difficult to cause aromatic molecules to break apart and to react with other substances. Organic compounds that are not aromatic are classified as aliphatic compounds—they might be cyclic, but only aromatic rings have especial stability (low reactivity).

Since one of the most commonly encountered aromatic systems of compounds in organic chemistry is based on derivatives of the prototypical aromatic compound benzene (an aromatic hydrocarbon common in petroleum and its distillates), the word “aromatic” is occasionally used to refer informally to benzene derivatives, and this is how it was first defined. Nevertheless, many non-benzene aromatic compounds exist. In living organisms, for example, the most common aromatic rings are the double-ringed bases in RNA and DNA. A functional group or other substituent that is aromatic is called an aryl group.

The earliest use of the term “aromatic” was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855.[1] Hofmann used the term for a class of benzene compounds, many of which do have odors (aromas), unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons. Today, there is no general relationship between aromaticity as a chemical property and the olfactory properties of such compounds (how they smell), although in 1855, before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood, chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants, such as terpenes, had chemical properties we recognize today are similar to unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene.

In terms of the electronic nature of the molecule, aromaticity describes a conjugated system often made of alternating single and double bonds in a ring. This configuration allows for the electrons in the molecule’s pi system to be delocalized around the ring, increasing the molecule's stability. The molecule cannot be represented by one structure, but rather a resonance hybrid of different structures, such as with the two resonance structures of benzene. These molecules cannot be found in either one of these representations, with the longer single bonds in one location and the shorter double bond in another (See Theory below). Rather, the molecule exhibits bond lengths in between those of single and double bonds. This commonly seen model of aromatic rings, namely the idea that benzene was formed from a six-membered carbon ring with alternating single and double bonds (cyclohexatriene), was developed by August Kekulé (see History section below). The model for benzene consists of two resonance forms, which corresponds to the double and single bonds superimposing to produce six one-and-a-half bonds. Benzene is a more stable molecule than would be expected without accounting for charge delocalization.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Simple, mono-cyclic examples==
The following are examples of simple and aromatic carbocycles, inorganic cyclic compounds, and heterocycles:
&lt;gallery caption="Simple mono-cyclic compounds: Carbocyclic, inorganic, and heterocyclic (aromatic and non-aromatic) examples."&gt;
Image:Cycloheptane.png | [[Cycloheptane]], a simple 7-membered carbocyclic compound, [[methylene group|methylene]] hydrogens shown (non-aromatic).

Image:Pyridine.svg|[[Pyridine]], a 6 membered heterocyclic compound, [[methine]] hydrogen atoms implied, not shown, and [[delocalized]] π-electrons shown as discrete bonds (aromatic).
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Stereochemistry==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
The closing of atoms into rings may lock particular atoms with distinct [[substituent|substitution]] by functional groups such that the result is [[stereochemistry]] and [[chirality]] of the compound, including some manifestations that are unique to rings (e.g., [[geometric isomers|configurational isomers]]).&lt;ref name="Reusch10"/&gt;

The structures are shown in line angle representation, though in the image at left, the lines projecting from the cyclohexane are not terminal methyl groups; rather, they indicate ''possible'' positions that might be occupied by [[substituents]] ([[functional groups]]) attached to the ring. In the image at left, those groups projecting upward and downward are termed ''axial substituents'' ('''a'''), and those groups projecting around the conceptual [[equator]] are termed ''equatorial substituents'' ('''e'''). Note, in general, the axial substituents are closer in space to one another (allowing for repulsive interactions); moreover, in the boat form, axial substituents in directly opposing positions (12 o'clock and 6 o'clock, termed "1,4-") are very close in space, and therefore give rise to even greater repulsion. These and other types of [[strain (chemistry)|strain]] are used to explain the observation that ''the chair conformation of cyclohexanes is the favored conformation''.&lt;ref name=Reusch10/&gt;

}}

Depending on ring size, the three-dimensional shapes of particular cyclic structures—typically rings of 5-atoms and larger—can vary and interconvert such that [[conformational isomerism]] is displayed.&lt;ref name=Reusch10/&gt; Indeed, the development of this important chemical concept arose, historically, in reference to cyclic compounds. For instance, [[cyclohexane]]s—six membered [[carbocycle]]s with no double bonds, to which various substituents might be attached, see image—display an equilibrium between two conformations, the ''chair'' and the ''boat,'' as shown in the image.

The chair conformation is the favored configuration, because in this conformation, the [[steric strain]], [[eclipsing strain]], and [[angle strain]] that are otherwise possible are minimized.&lt;ref name=Reusch10/&gt; Which of the ''possible'' chair conformations predominate in cyclohexanes bearing one or more substituents depends on the substiuents, and where they are located on the ring; generally, "bulky" substituents—those groups with large ''[[molecular volume|volumes]],'' or groups that are otherwise repulsive in their [[intermolecular interactions|interactions]]{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}—prefer to occupy an equatorial location.&lt;ref name=Reusch10/&gt; An example of interactions within a molecule that would lead to [[steric strain]], leading to a shift in equilibrium from boat to chair, is the interaction between the two [[methyl group]]s in ''cis''-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane. In this molecule, the two methyl groups are in opposing positions of the ring (1,4-), and their ''cis'' stereochemistry projects both of these groups toward the same side of the ring. Hence, if forced into the higher energy boat form, these methyl groups are in steric contact, repel one another, and drive the equilibrium toward the chair conformation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Macrocycles==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
{{refimprove science|section|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Cycloctane conformations.jpg|right|240px]]
The term [[macrocycle]] is used for compounds having a rings of 8 or more atoms.&lt;ref name=StillTet81/&gt;&lt;ref name=DunitzPersp68/&gt; Macrocycles may be fully carbocyclic, heterocyclic but having limited heteroatoms (e.g., in [[lactone]]s and [[lactam]]s), or be rich in heteroatoms and displaying significant symmetry (e.g., in the case of chelating macrocycles). Macrocycles can access a number of stable [[Conformational isomerism|conformation]]s, with preference to reside in conformations that minimize [[transannular]] nonbonded interactions within the ring (e.g., with the chair and chair-boat being more stable than the boat-boat conformation for cyclooctane, because of the interactions depicted by the arcs shown).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Medium rings (8-11 atoms) are the most strained, with between 9-13 (kcal/mol) strain energy, and analysis of factors important in the conformations of larger macrocycles can be modeled using medium ring conformations.&lt;ref&gt;Eliel, E.L., Wilen, S.H. and Mander, L.S.

Because of the unique shapes, reactivities, properties, and [[bioactivity|bioactivities]] that they engender, cyclic compounds are the largest majority of all molecules involved in the biochemistry, structure, and function of [[living organism]]s, and in the man-made molecules (e.g., drugs, herbicides, etc.) through which man attempts to exert control over nature and biological systems.

==Complex and polycyclic examples==
The following are examples of cyclic compounds exhibiting more complex ring systems and stereochemical features:

There are a variety of specialized reactions whose use is solely the formation of rings, and these will be discussed below. In addition to those, there are a wide variety of ''general'' organic reactions that historically have been crucial in the development, first, of understanding the concepts of ring chemistry, and second, of reliable procedures for preparing ring structures in high [[reaction yield|yield]], and with defined orientation of ring substituents (i.e., defined [[stereochemistry]]). These general reactions include:

The '''hydrogen molecular ion''', '''dihydrogen cation''', or {{chem|H|2|+}}, is the simplest [[molecular ion]]. It is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], and can be formed from [[ionization]] of a neutral [[hydrogen molecule]]. It is of great historical and theoretical interest because, having only one electron, the electronic [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system (in the clamped-nuclei approximation) can be solved in a relatively straightforward way due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion ([[electron correlation]]). The analytical solutions for the electronic energy eigenvalues are a ''generalization'' of the [[Lambert W function]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=T. C. |last2=Aubert-Frécon |first2=M. |last3=Grotendorst |first3=J. |year=2006 |title=New Approach for the Electronic Energies of the Hydrogen Molecular Ion |journal=Chem.

Consequently, it is included as an example in most [[quantum chemistry]] textbooks.

The first successful quantum mechanical treatment of {{chem|H|2|+}} was published by the Danish physicist [[Øyvind Burrau]] in 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Burrau |first=Ø. |title=Berechnung des Energiewertes des Wasserstoffmolekel-Ions ({{chem|H|2|+}}) im Normalzustand. |journal=Danske Vidensk.

Earlier attempts using the [[old quantum theory]] had been published in 1922 by [[Karel Niessen]]&lt;ref&gt;Karel F. Niessen ''Zur Quantentheorie des Wasserstoffmolekülions'', doctoral dissertation, University of Utrecht, Utrecht: I. Van Druten (1922) as cited in Mehra, Volume 5, Part 2, 2001, p. 932.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pauli W |title=Über das Modell des Wasserstoffmolekülions |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=373 |issue=11 |pages=177–240 |year=1922 |doi=10.1002/andp.19223731101}}  Extended doctoral dissertation; received 4 March 1922, published in issue No. 11 of 3 August 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1925 by [[Harold Urey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Urey HC |title=The Structure of the Hydrogen Molecule Ion |journal=Proc.

U.S.A. |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=618–21 |date=October 1925 |pmid=16587051 |pmc=1086173 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.11.10.618|url=|bibcode=1925PNAS...11..618U }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, [[Linus Pauling]] published a review putting together the work of Burrau with the work of [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] on the hydrogen molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Chemical Reviews |author=Pauling, L. |title=The Application of the Quantum Mechanics to the Structure of the Hydrogen Molecule and Hydrogen Molecule-Ion and to Related Problems |year=1928 |volume=5 |pages=173–213 |doi=10.1021/cr60018a003|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonding in {{chem|H|2|+}} can be described as a covalent [[one-electron bond]], which has a formal [[bond order]] of one half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Clark R. Landis; Frank Weinhold |title=Valency and bonding: a natural bond orbital donor-acceptor perspective |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2005 |pages=91–92 |isbn=978-0-521-83128-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ion is commonly formed in [[molecular cloud]]s in space, and is important in the chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]].

==Quantum mechanical treatment, symmetries, and asymptotics==
[[Image:hydrogen molecular ion.png|thumb|300px|right| Hydrogen molecular ion {{chem|H|2|+}} with clamped nuclei ''A'' and ''B'', internuclear distance ''R'' and plane of symmetry ''M''.]]The  electronic Schrödinger wave equation for the hydrogen molecular ion {{chem|H|2|+}} with two fixed nuclear centers, labeled ''A'' and ''B'', and one electron can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
\left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V \right) \psi = E \psi ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is the electron-nuclear Coulomb potential energy function:
:&lt;math&gt;
V =  - \frac{e^{2}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 } \left( \frac{1}{r_a} + \frac{1}{r_b}   \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
and ''E'' is the (electronic) energy of a given quantum mechanical state (eigenstate), with the electronic state function ''ψ'' = ''ψ''('''r''') depending on the spatial coordinates of the electron. An additive term {{sfrac|1|''R''}}, which is constant for fixed internuclear distance ''R'', has been omitted from the potential ''V'', since it merely shifts the eigenvalue. The distances between the electron and the nuclei are denoted ''r&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''r&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''. In atomic units (''ħ'' = ''m'' = ''e'' = 4{{pi}}''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1) the wave equation is
:&lt;math&gt;\left( -\tfrac12 \nabla^2 + V \right) \psi = E \psi    \qquad \mbox{with} \qquad  V = -\frac{1}{r_a} - \frac{1}{r_b} \; .
&lt;/math&gt;
We choose the midpoint between the nuclei as the origin of coordinates. It follows from general symmetry principles that the wave functions can be characterized by their symmetry behavior with respect to the point group inversion operation '''''i''''' ('''r''' ↦ −'''r'''). There are wave functions ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;('''r'''), which are ''symmetric'' with respect to '''''i''''', and there are wave functions ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;('''r'''), which are ''antisymmetric'' under this symmetry operation:
:&lt;math&gt; \psi_{g/u}(-{\mathbf{r}}) = {} \pm \psi_{g/u}({\mathbf r}) \; . &lt;/math&gt;
The suffixes [[Molecular term symbol|g and u]] are from the German ''gerade'' and ''ungerade'') occurring here denote the symmetry behavior under the point group inversion operation '''''i'''''. Their use is standard practice for the designation of electronic states of diatomic molecules, whereas for atomic states the terms ''even'' and ''odd'' are used.
The ground state (the lowest state) of {{chem|H|2|+}} is denoted X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Σ{{su|b=g|p=+}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huber |first=K.-P. |authorlink2=Gerhard Herzberg |last2=Herzberg |first2=G. |year=1979 |title=Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure. IV. Constants of Diatomic Molecules |location=New York |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold }}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1sσ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and it is gerade. There is also the first excited state A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Σ{{su|b=u|p=+}} (2pσ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;), which is ungerade.  
[[Image:h2plus figure 2.png|thumb|500px|right| Energies (''E'') of the lowest states of the hydrogen molecular ion {{chem|H|2|+}} as a function of internuclear distance (''R'') in atomic units. See text for details.]]
Asymptotically, the (total) eigenenergies ''E''&lt;sub&gt;{g/u}&lt;/sub&gt; for these two lowest lying states have the same asymptotic expansion in inverse powers of the inter-nuclear distance ''R'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Čížek |first=J. |last2=Damburg |first2=R.

:&lt;math&gt; 
E_{g/u} = - \frac12 - \frac{9}{4 R^4} + O\left(R^{-6}\right)  + \cdots 
&lt;/math&gt;
The actual difference between these two energies is called the [[exchange interaction|exchange energy]] splitting and is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=T. C. |authorlink2=Alexander Dalgarno |last2=Dalgarno |first2=A. |last3=Morgan |first3=J. D., III |year=1991 |title=Exchange Energy of {{chem|H|2|+}} Calculated from Polarization Perturbation Theory and the [[Holstein–Herring method|Holstein-Herring Method]] |journal=[[Physical Review Letters|Phys. Rev. Lett.]] |volume=67 |issue=11 |pages=1419–1422 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.67.1419 |bibcode=1991PhRvL..67.1419S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 
\Delta E = E_{u} - E_{g} = \frac{4}{e} \, R \, e^{-R}      \left[ \, 1 + \frac{1}{2R} + O\left(R^{-2}\right) \, \right] 
&lt;/math&gt;
which exponentially vanishes as the inter-nuclear distance ''R'' gets greater.  The lead term {{nowrap|{{sfrac|4|''e''}}''Re''&lt;sup&gt;−''R''&lt;/sup&gt;}} was first obtained by the [[Holstein–Herring method]].  Similarly, asymptotic expansions in powers of {{sfrac|1|''R''}} have been obtained to high order by Cizek ''et al.'' for the lowest ten discrete states of the hydrogen molecular ion (clamped nuclei case). For general diatomic and polyatomic molecular systems, the exchange energy is thus very elusive to calculate at large internuclear distances but is nonetheless needed for long-range interactions including studies related to magnetism and charge exchange effects. These are of particular importance in stellar and atmospheric physics.

The energies for the lowest discrete states are shown in the graph above.  These can be obtained to within arbitrary accuracy using [[computer algebra]] from the generalized [[Lambert W function]] (see eq. (3) in that site and the reference of Scott, Aubert-Frécon, and Grotendorst) but were obtained initially by numerical means to within double precision by the most precise program available, namely ODKIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hadinger |first=G. |last2=Aubert-Frécon |first2=M. |last3=Hadinger |first3=G. |year=1989 |title=The Killingbeck method for the one-electron two-centre problem |journal=[[Journal of Physics B|J. Phys. B]] |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=697–712 |doi=10.1088/0953-4075/22/5/003 |bibcode=1989JPhB...22..697H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The red solid lines are &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Σ{{su|b=g|p=+}} states.  The green dashed lines are &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Σ{{su|b=u|p=+}} states. The blue dashed line is a &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Π&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; state and the pink dotted line is a &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Π&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; state.  Note that although the generalized [[Lambert W function]] eigenvalue solutions supersede these asymptotic expansions, in practice, they are most useful near the [[bond length]].  These solutions are possible because the [[partial differential equation]] of the wave equation here separates into two coupled [[ordinary differential equations]] using [[prolate spheroidal coordinates]].

The complete Hamiltonian of {{chem|H|2|+}} (as for all centrosymmetric molecules) does not commute with the point group inversion operation '''''i''''' because of the effect of the nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian. The nuclear hyperfine Hamiltonian can mix the rotational levels of '''''g''''' and '''''u''''' electronic states (called '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' mixing) and give
rise to '''''ortho'''''-'''''para''''' transitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pique | first = J.

==Formation==
The dihydrogen ion is formed in nature by the interaction of [[cosmic ray]]s and the hydrogen molecule.  An electron is knocked off leaving the cation behind.&lt;ref name="eherbstastro"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herbst|first=E.|authorlink=|year=2000|title=The Astrochemistry of {{chem|H|3|+}}|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=358|issue=1774|pages=2523–2534|doi=10.1098/rsta.2000.0665|url=|accessdate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + cosmic ray → {{chem|H|2|+}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + cosmic ray.
Cosmic ray particles have enough energy to ionize many molecules before coming to a stop.

In nature the ion is destroyed by reacting with other hydrogen molecules:
:{{chem|H|2|+}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Trihydrogen cation|{{chem|H|3|+}}]] + H.

The ionization energy of the hydrogen molecule is 15.603&amp;nbsp;eV.  The dissociation energy of the ion is 1.8&amp;nbsp;eV. High speed electrons also cause ionization of hydrogen molecules with a peak cross section around 50&amp;nbsp;eV.  The peak cross section for ionization for high speed protons is {{val|70000|u=eV}} with a cross section of {{val|2.5e-16|u=cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  A cosmic ray proton at lower energy can also strip an electron off a neutral hydrogen molecule to form a neutral hydrogen atom and the dihydrogen cation, (p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; H + {{chem|H|2|+}}) with a peak cross section at around {{val|8000|u=eV}} of {{val|8e-16|u=cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Marco |last=Padovani |first2=Daniele |last2=Galli |first3=Alfred E. |last3=Glassgold |arxiv=0904.4149 |title=Cosmic-ray ionization of molecular clouds |year=2009 |journal= Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=501 |issue=2 |pages=619–631 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/200911794 |bibcode=2009A&amp;A...501..619P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial [[plasma discharge]] cell can also produce the ion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

A '''dowel''' is a cylindrical [[Rod (geometry)|rod]], usually made from [[wood]], [[plastic]], or [[metal]]. In its original manufactured form, a dowel is called a ''dowel rod''. Dowel rods are often cut into short lengths called ''dowel pins''. Dowels are commonly used as structural reinforcements in [[cabinet making]] and in numerous other applications, including:
* Furniture shelf supports
* Moveable game pieces (i.e. pegs)
* Hangers for items such as clothing, key rings, and tools
* Wheel [[axle]]s in toys
* [[Detent]]s in [[grip (gymnastics)|gymnastics grips]] 
* Supports for tiered [[wedding cakes]]

===Manufacturing process===

[[File:Dowel template.jpg|thumb|A dowel plate]]
The traditional tool for making dowels is a ''dowel plate'', an iron
(or better, hardened [[tool steel]]) plate with a hole having the size of the desired dowel.  To make a dowel, a piece of wood is split or whittled to a size slightly bigger than desired and then driven through the hole in the dowel plate.  The sharp edges of the hole shear off the excess wood.&lt;ref name="Sickels"&gt;Ivin Sickels, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zqoJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA104 Exercises in Wood-Working], American Book Company, 1889; see Exercise 18.— Uniting with Dowels, pages 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;Dowel Making and Doweling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Ik9AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA88 Scientific American], Vol. XLIX, No. 6 (Aug. 11, 1883); page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;H. H. Parker, Making Wood Dowels, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CNsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA957 Popular Mechanics], Vol. 41, No. 6 (June, 1924); page 957.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second approach to cutting dowels is to rotate a piece of oversized stock past a fixed knife, or alternatively, to rotate the knife around the stock.  Machines based on this principle emerged in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;William H. Whitlock, Improvement in Turning Tool, {{US patent|83573}}, granted Oct. 27, 1868. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanford A. Penny, Lathe, {{US patent|398077}}, granted Feb. 19, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequently, these are small bench-mounted tools.&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Cherry, Tool for Forming Round Dowels and Rods, {{US Patent|1367462}}, granted Feb. 1, 1921; this is the Stanley No. 77 Dowel and Rod Turner.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Aziz, Leonard G. Lee and Lloyd Sevack, Dowel Maker, {{US Patent|6263929}}, granted Aug. 26, 2001; this is the Lee Valley Veritas Dowel Maker.&lt;/ref&gt;

For modest [[manufacturing]] volumes, wood dowels are typically manufactured on industrial dowel [[machine]]s based on the same principles as the rotary cutters described above. Such machines may employ [[interchangeable parts|interchangeable]] cutting heads of varying [[diameter]]s, thus enabling the machines to be quickly changed to manufacture different dowel diameters.
Typically, the mechanism is open-ended, with material guides at the machine's entry and exit to enable fabrication of continuous dowel rod of unlimited length. Since the 19th century, some of these dowel machines have had power feed mechanisms to move the stock past the cutting mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar H. Ordway, Dowel Making Machine, {{US patent|603965}}, granted May 10, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George W. Davis, Dowel-Making Machine, {{US patent|1427073}}, granted Aug. 22, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

High-volume dowel manufacturing is done on a [[wood shaper]], which simultaneously forms multiple dowels from a single piece of rectangular stock (i.e., wood). These machines employ two wide, rotating cutting heads, one above the stock and one below it. The heads have nearly identical cutting [[profile (engineering)|profile]]s so that each will form an array of adjoined, side-by-side "half dowels". The heads are aligned to each other and one head is shaped to make deeper cuts along the dowel edges so as to part the stock into individual dowel rods, resulting in a group of dowel rods emerging in [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] at the machine's output.

===Application===

[[Image:Holzduebel-D10mm x L50mm.jpg|thumb|Fluted wood dowel pin]]
[[Image:Polaczenie kolkowe.svg|thumb|Cross-sectional view of a dowel joint]]
The wooden dowel rod used in [[woodworking]] applications is commonly cut into dowel pins, which are used to reinforce [[Woodworking joints|joints]] and support shelves and other components in [[cabinet making]]. Some woodworkers make their own dowel pins, while others purchase dowel pins precut to the required length and diameter.

When dowels are glued into [[blind hole]]s, a very common case in dowel-based [[Woodworking joints|joinery]], there must be a path for air and excess glue to escape when the dowel is pressed into place. If no provision is made to relieve the [[hydraulic pressure]] of air and glue, hammering the dowel home or clamping the joint can split the wood. An old solution to this problem is to plane a flat on the side of the dowel; some sources suggest planing the flat on the rough stock before the final shaping of the round dowel.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;  Some dowel plates solve the problem by cutting a groove in the side of the dowel as it is forced through; this is done by a ''groove screw'', a pointed screw intruding from the side into the dowel cutting opening.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Some dowel pins are [[wikt:en:fluted|Fluted]] with multiple parallel grooves along their length to serve the same purpose.

When two pieces of wood are to be joined by dowels embedded in blind holes, there are numerous methods for aligning the holes. For example, pieces of [[Shot (pellet)|shot]] may be placed between the wood pieces to produce indentations when the pieces are clamped together; after the clamp is released, the indentations indicate the center points for drilling.&lt;ref name="Sickels" /&gt; ''Dowel centers'' are simple and inexpensive tools for aligning opposing blind holes. Various commercial systems, such as [[Dowelmax]], have been devised to solve this problem.

Alternative joinery methods may be used in place of conventional dowel pins, such as Miller dowels, [[biscuit joiner]]s, [[spline joint]]s, and proprietary tools such as the [[Domino jointer]].

===History===
[[File:Hand cut house construction dowel c1840.jpg|thumb|right|Hand cut 8" dowel, c1840]]
The word ''dowel'' was used in [[Middle English]]; it appears in [[Wycliffe's Bible]] translation (circa 1382-1395) in a list of the parts of a wheel: "...and the spokis, and dowlis of tho wheelis..."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (Wycliffe)/3 Kings#Chapter 7|3 Kings 7:33]] in [[Wycliffe's Bible]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cognates with other [[Germanic languages]] suggest that the word is much older (''deuvel'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Dübel'' in [[German language|German]]).

Wooden dowels have been used in manufacturing and woodworking for many centuries. One of the earliest documented uses of wooden dowels was in Japanese shrines in AD 690,{{cn|date=April 2013}} which were constructed using only wood, wooden dowels and pegs, and interlocking joints. Around AD 1000, [[Leif Erikson]] sailed across the North Atlantic in a ship that was largely constructed of overlapping planks held together by wooden dowels{{cn|date=April 2013}} and iron nails. The wooden dowels did not rust and thus were more reliable than iron for long expeditions&lt;!-- why was iron used at all if it was unreliable? --&gt;.

==Metal dowel==

===In machinery===
[[File:Steel-Dowel-Pins.jpg|left|thumb|Steel dowel pins]]

'''Dowel pins''' are often used as precise locating devices in machinery. Steel dowel pins are [[Machining|machined]] to tight [[Engineering tolerance#Mechanical component tolerance|tolerances]], as are the corresponding holes, which are typically [[reamed]]. A dowel pin may have a smaller diameter than its hole so that it freely slips in, or a larger diameter so that it must be pressed into its hole (an [[interference fit]]).

When designing mechanical components, [[Manufacturing engineering|mechanical engineers]] typically use dowel holes as reference points to control positioning variations and attain repeatable assembly quality. If no dowels are used for alignment (e.g., components are mated by bolts only), there can be significant variation, or "play", in component alignment.

Typical drilling and milling operations, as well as manufacturing practices for bolt threads, introduce mechanical play proportional to the size of the fasteners. For example, bolts up to {{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} in diameter typically have play on the order of {{convert|0.2|mm|in|3|abbr=in}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} When dowels are used in addition to bolts, however, the tighter dimensional tolerances of dowels and their mating holes—typically {{convert|0.01|mm|in|4|abbr=in}}—result in significantly less play, on the order of {{convert|0.02|mm|in|4|abbr=in}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Manufacturing costs are inversely proportional to mechanical tolerances and, as a result, engineers must balance the need for mechanical precision against cost as well as other factors such as manufacturability and serviceability.

There are a variety of specifications, military, ISO, DIN, ASME that pins may be made to.  And size can even vary by dowel pin material. Metric dowel pins are often found in two size. In DIN 6325 standard the dowel pins are slightly larger than the [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] value.  For example a 3 mm dowel pin will range from 3.002 to 3.008.   In the ISO 2338 standard the dowel pins are slightly smaller - 3mm nominal range is 2.986 to 3.000. The terminology (e.g. "oversized", "standard") is not entirely consistent across suppliers. In [[United States customary units|inch]] pins "oversized" refers to pins that are more significantly oversized for worn out dowel pin holes. The most common inch sized pins are slightly oversized, and "undersized" versions are also available. 

In automobiles, dowels are used when precise mating alignment is required, such as in differential gear casings, engines, and transmissions.

[[Bolt (fastener)|Bolt]]s in a [[bolted joint]] often have an important function as a dowel, resisting [[shear force]]s. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded section to their shank. This gives a closer fit to the hole and also avoids some problems with [[fretting]] wear when a screw thread bears against an unthreaded component.

===In woodworking===
{{see also|Barrel nut}}
[[File:Cross dowel.png|thumb|right|150px|Cross dowel. Note that the slot is usually parallel to the axis of the bolt hole, contrary to this drawing.]]
[[File:Cross dowel cutaway.png|thumb|right|200px|A cutaway view of a cross dowel in use. For illustrative purposes the dowel's slot is shown perpendicular to the bolt, but in practice the slot is usually parallel to the bolt's axis.]]
A '''cross dowel''' is a cylindrically shaped metal nut (i.e., a metal dowel) that is used to join two pieces of wood. Like other metal nuts, it has an inside threaded hole, although the hole is unusual in that it passes through the sides of the dowel. One or both ends of the dowel are slotted, with the slots oriented parallel to the threaded hole through which the bolt will pass.

In a cross dowel application, the two pieces of wood are aligned and a bolt hole is drilled through one piece of wood and into the other. A dowel hole is drilled laterally across the bolt hole and the cross dowel is inserted into it. A screwdriver is inserted into the slot at the end of the cross dowel and the dowel is rotated so that its threaded hole aligns with the bolt hole. The bolt is then inserted into the bolt hole and screwed into the cross dowel until the wood pieces are held tightly together.

'''Dynamic voltage restoration''' ('''DVR''') is a method of overcoming [[voltage sag]]s that occur in [[electrical power distribution]].&lt;ref name="Li Liasi 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Li | first=Peng | last2=Liasi | first2=Sahand Ghaseminejad | title=A New Voltage Compensation Philosophy for Dynamic Voltage Restorer to Mitigate Voltage Sags Using Three-Phase Voltage Ellipse Parameters (A review presentation) (PDF Download Available) | website=ResearchGate | date=2017-12-15 | doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.16427.13606 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321875950_A_New_Voltage_Compensation_Philosophy_for_Dynamic_Voltage_Restorer_to_Mitigate_Voltage_Sags_Using_Three-Phase_Voltage_Ellipse_Parameters_A_review_presentation | access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="choi2000"/&gt;  These are a problem because spikes consume power and sags reduce efficiency of some devices.  DVR saves energy through voltage injections that can affect the [[phase (waves)|phase]] and wave-shape of the power being supplied.&lt;ref name="choi2000"&gt;{{cite journal| last       = Choi| first      = SS| last2      = Li| first2     = HH| last3      = Vilathgamuwa| first3     = DM| date       = 2000| title      = Dynamic voltage restoration with minimum energy injection| journal    = IEEE Transactions on Power Systems| volume     = 15| issue      = 1| pages      = 51–57| name-list-format = vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devices used for DVR include [[Static VAR compensator|static var devices]], which are series compensation devices that use voltage source converters (VSC).  The first such system in North America was installed in 1996 - a 12.47 kV system located in [[Anderson, South Carolina]].

==Operation==

The basic principle of dynamic voltage restoration is to inject a [[voltage]] of the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[frequency]] necessary to restore the load side voltage to the desired [[amplitude]] and waveform, even when the source voltage is unbalanced or distorted. Generally, devices for dynamic voltage restoration employ [[Gate turn-off thyristor|gate turn off thyristor]]s, (GTO) [[Solid-state relay|solid state power]] electronic switches in a [[Pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] (PWM) inverter structure. The DVR can generate or absorb independently controllable real and reactive power at the load side. In other words, the DVR is a solid state [[Direct current|DC]] to [[Alternating current|AC]] switching power converter that injects a set of three phase AC output voltages in series and synchronicity with the distribution and [[transmission line]] voltages.

The source of the injected voltage is the commutation process for reactive power demand and an energy source for the real [[power demand]]. The energy source may vary according to the design and manufacturer of the DVR, but DC [[capacitors]] and [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] drawn from the line through a [[rectifier]] are frequently used. The energy source is typically connected to the DVR through its DC input terminal.

The amplitude and [[phase angle]] of the injected voltages are variable, thereby allowing control of the real and reactive power exchange between the dynamic voltage restorer and the distribution system. As mentioned, the [[reactive power]] exchange between the DVR and the distribution system is internally generated by the DVR without AC passive reactive components.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, A. &amp; Ledwich, G. (2002). Power quality enhancement using custom power devices (1st ed., pp. 7-8). Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar devices==
DVRs use a technically similar approach as [[Low voltage ride through|low voltage ride-through]] (LVRT) capability systems in wind turbine generators use. The dynamic response characteristics, particularly for line supplied DVRs, are similar to those in LVRT-mitigated turbines. Conduction losses in both kinds of devices are often minimized by using [[integrated gate-commutated thyristor]] (IGCT) technology in the inverters.&lt;ref name="Jowder 2009 pp. 1–6"&gt;{{cite web | last=Jowder | first=F.A.L. | title=Modeling and simulation of different system topologies for dynamic voltage restorer using Simulink | website=ResearchGate | volume=1-6 | date=2009-12-12 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224116144_Modeling_and_simulation_of_different_system_topologies_for_dynamic_voltage_restorer_using_Simulink | access-date=2017-12-15 | pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE Conference Publication 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Control strategies and comparison of the Dynamic Voltage Restorer | website=IEEE Conference Publication | date=2017-11-07 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4653741/ | access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Practically, DVR systems can to inject up to 50% of [[nominal voltage]], but only for a short time (up to 0.1 seconds). However, most [[voltage sags]] are much less than 50 percent, so this is not typically an issue.

DVRs can also mitigate the damaging effects of voltage swells, [[voltage unbalance]] and other waveform distortions.&lt;ref name="IEEE Conference Publication2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Compensation of voltage sags and swells by using Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) | website=IEEE Conference Publication | date=2017-11-07 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7754936/ | access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
DVRs may provide good solutions for end-users subject to unwanted [[power quality]] disturbances. However, they are generally not used in systems that are subject to prolonged reactive power deficiencies (resulting in low voltage conditions) and in systems that are vulnerable to [[voltage collapse]]. Because DVRs will maintain appropriate supply voltage, in such systems where incipient voltage conditions are present they actually make collapses more difficult to prevent and can even lead to cascading interruptions.

Therefore, when applying DVRs, it is vital to consider the nature of the load whose voltage supply is being secured, as well as the transmission system which must tolerate the change in voltage-response of the load. It may be necessary to provide local fast reactive supply sources in order to protect the system, including the DVR, from voltage collapse and cascading interruptions.

==SSSC and DVR==
The [[Static synchronous series compensator|SSSC]]’s counterpart is the Dynamic Voltage Regulator (DVR). Although both are utilized for series [[voltage sag]] compensation, their operating principles differ from each other.&lt;ref name="IEEE Conference Publication"&gt;{{cite web | title=Comparison of dynamic voltage restorer and static synchronous series compensator for a wind turbine fed FSIG under asymmetric faults | website=IEEE Conference Publication | date=2017-11-07 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6966268/ | access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The static synchronous [[series compensator]] injects a balance voltage in series with the transmission line. On the other hand, the DVR compensates the unbalance in supply voltage of different phases. Also, DVRs are usually installed on a critical feeder supplying the active power through DC energy storage and the required reactive power is generated internally without any means of DC storage.

'''Elaidic acid''' is the [[organic compound]] with the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H.   Classified as an [[Saturated fat|unsaturated]] [[trans fat|trans fatty acid]], it is a colorless oily solid. This compound has attracted attention because it is a major trans fat found in [[Hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] vegetable oils, and trans fats are implicated in heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954422411000011| pmid = 21320382| title = Ruminant and industrial sources of trans-fat and cardiovascular and diabetic diseases| journal = Nutrition Research Reviews| volume = 24| issue = 1| pages = 111–7| year = 2011| last1 = Tardy| first1 = Anne-Laure| last2 = Morio| first2 = Béatrice| last3 = Chardigny| first3 = Jean-Michel| last4 = Malpuech-Brugère| first4 = Corinne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the [[Cis–trans isomerism|trans isomer]] of [[oleic acid]].  The name of the [[elaidinization]] reaction comes from elaidic acid.

'''Ethenone''' is the formal name for '''ketene''', an [[organic compound]] with formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=C=O.  It is the simplest member of the [[ketene]] class. It is a [[tautomer]] of [[ethynol]].

== Properties ==
Ethenone is a highly reactive gas (at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]) and has a sharp irritating odour. It is only reasonably stable at low temperatures (-80 °C). It must therefore always be prepared for each use and processed immediately, otherwise a dimerization to diketene occurs or it reacts to polymers that are difficult to handle. The polymer content formed during the preparation is reduced, for example, by adding sulfur dioxide to the ketene gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = EP | number =0377438 | title = | gdate = 1990-06-11 | invent1 = R. Bergamin et al. | assign1 = Lonza AG }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its cumulative double bonds, ethenone is highly reactive and reacts in an addition reaction H-acidic compounds to the corresponding acetic acid derivatives. It does for example react with water to acetic acid or with [[Primary amine|primary]] or [[secondary amines]] to the corresponding [[Acetamide|acetamides]].

Ethenone is highly poisonous; its toxicity is about eight times that of [[phosgene]].&lt;ref name="Römpp"&gt;{{RömppOnline|Name=Diketen |Datum=16. Juni 2014 |ID=RD-04-01613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethenone tends to spontaneously [[Polymerization|polymerize]]. Contact with hydrogen peroxide leads to an explosive reaction. It can form an explosive mixture with air.

It is soluble in [[acetone]], [[ethanol]], [[ethyl ether]], [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic]] solvents and [[halocarbon]]s.

== Preparation ==
Ethenone can be prepared by dehydration of [[acetic acid]] or by the [[pyrolysis]] of [[acetone]]. For example, when passing acetone vapors through heated pipes or electrically heated metal (like [[copper]]) wires at 500-600 °C in the presence of little [[carbon disulfide]] (CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), ethenone is formed in 95% yield in addition to some methane.&lt;ref&gt;K.-H. Lautenschläger, W. Schröter, A. Wanninger, "Taschenbuch der Chemie", 20. Aufl. 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-8171-1761-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|Kurzcode=cv1p0330 |Autor=C.D. Hurd |title=Ketene |Jahrgang=1925 |Volume=4 |Seiten=39 |ColVol=1 |ColVolSeiten=330 |doi=10.15227/orgsyn.004.0039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrial chemistry, ketone pyrolysis has largely been replaced by the dehydration of acetic acid (Schmidlin-Bergman-Wilsmore reaction&lt;ref&gt;J. Schmidlin, M. Bergman, [[Chemische Berichte|Ber. dtsch. Chem. Ges.]], '''43''', 2821 (1910), [[DOI:10.1002/cber.19100430340]].&lt;/ref&gt;).

&lt;!-- :&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CH_3-COOH \rightarrow CH_2=C=O + H_2O}&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:left;"&gt;
Ethenon was found around the same time by [[Hermann Staudinger]] (by reaction of bromoacetyl bromide with metallic [[zinc]]&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, T. T. (2005), Ein Jahrhundert Ketene (1905–2005): die Entdeckung einer vielseitigen Klasse reaktiver Intermediate. Angewandte Chemie, 117: 5926–5933. [[doi:10.1002/ange.200500098]] und H. Staudinger, H.W. Klever, Ber. dtsch. Chem. Ges., '''41''', 5943 (1908).&lt;/ref&gt;) and N.T.M. Wilsmore (by thermal decomposition of acetic anhydride&lt;ref&gt;N.T.M. Wilsmore, [[J. Chem. Soc.]], '''91''', 1938 (1907), [[DOI:10.1039/ct9079101938]].&lt;/ref&gt;).
&lt;/div&gt;

===  Occurrence ===
Ethenone has been observed to occur in space, in comets or in gas as part of the interstellar medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Reggie L.|last2=Loeffler|first2=Mark J.|date=2013|title=Ketene Formation in Interstellar Ices: A Laboratory Study|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/773/i=2/a=109|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=773|issue=2|pages=109|doi=10.1088/0004-637x/773/2/109|issn=0004-637X|hdl=2060/20140010162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
Ethenone is used to make [[acetic anhydride]] from [[acetic acid]]. Generally it is used for the [[acetylation]] of chemical compounds.&lt;ref name="Römpp" /&gt;

:[[File:Ketene reactions.png|mini|center|400px|Darstellung von [[Acetamid]], [[Ethylacetat]], Essigsäure und Essigsäureanhydrid]]
&lt;div style="clear:left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

:[[File:Mechanism-Ketene_Reactions_V1.svg|center|400x400px]]
&lt;div style="clear:left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Ethenone reacts with [[methanal]] in the presence of catalysts such as Lewis acids (AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oder BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to give [[Beta-Propiolactone|β-propiolactone]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Arpe, "Industrielle Organische Chemie", 6. Aufl., 2007, WILEY-VCH Verlag, Weinheim, {{ISBN|978-3-527-31540-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The technically most significant use of ethenone is the synthesis of [[sorbic acid]] by reaction with [[2-butenal]] (crotonaldehyde) in [[toluene]] at about 50 °C in the presence of zinc salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. This produces a [[polyester]] of 3-hydroxy-4-hexenoic acid, which is thermally&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent | country = EP | number =1295860 | title = | gdate = 26. März 2003-03-26 | invent1 = D. Decker et al.| assign1 = Nutrinova GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydrolytically depolymerized to sorbic acid.

Ethenone is very reactive, tending to react with [[nucleophiles]] to form an [[acetyl group]]. For example, it reacts with water to form [[acetic acid]];&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdczJj26oG8C&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt; with acetic acid to form [[acetic anhydride]]; with ammonia and amines to form ethanamides;&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; and with dry [[hydrogen halides]] to form acetyl halides.&lt;ref&gt;ChemSpider http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.9643.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of acetic acid likely occurs by an initial formation of [[1,1-dihydroxyethene]], which then [[tautomerism|tautomerizes]] to give the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Can. J. Chem. |volume= 77 |pages= 817–829 |year= 1999 |title= The hydration mechanism of ketene: 15 years later |first1= Minh Tho |last1= Nguyen |first2= Greet |last2= Raspoet |doi= 10.1139/v99-090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethenone will also react with itself via [[Woodward-Hoffmann rules|[2 + 2] photocycloadditions]] to form cyclic [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s known as [[diketene]]s.  For this reason, it should not be stored for long periods.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Taeschler :''Ketenes, Ketene Dimers, and Related Substances, Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hazards ==
Exposure to concentrated levels causes humans to experience irritation of body parts such as the [[human eye|eye]], [[human nose|nose]], [[throat]] and [[human lung|lung]]s. Extended toxicity testing on mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits showed that ten-minute exposures to concentrations of freshly generated ethenone as low as 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/liter (116 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]]) may produce a high percentage of deaths in small animals. These findings put ethenone in the same order of toxicity as [[phosgene]] (0.2–20&amp;nbsp;mg/liter) and [[hydrogen cyanide]] (0.2-0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/liter). Death is from [[pulmonary edema]] and is entirely similar to, but much more rapid than is the case with phosgene poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Inhalation Toxicity of Ketene and of Ketene Dimer |author1=H.

Occupational exposure limits are set at 0.5 ppm (0.9&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an eight-hour time-weighted average.&lt;ref name=pocket&gt;{{cite web

In [[environmental engineering]], the '''flood mitigation''' involves the management and control of flood water movement, such as redirecting flood run-off through the use of [[floodwall]]s and [[flood gate]]s, rather than trying to prevent floods altogether. It also involves the management of people, through measures such as evacuation and dry/wet proofing properties. The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities. The costs of protection rise as more people and property are protected. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]], for example, estimates that for every $1.00 spent on mitigation, $4.00 is saved.&lt;ref name="What is Hazard Mitigation?"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=4547&amp;&amp;PageID=457689&amp;mode=2|title= What is Hazard Mitigation? |accessdate= 2014-04-07 |publisher= Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection of individual properties==
[[Image:communit1.jpg|thumb|right]]
Property owners may fit their home to stop water entering by blocking doors and air vents, [[waterproofing]] important areas and [[sandbag]]ging the edges of the building.

==Protection of communities==
When more homes, shops and infrastructure are threatened by the effects of flooding, then the benefits of greater protection are worth the additional cost. Temporary flood defenses can be constructed relatively quickly in certain locations and provide protection from rising flood waters. Rivers running through large urban developments are often controlled and channeled. Water rising above a [[canals|canal's]] full capacity may cause flooding to spread to other [[waterway]]s and areas of the community, which causes damage. Defenses (both long-term and short-term) can be constructed to minimize damage, which involves raising the edge of the water with [[levees]], embankments or walls. The high population and value of infrastructure at risk often justifies the high cost of mitigation in larger urban areas.

==Flood risk management==
[[Image:maprawcliffe.jpg|right|thumb]]
The most effective way of reducing the risk to people and property is through the production of flood risk maps. Most countries have produced maps which show areas prone to flooding based on flood data. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Environment Agency]] has produced maps which show areas at risk. The map to the right shows a flood map for the [[York|City of York]], including the floodplain for a 1 in [[100 year flood]] (dark blue), the predicted floodplain for a 1 in 1000 year flood (light blue) and low-lying areas in need of flood defence (purple).
The most sustainable way of reducing risk is to prevent further development in flood-prone areas and old waterways. It is important for at-risk communities to develop a comprehensive Floodplain Management plan.&lt;ref name="Disaster Recovery Today"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adjustersinternational.com/publications/disaster-recovery-today/floodplain-management-sound-techniques-to-improve-your-recovery/2/|title=Floodplain Management: Sound Techniques to Improve Your Recovery
|accessdate= 2009-12-11|publisher=Disaster Recovery Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities that participate in the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] must agree to regulate development in flood-prone areas.

The '''Great Appalachian Storm of November 1950''' was a large [[extratropical cyclone]] which moved through the [[Eastern United States]], causing significant winds, heavy rains east of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], and [[blizzard]] conditions along the western slopes of the mountain chain. Hurricane-force winds, peaking at {{convert|110|mph|kph}} in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] and {{convert|160|mph|kph}} in the New England highlands, disrupted power to 1,000,000 customers during the event. In all, the storm impacted 22 states, killing 353, injuring over 160, and creating US$66.7 million in damage (1950&amp;nbsp;dollars).&lt;ref&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The cyclone is also one of [[List of Regional Snowfall Index Category 5 winter storms|only twenty-six storms]] to rank as a Category 5 on the [[Regional Snowfall Index]].&lt;ref&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

==Synoptic history==

The preceding atmospheric state was one of [[La Niña]] conditions, the cold phase of [[ENSO]], which favors a storm track from the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Tennessee Valley]]s into the Appalachians.&lt;ref&gt;Joe D'Aleo. [http://www.intellicast.com/DrDewpoint/Library/1101/ SOME MEMORABLE LA NINA NOVEMBER STORMS.] Retrieved on 2006-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cyclone]] initially formed in southeast [[North Carolina]] near a cold front on the morning of November 24 as the main cyclone over the [[Great Lakes]] weakened. Rapid development ensued as the surface center began to migrate back into a closed 500&amp;nbsp;hPa (14.75&amp;nbsp;inHg)-level (around 6,000&amp;nbsp;m/20,000&amp;nbsp;ft above sea level) cyclone, and the cyclone [[Bomb (meteorology)|bomb]]ed while moving north through Washington D.C. the next morning. The former occluded front to its northwest became a warm front which moved back to the west around the strengthening, and now dominant, southern low pressure center. By the evening of November 25, the cyclone retrograded, or moved northwestward, into [[Ohio]] due to a blocking ridge up across eastern Canada. It was at this time that the pressure gradient was its most intense across southern [[New England]] and eastern New York.  A wide area of +4 standard deviation 850mb winds occurred.&lt;ref name=Hanrahan/&gt; The cyclone moved west over [[Lake Erie]] to the north of the upper cyclone before looping over Ohio as the low-level and mid-level cyclone centers coupled. Significant convection within its comma head led to the development of a warm seclusion, or a pocket of low level warm air, near its center which aided in further development due to the increased [[lapse rate]]s a warmer low level environment affords under a cold low. After the system became stacked with height, the storm slowly spun down as it drifted north and northeast into eastern Canada over the succeeding few days.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence D. Smith, Jr. [http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/078/mwr-078-11-0204.pdf The Destructive Storm of November 25-27, 1950.] Retrieved on 2006-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kulluk''''' was an ice-strengthened [[Drillship|drill barge]] that was used for oil exploration in the Arctic waters. She was constructed by [[Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding]] in [[Japan]] in 1983 and operated in the Canadian Arctic until 1993 when she was mothballed for over a decade. In 2005, she was purchased and extensively refurbished by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] for the drilling operations off the northern coast of Alaska.

On 31 December 2012, ''Kulluk'' drifted aground after the towing line to the icebreaking anchor-handling tug ''[[Aiviq]]'' parted in heavy weather. While the rig was recovered, the repairs were not deemed feasible and Shell decided to scrap the unit in 2014.

== Career ==
From 1983 to 1993, the rig was operated by [[Gulf Oil|Gulf Canada Resources]] in the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]].&lt;ref name="Mxak"/&gt;
She was mothballed in 1993, and in 2005 she was acquired by Royal Dutch Shell and underwent  intensive refurbishment.&lt;ref name=adn040306&gt;{{cite news | work=The Anchorage Daily News | title=Shell plans Beaufort Sea drilling | url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AS&amp;p_theme=as&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=110339544BDEE508&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | first = Wesley | last = Loy | date= 2006-03-04 | accessdate=2013-01-02}}

=== 2012 grounding ===
[[File:KullukAground 1jan2013.JPG|thumb|left|''Kulluk'' aground on the southeast side of Sitkalidak Island on 1 January 2013]]

On 31 December 2012, ''Kulluk'' drifted aground off [[Sitkalidak Island]] in the [[Gulf of Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/kulluk-drilling-unit-runs-aground-in-alaska/|title=Kulluk Drilling Unit Runs Aground in Alaska|work=Offshore Energy Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until October the rig had been working in the [[Beaufort Sea]], off the [[Alaska North Slope]]. She was being towed to her winter home in [[Seattle]] when she encountered a storm, and the incident occurred. The [[US Coast Guard]] evacuated her 18-man crew on 29 December. On [[New Year's Eve]], tug crews were ordered by the [[US Coast Guard]] to cut the rig loose, leading to her grounding.&lt;ref name=FuelFix&gt;{{cite news|first = Jennifer | last = Diouhy| title = Shell’s Kulluk drilling rig runs aground near Alaskan island| url = http://fuelfix.com/blog/2013/01/01/shells-kulluk-drilling-rig-runs-aground-near-alaskan-island/| work = FuelFix.com| date = 2013-01-01| accessdate = 2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | first = Matt | last = Smith | title = No leaks from grounded drill rig off Alaska, Coast Guard says | work = CNN | url= http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/01/us/alaska-drilling-rig/index.html | date= 2013-01-02 | accessdate=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kulluk'''s movement south for the winter was at least in part motivated by an effort to avoid State of Alaska property taxes on oil and gas extraction equipment.&lt;ref name="dispatch-ben"&gt;{{Cite news | work = [[Alaska Dispatch]] | title = Did Alaska tax liability influence Shell Oil's latest Arctic fiasco? | url = http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/did-alaska-tax-liability-influence-shell-oils-latest-arctic-fiasco | first = Ben | last = Anderson | date = {{date|2013-01-03|mdy}} | accessdate = {{date|2013-01-04|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax in question is a state property tax of 20 [[Property tax|mills]] (or 2 percent) "on property used or committed by contract or other agreement for use for the pipeline transportation of gas or unrefined oil or for the production of gas or unrefined oil at its full and true value as of January 1 of the assessment year."&lt;ref name="alaska-tax"&gt;{{cite web | title = Oil and Gas Exploration, Production and Pipeline Transportation Property Taxes | url = http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?27s | accessdate = {{date|2013-01-04|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tax liability for the rig is estimated at between 6 and 7 million dollars, based on the value of the rig;&lt;ref name="dispatch-jim"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Shell hoped to save millions in taxes by moving now-grounded drill rig out of Alaska | author = Paulin, Jim | author2 = Restino, Carey | work = [[Alaska Dispatch]] | url = http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/shell-hoped-save-millions-taxes-moving-now-grounded-drill-rig-out-alaska | date = {{date|2012-01-03|mdy}} | accessdate = {{date|2012-01-04|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Shell may seek a filing extension to try to pay a lower tax rate given that the rig was grounded, potentially reducing her value, as of January 1.&lt;ref name="dispatch-ben"/&gt;

''Kulluk'' was carrying {{convert|138000|USgal}} of [[ultra-low-sulfur diesel]] fuel, {{convert|1000|USgal}} of [[aviation fuel]] and {{convert|12000|USgal}} of lubricants. So far the Coast Guard has reported no sign of a hull breach or fuel spill.&lt;ref name=ADN&gt;

On January 6, 2013, ''Kulluk'' was floated from the rocks.

On 31 October 2013, a Shell representative hinted that ''Kulluk'' may not be brought back into operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/2013/10/31/3151333/shell-prepares-arctic-offshore.html Shell prepares Arctic drilling plan but is uncertain about 2014].

''Kulluk'' was ice-reinforced with {{convert|3|in|abbr=on}} thick, reinforced steel, and a double-sided funnel-shape hull with flared sides enabling her to operate in Arctic waters as moving ice was deflected downwards and was broken into pieces.&lt;ref name=ap010113&gt;

''Kulluk'' originally had no propulsion and had to be towed to location. In 2006, Shell contracted [[Aker Arctic]] to evaluate the feasibility of adding a thruster-aided propulsion to the drilling barge. In 2007, ''Kulluk'' was fitted with two 62-tonne, {{convert|2000|shp|kW}} ThrustMaster hydraulic overboard [[azimuth thrusters]], the largest ever supplied by the company, to provide the platform an ability to move between drill sites and improve her operability in ice.&lt;ref name=ogj100107 /&gt; However, before the system had been installed completely, the project was already delayed and subsequently halted due to regulatory and operational changes. In 2011, it was decided to remove the thrusters while ''Kulluk'' was on the shipyard and sell them, turning ''Kulluk'' into an unpropelled drilling barge again.&lt;ref name="thruster_auction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkintl.com/contents/auction/QFPIRA000HBW/QFPIRA01B3DZ/!QFPIRA01B3FCLOT%20DETAILS%20for%2013838.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kulluk Equipment Disposition |accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lalamilo Wells''' is a wind farm on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]]. It is located within the ''[[ahupuaa|ahupua{{okina}}a]]'' (ancient land division) called Lalamilo,&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|361706|Lalamilo}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the coastal area known as [[Puako, Hawaii]], and the inland towns of [[Waimea, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Waimea]] and [[Waikoloa Village, Hawaii]]. It was commissioned in 1985 with 39 17.5&amp;nbsp;kW [[Jacobs Wind|Jacobs]] wind turbines and 81 20&amp;nbsp;kW Jacobs wind turbines, yielding a total capacity of 2.3 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/ert/wwg/history.html |title=History of Wind Energy Projects in Hawaii |website=State of Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615104456/http://hawaii.gov/dbedt/ert/wwg/history.html |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2009 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in January 2006, the electric utility operating the wind farm, [[Hawaiian Electric Company]]  (HELCO), operated a demonstration model of a grid-stabilizing unit, known as an Electronic Shock Absorber (ESA). This unit was designed to increase the stability of the island's grid, which has a relatively high penetration of wind energy, which is subject to rapid fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jun06/3544 IEEE Spectrum: Taking Wind Mainstream]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the unit was damaged in an [[2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake|earthquake in October 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heco.com/portal/site/heco/menuitem.508576f78baa14340b4c0610c510b1ca/?vgnextoid=94600420af0db110VgnVCM1000005c011bacRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ab020420af0db110VgnVCM1000005c011bacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=defau&amp;vgnextrefresh=1&amp;level=0&amp;ct=article HECO &gt; Energy Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711161653/http://www.heco.com/portal/site/heco/menuitem.508576f78baa14340b4c0610c510b1ca/?vgnextoid=94600420af0db110VgnVCM1000005c011bacRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ab020420af0db110VgnVCM1000005c011bacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=defau&amp;vgnextrefresh=1&amp;level=0&amp;ct=article |date=2011-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repowering==
By 2010 the turbines were antiquated; only two-thirds were still in operation. The farm was decommissioned that year in anticipation of replacing the turbines with more efficient modern models.

Lalamilo Wind Company was awarded the contract to repower and operate the wind farm. They plan to install five Vestas V47/660&amp;nbsp;kW turbines that together would have a generating capacity of 3.3 MW. Commercial operation is intended to begin in late 2015 or early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Windmills We Have Known and Loved |url=http://www.hawaiianelectric.com/vcmcontent/EnergyServices/Powerlines/Fall_Winter2010%5b1%5d.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Powerlines |publisher=Hawaiian Electric Company |date=2010 |issue=3 |page=9 |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yager |first1=Bret |date=26 June 2014 |title=County Plans Wind Farm to Power Water Wells |url=http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/local-news/county-plans-wind-farm-power-water-wells |newspaper=West Hawaii Today |location=Kailua-Kona, Hawaii |publisher=Oahu Publications |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Colin |date=11 July 2014 |title=South Kohala Wind Farm Could Restart |url=http://hawaiitribune-herald.com/news/local-news/south-kohala-wind-farm-could-restart |newspaper=Tribune-Herald |location=Hilo, Hawaii |publisher=Oahu Publications |accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Libby, Montana''''' is a 2004 [[documentary film]] about the biggest case of community-wide exposure to a toxic substance in U.S. history. The film details the story of the iconic, mountainside town of [[Libby, Montana]] and the hundreds of residents who have been exposed to asbestos, raising questions of the role of corporate power in American politics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2007/libbymontana/about.html PBS Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Libby, Montana'' was directed, produced, and edited by [[Drury Gunn Carr]] and [[Doug Hawes-Davis]] and was aired as part of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s [[P.O.V.|Point of View]] series in 2007.

'''Long-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic''' ('''LFRTs''') is a type of easily mouldable thermoplastic used to create a variety of components used primarily in the automotive industry. LFRTs are one of the fastest growing categories in thermoplastic technologies. Leading this expansion is one of the oldest forms, glass mat thermoplastic (GMT) and two of the segment’s newest: precompounded (pelletized) LFRTs (long-fiber-reinforced thermoplastics), also known as LFTs, and inline compounded (ILC) or direct LFTs (D-LFTs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/reinforced-thermoplastics-lfrtgmt-roundup Compositesworld.com: Reinforced Thermoplastics: LFRT/GMT Roundup]&lt;/ref&gt;

LFRTs differ from the composite structures used in the aerospace industry for components such as aircraft parts. The fibers in LFRTs are relatively short (6.35 mm/0.25 in. or greater) compared to the fibres contained in composite aircraft components. High performance composites usually contain fibers as long as the component  itself (6 metres or longer).{{fact|date=August 2013}}

Their structural properties and low cost per part have enabled LFRTs to replace metal parts in the automotive industry. In addition, some new organic fibers can even be recyclable. With the independence of choosing the reinforcement from a wide range of fibers and the matrix from a wide range of thermoplastics polymer in the LFRTs, its property can be changed according to customer needs. LFRTs have become an increasingly valuable and popular part of building envelope components such as windows and doors.{{fact|date=August 2013}}

==Manufacture==
LFRT components or semi-finished products are made by compression or injection molding. Fibers are contained in the polymer matrix, often in the form of a granulate raw material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/reinforced-thermoplastics-lfrtgmt-roundup Compositesworld.com: Reinforced Thermoplastics: LFRT/GMT Roundup]&lt;/ref&gt;
Long Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic Compounds are typically 10-12 mm in length.  Fiber is unidirectional along the length of the 12 mm pellet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">In May 1959, the [[Loudoun County Board of Supervisors]] created '''Loudoun County Sanitation Authority''' (LCSA) by a resolution, through the Water and Waste Authorities Act, for the sole purpose of providing [[water supply|water]] and [[Sewage treatment|wastewater]] service to residents of the unincorporated areas of the county.  rebranded and moved from [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]] to [[Ashburn, Virginia|Ashburn]] in April 2008. It now does business as '''Loudoun Water'''.

Loudoun Water is a political subdivision of the state, similar to a town or a county government. All income is received either as user fees from customers or availability fees from developers. User fees pay for operating expenses. Availability fees pay for capital improvements. Loudoun Water receives no tax revenues.

==Board of directors==
Loudoun Water's nine-member Board governs how it operates and generally meets every second Thursday of the month. These meetings are open to the public. Each member of the Board is appointed at-large by the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors and serves a four-year term. These terms are staggered, so that every year, two members are re-appointed and every fourth year, three members are re-appointed. The Authority's Board appoints a General Manager who is responsible for the daily management of Loudoun Water.

==Water and Wastewater Operations==
Loudoun Water purchases its water from Fairfax Water ([[Fairfax County Water Authority]]) and Loudoun Water's Goose Creek Water Treatment Facility. A small percentage of Loudoun Water's customers are part of Community Systems. Customers within these systems have community wells and / or small communal wastewater systems. Wastewater in the Central Service Area is sent to the Broad Run Water Reclamation Facility, owned and operated by Loudoun Water, or conveyed to the  [[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant]] operated by the [[District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority]].

==Aquiary==
Loudoun Water created an indoor education center and outdoor interpretive area called The Aquiary (ā•kwee•air•ee). The Aquiary is like a water museum, full of interactive exhibits and interpretive trails that tell the story of drinking water treatment and delivery; source water protection; water conservation and water reclamation. The Aquiary was named by one of the citizen members of the advisory group that advised Loudoun Water on the content and appearance of the space. It is a made-up word that rhymes with aviary, and means “a place for Loudoun water learning and appreciation.” Brainstorming for the space and the trail system began in 2003 when Loudoun Water first decided to build a campus in Ashburn, next to its Operations and Maintenance facility. Loudoun Water worked with consultants and a citizen advisory group, comprising a diverse array of Loudoun Water customer volunteers, to develop the exhibits and the space.

Loudoun Water has intended the Aquiary to serve as a learning and teaching tool for Loudoun County Public Schools, and consulted with teachers and the school administration to ensure its effectiveness as a field trip destination. 

The Aquiary is a National Wildlife Federation certified national wildlife habitat.

'''Maren''' is a marine [[energy management system]] used to minimize fuel usage, thereby reducing vessel operator's fuel cost and the harmful emissions.  Maren is developed by [[Marorka]] in Iceland.  Maren 2 was released in Q3 in 2005 and launched at the Icelandic Fisheries Exhibition that year.  Maren 2 was awarded the best new product at the exhibition.

Maren monitors the various energy systems onboard different types of vessels.  It puts operating en environmental parameters in an energy management context.  Maren uses [[simulation]] and [[Process optimization|optimization]] to deliver suggestions on how to improve the operation of the vessel to minimize fuel usage.

The '''Ministry of Energy of Georgia''' ({{lang-ka|საქართველოს ენერგეტიკის სამინისტრო}}, ''sakartvelos energetikis saministro'') was a [[governmental agency]] within the [[Cabinet of Georgia]] in charge of regulating the activities in the energy sector of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] from 1991 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Government Wins Confidence Vote|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=30753|accessdate=23 December 2017|work=Civil Georgia|date=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The ministry is headed by minister appointed by the [[President of Georgia]]. Five deputy ministers report directly to the minister. Main functions of the ministry are increasing capabilities for maximum exploitation of the available energy resources in the country and diversification of energy supply imported from other countries; improving and modernizing electricity supply by enhancing the hydropower capacity of Georgia; renovation of existing and construction of new power stations and natural gas transportation infrastructure; development of alternative energy sources; improvements of infrastructure for making the country a reliable transit point for regional energy projects, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minenergy.gov.ge/index.php?m=284 |title=Ministry of Energy.

Due to improvements in recent years, Georgia has become a major exporter of electricity in the region, exporting 1.3 billion [[KWh]] in 2010. [[Hydropower plant|Hydropower stations]] of Georgia produce 80-85% of the electricity utilized within the country, the remaining 15-20% is produced by [[thermal power station]]s. According to the authorities, so far Georgia has been exploiting only 18% of its hydro resource potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://world.eizvestia.com/full/turciya-i-gruziya-pokroyutsya-dambami-i-ges |title=Турция и Грузия покроются дамбами и ГЭС |trans-title=Turkey and Georgia will be covered with dams and hydroelectric plants |publisher=Economicheskiye Izvestiya |author=Dmitry Bondarenko |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Natural uranium (NU, U&lt;sub&gt;nat&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldNuclear"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Introduction/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle-Overview/ |title=Nuclear Fuel Cycle Overview |date=October 2014 |publisher=World Nuclear Association |accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;)''' refers to [[uranium]] with the same [[isotopic ratio]] as found in nature. It contains 0.711% [[uranium-235]], 99.284% [[uranium-238]], and a trace of [[uranium-234]] by weight (0.0055%). Approximately 2.2% of its [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]]  comes from uranium-235, 48.6% from uranium-238, and 49.2% from uranium-234.

Natural uranium can be used to fuel both low- and high-power [[nuclear reactor]]s. Historically, [[graphite-moderated reactor]]s and  [[heavy water]]-moderated reactors have been fueled with natural uranium in the pure metal (U) or [[uranium dioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [[ceramic]] forms. However, experimental fuelings with  [[uranium trioxide]] (UO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[triuranium octaoxide]], (U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) have shown promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/rpt/115351.pdf |title=Design Parameters for a Natural Uranium UO3- or U3O8-Fueled Nuclear Reactor |editor=Oak Ridge National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 0.72% uranium-235 is not sufficient to produce a self-sustaining critical [[chain reaction]] in [[light water reactor]]s or [[nuclear weapon]]s; these applications must use [[enriched uranium]]. Nuclear weapons take a concentration of 90% uranium-235, and light water reactors require a concentration of roughly 3% uranium-235.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/ch374/ch418518/Chapter%2016%20Nuclear%20Reactor%20Chemistry.pdf |title=Modern Nuclear Chemistry |chapter=Chapter 16 Nuclear Reactor Chemistry |first1=W. |last1=Loveland |first2=D.J. |last2=Morrissey |first3=G.T. |last3=Seaborg |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unenriched natural uranium is appropriate fuel for a [[heavy-water reactor]], like a [[CANDU reactor]].

In rare occasions, earlier in geologic history when uranium-235 was more abundant, uranium ore was found to have naturally engaged in fission, forming [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]s. Uranium-235 decays at a faster rate ([[half-life]] of 700 million years) compared to uranium-238, which decays extremely slowly (half-life of 4.5 billion years). Therefore, a billion years ago, there was more than double the uranium-235 compared to now.

During the [[Manhattan Project]], the name '''''Tuballoy''''' was used to refer to natural uranium in the refined condition; this term is still in occasional use. Uranium was also called codenamed "X-Metal" during World War II.  Similarly, enriched uranium was referred to as '''''Oralloy''''' (Oak Ridge alloy), and [[depleted uranium]] was referred to as '''''Depletalloy''''' (depleted alloy).

'''''Drombus bontii''''' is a [[species]] of [[goby]] native to the [[Indian Ocean]] from the [[Bazaruto Archipelago]] of [[Mozambique]] through to the [[tropical]] waters of the western [[Pacific Ocean]].  This species can reach a length of {{convert|7.1|cm|in}} [[fish measurement|TL]].  The status of this species is questionable, with [[Maurice Kottelat]] considering it to be a junior [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''[[Drombus triangularis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase |genus= Gobius|species= bontii| month = June | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kottelat"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maurice Kottelat|author2=A.

'''Paper car wheels''' were composite wheels of [[railway carriage]]s, made from a [[wrought iron]] or [[steel]] rim bolted to an iron hub with an interlayer of [[Lamination paper|laminated paper]].&lt;ref name="Lienhard"&gt;John H. Lienhard: [https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi758.htm ''Engines of Our Enginuity, No. 758: Paper railroad wheels.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The center was made of compressed paper held between two plate-iron disks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Paper+car+wheel ''Paper car wheel.''] In: The Free Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ability to damp rail/wheel noise resulted in a quiet and smooth ride for the passengers of North American [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]] dining and sleeping cars.&lt;ref name="Cupery"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ken|last=Cupery|url=http://www.cupery.net/wheels.html|title=Paper Railroad Wheels?|year=2016|publisher=cupery.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
[[File:Derailment of a railway bogie with paper car wheels.jpg|thumb|Derailment of a railway bogie with paper car wheels, around 1895]]
Paper car wheels were invented by the locomotive engineer [[Richard N. Allen]] (1827–1890),&lt;ref name="ACBD"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/dictionary/paperwheels.htm|title=Paper Wheels|date=April 11, 2006|publisher=A Car-Builder's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; who set up a company with his brother-in-law in 1867, producing paper from straw. They damped vibrations much better than conventional cast-iron railway wheels, which transmitted all imperfections of the track into the car above it, making train rides noisy and uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="Lienhard"/&gt; Paper wheels were especially used in [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]] dining and sleeping cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas Curtis |last=Clarke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nw4QCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT201 |title=The American Railway: Its Construction, Development, Management, and Trains|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781510702011|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Helena E. |last=Wright|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3106589?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |title=George Pullman and the Allen Paper Car Wheel|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=33|issue=4|date= October 1992|pages=757-768|subscription=yes|via=[[Jstor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they were occasionally criticised for causing derailments. In 1915 the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]], which regulated U.S. railroads, declared paper car wheels to be unsafe, and they went out of use on railroad passenger cars in the United States.&lt;ref name="Cupery"/&gt;

== Manufacture ==
The construction process involved the bonding of 200 circular sheets of paper, as follows. Sets of three circular sheets were bonded into a "sandwich" using a flour-based glue. Additional "sandwiches" were then constructed and placed atop one another to make a {{convert|4|ft|adj=on}} high stack. This stack was placed in a 650-ton [[hydraulic press]] for three hours.&lt;ref name="Cupery"/&gt; The circular compound disks were then dried and cured for six to eight weeks, leaving no moisture in them. After curing, the compound disks were turned in a [[lathe]] to the appropriate size, and 24 or more bolt holes were drilled in them. These compound disks formed the center of each wheel, to which was added a cast-iron hub and steel rim bolted to {{convert|1/4|inch|mm|adj=on}} thick protective metal plates on either side of the paper center. With the bolts tightened, the paper center became a "solid, dense, compressed, composite structure" which could support the weight of the carriages.&lt;ref name="Eichman"&gt;John E. Eichman, Sr: [http://www.cteastrrmuseum.org/ghost1999-02.htm ''Paper Passenger Car Wheels.''] In: ''The Proto Journal'', Volume 4, No 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morris Fibre Board Co, Morris, ILL.jpg|thumb|Morris Fibre Board Co, [[Morris, Illinois]]]]
The Allen Paper Car Wheel Works was initially based on East North Street in [[Morris, Illinois]], while its general office was on 239 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[New York City|New York]]. The company's principal customer was the [[Pullman Company|Pullman Palace Car Company]] in [[Chicago]] which, after testing and optimising the wheel, had placed their first order for 100 wheels in 1871. Subsequently, the main plant was established at South Bay&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Cupery"/&gt;--&gt; in [[Hudson, New York]], in 1873, and eventually relocated onto the site of Pullman's Chicago works.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;[http://www.theherald-news.com/2017/10/17/then-now-morris-paper-mills-morris/a4n8kux/ ''Then &amp; Now: Morris Paper Mills – Morris.''] In: ''The Herald-News'', 18 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1881, the Allen Paper Car Wheel Co. operated workshops in New York and Chicago, but maintained its processing plant in Morris.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt; Each workshop employed approximately 80 men and produced more than 24 wheels a day.&lt;ref name="Cupery"/&gt; Thus the company produced and sold thousands of wheels each year.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt; In 1886 the company announced it had 60,000 wheels in service. In 1893 it had sold 115,000.&lt;ref name="ACBD"/&gt; The Allen Paper Car Wheel Works operated until 1890, when they were transferred to John N. Bunnell and changed their name to the American Straw Board Co. Subsequently, the business and plant were leased, sold and restructured, and operated for the next two decades under different names, including the Morris Box Board Co. In October 1915, the company was restructured and incorporated as the Morris Paper Mills. By the 1920s, the paper mill was one of the largest employers in Morris, producing cardboard boxes of various shapes, sizes, and colors that were shipped throughout the US.&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt;

[[File:Allen's elastische Eisenbahn-Wagenräder (cropped).png|thumb|Allen's elastic rail wagon wheels, designed an manufactured by John Brown &amp; Co in Sheffield]]
The company John Brown &amp; Co in [[Sheffield]], [[England]], came to an agreement with the inventor on the manufacture of paper wheels in Europe. It installed the necessary machines by October 1875, so that production was expected to start in due course.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=bIZmAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Wagenr%C3%A4der%20Papier%20eisenbahn%20england&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q=%20elastische%20eisenbahn%20wagenr%C3%A4der&amp;f=false ''Allen's elastische Eisenbahn-Wagenräder.''] In: Stummer's Ingenieur: internationales Organ für d. Gesamtgebiet d. techn. Wissens u. Repertorium d. hervorragendsten ausländ. Fachjournale, No. 95, Vol. 4, Fromme, 1875, pp. 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
As proposed by the Master Machine Builder Finckbein in [[Saarbrücken]]-[[Sankt Johann (Saarbrücken)|St. Johann]] and the Master Craftsman Caesar of the Reichseisenbahn, the oilboard and lacquerware factory of Gebrüder Adt in [[Forbach]] produced a paper pulp suitable for railway car wheels after various tests. With the permission of the Royal Railway Administration in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt a. M.]], wheelsets with paper discs were manufactured in the main railway workshop in Saarbrücken and in the railway car wheels factory of the van der Zypen brothers in [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]] and then put into use. Such wheelsets with paper pulp discs were in regular service on wagons for a long time. They held perfectly and showed a very smooth running while driving without making any annoying noises.&lt;ref Name="Dingler1881"&gt;[http://dingler.culture.hu-berlin.de/article/pj242/mi242mi01_5 ''Eisenbahnwagenräder aus Papier.''] In: ''Polytechnisches Journal.'' 1881, Band 242, S. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wheels used in Saarbrücken were constructed in the manner of wooden [[Mansell wheel]]s, with the wheel tire being placed on the paper disc and the hub in it by means of strong hydraulic pressure, while the tires of the American paper wheels were provided with an inner attachment against which the paper disc was pressed and to which it was connected by bolts. Practice has shown that tires with such an inner approach, apparently due to the uneven mass distribution, cracked from the inside to the outside, so that the advantage of reinforcing the tires was lost and an opposite result was achieved. The tire in conventional Mansell wheels with wooden discs could slip on the wooden disc when the tire was warmed up during braking. In the wheels designed in Saarbrücken, four iron dowels were therefore inserted on each side between the tire and the Mansell ring, which prevented the wheel tires from turning during braking.&lt;ref Name="Dingler1881"/&gt;

'''Picarin''' is a [[plastic]] used to make optics such as [[lens (optics)|lens]]es for [[terahertz radiation]] (THz radiation). Picarin is useful for this purpose because it is highly [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] in both the THz and [[visible light|visible]] [[spectrum|spectral]] ranges. The [[refractive index]] of Picarin is almost the same for THz (''n''=1.52) and visible light (''n''=1.52). It is very strong mechanically, and withstands optical [[polishing]].&lt;ref name="mtinstruments"&gt;http://www.mtinstruments.com - dealer&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unpolished Picarin Lenses''' offer the best performance at 2-7 THz spectral range. Unfortunately, unpolished surfaces scatter visible and near-IR light.&lt;ref name="mtinstruments"/&gt;

A version which can be polished is sold as '''Tsurupica'''.&lt;ref name="bblaser"&gt;http://www.bblaser.com - producer (not English)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rue Saint-Paul''' (''Saint Paul Street'') is a street in the [[Old Montreal]] historic area of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].

The street was laid out by [[François Dollier de Casson]], along the route of a path that had bordered a former fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bootsnall.com/namericatravelguides/montreal/apr01mont.shtml |title=A Summer Walk into Montreal's Early Years under French Rule |accessdate=2008-03-02 |last=Goldman |first=Norman |work=Bootsn All Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Paul is Montreal's oldest street and for many years served as its main thoroughfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetware.com/map-of/montreal-rue-saint-paul-cdn-qu-qumrs.htm |title=Rue Saint Paul |accessdate=2008-03-02 |work=Planetware}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paved in 1672, it was named after [[Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve]], founder of Montreal, who built a home for himself on it in 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.providenceintl.org/www.providenceintl.org/english/Actuality/PasE/PAS1.html |title=In the footsteps of Emilie |accessdate=2008-03-02 |work=Sisters of Providence |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922042549/http://www.providenceintl.org/www.providenceintl.org/english/Actuality/PasE/PAS1.html |archivedate=September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The street is home to such landmarks as the [[Bonsecours Market]] and [[Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/archives/democratie/democratie_en/expo/democratisation/revalorisation/piece6/index.shtm  |title=Saint Paul Street, Democracy in Montreal |accessdate=2008-03-02 |work=City of Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Saint Paul is still paved with [[cobblestones]]. Plans to pedestrianize the street in 2008 were dropped by the [[City of Montreal]] after complaints from merchants.

'''Dr. Sadad Ibrahim Al Husseini''' is a leading [[Saudis|Saudi]] oil and gas industry expert.  He is most widely known for his achievements during his tenure at Saudi Aramco as the Senior and Executive Vice President for Exploration and Producing, and his current work on supply side risk; referred to by the New York Times as “one of the most respected and accomplished oilmen in the world”.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Aug. 21, 2005,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/magazine/the-breaking-point.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
He is credited with launching the field modernization and state of art reservoir management and development of Saudi Arabia’s giant oil fields,&lt;ref&gt;Aramco World Magazine, May–June 1984&lt;/ref&gt; the upgrading of the company’s drilling, environmental, and upstream safety standards, the discovery and development of its Paleozoic oil and gas reservoirs,&lt;ref&gt;The Arabian Sun, November 29, 1989 and AIME, www.aimehq.org&lt;/ref&gt; the discovery of its Red Sea oil and condensate fields,&lt;ref&gt;The Arabian Sun, Special Issue Commemorating Saudi Aramco’s 60th Year, May 26, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; the initiation of its upstream advanced degree and specialists professional programs, and the development of its leading edge reservoir modelling and simulation capabilities at its purpose built Exploration and Petroleum Engineering Center,EXPEC.&lt;ref&gt;Al Youm Newspaper, Dammam, March 28, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Arabian Sun, Special Issue Commemorating Saudi Aramco’s 60th Year, May 26, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Arabian Sun, September 22, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he launched Aramco’s mothballing program for 3.5 million barrels of oil production capacity and in 1990, as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he led the Aramco team that re-activated the mothballed capacity thereby increasing Kingdom’s oil production from 5 million bd to 8.5 million bd within six months.&lt;ref&gt;Miscellaneous Report, Executive Committee, Saudi Arabia Oil Company, February 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 he launched the intensified non-associated Saudi gas exploration program which increased the Kingdom’s non-associated gas reserves by 30 Tcf within 4 years.

In 1996,Al Husseini was called upon by HM King Abdullah ibn Abdul Aziz to provide advisory support to the Kingdom’s leadership for the purpose of expanding its economy through a broader exploitation of its proven gas reserves. This culminated in the Kingdom’s Natural Gas Initiative in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Shell in the Middle East, No.15 – Oct. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  which invited international oil companies to participate in the development of the Kingdom’s non-associated gas reservoirs and the expansion of its power generation, desalination and petrochemical sectors. Following on his retirement from Saudi Aramco in 2004, Dr.Al Husseini co-founded and is president of Husseini Energy Company, a highly specialized oil and gas consulting firm based in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

In July 30, 2018, Al Hussenini said, “Rather than allowing these hostile maneuvers to go unnoticed in the eyes of the world, the Saudi (energy) minister has placed Iran’s subversions of the whole global economy under the spotlight for everyone to see,” “The capture of the port of Hodeidah will go a long way towards putting an end to these disruptions".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-oil-explainer/why-is-saudi-halting-oil-shipments-through-the-red-sea-idUSKBN1KK1ND&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Dr Sadad Al Husseini was born in Damascus in 1946 to Col. Ibrahim Abdulrahman Al Husseini and Myassar BachImam. His father was a leading Syrian nationalist and member of the Syrian military and political leadership until 1957.  Al Husseini attended primary and secondary education at Notre Dame International School in Rome, Italy between 1955 and 1964. He and his family moved to Saudi Arabia in 1961 when King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz invited Col. Ibrahim Al Husseini to advise the Saudi Arabian Council of Ministers on national security matters and to support Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud as his special advisor in the establishment of the modern Saudi Arabian National Guard.&lt;ref&gt;A Soldier in Arabia: A British Military Memoir from Jordan to Saudi Arabia. Author: Nigel Bromage and the WSJ article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wikileaks==
On February 8, 2011 The Guardian newspaper published US cables from Saudi Arabia that were obtained by WikiLeaks. The cables were based on a conversation attributed to Dr Sadad Al Husseini in 2007 claiming Dr Husseini thought Aramco’s reserves were overstated by as much as 300 billion barrels.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, February 8, 2011, https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/08/saudi-oil-reserves-overstated-wikileaks&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained traction in the press and caused tremendous damage to Dr Husseini’s reputation within the Kingdom. Dr Sadad Al Husseini maintained that the US cable gravely misrepresented his opinion and that the report was full of errors and rooky mistakes including quoting resource figures as reserve figures.Subsequently, Dr Sadad Al Husseini’s firm published a press release on February 9, 2011 in response to the significant errors in the cable and clarified Dr Sadad’s position on Saudi Arabia’s reserves and production capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Husseini Energy website,http://www.husseinienergy.com/media-center/in-the-press/press-release-by-dr-sadad-al-husseini/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shock stall''' is a [[Stall (flight)|stall]] created when the [[airflow]] over an [[aircraft]]'s [[wing]]s is disturbed by [[shock waves]] formed when flying at or above the aircraft's [[drag divergence Mach number]].

A '''stall''' is the decrease in Lift to a value below the Weight, and the associated increase in Drag upon the separation of the boundary layer (in this case behind the shock wave).

The '''sociology of space''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that mostly borrows from theories developed within the discipline of [[geography]], including the sub fields of [[human geography]], [[economic geography]], and [[feminist geography]]. The "sociology" of space examines the social and material constitution of spaces. It is concerned with understanding the social practices, institutional forces, and material complexity of how humans and spaces interact. The sociology of space is an inter-disciplinary area of study, drawing on various theoretical traditions including [[Marxism]], [[postcolonialism]], and [[Science and Technology Studies]], and overlaps and encompasses theorists with various academic disciplines such as [[geography]] and [[architecture]].  Edward T. Hall developed the study of [[Proxemics]] which concentrates on the empirical analysis of space in psychology.  

== Definition of space ==
Space is one of the most important concepts within the disciplines of social science as it is fundamental to our understanding of geography. The term "space" has been defined variously by scholars:

In general terms, the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways;

1. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it.  
2. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions.

However, the human geographers’ interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study.

[[Michel Foucault]] defines space as;
“The space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space…..we live inside a set of relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kham|first=Miriam|title=Tahiti Intertwined: Ancestral Land, Tourist Postcard, and Nuclear Test Site|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 2000|volume= 102| issue = 1|series=New Series|pages=7–26|jstor=683535|doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Thrift]] also defines space as;
"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, "space" is the social space in which we live and create relationships with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.

== History of the sociology of space ==

[[Georg Simmel]] has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Urry | first1 = John | contribution = The Sociology of Space and Place  | series = Blackwell companion to sociology | pages = 5 | year = 2004|isbn=1-4051-2267-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel wrote on "the sociology of space" in his 1908 book "Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation". His concerns included the process of metropolitanisation and the separation of leisure spaces in modern economic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Theory and Method |last=Jary| first=David |url =http://www.reading.ac.uk/RevSoc/archive/volume10/number1/10-1b.htm | year=1997 |accessdate =2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of [[space]] long played a subordinate role in sociological theory formation. Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the [[topological turn]]. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels.

The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is [[Michel Foucault| Michel Foucault’s]] essay on “Of Other Spaces”,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1991, orig. 1967), »Andere Räume«, in: Wentz, Martin (Hg.), Stadt-Räume, Frankfurt a. M./New York, S. 65–72&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author proclaims the “age of space”, and [[Henri Lefebvre| Henri Lefebvre’s]] seminal work “La production de l’espace”.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri (1991, orig. 1974), The Production of Space, D. Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-14048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], [[Manuel Castells]], [[Edward Soja]], and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist [[Martina Löw]].&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches deriving from the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years. Also in contrast to (neo)Marxist concepts of space, British geographer [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]]&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999a), Power-Geometries and the Politics of Space-Time, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999b), »Spaces of Politics«, in: Massey, Doreen/Allen, John/Sarre, Philip (Hg.), Human Geography Today, Cambridge/Oxford/Malden, S. 279–294&lt;/ref&gt; and German sociologist [[Helmuth Berking]],&lt;ref&gt;Berking, Helmuth (1998), »›Global Flows and Local Cultures‹. Über die Rekonfiguration sozialer Räume im Globalisierungsprozeß«, in: Berliner Journal für Soziologie, 8, 3, S. 381–392&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, emphasise the heterogeneity of local contexts and the place-relatedness of our knowledge about the world.

== Duality of space ==

[[Martina Löw]] developed the idea of a "relational" model of space, which focuses on the “orderings”&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2008), »The Constitution of Space: The Structuration of Spaces Through the Simultaneity of Effects and Perception«, in: European Journal of Social Theory, 1, 11&lt;/ref&gt; of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by [[Anthony Giddens]],&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1984), The Constitution of Society. Outline of the Theory of Structuration. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; whose concept of the “duality of structure” Löw extends sociological terms into a “duality of space.” The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.

With respect to the constitution of space, Löw distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: “spacing” and “synthesis.” Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to Löw, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people – in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. Löw calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by [[Lars Meier]] (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), [[Cedric Janowicz]] (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of [[Accra]]), and [[Silke Streets]] (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).

== Marxist approaches ==

The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was [[Henri Lefebvre]]. He proposed "social space" to be where the [[relations of production]] are reproduced and that dialectical contradictions were spatial rather than temporal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Survival of Capitalism: Reproduction of the Relations of Production | publisher=Allison &amp; Busby | year=1973 | isbn=0-85031-173-X}}, p17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Lefèbvre sees the societal production of space as a dialectical interaction between three factors. Space is constituted:

* by “spatial practice,” meaning space as reproduced in everyday life
* by the “representation of space”, meaning space as developed cognitively
* and by “spaces of representation,” by which Lefebvre means complex symbolisations and ideational spaces.

In Lefebvre’s view of the 1970s, this spatial production resulted in a space of non-reflexive everydayness marked by alienation, dominating through mathematical-abstract concepts of space, and reproduced in spatial practice. Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation – in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space.

Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from [[Fordism]] to “flexible accumulation” on the experience of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1989), The Condition of Postmodernity, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis-prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is “time-space compression.” While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.

== Postcolonial theories of space ==

Theories of space that are inspired by the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces. According to [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]], calling a country in Africa a “developing country” is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the “developed” world, a view she condemns as "Eurocentrism." In this vein, [[Helmuth Berking]] criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as “globocentrism.” He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]] is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as [[McDonald’s]] means something different in Moscow than in Paris.

== Third Space ==
[[Henri Lefebvre]] (see also [[Edward Soja]]) says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. He explains space embraces a multitude of intersection in his great book, “Production of Space”. That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other.

He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefebvre|first=Henri|title=Marxist &amp; Social Constructivist Approaches to Place|url=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~janzb/courses/hum3930b/lefebvre1.htm|publisher=Pegasus|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. First Space
(Physical space/perceived space)
"The spatial practice of a society secretes that society's space; it propounds and presupposes it, in a dialectical interaction; it produces it slowly and surely as it masters and appropriates it."

2. Second Space
(Mental space/conceived space)
"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived."

3. Third Space
(Social space/lived space)
"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols."

Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is “The third space” formulated by [[Edward Soja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Smith|first=Susan|title=Introducing Human Geographies|year=1999|publisher=Arnold|location=London|pages=12–22|chapter=Society-Space|editor=Paul Cloke |editor2=Philip Crang |editor3=Mark Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a number of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.

== Rational view of space ==
In the work of geographer and critical theorist [[Nigel Thrift]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. 
There are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space.

'''First Space''' is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today’s technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space.
'''Second space''' is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of goods, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. 
'''Third space''' is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. 
'''Fourth space''' is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place, and it can represent as different type of space. This fourth type of space tries to understand that place is a vital actor in bringing up people's lives in certain ways and place will let us to understand all kind of things which are hidden form us..

==Scale: the local and the global==
Andrew Herod &lt;ref&gt;Harod, A. 2003. "Scale: the local and the global".  Key Concepts in Geography. London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that scale, within human geography, is typically seen in one of the two ways: either as a real material thing which actually exists and is the result of political struggle and/or social process, or as a way of framing our understanding of the world. People’s lives across the globe have been re-scaling by contemporary economic, political, cultural and social processes, such as [[globalization]], in complex ways. As a result, we have seen the creation of [[supra-national]] political bodies such as the [[European Union]], the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.&lt;ref&gt;PoliticalGeography. 1997. Special Issue on " The political geography of scale".Political Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and ‘[[Americanization]]’ through the process of globalization while the locals’ tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people‘s lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the ‘global’ and the ‘local’ were brought into question.

===Ontological status of the global and the local===
Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of ‘scale’ itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from ‘regional scale’ or‘national scale’. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among [[materialists]] and [[idealists]]. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant’s idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian‘s inspiration, the ‘global’ is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the ‘local’ is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the ‘national’ scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional.

The notion of ‘becoming’ and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.J. 1982. "A materialist framework for political geography", Transactions, Institute of British Geographers.&lt;/ref&gt; arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become ‘local’as they have to work to become ‘global’. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have ‘gone global’, how institutions of governance have‘become’ supra-national and how labour unions have sought to ‘globalize’ their operations to match those of an increasingly ‘globalized’ city.

For the scale ‘global’ and ‘local’, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’ but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, ‘scale’ is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static ’arenas’within which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions.For example, a political organization might attempt to go ‘global’ to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to ‘go local’ through tailoring its products and operations in different places.

===Discourses of the global and the local===
[[J. K. Gibson-Graham|Gibson-Graham]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibson-Graham, J.K. 2002. "Beyond global vs. local: economic politics outside the binary frame" in: A. Herold and M.W. Wright(eds) . Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed.

1. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations

2. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is ‘something more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local’. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not.

3. According to French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]], the local and the global ‘offer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour’s view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins.

4. The concept ‘The global is local’ was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually ‘multi local‘ rather than ‘global’.

5. The local is global. In this view, the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet.

6. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are ‘glocal.’

There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as ‘small and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global’. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital – those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept ‘Think globally and act locally’ viewed by [[neoliberals]].

===Metaphors of scale===
For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls, earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]] argued is that a world of places is ‘networked’ together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other.  For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a ‘more accurate’representation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon.

Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social, economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,A&lt;ref&gt;Herod, A., Wright, M.W (eds). 2002. Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; )

'''The Rock''' is a [[boulder]] on the campus of [[Michigan State University]]. Once popular as a [[Trysting tree#Etymology|trysting]] site, today it serves as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] for campus groups and events. __NOTOC__

==History==
[[File:MSU Rock 2011-02-11.jpg|thumb|left|MSU Rock 2011-02-11]]
The Rock was unearthed in 1873 near what is now the corner of [[Grand River Avenue]] ([[M-43 (Michigan highway)|M-43]]) and Michigan Avenue in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]], [[Michigan]]. It was donated to the (Michigan) [[History of Michigan State University|State Agricultural College]] by the class of 1873. The college placed the rock in the "Sacred Space" near the modern day [[Beaumont Tower]], where the stone became a common hangout for young couples and became known as the "[[Engagement]] Rock". By the late 20th Century, the rock had become better known for protest slogans than engagement photos. In 1985, it was moved to its current location, east of [[Farm Lane]], on the north bank of the [[Red Cedar River (Michigan)|Red Cedar River]]. Today, the innumerable layers of paint obliterate the original inscription: "Class '73".

==The Rock Today==
[[File:MSU Rock 2006-01-12.jpg|thumb|left|The Rock on January 12, 2006.]]
The Rock can be painted on by anyone, and is used for anything from birthday wishes and marriage proposals to political statements. The Rock is also a hot spot for rival universities to paint. As a result, during football and basketball season MSU students often camp next to the Rock to protect it.

One of the most poignant moments in the history of the Rock occurred on the evening of September 11, 2001. Within hours of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], virtually every activist group on campus, along with the university administration, had organized an impromtpu [[candlelight vigil]] at the [[floodplain]] next to the Rock. The Rock was painted green and white with the words "MSU students in remembrance and reflection" on the front, and an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] on the back. Several thousand students attended. In a break from normal rock-painting etiquette, the university asked all campus groups to abstain from repainting the Rock for one week.

[[File:Lacey.jpg|thumb|The Rock the night following the vigil.]]
On Wednesday, April 9, 2014, at 9:00 pm, hundreds gathered at the rock to hold a vigil for Lacey Holsworth, dubbed "Princess Lacey", a young 8-year-old girl, with terminal cancer, who befriended the MSU Basketball team and whose story was a source of inspiration nationwide. The rock was painted white, with "MSU Loves Princess Lacey" on the front, and "Love Like Lacey" on the base. Students then proceeded to sign the rock with a black sharpie, leaving their own personal messages to Lacey, who had passed that morning. 
Throughout Thursday, dozens of students an hour stopped at the rock, adding their names, leaving flowers, and paying their respects. A movement, highlighted by an article in the [http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140410/SPORTS0202/304100114?fb_comment_id=fbc_730322790332090_7136874_730362746994761#f1776f93f4 Detroit News], sought to ban all future painting of the rock, and to preserve it as a permanent memorial to Lacey. But by April 21, 2014, four days after her memorial, it was repainted with the message "Congratulations graduates, be a hero to someone"

A '''turbosteamer''' is a term used by [[BMW]] to describe a [[combined cycle]] engine.  [[Waste heat]] energy from the [[internal combustion engine]] would be used to generate steam (see [[Waste Heat Recovery Unit]]) for a [[steam engine]] which would create supplemental power for the vehicle. The turbosteamer device is affixed to the [[exhaust pipe|exhaust]] and cooling system. It salvages the heat wasted in the exhaust and radiator (as much as 80% of heat energy) and uses a steam piston or turbine to relay that power to the crankshaft. The steam circuit produces {{convert|14|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque at peak (for a 1.8 [[Straight-4]] engine), yielding an estimated 15% gain in fuel efficiency. Unlike gasoline-electric hybrids, these gains increase at higher, steadier speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paultan.org/archives/2005/12/11/bmw-turbosteamer/ BMW TurboSteamer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timescale==
BMW has been the pioneer of this concept as early as 2000 under the direction of Dr. [[Raymond Freymann]], and while they were designing this system to fit to most current BMW models, the technology didn't reach production.

'''Turkish Airlines Flight 5904''' was a [[Boeing 737-400]] on an international repositioning flight from [[Adana Şakirpaşa Airport]] in [[Adana]], [[Turkey]] to [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]] in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]] which crashed on 7 April 1999 in the vicinity of [[Ceyhan]], [[Adana Province]] in southern [[Turkey]] some eight minutes after takeoff. The flight was on its way to Saudi Arabia to pick up pilgrims from Jeddah and as such took off without any passengers on board. All six crew members however were killed in the crash.

==Flight==
The aircraft operating Flight 5904 was a 1995-built [[Boeing 737-400]], registered as TC-JEP and named ''Trakya''. Owned by [[ILFC]], – an American aircraft lessor – it was equipped with two [[CFM International CFM56]] engines and had accumulated around 11.600 flight hours in 6.360 flight cycles up until the time of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19990407-0 |publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network]] |title=Accident description |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preceding flight from [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]] in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]] had transferred 150 pilgrims returning from [[Hajj]] back to [[Adana Şakirpaşa Airport]], where it landed without any problems at around 23:45 [[Eastern European Time|EET]] (20:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). Remaining on the ground for around one hour for refueling,  Flight 5904 took off with a new crew – two pilots and four flight attendants – and with around 10 to 15 tons of fuel at 00:36 EET in order to pick up more pilgrims from Jeddah.&lt;ref name="shgm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shgm.gov.tr/kaza/tcjep.htm |publisher=Civil Aviation Authority |title=Accident report TC – JEP (07.04.1999) |language=Turkish |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615143040/http://www.shgm.gov.tr/kaza/tcjep.htm |archivedate=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before takeoff, upon request by the crew, the air traffic controller at [[Incirlik Air Base]] relayed the weather report and told the crew that the entire [[aerodrome]] was completely covered by thunderstorms and that the thunderstorms were moving from the south towards the north.&lt;ref name="shgm"/&gt;

===Crash===
Around eight minutes into the flight, at 00:44 EET, at an altitude of around {{convert|10000|ft|km}} and without any sign of inconvenience, the aircraft started to plunge nose-down into the ground and crashed into a field some {{convert|30|nmi|km}} east-northeast of the airport near Hamdilli village in the vicinity of [[Ceyhan]] in [[Adana Province]]. The force of the impact created of {{convert|15|m|ft}} deep and {{convert|30|m²|sqft}} large hole. The [[Stabilizer (aeronautics)|horizontal stabilizer]] of the aircraft was discovered some {{convert|250|m|ft}} away from the main wreckage which was spread over an area of around {{convert|500|m²|sqft}}. All six occupants were instantly killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/1999/04/08/haber/hab00.html |title=MİLLİYET HABER SAYFALARI |website=Milliyet |accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://webarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/1999/04/07/107253.asp |publisher=Hürriyet |title=THY uçağı Adana'da düştü |date=7 April 1999 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.habervaktim.com/haber/246578/ayni-faciayi-biz-de-yasadik.html |title=Aynı faciayı biz de yaşadık |accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immediate Response===
After the aircraft vanished from radar without any prenotice, [[air traffic controllers]] at Adana Airport and at Incirlik Air Base immediately notified the [[Turkish Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] and the police to initiate search and rescue efforts. At around that time, a large explosion was reported near Hamdili village around {{convert|5|km|mi}} east of Ceyhan in Adana Province.

==Investigation==
The investigation into the accident was carried out by Turkey's [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (Turkey)|Directorate General of Civil Aviation]] (DGCA). The [[cockpit voice recorder]] revealed that while the crew was struggling to regain control of the aircraft, at least some of the four flight attendants were inside the cockpit panicking and screaming. The copilot was heard telling the captain ''"aman ağabey, gittik, gidiyoruz, bas.."'' (which roughly translates into ''"Oh brother, we've gone, we're going, push..."'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hvtd.org/yeni/?p=807 |title=1999 THY – Trakya Uçağı Kazası |website=www.hvtd.org |accessdate=2016-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826051637/http://www.hvtd.org/yeni/?p=807 |archivedate=26 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Uglies''''' is a 2005 science fiction novel by [[Scott Westerfeld]]. It is set in a [[future]] [[post scarcity]] [[dystopia]]n world in which everyone is considered an "ugly", but then turned "Pretty" by extreme [[cosmetic surgery]] when they reach the age 16. It tells the story of teenager [[Tally Youngblood]] who rebels against society's enforced conformity, after her newfound friends Shay and David show her the downsides to becoming a "Pretty".

Written for [[Adolescence|young adults]], ''Uglies'' deals with themes of change, both emotional and physical. The book is the first installment in what was originally a trilogy, [[the Uglies series|the ''Uglies'' series]], which also includes the books ''[[Pretties]]'', ''[[Specials (novel)|Specials]]'', and ''[[Extras (novel)|Extras]]''. In 2018, four new installments within the Uglies Universe were announced, to be titled the Imposters Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scottwesterfeld.com/blog/2018/02/four-new-uglies-novels/|title=Four New Uglies Novels - Scott Westerfeld|date=2018-02-01|work=Scott Westerfeld|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone on their sixteenth birthday receives the “pretty” operation which transforms them into the society's standard of beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfeld, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; After the operation, new Pretties cross the river that divides the city and lead a new life with no responsibilities or obligations. There are two other operations available, one to transform Pretties into “Middle-Pretties” (adults with a job), and another to transform Middle-Pretties into "Crumblies".

Former cities have decayed after bacteria infected the world's petroleum, making it unstable. The old society, so dependent on oil, fell apart when cars and oil fields exploded and food could no longer be transported. People who lived before this catastrophe are called "Rusties."&lt;ref&gt;http://scottwesterfeld.com/books/uglies/&lt;/ref&gt;

Tally Youngblood is almost sixteen. Like every other Ugly, she awaits the operation with great anticipation.

At first, Tally ignores the idea, but is forced to deal with it when Shay runs away a few days before their shared sixteenth birthday, leaving behind cryptic directions to her destination, a “renegade settlement” called the Smoke, where city runaways go to escape the operation.&lt;ref name="Simon Pulse"/&gt;

On the day of Tally’s operation, she is taken to Special Circumstances, a division that is likened to “gremlins” and, “[blamed] when anything weird happens."&lt;ref&gt;Westerfeld, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Cable, a woman who is described as “a cruel pretty”,&lt;ref name="Westerfeld, p. 191"&gt;Westerfeld, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; is the head of Special Circumstances. She gives Tally an ultimatum to either help locate Shay and the Smoke, or never become a pretty. Tally cooperates and Dr. Cable gives her a hoverboard and all the needed supplies to survive in the wild, along with a heart locket that contains a tracking device. Once activated, it will show the location of the Smoke to Special Circumstances. Following Shay's clues, Tally sets off to find her friend.

When Tally arrives at the Smoke, she finds Shay, her friend David and an entire community of runaway Uglies. She is reluctant to activate the pendant and it eventually becomes clear that David is in love with her. David takes her to meet his parents, Maddy and Az, who are the original runaways from the city. They explain how the operation does more than “cosmetic nipping and tucking.”&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Uglies| journal =Publishers Weekly | volume = 252| issue =12 | pages =53 | publisher = | location =New York, New York | date =21 March 2005 | url =http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=13&amp;sid=079ce694-53d5-4d4f-bb05-3a0b5d54a319%40sessionmgr12&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLGN1c3R1aWQmY3VzdGlkPXM4NDU1ODYxJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=lkh&amp;AN=16495557 | jstor = | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = 14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also causes lesions in the brain to make the people placid, or “pretty-minded.” Horrified, Tally decides to keep the Smoke secret and throws the locket into a fire. However, the flames' heat causes the tracker to activate, giving away the Smoke’s location.

The following morning, Special Circumstances arrives at the camp and Tally makes an effort to escape. She does not succeed and is caught and taken to a rabbit pen, where other caught Smokies are kept, tied up. Eye scans are taken of all the captured Smokies, identifying from which city they fled. Tally is then taken to Dr. Cable, who explains how they found the Smoke. Dr. Cable thinks Tally purposefully activated the pendant. After being ordered to retrieve the pendant, Tally escapes on a hoverboard. After a long and stressful chase, she manages to hide in a cave where they cannot track her heat signature. There she finds David also hiding and together, they begin to plan a rescue.

Tally and David go back to his house, where they find evidence that Special Circumstances took Maddy and Az. David leads Tally to a secret stash of survival equipment&lt;ref&gt;Westerfeld, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; where they find everything they need, and load them onto the four hoverboards stashed there. As Tally and David travel back to the city to free their friends, they fall in love. Arriving at the Special Circumstances complex, they discover that Shay has already been “turned” and is now a Pretty.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfeld, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting Dr. Cable, David knocks her out and takes her work tablet, which contains all the necessary information to reverse the brain lesions created by the Pretty operation. Tally and David then free all the Smokies held in the complex. As they escape the complex, Maddy tells David that his father, Az, is dead.

Once everyone is safe, Maddy begins working on a cure using Dr. Cable’s tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfeld, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; She then offers it to Shay, who refuses, not wanting to become a “vegetable.”&lt;ref&gt;Westerfeld, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Since Tally feels responsible for her betrayal, she decides to become a Pretty and take the cure as a “willing subject”.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfeld, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt; To convince David to let her go back to the city, she tells him about her involvement with Special Circumstances and searching for the Smoke to betray them. While David is absorbing what Tally admitted, Maddy advises Tally to go back with Shay before she changes her mind. Once there, Tally announces to a Middle Pretty, “I’m Tally Youngblood. Make me pretty,” the final phrase of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Westerfeld, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
===Uglies===
*Tally Youngblood is the main character of the story. She is clever and loves tricks. Her Ugly nickname is Squint.  As the story progresses, she begins to stray from the rules of her city, and her assignment. She falls in love with David at the Smoke. Together, Tally and David rescue the Smokies after the Smoke is captured by Special Circumstances. In the end, she gives herself up to be Pretty and help Shay.
*Shay is Tally's new friend in Uglyville. She is an Ugly nicknamed Skinny. They meet while Tally is fleeing from New Pretty City. Shay teaches Tally how to hoverboard and more about the outside world and the Rusties. Shay prefers to refer to Tally by her name, however, they occasionally call each other by their Ugly nicknames to provoke each other. After a fight, Shay decides to "grow up" and go to the Smoke. Shay grows jealous of Tally's presence in the Smoke, especially of her relationship with David. Shay realizes Tally's ultimate betrayal, but no longer cares once she is made Pretty.

===Smokies===
*David, the son of the founders of the Smoke, was not born in any city. Shay has an interest in David but he does not reciprocate her feelings. After Tally arrives at the Smoke, his interest in her makes Shay jealous. David helps change Tally’s feeling towards the cities. He wears hand-sewn clothing, made from animal skins, and has survival skills which he passes on to Tally.
*Maddy is David’s mother. She tells Tally about the brain lesions caused by the Pretty surgery, and later develops a cure for the lesions. She is a founder of the Smoke.
*Az is David’s father and dies in an operation. As part of the Pretty Special Committee, he discovered the brain lesions that the Pretty surgery causes and suspects the lesions are intentional. He is a founder of the Smoke.
*Croy is another Smokie. He is originally from Uglyville and knows Shay. He is originally suspicious of Tally, but grows to trust her.
*The Boss: Although he is called the "Boss", he is not in charge of the Smoke (Actually, no one is); however, he is in charge of the library. Died when the Specials arrive.

===Specials===
*Dr. Cable is the head of Special Circumstances, and the one who denies Tally the operation until she finds Shay. She sends Specials to destroy the Smoke. She is described as having an aquiline nose, non-reflective gray eyes, a razor-like voice, and sharp teeth.

===Pretties===
*Peris, Tally's best friend, is three months older than Tally and thus has become a Pretty. He helps Tally decide to betray Shay. His Ugly nickname was Nose.
*Ellie Youngblood is Tally’s mother who helps Tally decide to turn in Shay. She is a Middle Pretty.
*Sol Youngblood is Tally's father who helps Tally decide to turn in Shay. He is a Middle Pretty.

==Major motifs==
===Identity===
According to critics, Uglies contains themes of identity, particularly regarding teenagers. Phillip Gough said the government of Tally’s city, which controls what happens within the operation, “removes responsibility for identity, ” creating sameness and uniformity.&lt;ref name = "Thesis Essay" &gt;{{cite journal

===Beauty===
Kristi N. Scott and M. Heather Dragoo note that another recurring theme in the “image-obsessed society,” is beauty, and its recurring relationship with individuality.&lt;ref name= "Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Huxley"&gt;{{cite journal

===Dystopian society===
A “utopia resting on ruthless suppression of individual freedom” was Amanda Craig of The Times’s description of Tally’s city.&lt;ref name= "Pretty Faces"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics identified the trend of a controlling government in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galdon Rodriguez|first=Angel|date=2014|title=Urban and Natural Spaces in Dystopian Literature Depicted as Opposed Scenarios|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ANRE/article/view/47585/44612|journal=Ángulo Recto.

===Humanity===
Various critics also found a theme of humanity within Uglies. Phillip Gough noted that Pretties and Specials (those who worked for Special Circumstances) are “posthuman” because of their operations.&lt;ref name= "Thesis Essay"/&gt; Others, including Scott and Dragoo, argued against this, claiming “the human body provides an artistic and political canvas for intentional manipulation," and that this physical transformation can be an “outlet for humanity”.&lt;ref name= "Huxley"/&gt; The novel Uglies seems to take no definite stance on it, though clearer points are shown in Pretties and Specials, the following books in the trilogy.

==Background==
When asked how he came up with the idea of ''Uglies,'' Westerfeld said, "the inspiration came from a friend whose dentist asked him to consider getting cosmetic surgery." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Scott Westerfeld|url=http://keris.typepad.com/chicklet/2008/08/interview-scott.html|publisher=Chicklish|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of a computer programmer for Univac, which meant he grew up familiar with the cutting edge of 1960s technology. Amanda Craig said that "it is his prescient perception of how such inventions will lead to absolute loss of privacy which has elicited as much fan-mail as the issue of how looks dominate our lives." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=Amanda|title=Scott Westerfeld interview: future imperfect|url=http://www.amandacraig.com/pages/childrens-book-reviews/interviews/scott-westerfeld.htm|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book shares many themes with the 1964 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Number 12 Looks Just Like You]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebooksmugglers.com/2009/08/why-havent-i-read-these-books-the-uglies-trilogy-by-scott-westerfeld.html|title=Why haven't I read these books?|publisher=The Book Smugglers|date=6 August 2009|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the books noted that he saw the episode in his childhood but had forgotten the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Westerfeld|url=http://scottwesterfeld.com/blog/?p=377fin|title=Number 12 Looks Suspiciously Familiar|date=3 January 2008|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the dedication page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel was shaped by a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Scott Westerfeld|url=http://bookyurt.com/scouting/interviews/scott-westerfeld-on-all-things-uglies/|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The novel has received mostly positive reviews. The Baroque Body praised the novel as having “creative slang, unique technical gadgets, and defining characteristics of personhood.”&lt;ref name="Huxley"/&gt; Cory Doctorow complimented its “perfect parables of adolescent life,” and stated that it is “fine science fiction for youth."&lt;ref name = Doctorow&gt;{{cite web

However, ''Publishers Weekly'' commented that Tally was a “rather passive protagonist,”&lt;ref name="Shays Story"&gt;{{cite journal

The novel sparked discussion over the use of plastic surgery to improve one's looks. The author said he has “received many letters from girls who have decided against having surgery since reading Uglies,” while others, sparked by Uglies, have started to ponder the ethics of changing your body’s appearance.&lt;ref name="Future Imperfect"/&gt;  Westerfeld has theorized that “having extreme cosmetic surgery will be like buying a $1,000 Gucci bag, an indication that you are a member of the privileged class."&lt;ref name="Future Imperfect"/&gt; Critics echo his opinion. However, Westerfeld has also stated he “wouldn’t hesitate [to use plastic surgery] if he had a kid with port-wine stain. We have all been altering our appearances ever since clothing was invented.”&lt;ref name="Future Imperfect"/&gt; Other critics have stated that while altering one's appearance with plastic surgery can be ethically debatable, the benefits of it to people who have need for it are tremendous.&lt;ref name = "Surgurey"&gt;{{cite web

There is also some moderate debate sparked by Uglies over the issue of monitoring people. The state has started to track teens through their cell phones and on occasion through dental implants.&lt;ref name="Future Imperfect"/&gt; Westerfeld feels that this will “result in a total loss of privacy,” however, others feel that this technology is necessary to properly supervise people.&lt;ref name= "Future Imperfect"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
===Film===
{{update section|date=May 2017}}
[[20th Century Fox]] and producer [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] (''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'') bought the film rights to the novel in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Vergnet''' is a [[France|French]] [[wind turbine]] manufacturer headquartered in [[Orléans]]. The company also produces [[water pump]]s installed in [[Africa]]. 

Vergnet wind turbines are small to midsize (the newest model is rated for 1MW) designed for operation in tropical countries: [[Caribbean]], [[Africa]], parts of [[Asia]] and [[South America]]. They are robust, designed to resist hurricanes (by parking the turbine close to the ground), and easy to assemble on site with self erecting components (no tall crane required) from factory-made kits.

In 2008, Vergnet got a large contract for 120 1MW turbines in [[Ethiopia]]. [http://www.vergnet.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=213&amp;Itemid=174&amp;lang=en].
