'''Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia''' defines various terms used in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]]. It has an important impact on [[Islam in Malaysia|Islam]] in [[Malaysia]] and the [[Malay people]] due to its definition of a [[Malaysian Malay|Malay person]] under clause 2.&lt;ref name="Rashid2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Faridah Abdul Rashid|title=Research on the Early Malay Doctors 1900-1957 Malaya and Singapore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNu6b6uY7PgC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2012|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4691-7243-9|pages=85–86}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took effect after 31 August 1957 ("Merdeka Day" or "Independence Day") in [[West Malaysia]], and took effect in [[Singapore]] and [[East Malaysia]] when they merged with [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] in 1963. The article no longer applies to Singapore, as it separated from Malaysia in 1965 (Singapore is also a [[secular state]]); however, it does affect the legal status of Malay Singaporeans when they enter Malaysia.

==Definition of a Malay==
The article defines a “Malay” as a person who professes the religion of Islam, habitually speaks the Malay language, conforms to Malay custom and
(a) was before Merdeka Day born in the Federation or in Singapore or born of parents one of whom was born in the Federation or in Singapore, or is on that day domiciled in the Federation or in Singapore; or
(b) is the issue of such a person;
As a result, Malay citizens who convert out of Islam are no longer considered Malay under the law. Hence, the [[Bumiputra]] privileges afforded to Malays under [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153 of the Constitution]], the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP), etc. are forfeit for such converts.

Likewise, a non-Malay Malaysian who converts to Islam can lay claim to Bumiputra privileges, provided he meets the other conditions.

'''Aurora Colony''', also called '''Aurora Mills''', was a Christian [[List of American Utopian communities|utopian communal society]] founded in 1856 by [[William Keil]] in modern-day [[Aurora, Oregon]], USA.&lt;ref name="Encyc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= Aurora|encyclopedia= The Oregon Encyclopedia|year=2017 |publisher= Portland State University and the Oregon Historical Society|location= Oregon, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At its peak in 1868, the Aurora Colony had about 600 people and {{convert|15000|acre}} of land. The colony, along with Keil's previously established Bethel colony, was formally dissolved in 1883.&lt;ref name="Settlement"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Crutchfield|first1=James A. |last2=Moutlon |first2=Candy| last3= Del Bene|first3= Terry |date=2011 |title=The Settlement of America: An Encyclopedia of Westward Expansion from Jamestown to the Closing of the Frontier |url= https://books.google.es/books?id=lGusBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;ots=L4qaEI2v_q&amp;dq=aurora%20colony%20william%20kiel&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q=aurora&amp;f=false|location= New York, USA | publisher=M.E.

==Background==
William Keil was a Prussian-born tailor who moved to the United States with his wife in the 1830s. He opened open a tailor shop in [[New York City]], and studied pharmacology. He then moved to [[Pennsylvania]] and set up a drugstore and sold medicines. Around this time, he began calling himself "Dr. Keil."&lt;ref name="Sreen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sreenivasan|first=Jyotsna |date= |title=Utopias in American History |url= https://books.google.es/books?id=RnrBO-O_HvcC&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;ots=OY1-izn59T&amp;dq=aurora%20colony%20william%20kiel&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q=aurora%20colony%20william%20kiel&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, Keil became a preacher after attending a [[Methodist]] revival meeting. In Pennsylvania, he began to amass followers, including members of [[George Rapp]]'s Economy Colony. In 1844 he and his followers established the Bethel community in Missouri, which at its peak had 650 members.

==Founding==
Though Keil's community in [[Missouri]] was successful and nearly self-sufficient, he decided to expand his colony to the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States. In 1853, he sent a scout party to find a location for "A Second Eden."&lt;ref name="novel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohs.org/research-and-library/oregon-historical-quarterly/upload/110_2-Kopp-Novel-Views.pdf |title=Novel Views of the Aurora Colony |last= Kopp|first=James J. |date= 2009|website=ohs.org |publisher= Oregon Historical Society|access-date= 30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1855, Keil and several members of his Bethel colony in Missouri began the wagon journey to [[Washington Territory]]. Four days before they set out, Keil's son Willy died of [[malaria]]. Not wanting to leave his son behind, Keil put the body in a wooden, lead-lined coffin and covered it with Whiskey from the Bethel Distillery to preserve it.

The group first settled in [[Willapa Bay]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. After spending the Winter there, Keil decided the land was not suitable for a self-sufficient agricultural community and began searching for a new location. In 1856 he purchased land and a functioning mill south of [[Oregon City]]. He named the Colony Aurora Mills after his daughter, Aurora.&lt;ref name="Settlement" /&gt; The original colony contained 250 members who had left the Bethel Colony with Keil.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt;

==Colonial life==
The Aurora Colony built homes, schools, business, mills, and a hotel. The colony also created a fruit orchard and produced hand-made goods. The Oregon &amp; California Railway line expanded to pass through Aurora in 1870, which brought additional business to the colony. The train stopped four times a day for meals in its hotel.&lt;ref name="Settlement" /&gt;

The Aurora Colony Band became well known on the West Coast, and traveled throughout the region to perform music.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt;

The charismatic Keil was the sole leader of the group. As the spiritual leader, he installed his own form of [[Christianity]] in the community. Keil preached a simple ideal about brotherhood and love and taught a "No title but Christian" and "No rules but the Bible" form of Christianity, maintaining that all existing religions were human creations.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

As in many other utopian communities, its founder held special privileges. He instated confession in order to maintain the member's humility, yet was immune from taking part in confession himself. He was also exempt from taking part in manual labor. Keil lived in a large house in the colony, called "Gross Haus"  (German for Big House).&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt;

As part of keeping order and maintaining his place in the community, Keil utilized mortification functions, calling out deviants for their transgressions during public meetings.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moss Kanter  |first= Rosabeth|date= 1972|title= Commitment and Community: Communes and Utopias in Sociological Perspective |url= https://books.google.es/books?id=HNkvPqXMbPwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=aurora%20colony%20wikipedia&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=aurora&amp;f=false|location= Cambridge, Massachusettes|publisher=Harvard University Press |pages= 4, 100, 107, 114, |isbn=0-674-14576-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smallpox outbreak===
In 1862, a member of the colony took care of an individual outside the colony who had [[smallpox]] and brought it back to the Aurora Colony. As a result, many in Aurora contracted the disease and many died. Four of Keil's children died in the outbreak, including his daughter Aurora, the colony's namesake.&lt;ref name="Sreen" /&gt;

==Dissolution of the colony==
Keil had held all the communal property in his name. In 1872, after the death of his only remaining daughter, Keil began to transfer ownership of colony land to individual families in the community and intended to transfer more later. However, by the time he died suddenly on December 30, 1877, he had not made any additional transfers.&lt;ref name="Sreen" /&gt;

It was decided to dissolve the two colonies, and the dissolution was formally declared on January 22, 1883. The land was later incorporated and became the modern-day city of Aurora, Oregon.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1966 the Old Aurora Colony Museum was established, dedicated to maintaining the history of the colony. In 1974, twenty sites in Aurora were added to the National Register of Historical Places.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt;

===In media===
Author [[Jane Kirkpatrick]] wrote a trilogy of novels about the experience of Emma Wagner Giesy, the only female member of Keil's scout party to find a location for a new colony in the [[Pacific Northwest]] that eventually became the Aurora Colony. The three novels in Kirkpatrick's series are "A Clearing in the Wild" (2006), "A Tendering In the Storm" (2007), and "Mending at the Edge" (2008).

'''Beatriz Nascimento''' (12 July 1942-28 January 1995) was an [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] academic and activist. She was an influential participant of the [[Black Movement of Brazil]] from its beginnings in the 1960s until her death. Through her academic research, she evaluated the importance of ''[[quilombos]]'' as autonomous spaces for people of African descent during the colonial period and challenged the political environment and racial policies of the government toward Afro-Brazilians. Her scholarship on the invisibility of black women, and particularly non-Anglo women of the [[African diaspora]] had an international impact on research regarding the complexities of the black experience and lack of attention focused on Afro-Latinas in transnational feminism. 

==Early life==
Maria Beatriz do Nascimento was born on 12 July 1942 in [[Aracaju]], [[Sergipe]], Brazil to Rubina Pereira Nascimento and Francisco Xavier do Nascimento. Her father was a mason and her mother raised their ten children. Nascimento was their eighth child. Around 1949, the family migrated south and settled in the [[Cordovil]] neighborhood of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. After completing her secondary schooling, she enrolled at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] (UFRJ), graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 1971. During her schooling, she became involved in the [[Black Movement of Brazil]] ({{lang-pt|Movimento Negro}}). Beginning as a student organizer, Nascimento was a co-founder of several associations and attended numerous conferences and public forum discussions on blackness and racial politics.{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

==Career==
Upon graduating, Nascimento began working as an intern at the [[Brazilian National Archives]] and continued her education, studying at the [[Fluminense Federal University]] (UFF). She married Jose do Rosario Freitas Gomes and the couple subsequently had a daughter, Bethânia Gomes. While at UFF, she was involved in the founding of the Andre Rebouças Working Group, which had a significant effect on the resurgence of black identity and the politicization of race under the [[Brazilian military government]] from 1974 to 1985.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} Her research during this period centered on [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies in three of the surviving  ''[[quilombos|quilombo communities]]'' (African-Brazilian Maroon societies) in [[Minas Gerais]]. Conducting interviews and evaluating archival materials, Nascimento came to recognize ''quilombos'' as "autonomous black spaces of liberation".{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

In 1977, Nascimento was one of the speakers at the ''Quinzena do Negro'' (Black Fortnight), organized by Eduardo Oliveira e Oliveira at the [[University of São Paulo]].{{sfn|Smith|2016}}{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=11}} The conference was pivotal in Nascimento's development, and was where she secured her place as an anchor in the Black Movement,{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=11}} through her introduction of theoretical ideas about the significance of ''quilombos'' for [[Afro-Brazilians]] and the intersection of race and gender in the political environment for black women in Brazil. She also strongly criticized the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]] for its racist policies. In 1978, she joined the [[Movimento Negro Unificado Contra a Discriminação Racial]] (Unified Black Movement, or MNU) and over the next decade worked with Raquel Gerber, a filmmaker, on a documentary which would become one of her most important legacies.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} 

Nascimento completed her graduate studies at UFF in 1981 and began a master's degree program at UFRJ studying communications with {{ill|Muniz Sodré|es}}, a noted Brazilian sociologist and journalist.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} She taught history at the Rome State School ({{lang-pt|Colégio Estadual Roma}}), in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]]{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=27}}{{sfn|Torres|1995}} and published articles in various newspapers and journals like ''Estudos Afro-Asiáticos'' (Afro-Asian Studies), ''[[Folha de São Paulo]]'', ''Revista Cultura Vozes'' (Culture Voices Magazine), and ''Revista do Patrimônio Histórico'' (Historical Patrimony Magazine), while serving on the editorial board of ''Boletim do Centenário da Abolição e República'' (Centennial Bulletin of Abolition and the Republic).{{sfn|Ratts|2006|pp=27–28}} In 1989, Nascimento and Gerber released ''[[Ori (film)|Ori]]'',{{sfn|Smith|2016}} their documentary about the relationship between Africa and Brazil and the Black Movement in the country.{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=28}}

==Death and legacy==
Nascimento was murdered on 28 January 1995 during a domestic dispute between Aurea and Antônio Jorge Amorim Viana, known as Danone.{{sfn|Torres|1995}} The murderer, Danone, believed that Nascimento had counseled his wife, Aurea to leave him because of their violent relationship.{{sfn|Torres|1995}}{{sfn|Gramado|1995}} At the time of her death Nascimento and Gomes had separated, and she was in relationship with Roberto Rosemburg, her common law spouse.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} She was buried on 30 January 1995 at the [[Cemitério de São João Batista]].{{sfn|Gramado|1995}} Nascimento impacted international scholarship on black women, calling into question their invisibility because of patriarchy and colonialism, but also because of the over-emphasis on the English-speaking diaspora among academics{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=72}} and the language barriers to intellectual discourse from non-Anglo scholars.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=74}} Nascimento caused feminist scholars to recognize the need for expanding research to encompass Afro-Latinas for a deeper understanding of the complexities impacting the African diaspora.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=85}} Aléx Ratts published a biography on Nascimento and her career, ''Eu Sou Atlântica'' in 2007.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=72}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2220">'''Bituah Leumi''' ({{lang-he|המוסד לביטוח לאומי}}, ''HaMossad LeVituach Leumi'', lit. "The National Insurance Institute") is [[Israel]]'s national [[social security]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btl.gov.il/English%20homepage/Pages/default.aspx Bituah Leumi homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; It was established on 1 April 1954.

All Israeli citizens over the age of 18 are obligated to pay monthly Bituach Leumi insurance with the exception of [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldiers, National Service volunteers and students enrolled in vocational training courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jr.co.il/aliyah/bituach-leumi.htm 7 Tips on Dealing With Bituah Leumi]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bituah Leumi pays disability pensions to individuals who have lost the ability to earn a living due to medical disability, individuals whose earning capacity has dropped by at least 50%, and homemakers whose ability to perform household tasks has decreased by at least 50%. The monthly pension rate is determined by the degree of disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patients-rights.org/index.aspx?id=4365 National Insurance Pensions for the Ill and Disabled]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''candidate''', or '''nominee''', is the prospective recipient of an [[award]] or [[Honour|honor]], or a person seeking or being considered for some kind of position; for example:
* to be [[election|elected]] to an [[official|office]] — in this case a [[Preselection|candidate selection]] procedure occurs.
* to receive membership in a  [[group (sociology)|group]]

"[[Nomination]]" is part of the process of selecting a candidate for either election to an [[office]] by a political party,&lt;ref name=Definition&gt;''Judicial and Statutory Definitions of Words and Phrases,'' Volume 1, Edition 2, West Publishing Company, 1914, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA558&amp;dq=nominee+candidate+definitions+of+words&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U_enT8qBPOO16AGr3e2ZBA&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nominee%20candidate%20definitions%20of%20words&amp;f=false p. 588] [https://books.google.com/books?id=MXE8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA618&amp;dq=nominee+candidate+definitions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-venT57fF6mX6QHylqGoBA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nominee%20candidate%20definitions&amp;f=false p. 618]&lt;/ref&gt; or the bestowing of an honor or award. This person is called a "nominee",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nominee|title=Nominee|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; though nominee often is used interchangeably with "candidate". A presumptive nominee is a person or organization believes that the nomination is inevitable or likely. The act of being a candidate in a race for either a party nomination or for electoral office is called a "candidacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/candidacy?show=0&amp;t=1342024814|title=Candidacy|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumptive candidate may be used to describe someone who is predicted to be a formal candidate.

''"Candidate"'' is a derivative of the [[Latin]] ''"[[wikt:candidus#Latin|candidus]]"'' (shining [[white]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/candidate|title=Candidate|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome]], people running for political office would usually wear [[toga]]s chalked and bleached to be bright white at [[public speaking|speeches]], [[debate]]s, [[Political convention|conventions]], and other public [[ceremony|functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=candidate&amp;searchmode=none|title=Candidate|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Candidates in elections==
In the context of elections for [[public office]] in a representational partisan democracy, a candidate who has been selected by a [[political party]] is normally said to be the nominee of that party.  The party's selection (that is, the nomination) is typically accomplished either based on one or more [[primary election]]s according to the rules of the party and any applicable election [[law]]s.&lt;ref name=Definition/&gt;

Candidates are called "[[incumbent]]s" if they are already serving in the office for which they are seeking re-election, or "challengers", if they are seeking to replace an incumbent.      

In the context of elections for public office in a [[direct democracy]], a candidate can be nominated by any eligible person—and if parliamentary procedures are used, the nomination has to be seconded, i.e., receive agreement from a second person.

In some non-partisan representative systems (e.g., administrative elections of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]), no nominations (or campaigning, electioneering, etc.) take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting—with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement—in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons in their area, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).

===''Spitzenkandidat''===
{{main|President of the European Commission#Spitzenkandidat}}
In [[German politics]], the person at the head of an [[electoral list]] is called the ''Spitzenkandidat'' ("lead candidate"). By convention, this means that this person (normally the [[party leader]]) will be elected to lead the government if their party wins the election. 

In 2014, the major groups represented in the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Council]] agreed to apply this process to determine the next [[President of the European Commission]], as a way of the Council "taking account of the results of the European Parliament election" as required by the Union treaties. This led to the appointment and confirmation of [[Jean-Claude Juncker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commission’s Spitzenkandidat process at risk|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/spitzenkandidat-jean-claude-juncker-race-with-no-rules-eu-leaders-brace-for-clash-over-2019-elections/|accessdate=14 February 2018|work=POLITICO|date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presumptive candidate===
The term "presumptive candidate" is sometimes used to describe a person who has not officially become a candidate but is considered very likely to in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">A '''Chauka''' system is a method for [[Rainwater harvesting|harvesting rainwater]], typically used in [[arid]] areas that are subject to [[monsoon]] rains.  Chauka comes from the [[Hindi]] word for square.

The system consists of square shaped [[levee|embankments]].  On three sides there are nine inch walls and one side is left open to allow rainwater to fill the structure.  As one structure fills, then the overflow fills the next chauka and so on.  Retaining the rainwater in this way helps prevent [[soil erosion]] and recharges the surface water enabling various grasses to thrive.  This has the effect of holding the soil together and, as the chauka system is used mostly on common land, provides [[grazing]] areas for cow and goat herds. For this to be effective it is combined with the planting of grass seeds and trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =Mari  | title =The Chauka system: An innovative method of water harvesting | work =Gather and Grow: Resilience | publisher = gatherandgrow.org | date =2013-07-25 | url = http://gatherandgrow.org/2013/07/25/the-chauka-system-an-innovative-method-of-water-harvesting/|accessdate = 2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system is widely in use in the Dudu block of [[Jaipur district]] in [[Rajasthan]], India.  Here a local village development organisation [[GVNML]], working in the area of Natural Resource Management, has been responsible for its uptake among local villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Chauka System | work =rainwaterharvesting.org: technology: rural: improvised | publisher =Centre for Science and Environment | url = http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/rural/Improvised.htm|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The chauka magic|journal=Down To Earth|publisher=Society for Environmental Communications|date =September 30, 1999|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/node/20492?quicktabs_1=0|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cisgender''' (often abbreviated to simply '''cis''') is a term for people whose [[gender identity]] matches the [[Sex assignment|sex that they were assigned]] at birth. ''Cisgender'' may also be defined as those who have "a gender identity or perform a gender role society considers appropriate for one's sex".&lt;ref&gt;Crethar, H. C. &amp; Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire &amp; C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor's companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. {{ISBN|0-8058-5684-6}}. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of the term ''[[transgender]]''.&lt;ref name="Schilt"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schilt | last2 = Westbrook| first1 = Kristen| first2 = Laurel | title = Doing Gender, Doing Heteronormativity: 'Gender Normals,' Transgender People, and the Social Maintenance of Heterosexuality| journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]]| volume = 23|issue = 4| pages = 440–464 [461]|doi =10.1177/0891243209340034|date = August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/cisgenders-linguistic-uphill-battle/380342/|title=Will the Word "Cisgender" Ever Go Mainstream?|last=Blank|first=Paula|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related terms include [[cissexism]] and cisnormativity.

== Etymology and terminology ==

German [[sexology|sexologist]] [[Volkmar Sigusch]] used the [[neologism]] ''cissexual'' (''zissexuell'' in German) in a peer-reviewed publication. In his 1998 essay "The Neosexual Revolution", he cites his two-part 1991 article "Die Transsexuellen und unser nosomorpher Blick" ("Transsexuals and our nosomorphic view") as the origin of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Sigusch| first = Volkmar| authorlink = Volkmar Sigusch| title = The Neosexual Revolution| journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior| volume = 27| pages = 331–359| date = February 1998| issue = 4| doi = 10.1023/A:1018715525493| pmid = 9681118}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used the term in the title of a 1995 article, "Transsexueller Wunsch und zissexuelle Abwehr" (or: "Transsexual desire and cissexual defense").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Sigusch| first = Volkmar| authorlink = Volkmar Sigusch| title = Transsexueller Wunsch und zissexuelle Abwehr| journal = Psyche| volume = 49| pages = 811–837| year = 1995| pmid = 7480808|issue= 9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cisgender'' has its origin in the [[Latin]]-derived prefix ''[[wikt:cis-|cis-]]'', meaning "on this side of", which means the opposite of ''[[wikt:trans-|trans-]]'', meaning "across from" or "on the other side of". This usage can be seen in the [[cis–trans isomerism|cis–trans distinction]] in chemistry, the cis–trans or [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] test in genetics, in [[Ciscaucasia]] (from the Russian perspective), in the ancient Roman term [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (i.e., "[[Gaul]] on this side of the [[Alps]]"), and more recently, [[Cisjordan]], as distinguished from [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]]. In the case of gender, ''cis-'' describes the alignment of gender identity with assigned sex.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cisgender | title=Definition of cisgender | publisher=Merriam Webster | accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists Kristen Schilt and Laurel Westbrook define ''cisgender'' as a label for "individuals who have a match between the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity".&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt; A number of derivatives of the terms ''cisgender'' and ''cissexual'' include ''cis male'' for "male assigned male at birth", ''cis female'' for "female assigned female at birth", analogously ''cis man'' and ''cis woman'',&lt;ref name=advo&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.advocate.com/transgender/2015/07/31/true-meaning-word-cisgender | title=The true meaning of the word 'cisgender' |first=Sunnivie|last=Brydum|date=July 31, 2015| work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[cissexism]]'' and ''[[cissexual assumption]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|last = Serano|first = Julia|publisher = Seal Press|year = 2007|isbn = 1580051545|location = Berkeley|pages = 164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, one study published in the ''[[Journal of the International AIDS Society]]'' used the term ''cisnormativity'', akin to [[sexual diversity]] studies' ''[[heteronormativity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Logie|first1= Carmen|last2= James|first2= Lana|last3= Tharao|first3= Wangari|last4= Loutfy|first4= Mona|year= 2012|title= ''We don't exist'': a qualitative study of marginalization experienced by HIV-positive lesbian, bisexual, queer and transgender women in Toronto, Canada|journal= Journal of the International AIDS Society|volume= 15|issue= 2|url= http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/17392|accessdate=January 17, 2013|doi=10.7448/ias.15.2.17392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ou Jin Lee|first1= Edward|last2= Brotman|first2= Shari|year= 2011|title= Identity, Refugeeness, Belonging: Experiences of Sexual Minority Refugees in Canada|journal= Canadian Review of Sociology|volume= 48|issue= 3|pages= 241–274|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01265.x/abstract;jsessionid=3683049B898CB3729C2991069982412B.d03t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false|doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01265.x|pmid= 22214042}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related adjective is ''gender-normative'' because, as Eli R. Green writes, "'cisgendered' is used [instead of the more popular 'gender normative']&lt;!--PLEASE PRESERVE this bracketed text – this is an exact quotation--&gt; to refer to people who do not identify with a gender diverse experience, without enforcing existence of a normative gender expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Green| first1 = Eli R.| title = Debating Trans Inclusion in the Feminist Movement: A Trans-Positive Analysis| journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies| volume = 10| issue = 1/2| pages = 231–248 [247]| year = 2006| doi=10.1300/j155v10n01_12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, ''cisgender'' is preferable because, unlike the term ''gender-normative'', it does not imply that [[transgender]] identities are abnormal.

[[Julia Serano]] has defined ''cissexual'' as "people who are not [[transsexual]] and who have only ever experienced their mental and physical sexes as being aligned", while ''cisgender'' is a slightly narrower term for those who do not identify as transgender (a larger cultural category than the more clinical transsexual).&lt;ref name="Serano"&gt;{{cite book |title= Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity|last= Serano|first= Julia|year= 2007|publisher= Seal Press|isbn= 978-1-58005-154-5|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Jessica Cadwallader, ''cissexual'' is "a way of drawing attention to the unmarked [[norm (sociology)|norm]], against which [[transgender|trans]] is identified, in which a person feels that their [[gender identity]] matches their body/sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Sullivan | last2 = Murray| first1 = Nikki | first2 = Samantha| title = Somatechnics: queering the technologisation of bodies| publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]]| location = Surrey, England| year = 2009| page = 17| isbn = 0-7546-7530-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''cisgender'' and ''cissexual'' were used in a 2006 article in the ''Journal of Lesbian Studies''&lt;ref&gt;Green, Eli R. (2006). "Debating Trans Inclusion in the Feminist Movement: A Trans-Positive Analysis," ''Journal of Lesbian Studies''. Volume: 10 Issue: 1/2. pp. 231−248.

Serano also uses the related term ''cissexism'', "which is the belief that transsexuals' identified genders are inferior to, or less authentic than, those of cissexuals".&lt;ref&gt;Serano (2007) also defines cisgender as synonymous with "non-transgender" and cissexual with "non-transsexual" (p. 33).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the term ''cisgender [[social privilege|privilege]]'' appeared in academic literature, defined as the "set of unearned advantages that individuals who identify as the gender they were assigned at birth accrue solely due to having a cisgender identity".&lt;ref&gt;Walls, N.

== Critiques ==

=== From feminism and gender studies ===

Krista Scott-Dixon wrote in 2009: "I prefer the term non-trans to other options such as cissexual/cisgendered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Scott-Dixon| first = Krista| authorlink = Krista Scott-Dixon| title = Public health, private parts: A feminist public-health approach to trans issues| journal = Hypatia| doi = 10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01044.x| volume = 24| issue = 3| pages = 33–55| year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She holds this view because she believes the term "non-trans" is clearer to average people and will help normalize transgender individuals.

Women's and Gender Studies scholar Mimi Marinucci writes that some consider the "cisgender–transgender" binary to be just as dangerous or self-defeating as the [[gender binary|masculine–feminine gender binary]], because it lumps together people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) arbitrarily and over-simplistically with a [[heteronormative]] class of people as opposed to with transgender people. Characterizing LGB individuals together with heterosexual, non-trans people may problematically suggest that LGB individuals, unlike transgender individuals, "experience no mismatch between their own gender identity and [[gender expression]] and cultural expectations regarding gender identity and expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marinucci|first=Mimi|publisher=Zed Books|year=2010|title=Feminism is Queer: The Intimate Connection between Queer and Feminist Theory|pages=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glosswitch wrote in the British magazine the ''[[New Statesman]]'' that if an essential gender binary does not exist, then the idea that one's identity matches their gender is maintaining a stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2014/02/i-dont-feel-i-match-my-gender-so-what-does-it-mean-be-called-cis|title=I don't feel I "match" my gender, so what does it mean to be called cis?|website=www.newstatesman.com|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S/he also critiques the fact that the term "sex assigned at birth" is used in one of cisgender's definitions without noting that babies are assigned male or female regardless of intersex status in most of the world, stating that doing so obfuscates the birth of intersex babies and frames gender identity within a binary male/female sex model that fails to account for both the existence of natally congruent gender non-conforming gender identities, and gender-based discrimination against intersex people based on natal sex characteristics rather than on gender identity or expression, such as "normalizing" infant genital surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hidaviloria.com/caught-in-the-gender-binary-blind-spot-intersex-erasure-in-cisgender-rhetoric/ Caught in the Gender Binary Blind Spot: Intersex Erasure in Cisgender Rhetoric], [[Hida Viloria]], August 18, 2014.

The '''Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures''' ('''CVE''') system provides a reference-method for publicly known [[information security|information-security]] [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] and exposures. The [[National Cybersecurity FFRDC]], operated by the [[Mitre Corporation]], maintains the system, with funding from the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= CVE – Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures |publisher= [[Mitre Corporation]] |date= 2007-07-03 |url= https://cve.mitre.org/ |accessdate= 2009-06-18 |quote= CVE is sponsored by the National Cyber Security Division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- From WP:MOSTM: "Follow standard English text formatting and capitalization rules, regardless of the preference of trademark owners." DO NOT change Mitre back to all-caps. --&gt;

The [[Security Content Automation Protocol]] uses CVE, and CVE IDs are listed on MITRE's system&lt;ref name="MITRE's System"&gt;[https://cve.mitre.org cve.mitre.org]. CVE® International in scope and free for public use, CVE is a dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the US [[National Vulnerability Database]].

=={{Anchor|IDENTIFIERS}}CVE identifiers==
MITRE Corporation's documentation defines CVE Identifiers (also called "CVE names", "CVE numbers", "CVE-IDs", and "CVEs") as unique, common identifiers for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities in publicly released software packages. Historically, CVE identifiers had a status of "candidate" ("CAN-") and could then be promoted to entries ("CVE-"), however this practice was ended some time ago and all identifiers are now assigned as CVEs. The assignment of a CVE number is not a guarantee that it will become an official CVE entry (e.g. a CVE may be improperly assigned to an issue which is not a security vulnerability, or which duplicates an existing entry).

CVEs are assigned by a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA);&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title= CVE - CVE Numbering Authorities |publisher= [[Mitre Corporation]] |date= 2015-02-01 |url= https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html |accessdate= 2015-11-15}}
&lt;/ref&gt; there are three primary types of CVE number assignments:

# The [[Mitre Corporation]] functions as Editor and Primary CNA
# Various CNAs assign CVE numbers for their own products (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat, etc.)
# A third-party coordinator such as [[CERT Coordination Center]] may assign CVE numbers for products not covered by other CNAs

When investigating a vulnerability or potential vulnerability it helps to acquire a CVE number early on. CVE numbers may not appear in the MITRE or NVD CVE databases for some time (days, weeks, months or potentially years) due to issues that are embargoed (the CVE number has been assigned but the issue has not been made public), or in cases where the entry is not researched and written up by MITRE due to resource issues. The benefit of early CVE candidacy is that all future correspondence can refer to the CVE number. Information on getting CVE identifiers for issues with open source projects is available from [[Red Hat]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title= CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO |publisher= [[Red Hat Inc.]] |date= 2012-06-18 |url= https://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html |accessdate= 2013-07-06
 |quote= There are several ways to make a request depending on what your requirements are:
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

CVEs are for software that has been publicly released; this can include betas and other pre-release versions if they are widely used. Commercial software is included in the "publicly released" category, however custom-built software that is not distributed would generally not be given a CVE. Additionally services (e.g. a Web-based email provider) are not assigned CVEs for vulnerabilities found in the service (e.g. an XSS vulnerability) unless the issue exists in an underlying software product that is publicly distributed.

==CVE data fields==
The CVE database contains several fields:

===Description===
This is a standardized text description of the issue(s). One common entry is:

 ** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided. 

This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500), the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time. Until the CVE is assigned AND Mitre is made aware of it (i.e., the embargo passes and the issue is made public), AND Mitre has researched the issue and written a description of it, entries will show up as "**RESERVED **".

===References===
This is a list of URLs and other information (such as vendor advisory numbers) for this issue.

===Date entry created===
This is the date the entry was created. For CVEs assigned directly by Mitre, this is the date Mitre created the CVE entry. For CVEs assigned by CNAs (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat, etc.) this is also the date the entry was create by Mitre, not by the CNA. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500) the entry date would be when that CVE is assigned to the CNA. The CVE itself may not be used for days, weeks, months or even possibly years (e.g. Red Hat maintains blocks of CVEs for older security issues in open-source software that were not assigned CVEs yet).

===Obsolete fields===
The following fields were previously used in older CVE records, but are no longer used.

* Phase: The phase the CVE is in (e.g. CAN, CVE).
* Votes: Previously board members would vote yea or nay on whether or not the CAN should be accepted and turned into a CVE. 
* Comments: Comments on the issue. 
* Proposed: When the issue was first proposed.

==Changes to syntax==
In order to support CVE ID's beyond CVE-YEAR-9999 (aka the CVE10k problem) a change was made to the CVE syntax in 2014 and took effect on Jan 13, 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/syntaxchange.html |website=cve.mitre.org |date=September 13, 2016 &lt;!--Last Updated or Reviewed--&gt; |title=CVE - CVE ID Syntax Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new CVE-ID syntax is variable length and includes:

CVE prefix + Year + Arbitrary Digits

NOTE: The variable length arbitrary digits will begin at four (4) fixed digits and expand with arbitrary digits only when needed in a calendar year, for example, CVE-YYYY-NNNN and if needed CVE-YYYY-NNNNN, CVE-YYYY-NNNNNN, and so on. This also means there will be no changes needed to previously assigned CVE-IDs, which all include a minimum of 4 digits.

==CVE SPLIT and MERGE==
CVE attempts to assign one CVE per security issue, however in many cases this would lead to an extremely large number of CVEs (e.g. where several dozen cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are found in a PHP application due to lack of use of htmlspecialchars() or the insecure creation of files in /tmp). To deal with this there are guidelines (subject to change) that cover the splitting and merging of issues into distinct CVE numbers. As a general guideline one should first consider issues to be merged, then issues should be split by the type of vulnerability (e.g. [[buffer overflow]] vs. [[stack overflow]]), then by the software version affected (e.g. if one issue affects version 1.3.4 through 2.5.4 and the other affects 1.3.4 through 2.5.8 they would be SPLIT) and then by the reporter of the issue (e.g. Alice reports one issue and Bob reports another issue the issues would be SPLIT into separate CVE numbers). Another example is Alice reports a /tmp file creation vulnerability in version 1.2.3 and earlier of ExampleSoft web browser, in addition to this issue several other /tmp file creation issues are found, in some cases this may be considered as two reporters (and thus SPLIT into two separate CVEs, or if Alice works for ExampleSoft and an ExampleSoft internal team finds the rest it may be MERGE'ed into a single CVE). Conversely issues can be merged, e.g. if Bob finds 145 XSS vulnerabilities in ExamplePlugin for ExampleFrameWork regardless of the versions affected and so on they may be merged into a single CVE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/cd_abstraction.html CVE Abstraction Content Decisions: Rationale and Application]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search CVE identifiers==
The Mitre CVE database can be searched at the [https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html CVE List Search], and the NVD CVE database can be searched at [https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search Search CVE and CCE Vulnerability Database].

==CVE usage==
CVE identifiers are intended for use with respect to identifying vulnerabilities:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a dictionary of common names (i.e., CVE Identifiers) for publicly known information security vulnerabilities. CVE’s common identifiers make it easier to share data across separate network security databases and tools, and provide a baseline for evaluating the coverage of an organization’s security tools. If a report from one of your security tools incorporates CVE Identifiers, you may then quickly and accurately access fix information in one or more separate CVE-compatible databases to remediate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= CVE - About CVE|url= https://cve.mitre.org/about/|website= cve.mitre.org|accessdate= 2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Users who have been assigned a CVE identifier for a vulnerability are encouraged to ensure that they place the identifier in any related security reports, web pages, emails, and so on.

In  [[Marxist philosophy]], '''cultural hegemony''' is the [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] of a culturally diverse society by the [[ruling class]] who manipulate the culture of that society—the [[belief]]s, [[explanation]]s, [[perception]]s, [[Value system|values]], and [[mores]]—so that their imposed, ruling-class [[worldview]] becomes the accepted cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]; the universally valid [[dominant ideology]], which justifies the social, political, and economic ''[[status quo]]'' as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for everyone, rather than as artificial [[Social constructionism|social constructs]] that benefit only the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan; Trombley, Stephen, Editors (1999), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, pp. 387–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TheColumbia"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994), p. 1215.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and in [[sociology]], the term ''cultural hegemony'' has denotations and connotations derived from the Ancient Greek word ''ἡγεμονία (hegemonia)'' indicating leadership and rule. In politics, [[hegemony]] is the geopolitical method of indirect [[Empire|imperial]] dominance, with which the ''hegemon'' (leader state) rules subordinate states, by the threat of intervention, an implied means of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], rather than by direct military force, that is, [[invasion]], [[Military occupation|occupation]], and [[annexation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross Hassig, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest'' (1994), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Etymology===
The etymologic and historical evolution of the Greek word ''ἡγεμονία'', and of its denotations, has proceeded thus:

* In [[Ancient Greece]] (8th c. BC – AD 6th c.), ''ἡγεμονία'' (leadership) denoted the politico–military dominance of a [[city-state]] upon other city-states, as in the [[League of Corinth|Hellenic League]] (338 BC), a [[federation]] of Greek city–states, established by King [[Philip II of Macedon]], to facilitate his access to and use of the Greek militaries against the [[Persian empire]].&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;
* In the 19th century, ''hegemony'' (rule) denoted the [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] and cultural predominance of one country upon other countries, as in the [[European colonialism]] imposed upon the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia.{{Sfn | Bullock | Trombley | 1999 | pp = 387–88}}
* In the 20th century, the political-science denotation of ''hegemony'' (dominance) expanded to include [[cultural imperialism]]; the cultural domination, by a [[ruling class]], of a socially [[Social stratification|stratified]] society. That by manipulating the [[dominant ideology]] (cultural values and mores) of the society, the ruling class can intellectually dominate the other social classes with an imposed [[worldview]] (''Weltanschauung'') that ideologically justifies the social, political, and economic ''status quo'' of the society as if it were a natural and normal, inevitable and perpetual state of affairs that always has been so.&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Upton, William A. Kretzschmar, Rafal Konopka: ''Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English''. Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.flagrancy.net/timeline.html|title=US Hegemony|publisher=Flagrancy|contribution = Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] proposed that the [[economic recession]]s and practical contradictions of a capitalist economy would provoke the [[working class]] to [[proletarian revolution]], depose [[capitalism]], restructure social institutions (economic, political, social) per the rational models of [[socialism]], and thus begin the transition to a [[communist]] society.  Therefore, the [[dialectics|dialectical]] changes to the functioning of the [[economy]] of a society determine its social [[Base and superstructure|superstructures]] (culture and politics).

To that end, Antonio Gramsci proposed a ''strategic distinction'', between a War of Position and a War of Manœuvre. The war of position is an intellectual and cultural struggle wherein the [[anti-capitalist]] revolutionary creates a [[proletarian culture]] whose native value system counters the cultural hegemony of the [[bourgeoisie]]. The proletarian culture will increase [[class consciousness]], teach [[revolution]]ary theory and historical analysis, and thus propagate further revolutionary organisation among the social classes. On winning the war of position, socialist leaders would then have the necessary political power and popular support to begin the political [[maneuver warfare|manœuvre warfare]] of [[revolutionary socialism]].

The initial, theoretical application of cultural domination was as a Marxist analysis of "economic class" ([[base and superstructure]]), which Antonio Gramsci developed to comprehend "social class"; hence, cultural hegemony proposes that the prevailing cultural norms of a society, which are imposed by the ruling class ([[bourgeoisie|bourgeois cultural hegemony]]), must not be perceived as natural and inevitable, but must be recognized as artificial [[social construct]]s ([[institutions]], [[convention (norm)|practices]], [[beliefs]], et cetera) that must be investigated to discover their philosophic roots as instruments of social-class domination. That such praxis of knowledge is indispensable for the intellectual and political [[liberty|liberation]] of the [[proletariat]], so that workers and peasants, the people of town and country, can create their own [[working-class culture]], which specifically addresses their social and economic needs as social classes.

In a society, cultural hegemony is neither monolithic intellectual praxis, nor a unified system of values, but a complex of [[Social stratification|stratified]] [[social structure]]s, wherein each social and economic class has a social purpose and an internal class-logic that allows its members to behave in a way that is particular and different from the behaviours of the members of other social classes, whilst co-existing with them as constituents of the society.

As a result of their different social purposes, the classes will be able to coalesce into a [[society]] with a greater social mission. When a man, a woman, or a child perceives the social structures of bourgeois cultural hegemony, personal [[common sense]] performs a dual, structural role (private and public) whereby the individual person applies common sense to cope with daily life, which explains (to himself and to herself) the small segment of the [[social order]] stratum that each experiences as the ''status quo'' of life in society; "the way things are". Publicly, the emergence of the perceptual limitations of personal common sense inhibit the individual person’s perception of the greater nature of the systematic socio-economic [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] made possible by cultural hegemony. Because of the discrepancy in perceiving the ''status quo''—the socio-economic hierarchy of bourgeois culture—most men and women concern themselves with their immediate (private) personal concerns, rather than with distant (public) concerns, and so do not think about and question the fundamental sources of their socio-economic [[oppression]], and its discontents, social, personal, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/019685998601000203 |format= [[PDF]] |title= The Problem of Ideology — Marxism without Guarantees |year= 1986 |first= Stuart |last= Hall |authorlink= Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) |journal= Journal of Communication Inquiry |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 28–44 |url= http://www.ram-wan.net/restrepo/hall/The%20problem%20of%20ideology.pdf }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of cultural hegemony are perceptible at the personal level; although each person in a society lives a meaningful life in his and her social class, to him and to her, the discrete social classes might appear to have little in common with the private life of the individual man and woman. Yet, when perceived as a whole society, the life of each person does contribute to the greater social hegemony. Although social diversity, economic variety, and political freedom appear to exist—because most people ''see'' different life-circumstances—they are incapable of perceiving the greater hegemonic pattern created when the lives they witness coalesce as a society. The cultural hegemony is manifested in and maintained by an existence of minor, different circumstances that are not always fully perceived by the men and the women living the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio |last=Gramsci |authorlink=Antonio Gramsci |editor-first =Joseph A | editor-last = Buttigieg |title=Prison Notebooks |publisher= Columbia University Press |location=New York City |year=1992 |pages=233–38 |isbn=0-231-10592-4 |oclc=24009547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectuals==
In perceiving and combating cultural hegemony, the working class and the peasantry depend upon the intellectuals produced by their society, to which ends Antonio Gramsci distinguished between bourgeois-class intellectuals and working-class intellectuals, the proponents and the opponents of the imposed, normative culture, and thus of the social ''[[status quo]]'':

{{Quotation| Since these various categories of traditional [[intellectual]]s [administrators, [[scholar]]s and [[scientist]]s, theorists, non-ecclesiastical philosophers, etc.] experience through an ''esprit de corps'' their uninterrupted historical continuity, and their special qualifications, they thus put themselves forward as autonomous and independent of the [[Ruling class|dominant social group]]. This self-assessment is not without consequences in the [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[Politics|political]] fields, consequences of wide-ranging import. The whole of [[Idealism|idealist philosophy]] can easily be connected with this position, assumed by the social complex of intellectuals, and can be defined as the expression of that social utopia by which the intellectuals think of themselves as "independent" [and] autonomous, [and] endowed with a character of their own, etc.|''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), pp. 7–8.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, eds., pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation| The traditional and vulgarized type of the intellectual is given by the Man of Letters, the [[philosopher]], and the [[artist]]. Therefore, journalists, who claim to be men of letters, philosophers, artists, also regard themselves as the "true" intellectuals. In the modern world, [[technical education]], closely bound to industrial labor, even at the most primitive and unqualified level, must form the basis of the new type of intellectual. ...

The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as "permanent persuader", not just simple orator.|''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), pp. 9–10.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, eds., pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Gramsci’s influence==
[[File:Rudi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In the 1960s, the German student leader [[Rudi Dutschke]], of the ''[[German student movement|68er-Bewegung]]'', said that changing the bourgeois West Germany required a long march through the society’s institutions, in order to identify and combat cultural hegemony. This quote is often mis-attributed to Antonio Gramsci.&lt;ref name=JaButt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buttigieg|first1=J. A.|title=The Contemporary Discourse on Civil Society: A Gramscian Critique|journal=boundary 2|date=1 March 2005|volume=32|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1215/01903659-32-1-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cultural hegemony has philosophically influenced [[Eurocommunism]], the [[social sciences]], and the [[activist]] politics of socially [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] politicians. The analytic [[discourse]] of cultural hegemony is important to research and synthesis in [[anthropology]], political science, sociology, and [[cultural studies]]; in [[education]], cultural hegemony developed [[critical pedagogy]], by which the root causes of political and social discontent can be identified, and so resolved.

In 1967, the [[German student movement]] leader [[Rudi Dutschke]] reformulated Antonio Gramsci's philosophy of cultural hegemony with the phrase ''[[The long march through the institutions]]'' (German: ''Marsch durch die Institutionen'') to identify the political war of position, an allusion to the [[Long March]] (1934–35) of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]], by means of which, the working class would produce their own organic intellectuals and culture ([[dominant ideology]]) to replace those imposed by the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | editor1-first = Joseph A | editor1-last = Buttigieg | edition = English critical | last = Gramsci | title = Prison Notebooks | at = p 50 footnote 21 | quote = Long March Through the Institutions&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100616163619/http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | archivedate = 2010-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1215/01903659-32-1-33| issn = 0190-3659| volume = 32| issue = 1| pages = 33–52| last = Buttigieg| first = Joseph A.| title = The Contemporary Discourse on Civil Society: A Gramscian Critique| journal = Boundary 2| accessdate = 2010-06-30| year = 2005| url = http://boundary2.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/32/1/33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "davidson"&gt;{{Citation | format = web log | url = http://carldavidson.blogspot.com/2006/04/strategy-hegemony-long-march.html | title = Strategy, Hegemony &amp; ‘The Long March’: Gramsci’s Lessons for the Antiwar Movement | first = Carl | last = Davidson | date = 6 April 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Marsch durch die Institutionen|Marsch durch die Institutionen]] at German Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Antonio Gramsci#Misattributed|Antonio Gramsci: Misattributed]] at English Wikiquote for the origin of “The Long March Through the Institutions” quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of Gramsci==

===The ideological apparatuses of the State===
As conceptual criticism of cultural hegemony, the [[structuralism|structuralist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] presented the theory of the [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|ideological state apparatus]] to describe the structure of complex relationships, among the different organs of the State, by which ideology is transmitted and disseminated to the populations of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On The Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=9781781681640|location=London/ New York|pages=74–75; 103–47; 177, 180, 198–206; 218–31; 242–6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Althusser draws from the concepts of hegemony present in ''cultural hegemony'', yet rejects the absolute [[historicism]] proposed by Gramsci. He argues that the ideological state apparatuses (ISA) are the sites of ideological conflict among the social classes of a society. That, in contrast to the repressive state apparatuses (RSA), such as the military and the police forces, the ISA exist as a plurality. While the ruling class in power can readily control the repressive state apparatuses, the ISA are both the sites and the stakes (the objects) of class struggle. Moreover, the ISA are not monolithic social entities, and are distributed throughout the society, as public and as private sites of continual [[class struggle]].

In ''On the Reproduction of Capitalism'' (1968), Louis Althusser said that the ideological apparatuses of the State are over-determined zones of society that comprise complex elements of the ideologies of previous [[modes of production]], thus, are sites of continual political activity in a society, which are&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=9781781681640|location=London/ New York|page=243.}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* the religious ISA (the system of Churches)
 
* the educational ISA (the systems of public and private schools),
 
* the family ISA,
 
* the legal ISA,
 
* the political ISA (the political system, e.g. political parties),
 
* the trade union ISA,
 
* the communications ISA (press, radio, television, etc.)
 
* the cultural ISA (literature, the arts, sport, etc.)

Althusser said that the [[parliament]]ary structures of the State, by which the “will of the people” is represented by elected delegates, are an ideological apparatus of the State. That the political system, itself, is an ideological apparatus, because it involves the “fiction, corresponding to a ‘certain’ reality, that the component parts of the [political] system, as well as the principle of its functioning, are based on the ideology of the ‘freedom’ and ‘equality’ of the individual voters and the ‘free choice’ of the people’s representatives, by the individuals that ‘make up’ the people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|location=London/New York|pages=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">'''Data exfiltration''' occurs when malware and/or a malicious actor carries out an unauthorized data transfer from a computer. It is also commonly called data extrusion or data exportation. Data exfiltration is also considered a form of [[data theft]]. During the past couple decades, a number of data exfiltration efforts severely damaged the consumer confidence, corporate valuation, and intellectual property of businesses and national security of governments across the world.

== Types of exfiltrated data ==
In some data exfiltration scenarios, a large amount of aggregated data may be exfiltrated. However, in these and other scenarios, it is likely that certain types of data may be targeted. Types of data that are targeted includes:

* Usernames, associated passwords, and other system authentication related information&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-devise-perfect-data-exfiltration-technique|title=Researchers Devise "Perfect" Data Exfiltration Technique|last=Kovacs|first=Eduard|date=May 30, 2016|website=Security Week|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Information associated with strategic decisions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Cryptographic keys&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Personal financial information&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/18/technology/biggest-cyberattacks-of-the-year/index.html|title=The hacks that left us exposed in 2017|last=Larson|first=Selena|date=December 20, 2017|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social security numbers and other personally identifiable information (PII)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Mailing addresses&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* United States National Security Agency hacking tools&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Techniques ==
Several techniques have been used by malicious actors to carry out data exfiltration. The technique chosen depends on a number of factors. If the attacker has or can easily gain physical or privileged remote access to the server containing the data they wish to exfiltrate, their chances of success are much better than otherwise. For example, it would be relatively easy for a system administrator to plant, and in turn, execute malware that transmits data to an external command and control server without getting caught.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, if one can gain physical administrative access, they can potentially steal the server holding the target data, or more realistically, transfer data from the server to a DVD or USB flash drive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2520483/enterprise-applications/data-exfiltration--how-data-gets-out.html|title=Data Exfiltration: How Data Gets Out|last=Percoco|first=Nicholas|date=March 12, 2010|website=Computerworld|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, malicious actors cannot gain physical access to the physical systems holding target data. In these situations, they may compromise user accounts on remote access applications using manufacturer default or weak passwords. In 2009, after analyzing 200 data exfiltration attacks that took place in 24 countries, SpiderLabs discovered a ninety percent success rate in compromising user accounts on remote access applications without requiring brute-force attacks. Once a malicious actor gains this level of access, they may transfer target data elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally, there are more sophisticated forms of data exfiltration. Various techniques can be used to conceal detection by network defenses. For example, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to provide a malicious actor with sensitive data. A timing channel can also be used to send data a few packets at a time at specified intervals in a way that is even more difficult for network defenses to detect and prevent.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ullah|first=Faheem|date=2017|title=Data Exfiltration: A Review of External Attack Vectors and Countermeasures|url=|journal=Journal of Network and Computer Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Preventative measures ==
There are a number of things that can be done to help defend a network against data exfiltration. Three main categories of preventative measures may be the most effective: 

* Preventive&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* Detective&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* Investigative&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

One example of detective measures is to implement intrusion detection and prevention systems and regularly monitor network services to ensure that only known acceptable services are running at any given time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If suspicious network services are running, investigate and take the appropriate measures immediately. Preventative measures include the implementation and maintenance of access controls, deception techniques, and encryption of data in process, in transit, and at rest. Investigative measures include various forensics actions and counter intelligence operations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] are the cornerstones of [[Qatar]]'s [[Economic system|economy]] and account for more than 70% of total government revenue, more than 60% of [[gross domestic product]], and roughly 85% of [[export]] earnings. Qatar has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|world's third largest proven natural gas reserve]] and is the [[List of countries by natural gas exports|second-largest exporter of natural gas]].

==Energy sector==
{{main|Energy in Qatar}}
Before the emergence of petrol-based industry, Qatar was a poor pearl diving country. The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939.&lt;ref name=emboil&gt;{{cite web|title='''The Qatar Oil Discoveries''', Rasoul Sorkhabi, Ph.D., in GEO ExPro Magazine, Vol. 7, No. 1 - 2010|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2010/01/the-qatar-oil-discoveries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.onlineqatar.com/info/tourist-info.aspx
|title=Qatar tourist information guide
|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, oil production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks of the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.

Qatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC ([[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]]) quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South [[Asia]], have grown again.

Oil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m³) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023. However, large [[natural gas]] reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast coast. There have been found also some oil fields or some large gas fields containing larger amounts of oil. For example, the state owned [[Qatar Petroleum]] found 2 offshore oil fields in the 1960s.  Back then production was too expensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years later. Oil and gas condensate will also be produced in the gas fields.

The gas condensate can be refined to usual oil products in specialised refineries. The costs are a bit higher but it is normal today for companies to use the gas condensate too. Oil offshore production in 2008 for PS-2 and PS-3 blocks was about 31.1 million barrels (84,995 b/d). Joint Ventures facilities (PS-1, ALK, K &amp; A): Combined oil production from these three joint venture production facilities in 2008 was 57.4 million barrels (156,873 b/d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qp.com.qa/en/QPActivities/QPOperations/Pages/OilandGasDetails.aspx?OID=10|title=Oil and Gas Details|website=www.qp.com.qa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like with gas fields there are more offshore blocks which need to be explored and could increase the oil output. So the 500,000 bpd peak and a depletion in 2023 is delayed. With higher oil prices it is expected that the offshore exploration of oil and/or natural gas fields will go on. Oil production in June 2016 seemed to be around 670,000 barrels per day, a bit down from February 2016 production of 692,000 barrels per day. Taking all liquids together Qatar is already far beyond a million barrels per day.

Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 7000&amp;nbsp;km³ (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to [[Japan]]. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.

Qatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m³) per day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The U.S. is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.

Qatar pursues a vigorous program of "[[Qatarization]]", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the U.S., are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. In order to control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programs over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.

==Industry==
The government considers industry to be an integral part of its plan to diversify the economy and maximize its huge natural gas reserves, which serve as the primary feedstock for the sector. Accordingly, careful planning has gone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has been clustered around the ports of [[Ras Laffan Industrial City]] and [[Mesaieed Industrial Area]], which are key centers of energy. The result has seen considerable growth over the years. [[Industries Qatar]] (IQ), a producer of petrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed only in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East’s largest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-largest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about 7.5% of GDP. 

Petrochemicals and fertilizers supply make up a large portion of the industrial base, along with steel and other construction materials, through Qatar Steel and Qatar Primary Material Company (QPMC). Indeed, over the past few years, demand for construction materials experienced a major surge as the development boom swept the [[Persian Gulf]] region. But the global financial crisis has put a significant dent in demand in the region, as project credit lines dry up and investor sentiment remains cautious. The crisis has in fact impacted the whole of the industrial sector – IQ saw its net profit drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than 90% over the same period the previous year. But in relative terms, the sector has fared better than most and IQ still managed to post an annual profit of $2bn. Large profit chunks from years past have been channeled into capital investments, which should help the sector ride out the storm. IQ, for example, is pushing several major expansion projects, worth almost $6bn, ahead. Qatar is expected to be one of the fastest growing economies in 2009 – the hope is it will be enough to keep the industrial sector on an upward trajectory.

==Financial sector==
The Qatari banking sector managed to escape the direct impact of the global subprime fallout, but was not altogether unscathed by its aftershocks. Overall, it was the best performing of the Gulf Cooperation Council markets in the last quarter of 2008 and most banks posted substantial profits for 2008. But the sector is also facing issues of liquidity, declining customer confidence and a forced reluctance to lend. In a bid to strengthen the banks’ positions, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) announced in early 2009 that it was willing to take a 10-20% stake in any interested local listed banks by way of a capital injection, although this was later reduced to 5% stakes and an additional 5% at the end of 2009. 

The Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy the investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to continue lending. Cautious sector sentiment has also been compounded by the Qatar Central Bank’s (QCB’s) lending restrictions, which demand a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90%. Given the high level of integration between Qatar’s economy and the Persian Gulf region, as well as the wider world, a slowdown in business and banking activity seemed inevitable. Nevertheless, Qatar’s banking sector has been faring relatively well, considering the strife experienced in other countries, and insiders are confident that activity will return to its previous brisk pace in the second half of 2009 as confidence slowly rebuilds around the globe.

===Islamic finance===
The [[Islamic finance]] sector enjoyed increased activity in 2008 and is expected to continue to grow into 2009 as more sophisticated financial instruments spark the interest of investors. In addition to Islamic banks, such as Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and newcomer Masraf Al Rayyan, conventional banks have also been entering the sharia-compliant sector and are coming to view an Islamic subsidiary as a virtual necessity in order to maintain market standing. Islamic banks currently take the lion’s share of sharia-compliant business, though the conventional banks are working hard to take a greater share of market activity. Both Islamic banks and Islamic subsidiaries did remarkably well in the first three quarters of 2008, during which overall financing activity increased by 70.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. The global financial crisis slowed this growth though. Poor market conditions have contributed to a marked slowdown of Islamic bond, or sukuk, activity in 2008 throughout the Persian Gulf. But other segments, such as Islamic insurance, or takaful, have not seen a similar downturn. Overall, challenges to further growth remain, including a lack of qualified staff to meet the growing demand for sharia-compliant banking services.

===Capital market===
The stock [[market capitalisation]] of listed companies in Qatar was valued at $95,487 million in 2007 by the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20394793~menuPK%3A1192714~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html|title=Data - Finance|date=5 December 2006|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205235151/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20394793~menuPK%3A1192714~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html|archivedate=5 December 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As 2008 drew to a close, no capital markets around the globe, including Qatar's, were immune to the effects of the sub-prime fallout. That said, there is considerable optimism that Qatar's bourse, the Doha Securities Market (DSM), will remain relatively resilient to the ongoing international turbulence. It has followed the same peak-trough trajectory as many others around the globe, hitting record highs in mid-2008, before diving in late 2008 and early 2009. Between December 2006 and July 2008 the DSM Index rose about 117% before the global financial crisis wiped out most of these gains. In the first few months of 2009, the DSM lost about 40% of its value. In an effort to stave off further losses, the government announced in February 2009 that it would step in to buy up shares of troubled banks amounting to about 10% of the market's capitalisation. The move improved investor optimism and is hoped to prevent the market from falling further. The proposal to create a single unified regulator as early as 2010 to oversee all banking and financial services is viewed as another promising development that will transform the financial sector for the better.

==Tourism==
[[File:Qatar Lagoon.jpg|thumb|260px|The Pearl Qatar]]
Under the ambitious five-year development plan of the Qatar Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (QTEA), the government aimed to boost the number of visitors from 964,000 as of 2007 to 1.5m by 2010. The funding required to meet this goal was present in sufficient amounts; in 2008 the state allocated some $17bn for tourism development through 2014, most of which was allocated towards hotels, exhibition space and infrastructure. In order to keep up with a rising number of visitors, the government set a goal of increasing hotel capacity 400% by 2012. In addition to financial support, the government has also worked to ease business regulations in a bid to increase private sector activity. A major aspect of expansion plans is the [[Hamad International Airport]], which will have the capacity to handle up to 24m passengers upon the completion of the first phase in 2012.

Other niche tourism segments receiving special focus include cultural tourism on the back of the high publicity opening of Doha’s [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]], and sports tourism, initially spurred by the [[Asian Games]], to which [[2006 Asian Games|Qatar played host in 2006]]. The government appears to be committed to long-term expansion plans, but challenges nevertheless remain, including effective marketing to the international community as well as the effect of the financial crisis on global tourism appetite.

{{Main article|Transport in Qatar}}
With a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.

As driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity. Mass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers. The [[New Doha International Airport]] is one of the largest projects in Qatar today and will boast a capacity of 50m passengers upon completion in 2015. Finally, port infrastructure is seen as an integral part of Qatar's economic development as it focuses on LNG and industrial exports. The port at Mesaieed is undergoing expansion. While the financial crisis may present challenges to infrastructure development, once all projects are completed Qatar will have one of the most advanced and modern transport infrastructures in the region.

But rising global oil demand helped current GDP per capita to expand 94% in the 90s. Diversification is still a long-term issue for this over-exposed economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18077">'''"Encounter killing"''' is a term used in [[South Asia]] since the late 20th century to describe killings by the police or the armed forces, allegedly in self-defence, when they encounter suspected gangsters or terrorists. In the 1990s and the mid-2000s, the [[Mumbai Police]] used encounter killings to attack the [[Organised crime in India#Mumbai underworld|city's underworld]], and the practice spread to other large cities.

Critics are sceptical of many of these reported incidents,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; and further complain that the wide acceptance of the practice has led to incidents of police creating 'false encounters' to cover-up the killing of suspects when they are either in custody or are unarmed.&lt;ref name="IndExp_2011_Sohrabuddin"/&gt;

==In India ==
This term has come into popular use in India since the late 20th century because of a very high frequency of encounter killings by police in such cities as [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]], and [[Kolkata]]. Some of the killings have been controversial, and critics have alleged that the police created 'fake encounters' as opportunities to kill suspects.&lt;ref name="IndExp_2011_Sohrabuddin"/&gt;

According to the [[National Human Rights Commission]] (NHRC) of India, there were many cases of alleged fake encounters:
;2002–2008
440 cases. States with high number of cases were: Uttar Pradesh (231), Rajasthan (33), Maharashtra (31), Delhi (26), Andhra Pradesh (22) and Uttarakhand (19).&lt;ref name="IndExp_2011_Sohrabuddin"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://newindianexpress.com/opinion/article482874.ece | title = Sohrabuddin: Interrogating the media | accessdate = 2012-05-23 | date = 2011-08-11 | publisher = Indian Express | author = S Gurumurthy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2009/10 - February 2013
555 cases. States with high number of cases were: Uttar Pradesh (138), Manipur (62), Assam (52), West Bengal (35) and Jharkhand (30).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/fake-encounters-congress-ruled-states-narendra-modi-gujarat/1/286891.html | title = NHRC stats show there were more fake encounters in Congress-ruled states than in Narendra Modi's Gujarat | date = 2013-07-04 | publisher = India Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 1982, the gangster [[Manya Surve]] was shot dead by police officers Raja Tambat and Isaque Bagwan at the [[Wadala]] area. This is often referred to as the city's first recognised encounter killing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=21225 "City’s first encounter ended two years of urban dacoity"], June 22, 2002, ''Express India''. {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From that period until early 2003, the police killed 1,200 alleged criminals.&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt;

Members of the Mumbai Police involved in these killings became widely known as 'encounter specialists', and several became well-known to the public in India, including:

===Punjab===
The term 'police encounter' was used often during the [[Punjab insurgency]] between 1984 and 1995. During this time, [[Punjab Police (India)|Punjab police]] officials reported 'encounters' to local newspapers and to the family members of those killed. The victim was typically a person whom the police believed to be a [[Insurgent|militant]] or involved in the militant separatist movement; proof of alleged militant involvement was rarely given. Ultimately, the practice became so common that 'encounter' became synonymous with [[extrajudicial execution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dead Silence: The Legacy of Abuses in Punjab|publisher=Human Rights Watch/Asia and Physicians for Human Rights|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CampbellBrenner2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Bruce B.|last2=Brenner|first2=Arthur David|title=Death Squads in Global Perspective: Murder with Deniability|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlXPSphM840C&amp;pg=PA265|accessdate=19 June 2010|date=2002-10-01|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4039-6094-8|pages=265–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is alleged that police typically take a suspected militant into custody without filing an arrest report. If the suspect dies during interrogation, security forces would deny ever taking the person into custody and instead claim that he was killed during an armed encounter, placing weapons on or near the body to suggest the police acted in self-defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (India)|publisher=U.S. State Department|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/weekinreview/01pepper.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title=India Makes a Place for Dirty Harry|last=Pepper|first=Daniel|date=2009-02-28|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sbs.com.au/dateline/index.php?page=transcript&amp;dte=2002-04-03&amp;headlineid=427 |title=India-Who Killed the Sikhs |date=4 March 2002 |publisher=Dateline |accessdate=2009-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912235435/http://news.sbs.com.au/dateline/index.php?page=transcript&amp;dte=2002-04-03&amp;headlineid=427 |archivedate=September 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensaaf.org/pdf/un/Bhatti.pdf|title=Communication to Special Representative on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders|date=2006-05-12|publisher=Ensaaf|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equality Pennsylvania''' is an organization which advocates throughout the state of [[Pennsylvania]] for [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]]. Equality Pennsylvania also attempts to "advance LGBT-friendly policy and legislative initiatives".&lt;ref name="Equality Pennsylvania About Us"&gt;[http://www.equalitypa.org/about.html Equality Pennsylvania About Us] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505142338/http://www.equalitypa.org/about.html |date=May 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is a member of the [[Equality Federation]].&lt;ref name="roxbury413"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roxburynews.com/index.php?a=6001 | title=Dauphin County candidates endorsed by Equality Pennsylvania | publisher=Roxbury News | date=April 15, 2013 | accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Equality Pennsylvania was founded by Andrew Park in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Philly Leader Named to Staff of Williams Institute|url=http://www.epgn.com/news/national/7429-25349861-former-philly-leader-named-to-staff-of-williams-institute|accessdate=13 February 2017|publisher=Phil. Gay News}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Philadelphia as the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights.&lt;ref name="Equality Pennsylvania About Us" /&gt; Upon its founding, the Center provided legal services to members of the [[LGBT]] community in Philadelphia. The organization specifically provided assistance with HIV/AIDS discrimination and transgender name-change cases for the LGBT community. The organization eventually developed into Equality Advocates PA, which helped to advocate for LGBT rights along with its previous goal of providing legal representation to the LGBT community. Equality Advocates PA was instrumental in defeating constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage in 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref name="Equality Pennsylvania About Us" /&gt; In 2007, the organization also began to help draft [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|LGBT non-discrimination legislation]] throughout the state. In 2009, the Equality Advocates PA reorganized under the name of Equality Pennsylvania. Along with changing the name of the organization, this reorganization saw the installation of a new board of directors and a new mission, which is to advocate for LGBT rights and LGBT legislation throughout Pennsylvania as a [[501(c)(4)]] organization. The organization also reassigned its legal responsibilities to the [[Mazzoni Center]] to ensure that it could offer its complete focus to advocating for equality for LGBT individuals. In 2010, the organization hired Ted Martin to become the Executive Director and opened an office in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] to help expand the focus of the organization beyond Philadelphia and to allow for easier access to the General Assembly and the Governor. Following Martin's resignation in June 2017, the organization closed its Harrisburg office and established an even greater statewide network through the activation of regional chapters and with board members across the Commonwealth.

[[Image:Bandera de Estado Aragonés.svg|thumb|right|200px|Flag of Estado Aragonés]]

'''Estado Aragonés''' ('Aragonese State' in English) was a small [[Aragon]]ese [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political party, and the first regarded as fully [[Nationalism|nationalist]]. It was founded in [[Barcelona]] in the winter of 1933, during the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Many of their members came from [[Unión Aragonesista]] and had their origins in the north-east Aragonese region of [[Ribagorza]]. The president was [[Gaspar Torrente]].

The youth wing of the party, ''Los Almogávares'' ('The [[Almogavars]]'), headed by Luis Porté, supported the declaration of the [[Catalan State (1934)|Catalan Republic]] by [[Lluis Companys]] in 1934, what lead to their headquarters being closed down. The organization was quite inactive until 1936, when they opened a new head office and Miguel Alcubierre was elected as the president of the youth wing. He started a campaign for self-government in Aragon which aroused the interest of the rest of left-wing Republican parties.

Those actions led to a Congress taking place in [[Caspe]] ([[Saragossa]]) at the beginning of May in 1936, with Torrente as the chairman. The result was the draft of a Statute of Autonomy for Aragon, which would not come to the light due to the onset of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. By 1939 the party had ceased to exist.

''Renacimiento Aragonés'' ('Aragonese Revival') was the party's official publication. The party was in good relations with the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] party [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]].

==Estau Aragonés==
In 2006, '''Estau Aragonés''' (''Estado Aragonés'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Estat Aragonès'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) was founded as a new political party, inspired by the one of 1933 in a sort of refoundation. It aims for the [[independence]] of [[Aragon]] and the liberation of the Aragonese working class. The youth wing is Astral-Mozardalla d'Estau Aragonés.

In 2007, both Estau Aragonés and Astral, along with other Aragonese pro-independence organizations (Chobenalla, Puyalón, A Enrestida and the Aragonese Workers' Union, STA) formed a political bloc, called ''[[Bloque Independentista de Cuchas]]'' ([[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] for 'Left Independentist Block').

==Allegation of a US "war on whistleblowers"==

[[Leonard Downie, Jr.|Leonard Downie]] describes the Administration as the "most militant" since Richard Nixon's regarding leaks. {{cite web|author=Richard McGregor|date=28 May 2013|title=Press freedom: A heavy-handed approach|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aef24916-c776-11e2-be27-00144feab7de.html|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting critics to describe Obama's crackdown as a "war on whistleblowers."&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/07/02/greenwald-obama-engaged-in-unprecedented-war-on-whistleblowers/ Greenwald: Obama engaged in ‘unprecedented war on whistleblowers’]," ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;"[http://www.thenation.com/blog/174916/war-whistleblowers-sin-being-correct#axzz2ZvISOaKm The War on Whistleblowers: On the Sin of Being Correct]", ''The Nation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MJ"&gt;"[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones Obama's War on Whistleblowers]" ''Mother Jones''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A public statement by the Obama campaign bragged that "the Obama administration has prosecuted  twice  as many cases under the Espionage Act as all the other administrations combined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130620/18182823551/obama-administration-has-declared-war-leakers-claims-any-leak-is-aiding-enemy.shtml Obama Administration Has Declared War On Whistleblowers, Describes Leaks As 'Aiding The Enemy' | Techdirt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/obama-campaign-brags-about-whistleblower-persecutions Obama campaign brags about its whistleblower persecutions | Glenn Greenwald | Comment is free | theguardian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/06/22/edward_snowden_is_eighth_person_obama_has_pursued_under_espionage_act.html Edward Snowden is eighth person Obama has pursued under Espionage Act&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones Obama's War on Whistleblowers | Mother Jones&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of government intimidation of ''The Guardian''==
''[[The Guardian]]'' is a UK-based newspaper with an international reach. In 2013, ''The Guardian'' received a copy of data from NSA whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]].

===Legal threats and forced computer destruction===
{{external media|
video1=[https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/jan/31/snowden-files-computer-destroyed-guardian-gchq-basement-video Video from ''The Guardian'' including footage of destruction]
}}

In June and July 2013, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] sent [[Jeremy Heywood]], the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]],  to meet with [[Alan Rusbridger]], editor of ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq Footage released of Guardian editors destroying Snowden hard drives | UK news | theguardian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Heywood ordered the editor to cease publishing articles based on the Snowden disclosures. According to ''The Guardian'', Heywood said: "We can do this nicely or we can go to law", adding that "A lot of people in government think you should be closed down".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

On July 20, the destruction of computer hard-drives was carried out by several ''Guardian'' staff members under the observation of experts from GCHQ.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Borger|first=Julian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/nsa-snowden-files-drives-destroyed-london|title=NSA files: why the Guardian in London destroyed hard drives of leaked files|work=The Guardian|date=20 August 2013|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' said the authorities were told of the existence of multiple copies of the data outside the UK. The deputy editor, &lt;!-- No article, hndis issue. --&gt;Paul Johnson, who was involved in the destruction told [[Luke Harding]] about the experience. "It was purely a symbolic act", Johnson said. "We knew that. GCHQ knew that. And the government knew that. It was the most surreal event I have witnessed in British journalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harding|first=Luke|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq|title=Footage released of Guardian editors destroying Snowden hard drives|work=The Guardian|date=31 January 2014|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013 the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] detained Greenwald's partner [[David Miranda (politician)|David Miranda]] at London's [[Heathrow Airport]] under Schedule 7 of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]], while he was traveling home from Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Savage]], (August 16, 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/world/europe/britain-detains-partner-of-reporter-tied-to-leaks.html Britain Detains the Partner of a Reporter Tied to Leaks] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Britain Detains Partner of Reporter Tied to Leaks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/world/europe/britain-detains-partner-of-reporter-tied-to-leaks.html?hp|accessdate=2013-08-18|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2013-08-18|author2=Michael Schwirtz|authorlink=Charlie Savage|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCAug19"&gt;{{cite news|title=US given 'heads up' on David Miranda detention|work=BBC News Online|date=August 19, 2013|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23761918}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A February 2014 court decision upheld the detention as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Ritchie (19 February 2014), [https://news.yahoo.com/court-dismisses-challenge-snowden-linked-detention-001317641.html British court upholds Snowden-linked detention] ''[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwald described his partner's detention as "clearly intended to send a message of intimidation to those of us who have been reporting on the NSA and [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/18/david-miranda-detained-uk-nsa | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Glenn | last=Greenwald | title=Glenn Greenwald: detaining my partner was a failed attempt at intimidation | date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miranda was detained for nine hours and his laptop and other items were seized. He has since sued the Metropolitan Police for misuse of their powers. According to ''The Guardian'' the claim, "challenging controversial powers used under schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000, maintains that Miranda was not involved in terrorism and says his right to freedom of expression was curtailed".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/david-miranda-lawyers-heathrow-detention-high-court David Miranda lawyers argue that Heathrow detention was unlawful, ''The Guardian'', Wednesday 6 November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global warming controversy''' concerns the public debate over whether [[global warming]] is occurring, how much has occurred in modern times, what has caused it, what its [[Effects of global warming|effects]] will be, whether any action should be taken to curb it, and if so what that action should be. In the [[scientific literature]], there is a [[scientific opinion on climate change|strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased]] in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref name="OreskesBeyondTheIvoryTower"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "AmericasClimateChoices-2010-SciPanel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USNAS-2008-ClimateChoices" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCG-20140411" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CD-201404" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf ''Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.''

The controversy is, by now, political rather than scientific: there is a scientific consensus that climate change is happening and is caused by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ |title=Scientific consensus: Earth's climate is warming |website=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet |access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the [[Media coverage of climate change|media]] than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the [[United States]] than [[Climate change opinion by country|globally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=M. |first2=J. |title=Balance as bias: global warming and the US prestige press |last1=Boykoff |journal=Global Environmental Change Part A |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=125–136 |date=July 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2003.10.001 |last2=Boykoff |url=http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106081048/http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/boykoff04-gec.pdf |archivedate= 6 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="merchants_doubt"&gt;{{cite book | title=Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming | first1=Naomi | last1=Oreskes | authorlink1 = Naomi Oreskes| first2=Erik | last2=Conway | publisher=Bloomsbury Press | edition=first | isbn=978-1-59691-610-4| date=2010-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and popular debate concerning the existence and cause of climate change includes the reasons for the increase seen in the [[instrumental temperature record]], whether the warming trend exceeds normal climatic variations, and whether [[attribution of recent climate change|human activities have contributed significantly to it]]. Scientists have resolved these questions decisively in favour of the view that the current warming trend exists and is ongoing, that human activity is the cause, and that it is without precedent in at least 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years and National Research Council|title=Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years|year=2006|publisher=The National Academies|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-10225-4|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676&amp;page=R1|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public disputes that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system might be to any given level of greenhouse gases ([[climate sensitivity]]), how global climate change will play out at local and regional scales, and what the [[Effects of global warming|consequences of global warming]] will be.

Global warming remains an issue of widespread political debate, often split along party political lines, especially in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Support for Climate and Energy Policies in March 2012|year=2012|publisher=Yale Project on Climate Change Communication:|url=http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Policy-Support-March-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the issues that are settled within the scientific community, such as human responsibility for global warming, remain the subject of politically or economically motivated attempts to downplay, dismiss or deny them—an ideological phenomenon categorised by academics and scientists as [[climate change denial]]. The sources of funding for those involved with climate science—both supporting and [[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|opposing mainstream scientific positions]]—have been questioned by both sides. There are debates about the best [[Climate change mitigation|policy responses to the science]], their cost-effectiveness and their urgency. Climate scientists, especially in the United States, have reported [[Politicization of science#Global warming|official and oil-industry pressure]] to [[Climate change denial|censor or suppress their work]] and hide scientific data, with directives not to discuss the subject in public communications. Legal cases regarding global warming, its effects, and measures to reduce it have reached American courts. The [[fossil fuels lobby]] has been identified as overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming.&lt;ref name="Canvassing Works" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vidal /&gt;

== History ==

=== Public opinion ===
{{Main|Public opinion on climate change}}
In the [[United States]], the mass media devoted little coverage to global warming until the [[drought]] of 1988, and [[James E. Hansen]]'s testimony to the [[United States Senate|Senate]], which explicitly attributed "the abnormally hot weather plaguing our nation" to global warming.&lt;ref name = "McCrightDunlap2000p500"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCright, A. M. |author2=Dunlap R. E. |title=Challenging global warming as a social problem: An analysis of the conservative movement's counter-claims |journal=Social Problems |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=499–522 |year=2000 |jstor=3097132 |url=http://www.climateaccess.org/sites/default/files/McCright_Challenging%20Global%20Warming.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.2307/3097132 |ref=harv }} See p.&amp;nbsp;500.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British press also changed its coverage at the end of 1988, following a speech by [[Margaret Thatcher]] to the [[Royal Society]] advocating action against human-induced climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Speech to the Royal Society (27 September 1988), [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=107346 Public Statement, Speech Archive], ''Margaret Thatcher Foundation''. Retrieved 9 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anabela Carvalho, an academic analyst, Thatcher's "appropriation" of the risks of climate change to promote [[nuclear power]], in the context of the dismantling of the coal industry following the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|1984–1985 miners' strike]] was one reason for the change in public discourse. At the same time environmental organizations and the political opposition were demanding "solutions that contrasted with the government's".&lt;ref name="Carvalho2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carvalho, Anabela |title=Ideological cultures and media discourses on scientific knowledge |journal=Public Understanding of Science |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=223–43 |year=2007 |doi=10.1177/0963662506066775 |url=http://pus.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/16/2/223 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013 [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] took a strong stance criticising both climate change deniers and corporate lobbyists by likening the Earth to a dying patient. "A scientific hypothesis is tested to absolute destruction, but medicine can't wait. If a doctor sees a child with a fever, he can't wait for [endless] tests. He has to act on what is there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/09/prince-charles-climate-change | title=Charles: 'Climate change sceptics are turning Earth into dying patient' | newspaper=The Guardian | date=9 May 2013 | last=Harvey | first=Fiona | accessdate= 10 May 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many European countries took action to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions before 1990. [[West Germany]] started to take action after the [[Green Party (Germany)|Green Party]] took seats in Parliament in the 1980s. All countries of the [[European Union]] ratified the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]]. Substantial activity by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s took place as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=265–272|title=Confronting climate change|first=Irving M.|last=Mintzer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-521-42091-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Energy Information Administration|United States Energy Information Administration]] reports that, in the United States, "The 2012 downturn means that emissions are at their lowest level since 1994 and over 12% below the recent 2007 peak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USEIA U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions, 2012|date=21 October 2013|url=http://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory that increases in greenhouse gases would lead to an increase in temperature was first proposed by the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1896, but climate change did not arise  as a political issue until the 1990s. It took many years for this particular issue to attract any type of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bodansky|first1=Daniel|editor1-last=Luterbacher|editor1-first=Urs|editor2-last=Sprinz|editor2-first=Detlef F.|title=International Relations and Global Climate Change|date=2001|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|pages=23–40|chapter-url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/shared/iheid/800/luterbacher/luterbacher%20chapter%202%20102.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2016|chapter=The History of the Global Climate Change Regime|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327080814/http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/shared/iheid/800/luterbacher/luterbacher%20chapter%202%20102.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], the notion of human influence on climate gained wide acceptance more rapidly than in the United States and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More in Europe worry about climate than in U.S., poll shows|first=Thomas|last=Crampton|date=4 January 2007|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/04/news/poll.php|accessdate=14 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Consensus on Global Warming – Partisanship Drives Opinion – Summary of Findings|publisher=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|date=12 July 2006|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 survey found that Europeans rated climate change as the second most serious problem facing the world, between "poverty, the lack of food and drinking water" and "a major global economic downturn". 87% of Europeans considered climate change to be a very serious or serious problem, while ten per cent did not consider it a serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TNS Opinion and Social|title=Europeans' Attitudes Towards Climate Change|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_322_en.pdf|format=Full free text|publisher=European Commission|date=December 2009|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[BBC]] announced the cancellation of a planned television special [[Planet Relief]], which would have highlighted the global warming issue and included a mass electrical switch-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Richard|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6979596.stm|title=BBC switches off climate special|publisher=BBC|date=5 September 2007|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of BBC's [[Newsnight]] current affairs show said: "It is absolutely not the BBC's job to save the planet. I think there are a lot of people who think that, but it must be stopped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/05/bbc.television2 BBC drops climate change special]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 5 September 2007. Retrieved 15 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Mark Lynas]] said "The only reason why this became an issue is that there is a small but vociferous group of extreme right-wing climate 'sceptics' lobbying against taking action, so the BBC is behaving like a coward and refusing to take a more consistent stance."&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Michael, [http://environment.independent.co.uk/climate_change/article2934318.ece Global Warming: Too Hot to Handle for the BBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915053005/http://environment.independent.co.uk/climate_change/article2934318.ece |date=15 September 2007 }}, ''The Independent'', 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of the 2010 book ''[[Merchants of Doubt]]'', provide documentation for the assertion that professional deniers have tried to sow seeds of doubt in public opinion in order to halt any meaningful social or political progress to reduce the impact of human carbon emissions. The fact that only half of the American population believe that global warming is caused by human activity could be seen as a victory for these deniers.&lt;ref name="merchants_doubt"/&gt; One of the authors' main arguments is that most prominent scientists who have been voicing opposition to the near-universal consensus are being funded by industries, such as automotive and oil, that stand to lose money by government actions to regulate [[greenhouse gas]]es. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

* There is widespread recognition that the climate, irrespective of the cause, is changing—88% believe this to be true.
* However, the public is out of step with the scientific community, with 41% believing that climate change is being caused by both human activity and natural processes. 46% believe human activity is the main cause.
* Only a small minority reject anthropogenic climate change, while almost half (44%) are very concerned. However, there remains a large proportion who are not fully persuaded and hold doubts about the extent of the threat.
* There is still a strong appetite among the public for more information, and 63% say they need this to come to a firm view on the issue and what it means for them.
* The public continue to externalize climate change to other people, places and times. It is increasingly perceived as a major global issue with far-reaching consequences for future generations—45% say it is the most serious threat facing the World today and 53% believe it will impact significantly on future generations. However, the issue features less prominently nationally and locally, indeed only 9% believe climate change will have a significant impact upon them personally.

The [[Canadians|Canadian]] science [[Television presenter|broadcaster]] and [[environmentalism|environmental]] activist [[David Suzuki]] reports that focus groups organized by the [[David Suzuki Foundation]] in 2006 showed that the public has a poor understanding of the science behind global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/about_us/Dr_David_Suzuki/Article_Archives/weekly08180601.asp|title=Public doesn't understand global warming|author=[[David Suzuki]]|publisher=David Suzuki Foundation|date=18 August 2006|accessdate=18 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816174336/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/about_us/Dr_David_Suzuki/Article_Archives/weekly08180601.asp|archive-date=16 August 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite publicity through different means, including the films ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' and ''[[The 11th Hour (2007 film)|The 11th Hour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://11thhourfilm.com/|title=11th Hour Film|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.algore.com/library/an-inconvenient-truth-dvd|title=An Inconvenient Truth (Movie)|last=|first=|date=|website=Al Gore|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the poor understanding is public confusion between global warming and [[ozone depletion]] or other environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piercelaw.edu/risk/vol8/fall/bord+.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032808/http://www.piercelaw.edu/risk/vol8/fall/Bord%2B.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Is Accurate Understanding of Global Warming Necessary to Promote Willingness to Sacrifice? |author1=Richard J.

A 15-nation poll conducted in 2006, by [[Pew Research Center|Pew Global]] found that there "is a substantial gap in concern over global warming—roughly two-thirds of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] (66%) and Indians (65%) say they personally worry a great deal about global warming. Roughly half of the populations of Spain (51%) and France (46%) also express great concern over global warming, based on those who have heard about the issue. But there is no evidence of alarm over global warming in either the [[United States]] or [[China]]—the two largest producers of greenhouse gases. Just 19% of Americans and 20% of the Chinese who have heard of the issue say they worry a lot about global warming—the lowest percentages in the 15 countries surveyed. Moreover, nearly half of Americans (47%) and somewhat fewer Chinese (37%) express little or no concern about the problem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/252.pdf No Global Warming Alarm in the U.S., China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201022704/http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/252.pdf# |date=1 December 2007 }} 15-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey, released 13 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 Canadian poll, found that 32% of Canadians said they believe climate change is happening because of human activity, while 54% said they believe it’s because of human activity and partially due to natural climate variation. 9% believe climate change is occurring due to natural climate variation, and only 2% said they don't believe climate change is occurring at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/only-2-per-cent-of-canadians-dont-believe-in-climate-change-poll/article4482183/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Only 2 per cent of Canadians don't believe in climate change: poll | date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related controversies ===
Many of the critics of the consensus view on global warming have disagreed, in whole or part, with the scientific consensus regarding other issues, particularly those relating to environmental risks, such as [[ozone depletion]], [[DDT#Environmental impact|DDT]], and [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental skepticism: ecology, power and public life|series=Global environmental governance series|author=Peter Jacques|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=George E.

Mooney says that the promotion of doubt regarding issues that are politically, but not scientifically, controversial became increasingly prevalent under the George W. Bush administration, which, he says, regularly distorted and/or suppressed scientific research to further its own political aims. This is also the subject of a 2004 book by environmental lawyer [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]] titled ''Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and Corporate Pals are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy'' ({{ISBN|978-0060746872}}). Another book on this topic is ''[[The Assault on Reason]]'' by former [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|Vice President of the United States]] [[Al Gore]]. Earlier instances of this trend are also covered in the book ''The Heat Is On'' by [[Ross Gelbspan]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Some critics of the scientific consensus on global warming have argued that these issues should not be linked and that reference to them constitutes an unjustified [[ad hominem]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sepp.org/Archive/NewSEPP/How%20to%20think%20about%20GW.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070215192823/http://www.sepp.org/Archive/NewSEPP/How%20to%20think%20about%20GW.htm |archivedate=15 February 2007|title=NEW ON THE SEPP WEB|accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Roger A.

=== Scientific consensus ===
[[Scientific consensus]] is normally achieved through communication at conferences, publication in the [[scientific literature]], replication (reproducible results by others), and [[peer review]]. In the case of global warming, many governmental reports, the media in many countries, and environmental groups, have stated that there is virtually unanimous [[scientific consensus|scientific agreement]] that human-caused global warming is real and poses a serious concern.&lt;ref name=1997_Call_for_Action&gt;

The authors found that 3974 of the abstracts expressed a position on anthropogenic global warming, and that 97.1% of those endorsed the consensus that humans are causing global warming.

In 2014, a letter from 52 leading skeptics was published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry supporting the scientific consensus and asking the media to stop referring to deniers as "skeptics." The letter clarified the skeptical opinion on climate and denial: "As scientific skeptics, we are well aware of political efforts to undermine climate science by those who deny reality but do not engage in scientific research or consider evidence that their deeply held opinions are wrong. The most appropriate word to describe the behavior of those individuals is 'denial'. Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers. But virtually all deniers have falsely branded themselves as skeptics. By perpetrating this misnomer, journalists have granted undeserved credibility to those who reject science and scientific inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.csicop.org/news/show/deniers_are_not_skeptics | title=Deniers are not Skeptics | year=2014| publisher=Skeptical Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authority of the IPCC ===
{{Main|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}

The "standard" view of climate change has come to be defined by the reports of the IPCC, which is supported by many other [[Scientific opinion on climate change|science academies and scientific organizations]]. In 2001, sixteen of the world's national science academies made a joint statement on climate change, and gave their support for the IPCC.&lt;ref name=royalsoc01&gt;{{cite web

In an open letter to the IPCC, which they sent to numerous members of the US Congress, Singer, Seitz, and Nierenberg accused Santer of making "unauthorized" changes to the IPCC report [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They followed this with an op-ed piece in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' titled "A Major Deception on Global Warming". This piece was written by Seitz, in which he states that the effect of the changes was "to deceive policy makers and the public".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Santer replied, in a letter to the editor of ''The Wall Street Journal'', and in the response he explained that he had made changes, but those changes were in response to the peer review process. In other words, totally normal scientific practice...This account was corroborated by the Chairman of the IPCC and by all of the other authors of the chapters. In fact, over 40 scientists were co-authors of this chapter. This letter was signed by Santer and 40 others and published in ''The Wall Street Journal'' in June 1996. And Santer was also formally defended by the American Meteorological Society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But neither Seitz nor Singer ever retracted the charges, which was then repeated—many times, over and over again—by industry groups and think-tanks. And in fact, if you google "Ben Santer", these same charges are still in the Internet today. In fact, one site said that it was ''proven'' in 1996 that Santer had fraudulently altered the IPCC report.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Synthesis and Executive summaries; the full reports attract less attention. Some of the controversy and criticism has originated from experts invited by the IPCC to submit reports or serve on its panels.

While some critics have argued that the IPCC overstates likely global warming, others have made the opposite criticism.

The "standard" set of scenarios for future atmospheric greenhouse gases are the IPCC [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]] scenarios. The purpose of the range of scenarios is not to predict what exact course the future of emissions will take, but what it may take under a range of possible population, economic and societal trends.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Increasing scarcity of fossil fuels alone will not stop emissions growth in time. The stocks of hydrocarbons that are profitable to extract are more than enough to take the world to levels of {{CO2}} well beyond 750 ppm with very dangerous consequences for climate change impacts.

[[Scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming]] express varied opinions concerning the cause of global warming. Some say only that it has not yet been ascertained whether humans are the primary cause of global warming; others attribute global warming to natural variation; [[ocean current]]s; increased [[solar variation|solar activity]] or [[cosmic ray]]s. The consensus position is that solar radiation may have increased by 0.12&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; since 1750, compared to 1.6 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the net anthropogenic forcing.&lt;ref name="4ARSPM"&gt;

A few studies say that the present level of solar activity is historically high as determined by sunspot activity and other factors. Solar activity could affect climate either by variation in the Sun's output or, more speculatively, by an indirect effect on the amount of [[Solar variation#Effects on clouds|cloud formation]]. [[Sami Solanki|Solanki]] and co-workers suggest that solar activity for the last 60 to 70 years may be at its highest level in 8,000 years, however they said  "that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades", and concluded that "at the most 30% of the strong warming since then can be of solar origin".&lt;ref&gt;

However, these findings are not relevant to any debates about modern climate change. Our results show that the observed rapid rise in global mean temperatures seen after 1985 cannot be ascribed to solar variability, whichever of the mechanisms is invoked and no matter how much the solar variation is amplified.

The overall aerosol and cloud induced surface climate forcing is ~ 1 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; decade&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and has most probably strongly contributed to the recent rapid warming in Europe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature]] group carried out an independent assessment of land temperature records, which examined issues raised by skeptics, such as the urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data selection bias. The preliminary results, made public in October 2011, found that these factors had not biased the results obtained by NOAA, the [[Hadley Centre]] together with the [[Climatic Research Unit]] ([[HadCRUT]]) and NASA's GISS in earlier studies. The group also confirmed that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911&amp;nbsp;°C, and their results closely matched those obtained from these earlier studies. The four papers they had produced had been submitted for peer review.&lt;ref name=Nature1011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111020/full/news.2011.607.html|title=Different method, same result: global warming is real |author=Jeff Tollefson |work=[[Nature News]]|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011|doi=10.1038/news.2011.607|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114232522/http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111020/full/news.2011.607.html|deadurl=yes|archivedate=14 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111021144716.htm|title=Cooling the Warming Debate: Major New Analysis Confirms That Global Warming Is Real|work=[[Science Daily]]|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/20/global-warming-study-climate-sceptics|title=Global warming study finds no grounds for climate sceptics' concerns|author=Ian Sample|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21533360|title=Climate change: The heat is on|work=[[The Economist]]|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tropospheric temperature ====
General circulation models and basic physical considerations predict that in the tropics the temperature of the [[troposphere]] should increase more rapidly than the temperature of the surface. A 2006 report to the [[U.S. Climate Change Science Program]] noted that models and observations agreed on this amplification for monthly and interannual time scales but not for decadal time scales in most observed data sets. Improved measurement and analysis techniques have reconciled this discrepancy: corrected buoy and [[List of climate research satellites|satellite]] surface temperatures are slightly cooler and corrected satellite and [[radiosonde]] measurements of the tropical troposphere are slightly warmer.&lt;ref&gt;

There has been a public dispute regarding the apparent contradiction in the observed behavior of [[Antarctica]], as opposed to the global rise in temperatures measured elsewhere in the world.

In contrast to the popular press, there is no evidence of a corresponding controversy in the scientific community. Observations unambiguously show the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] to be warming.

=== Climate sensitivity ===
As defined by the IPCC, [[climate sensitivity]] is the "equilibrium temperature rise that would occur for a doubling of {{CO2}} concentration above pre-industrial levels".&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexessglossary-a-d.html Glossary A-D]: "Climate Sensitivity", in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2007 Fourth Assessment Report, IPCC said that climate sensitivity is "likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C with a best estimate of about 3&amp;nbsp;°C".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains2-3.html SYR 2.3: Climate sensitivity and feedbacks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a combination of surface temperature history and ocean heat content, [[Stephen E. Schwartz]] has proposed an estimate of [[climate sensitivity]] of 1.9 ± 1.0&amp;nbsp;K for doubled {{Co2}}.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/pubs/HeatCapCommentResponse.pdf Response to Comments on "Heat capacity, time constant, and sensitivity of Earth's climate system"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703194056/http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/steve/pubs/HeatCapCommentResponse.pdf# |date=3 July 2008 }}.

[[Roy Spencer (meteorologist)|Roy Spencer]] ''et al.'' suggested "a net reduction in radiative input into the ocean-atmosphere system" in tropical intraseasonal oscillations "may potentially support" the idea of an "Iris" effect, although they point out that their work is concerned with much shorter time scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cloud and radiation budget changes associated with tropical intraseasonal oscillations |author=Spencer, Roy W., Braswell, William D., Christy, John R. &amp; Hnilo, Justin |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34 |issue=15 |pages=L15707 |doi=10.1029/2007GL029698 |year=2007 |url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/Spencer_07GRL.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=2007GeoRL..3415707S |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103925/http://www.weatherquestions.com/Spencer_07GRL.pdf |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional projections of future temperature rises depend on estimates of future anthropogenic GHG emissions (see [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]]), those [[Climate change feedback|positive and negative climate change feedbacks]] that have so far been incorporated into the models, and the [[climate sensitivity]]. Models referenced by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) predict that global temperatures are likely to increase by 1.1 to 6.4&amp;nbsp;°C (2.0 to 11.5&amp;nbsp;°F) between 1990 and 2100. Others have proposed that temperature increases may be higher than IPCC estimates. One theory is that the climate may reach a "[[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]]" where positive feedback effects lead to runaway global warming; such feedbacks include decreased reflection of solar radiation as sea ice melts, exposing darker seawater, and the potential release of large volumes of methane from thawing permafrost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0916-09.htm |title=Global Warming 'Past the Point of No Return' |author=Steve Connor |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=16 September 2005 |accessdate=7 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203231238/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0916-09.htm |archivedate=3 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Dr. Bert Bolin, in a speech to the National Academy of Sciences, predicted that by the year 2000, there would be a 25% increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere compared to the levels in 1859.

A 2007 study by [[David Douglass (physicist)|David Douglass]] and coworkers, concluded that the 22 most commonly used [[global climate model]]s used by the IPCC were unable to accurately predict accelerated warming in the [[troposphere]] although they did match actual surface warming, concluding "projections of future climate based on these models should be viewed with much caution". This result went against a similar study of 19 models which found that discrepancies between model predictions and actual temperature were likely due to measurement errors.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily_1207"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071211101623.htm|title=New Study Increases Concerns About Climate Model Reliability|accessdate=4 April 2008 |date=20 December 2007 |publisher=Sciencedaily.com}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forecasts confidence ===
The IPCC states it has increased confidence in forecasts coming from General Circulation Models or GCMs. Chapter 8 of AR4 reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''There is considerable confidence that climate models provide credible quantitative estimates of future climate change, particularly at continental scales and above. This confidence comes from the foundation of the models in accepted physical principles and from their ability to reproduce observed features of current climate and past climate changes. Confidence in model estimates is higher for some climate variables (e.g., temperature) than for others (e.g., precipitation). Over several decades of development, models have consistently provided a robust and unambiguous picture of significant climate warming in response to increasing greenhouse gases.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter8.pdf |title=Climate Models and Their Evaluation |format=PDF |accessdate=29 August 2010}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sherwood Boehlert]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|House Science Committee]], told his fellow Republican Joe Barton it was a "misguided and illegitimate investigation" seemingly intended to "intimidate scientists rather than to learn from them, and to substitute congressional political review for scientific review".

On 15 July, Mann wrote giving his detailed response to Barton and Whitfield. He emphasised that the full data and necessary methods information was already publicly available in full accordance with [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) requirements, so that other scientists had been able to reproduce their work. NSF policy was that computer codes are considered the intellectual property of researchers and are not subject to disclosure, but notwithstanding these property rights, the program used to generate the original MBH98 temperature reconstructions had been made available at the Mann et al. public [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] site.&lt;ref name="urlwww.realclimate.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/Mann_response_to_Barton.pdf |title=Letter to Chairman Barton and Chairman Whitfield |author=Michael E.

A ''[[Washington Post]]'' editorial on 23 July which described the investigation as harassment quoted Bradley as saying it was "intrusive, far-reaching and intimidating", and Alan I. Leshner of the AAAS describing it as unprecedented in the 22 years he had been a government scientist; he thought it could "have a chilling effect on the willingness of people to work in areas that are politically relevant".&lt;ref name="wapo Witches" /&gt; Congressman Boehlert said the investigation was as "at best foolhardy" with the tone of the letters showing the committee's inexperience in relation to science.&lt;ref name="beeb 18 July 2005" /&gt;

Barton was given support by global warming sceptic [[Myron Ebell]] of the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], who said "We've always wanted to get the science on trial&amp;nbsp;... we would like to figure out a way to get this into a court of law," and "this could work".&lt;ref name="beeb 18 July 2005" /&gt; In his ''Junk Science'' column on [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]], [[Steven Milloy]] said Barton's inquiry was reasonable.&lt;ref name="Milloy FOXNews.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,163999,00.html |title=Tree Ring Circus |author=Steven Milloy |authorlink=Steven Milloy |date=31 July 2005 |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |quote= |accessdate=9 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208112922/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,163999,00.html |archive-date=8 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005 [[David Legates]] alleged in a newspaper op-ed that the issue showed climate scientists not abiding by data access requirements and suggested that legislators might ultimately take action to enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/comm/environment_and_public_works/general/repweeklycloser/TheWeeklyCloser9_23_05.pdf|title=The Weekly Closer from U.S. Senate, September&amp;nbsp;23,&amp;nbsp;2005.|format=PDF|accessdate=29 December 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074617/https://www.senate.gov/comm/environment_and_public_works/general/repweeklycloser/TheWeeklyCloser9_23_05.pdf| archivedate = 28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climatologist [[Kevin E. Trenberth]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The SPM [Summary for policymakers] was approved line by line by governments[...] The argument here is that the scientists determine what can be said, but the governments determine how it can best be said. Negotiations occur over wording to ensure accuracy, balance, clarity of message, and relevance to understanding and policy. The IPCC process is dependent on the good will of the participants in producing a balanced assessment. However, in Shanghai, it appeared that there were attempts to blunt, and perhaps obfuscate, the messages in the report, most notably by Saudi Arabia. This led to very protracted debates over wording on even bland and what should be uncontroversial text... The most contentious paragraph in the IPCC (2001) SPM was the concluding one on attribution. After much debate, the following was carefully crafted: "In the light of new evidence, and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Journal of the Forum for Environmental Law, Science, Engineering, and Finance|year=2001|issue=8–26|first=Kevin|last=Trenberth|authorlink=Kevin E.

As more evidence has become available over the existence of global warming debate has moved to further controversial issues{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}, including:

# The social and environmental impacts
# The appropriate response to climate change
# Whether decisions require less uncertainty

The single largest issue is the importance of a few degrees rise in temperature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most people say, "A few degrees? So what? If I change my thermostat a few degrees, I'll live fine."&amp;nbsp;... [The] point is that one or two degrees is about the experience that we have had in the last 10,000 years, the era of human civilization. There haven't been—globally averaged, we're talking—fluctuations of more than a degree or so. So we're actually getting into uncharted territory from the point of view of the relatively benign climate of the last 10,000 years, if we warm up more than a degree or two. ([[Stephen H. Schneider]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's up with the weather: the debate: Stephen H.

The other point that leads to major controversy—because it could have significant economic impacts—is whether action (usually, restrictions on the use of [[fossil fuel]]s to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions) should be taken now, or in the near future; and whether those restrictions would have any meaningful effect on global temperature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Because of the economic ramifications of such restrictions, there are those, including the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]], who argue that the negative economic effects of emission controls outweigh the environmental benefits.&lt;ref name="taylorspeech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/speeches/sp-jt011698.html|title=Global Warming, the Anatomy of a Debate: A speech by Jerry Taylor of the Cato Institute|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124172640/http://www.cato.org/speeches/sp-jt011698.html |deadurl=yes|archivedate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that even if global warming is caused solely by the burning of fossil fuels, restricting their use would have more damaging effects on the world economy than the increases in global temperature.&lt;ref name="PBSpalmer" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The linkage between coal, electricity, and economic growth in the United States is as clear as it can be. And it is required for the way we live, the way we work, for our economic success, and for our future. Coal-fired electricity generation.

[[Council on Foreign Relations]] senior fellow [[Walter Russell Mead]] argues that the 2009 [[Copenhagen Summit]] failed because environmentalists have changed from "Bambi to Godzilla". According to Mead, environmentalist used to represent the skeptical few who made valid arguments against big government programs which tried to impose simple but massive solutions on complex situations. Environmentalists' more recent advocacy for big economic and social intervention against global warming, according to Mead, has made them, "the voice of the establishment, of the tenured, of the technocrats" and thus has lost them the support of a public which is increasingly skeptical of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Will|Will, George]], "[http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 When Bambi becomes Godzilla] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909234738/http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 |date=9 September 2010 }}", ''[[The Denver Post]]'', 5 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various campaigns such as [[350.org]] and many [[Greenpeace]] projects have been started in an effort to push the world's leaders towards changing laws and policies that would effectively reduce the world's carbon emissions and use of non-renewable energy resources.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Kyoto Protocol ===
{{Main|Kyoto Protocol}}

The Kyoto Protocol is the most prominent international agreement on climate change, and is also highly controversial. Some argue that it goes too far&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Kyoto: Climate Change and What it Means to Canadians: Does the Kyoto treaty go far enough... or too far?|first=Ian|last=Darragh|publisher=[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]|year=1998|url=http://www.iisd.org/pdf/kyotoprimer_en.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; or not nearly far enough&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/kpstats.pdf|publisher=UNFCCC|title=Kyoto protocol status|accessdate=7 November 2006|format=PDF}} ([[Niue]],The [[Cook Islands]], [[Nauru]] consider reductions "inadequate")&lt;/ref&gt; in restricting emissions of greenhouse gases. Another area of controversy is the fact that China and India, the world's two most populous countries, both ratified the protocol but are not required to reduce or even limit the growth of carbon emissions under the present agreement even though when [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita|listed by greenhouse gas emissions per capita]], they have rankings of 121st largest per capita emitter at 3.9 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] and 162nd largest per capita emitter at 1.8 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] respectively, compared with for example the U.S. at position of the 14th largest per capita [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]] emitter at 22.9 Tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{CO2}}e]]. Nevertheless, China is the world's second largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions, and India 4th (see: [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|countries by greenhouse emissions]]).

=== Funding ===
{{See also|Climate change denial}}
The [[Global Climate Coalition]] was an industry coalition that funded several scientists who expressed skepticism about global warming. In the year 2000, several members left the coalition when they became the target of a national divestiture campaign run by [[John Passacantando]] and [[Phil Radford]] at Ozone Action.

=== Debate over most effective response to warming ===
{{See also|list of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming}}

In recent years some skeptics have changed their positions regarding global warming. [[Ronald Bailey]], author of ''Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths'' (published by the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] in 2002), stated in 2005, "Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up."&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, he wrote "Details like sea level rise will continue to be debated by researchers, but if the debate over whether or not humanity is contributing to global warming wasn't over before, it is now.... as the new IPCC Summary makes clear, climate change [[Pollyanna principle|Pollyannaism]] is no longer looking very tenable."&lt;ref&gt;

"There are alternatives to its [the climate-change crusade's] insistence that the only appropriate policy response is steep and immediate emissions reductions.... a greenhouse-gas-emissions cap ultimately would constrain energy production. A sensible climate policy would emphasize building resilience into our capacity to adapt to climate changes.... we should consider strategies of adaptation to a changing climate. A rise in the sea level need not be the end of the world, as the Dutch have taught us." says Steven F. Hayward of [[American Enterprise Institute]], a conservative think-tank.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2001, Richard Lindzen, asked whether it was necessary to try to reduce {{CO2}} emissions, said that responses needed to be prioritised. "You can't just say, 'No matter what the cost, and no matter how little the benefit, we'll do this'. If we truly believe in warming, then we've already decided we're going to adjust...The reason we adjust to things far better than Bangladesh is that we're richer. Wouldn't you think it makes sense to make sure we're as robust and wealthy as possible? And that the poor of the world are also as robust and wealthy as possible?"&lt;ref&gt;

The [[George W. Bush]] administration also voiced support for an adaptation-only policy in the US in 2002. "In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a climate report [''U.S. Climate Action Report 2002''] to the United Nations detailing specific and far-reaching effects it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. In the report, the administration also for the first time places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions—mainly the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere." The report however "does not propose any major shift in the administration's policy on greenhouse gases. Instead it recommends adapting to inevitable changes instead of making rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gases to limit warming."&lt;ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Despite conceding that our consumption of fossil fuels is causing serious damage and despite implying that current policy is inadequate, the Report fails to take the next step and recommend serious alternatives. Rather, it suggests that we simply need to accommodate to the coming changes. For example, reminiscent of former Interior Secretary Hodel's proposal that the government address the hole in the ozone layer by encouraging Americans to make better use of sunglasses, suntan lotion and broad-brimmed hats, the Report suggests that we can deal with heat-related health impacts by increased use of air-conditioning&amp;nbsp;... Far from proposing solutions to the climate change problem, the Administration has been adopting energy policies that would actually increase greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, even as the Report identifies increased air conditioner use as one of the 'solutions' to climate change impacts, the Department of Energy has decided to roll back energy efficiency standards for air conditioners.|sign=Letter from 11 State Attorneys General to George W.

Some find this shift and attitude disingenuous and indicative of an inherent bias against prevention (i.e. reducing emissions/consumption) and for the prolonging of profits to the oil industry at the expense of the environment. "Now that the dismissal of climate change is no longer fashionable, the professional deniers are trying another means of stopping us from taking action. It would be cheaper, they say, to wait for the impacts of climate change and then adapt to them" says writer and environmental activist George Monbiot&lt;ref&gt;

=== Political pressure on scientists ===
Many climate scientists state that they are put under enormous pressure to distort or hide any scientific results which suggest that human activity is to blame for global warming. A survey of climate scientists which was reported to the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2007, noted "Nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words 'climate change', 'global warming' or other similar terms from a variety of communications." These scientists were pressured to tailor their reports on global warming to fit the Bush administration's climate change scepticism. In some cases, this occurred at the request of former oil-industry lobbyist Phil Cooney, who worked for the American Petroleum Institute before becoming chief of staff at the White House Council on Environmental Quality (he resigned in 2005, before being hired by ExxonMobil).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070402170841/http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn11074 US climate scientists pressured on climate change], NewScientist, 31 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, a report by NASA's Office of the Inspector General concluded that NASA staff appointed by the White House had censored and suppressed scientific data on global warming in order to protect the Bush administration from controversy close to the 2004 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goddard |first=Jacqui |url=http://news.scotsman.com/world/Nasa-39played-down39-global-.4147975.jp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124090521/http://news.scotsman.com/world/Nasa-39played-down39-global-.4147975.jp |archivedate=24 November 2010 |title=Nasa 'played down' global warming to protect Bush|newspaper=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |accessdate=12 February 2010 |date=4 June 2008 &lt;!-- https://www.webcitation.org/5nU8o9ZoY?url=http://news.scotsman.com/world/Nasa-39played-down39-global-.4147975.jp --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen]], director of NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]], wrote in a widely cited ''New York Times'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew C.|last=Revkin|title=Climate Expert Says NASA Tried to Silence Him|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 January 2006|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/science/earth/29climate.html?ei=5088&amp;en=28e236da0977ee7f&amp;ex=1296190800&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in 2006, that his superiors at the agency were trying to "censor" information "going out to the public". [[NASA]] denied this, saying that it was merely requiring that scientists make a distinction between personal, and official government, views in interviews conducted as part of work done at the agency. Several scientists working at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] have made similar complaints;&lt;ref&gt;Eilperin, J. (6 April 2006) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/05/AR2006040502150_pf.html "Climate Researchers Feeling Heat From White House"] ''The Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; once again, government officials said they were enforcing long-standing policies requiring government scientists to clearly identify personal opinions as such when participating in public interviews and forums.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The [[BBC]]'s long-running current affairs series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' recently investigated the issue, and was told, "scientific reports about global warming have been systematically changed and suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Climate chaos: Bush's climate of fear|publisher=BBC Panorama|date=1 June 2006|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5005994.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists who agree with the consensus view have sometimes expressed concerns over what they view as sensationalism of global warming by interest groups and the press. For example, [[Mike Hulme]], director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Research, wrote how increasing use of pejorative terms like "catastrophic", "chaotic" and "irreversible", had altered the public discourse around climate change: "This discourse is now characterised by phrases such as 'climate change is worse than we thought', that we are approaching 'irreversible tipping in the Earth's climate', and that we are 'at the point of no return'. I have found myself increasingly chastised by climate change campaigners when my public statements and lectures on climate change have not satisfied their thirst for environmental drama and exaggerated rhetoric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chaotic world of climate truth|first=Mike|last=Hulme|publisher=BBC News|date=4 November 2006|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6115644.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an Associated Press release on 30 January 2007,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Climate scientists at seven government agencies say they have been subjected to political pressure aimed at downplaying the threat of global warming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The groups presented a survey that shows two in five of the 279 climate scientists who responded to a questionnaire complained that some of their scientific papers had been edited in a way that changed their meaning. Nearly half of the 279 said in response to another question that at some point they had been told to delete reference to "global warming" or "climate change" from a report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Groups Say Scientists Pressured On Warming|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[Associated Press]]|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=14 April 2007|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/30/politics/main2413400.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics writing in ''The Wall Street Journal'' editorial page state that the survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Timothy|last1=Donaghy|first2=Jennifer|last2=Freeman|first3=Francesca|last3=Grifo|first4=Karly|last4=Kaufman|first5=Tarek|last5=Maassarani|first6=Lexi|last6=Shultz|chapter=Appendix A: UCS Climate Scientist Survey Text and Responses (Federal)|title=Atmosphere of Pressure&amp;nbsp;– Political Interference in Federal Climate Science|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] &amp; [[Government Accountability Project]]|date=February 2007|chapter-url=http://www.whistleblower.org/storage/documents/AtmosphereOfPressure.pdf|chapter-format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325053150/http://www.whistleblower.org/storage/documents/AtmosphereOfPressure.pdf|archivedate=25 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the pressure from politicians, many prominent scientists working on climate change issues have reported increasingly severe harassment from members of the public. The harassment has taken several forms. The US [[FBI]] told [[ABC News]] that it was looking into a spike in threatening emails sent to climate scientists, while a white supremacist website posted pictures of several climate scientists with the word "Jew" next to each image. One climate scientist interviewed by ABC News had a dead animal dumped on his doorstep and now frequently has to travel with bodyguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC World News Sunday|publisher=ABC News|date=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Virginia Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]] claimed that leading climate scientist [[Michael E. Mann]] had possibly violated state fraud laws, and without providing any evidence of wrongdoing, filed the [[Attorney General of Virginia's climate science investigation]] as a civil demand that the [[University of Virginia]] provide a wide range of records broadly related to five research grants Mann had obtained as an assistant professor at the university from 1999 to 2005. This litigation was widely criticized in the academic community as politically motivated and likely to have a chilling effect on future research.&lt;ref name="AAAS2010-05-18"&gt;

Exxon Mobil is also notorious for skewing scientific evidence through their private funding of scientific organizations. In 2002, Exxon Mobil contributed $10,000 to The Independent Institute and then $10,000 more in 2003. In 2003, The Independent Institute release a study that reported the evidence for imminent global warming found during the Clinton administration was based on now-dated satellite findings and wrote off the evidence and findings as a product of "bad science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reddy|first=Sudhakara|title=The Great Climate Debate|journal=Energy Policy|year=2009|volume=37|issue=8|pages=2997–3008|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2009.03.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not the only consortium of skeptics that Exxon Mobil has supported financially. The George C. Marshall Institute received $630,000 in funding for climate change research from ExxonMobil between 1998 and 2005. Exxon Mobil also gave $472,000 in funding to The Board of Academic and Scientific Advisors for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow from 1998 to 2005. Dr. Frederick Seitz, well known as "the godfather of global warming skepticism", served as both Chairman Emeritus of The George C. Marshall Institute and a board member of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow from 1998 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Granados|first=Oriana Zill|title=The Doubters of Global Warming|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/hotpolitics/reports/skeptics.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=19 February 2014|date=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Litigation ===
Several lawsuits have been filed over global warming. For example, [[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] allowed the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] to [[Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act|regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act]]. A similar approach was taken by California Attorney General [[Bill Lockyer]] who filed a lawsuit [[California v. General Motors Corp.]] to force car manufacturers to reduce vehicles' emissions of carbon dioxide. This lawsuit was found to lack legal merit and was tossed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lifsher |first=Marc |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |title=Global warming lawsuit dismissed |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/18/business/fi-warmsuit18 |deadurl=no |archivedate=4 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004161743/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/18/business/fi-warmsuit18 |date=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tanner |first=Adam |publisher=Reuters |title=Calif. suit on car greenhouse gases dismissed |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/18/us-california-autos-idUSN1736580020070918 |deadurl=no |archivedate=15 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215065243/https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/18/us-california-autos-idUSN1736580020070918 |date=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third case, [[Comer v.

==== Kelsey Cascade, Rose Juliana et. al. vs. United States ====

In a lawsuit organized by activist organization Our Children's Trust, a group of plaintiffs aged 8–19 sued the U. S. Federal Government, claiming "the government has known for decades that carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) pollution has been causing catastrophic climate change and has failed to take necessary action to curtail fossil fuel emissions." On April 8, 2016, U. S. Magistrate Judge Thomas Coffin denied defendant's motion to dismiss, arguing plaintiffs have standing to sue because they will be disproportionately affected by the alleged damages. "The intractability of the debates before Congress and state legislatures and the alleged valuing of short term economic interest despite the cost to human life," argued Coffin, "necessitates a need for the courts to evaluate the constitutional parameters of the action or inaction taken by the government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourchildrenstrust.org/sites/default/files/16.04.08.OrderDenyingMTD.pdf Findings and Recommendation 6:15-cv-1517-TC]&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote=(p1) ... there is a strong, credible body of evidence, based on multiple lines of research, documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities. While much remains to be learned, the core phenomenon, scientific questions, and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations. * * * (p21-22) Some scientific conclusions or theories have been so thoroughly examined and tested, and supported by so many independent observations and results, that their likelihood of subsequently being found to be wrong is vanishingly small. Such conclusions and theories are then regarded as settled facts. This is the case for the conclusions that the Earth system is warming and that much of this warming is very likely due to human activities.

These works fulfill a wide variety of purposes often seen in government publications, primarily educating the public about government programs or lifestyle choices the government wants to encourage. Richard L. Graham examines and dissects the United States' government comics in ''Government Issue: Comics for the People, 1940s-2000s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.abramsbooks.com/2011/11/10/government-issue-comics-for-the-people/ |title=Government Issue: Comics for the People |publisher=Blog.abramsbooks.com |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== History of implementation ===
In 1942, the [[Advertising Research Foundation]] conducted a study which found that "for adults, the most widely read non-advertising feature in newspapers was the [[comic strip]]."{{sfn|Graham|2011|p=16}} In an effort to boost public support for ongoing foreign policies, the government looked to this study, and tried to persuade and suggest themes and ideas of soldiers and America as a whole, for artists to include in their weekly publications. Government officials understood that [[comics]] "have the capacity to simplify even the most crucial civic issues and shape public opinion." Not being satisfied with the images found in local papers and national magazines, the government went a step farther and began publishing their own comics. The intentions behind these publications were to "reinforce the government's expectations about the preferred cultural identity of the country." When examining government issued comics, it is important to realize that they give us an idea of the government's "idealized or assumed 'American experience'."{{Sfn|Graham|2011|p=12}}  The themes and ideas found within the comics written and distributed by the government
"express the government's attempts to recognize and address the nation's attitudes and concerns."{{sfn|Graham|2011|p=13}}

=== Artists ===
These comics were mainly printed by federal agencies, but the government also commissioned works printed by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[Harvey Comics|Harvey]], and [[DC Comics]].
{{Sfn|Graham|2011|p=11}} Some of the more well known artists within the comic world were also an integral part of creating and popularizing government issued comics. [[Will Eisner]], an army veteran, created the character "Joe Dope", and contributed to the creation of [[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]], which published illustrated pamphlets to complement other army publications. Before he was Dr. Seuss, [[Theodor Seuss Geisel]] also wrote and drew for the government. After becoming a captain in the army, Geisel worked in the animation branch, "where he wrote episodes of [[Private Snafu]], a series of cartoon shorts for soldiers." Along
with [[Munro Leaf]], Geisel created an illustrated pamphlet for the army, which addressed the problems of malaria. Another famous artist commissioned by the government was [[Walt Disney]]. While Walt Disney Studios in California "became extensive 'war plants', housing mountains of munitions", artists were also developing characters for the comic ''Winter Draws On'', a manual of sorts, for the [[United States Army Air Forces]].{{Sfn|Graham|2011|p=17}}

=== Distribution and target audience ===
These comics were "distributed at schools, civic events, and recruiting offices; they were inserted in local newspapers and national magazines", and can be found online on official government sites.{{Sfn|Graham|2011|p=12}} The target audience for these comics included "women, children, workers, ethnic groups, and immigrants."
{{sfn|Graham|2011|p=15}} The Federal Civil Defense Administration "produced comics designed to teach children how to survive everything from natural disasters—such as fires or earthquakes—to an atomic holocaust." By addressing the children, they could then in turn "get the word out to their parents about what families could do to protect themselves: build home shelters, stockpile canned goods and bottled water, learn first aid, and drop to the ground if they happened to get caught outside during an atomic blast." One example of these targeting
tactics is Bert the Turtle, "likely the most famous pop icon of the Atomic Age", from the comic [[Duck and Cover]]. "The strategy behind Bert was to have a cartoon animal stand-in soften the blow when a topic was too scary to deal with directly."{{Sfn|Graham|2011|p=139}}

== Examples of government comics ==
===''Coming Home''===
''Coming Home'' is a graphic novel written by [[Sid Jacobson]] and [[Ernie Colón]], published by the [[Ceridian Corporation]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryonesource.mil/products?program=deployment%7Ccontent_id=267850|title=Products - Military OneSource|website=www.militaryonesource.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended for educational purposes for military members, veterans, and family members. The novel centers around three main characters, each previously active-duty members in the military dealing with the transition of coming back home. The struggles of the transition from combat back to family life are shown through each of the character's individual struggles.

=== ''Preparedness 101: Zombie Pandemic'' ===
In ''Preparedness 101: Zombie Pandemic'', the CDC frames a real survival lesson in the entertaining zombie narrative. The story depicts a zombie apocalypse from the perspective of two residents of an unnamed town in southeast America, with an interlude showing the [[Center for Disease Control]]'s attempts to counter the pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contentdm.unl.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/comics/id/256/rec/1 |title=Preparedness 101: Zombie Pandemic :: Government Comics |publisher=Contentdm.unl.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic utilizes the zombie narrative's ability to "fulfill survivalist fantasies."&lt;ref&gt; Bishop, Kyle William.

== Haman in the Hebrew Bible ==
[[File:Esther Denouncing Haman.jpg|300px|thumb|Esther denouncing Haman by [[Ernest Normand]]]]
Haman is described as the son of [[List of Biblical names starting with H|Hammedatha]] the Agagite, and his wife Amathlai.&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /&gt; In the story, Haman instigates a plot to [[genocide|kill all]] of the [[Jews]] of ancient Persia. Haman attempts to convince Ahasuerus to order the killing of [[Mordecai]] and all the Jews of the lands he ruled. The plot is foiled by Queen [[Esther]], the king's recent wife, who is herself a Jew. Haman is hanged from the [[gallows]] that had originally been built, on the advice of his wife [[Zeresh]], to hang Mordecai. The dead bodies of his ten sons Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha (or Vajezatha), are also hanged after they die in battle trying to kill the Jews (Esther 9:5-14). Haman is upset that Mordecai refuses to bow down to him, as told in chapter 3:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
. . . and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes who were with him. And all the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, bowed, and did obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow, or do him obeisance. (Esther, 3:1-2)&lt;ref name="Esther - Chapter 3 - Esther"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=16476 |title=Esther - Chapter 3 - Esther |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt; or do him obedience, then Haman was full of wrath. But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had told him of the people of Mordecai; so that Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai''. (Esther, 3:5-6)&lt;ref name="Esther - Chapter 3 - Esther"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Queen Esther, learning that her people are in danger, risks her own life to spare the Jews living in Ancient Persia.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, "Who is he? Where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?" 6 Esther said, "The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman." Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen. 7 The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life. 8 Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, "Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?" 9 As soon as the word left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
9 Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, "A gallows 50 feet [b] high stands by Haman's house. He had it made for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king." 10  The king said, "Hang him on it!" 10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's fury subsided.'' (Esther, 7:6-10)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=16480 |title=Esther - Chapter 7 - Esther |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

or

&lt;blockquote&gt;
9 Then Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs, said, "Haman has set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet tall in his own courtyard. He intended to use it to [[Impalement|impale]] Mordecai, the man who saved the king from assassination." "Then impale Haman on it!" the king ordered. 10 So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai, and the king's anger subsided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlivingtranslation.com/05discoverthenlt/ssresults.asp?txtSearchString=ESTHER+7:9-10|title=New Living Translation™: Discover The NLT - Scripture Search|author=|date=|website=www.newlivingtranslation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Haman in other Jewish sources ==
=== Midrash ===
{{main|Haman in rabbinic literature}}
In [[Midrash|Rabbinical tradition]], Haman is considered to be an archetype of evil and persecutor of the Jews. Having attempted to exterminate the Jews of Persia, and rendering himself thereby their worst enemy, Haman naturally became the center of many Talmudic legends. Being at one time in extreme want, he sold himself as a slave to Mordechai (Meg. 15a). He was a barber at Kefar Karzum for the space of twenty-two years (ib. 16a). Haman had an idolatrous image embroidered on his garments, so that those who bowed to him at command of the king bowed also to the image (Esth. R. vii.).

Haman was also an [[astrologer]], and when he was about to fix the time for the genocide of the Jews he first [[cast lots]] to ascertain which was the most auspicious day of the week for that purpose.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt; Each day, however, proved to be under some influence favorable to the Jews.&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /&gt; He then sought to fix the month, but found that the same was true of each month; thus, [[Nisan]] was favorable to the Jews because of the [[Passover]] sacrifice; [[Iyyar]], because of the small Passover.&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /&gt; But when he arrived at [[Adar]] he found that its zodiacal sign was [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]], and he said, "Now I shall be able to swallow them as fish which swallow one another" (Esth. R. vii.; Targ. Sheni iii.).&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /&gt;

Haman had 365 counselors, but the advice of none was so good as that of his wife, Zeresh.&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /&gt; She induced Haman to build a gallows for Mordechai, assuring him that this was the only way in which he would be able to prevail over his enemy, for hitherto the just had always been rescued from every other kind of death.&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /&gt; As God foresaw that Haman himself would be hanged on the gallows, He asked which tree would volunteer to serve as the instrument of death. Each tree, declaring that it was used for some holy purpose, objected to being soiled by the unclean body of Haman. Only the thorn-tree could find no excuse, and therefore offered itself for a gallows (Esth. R. ix.; Midr. Abba Gorion vii., ed. Buber, Wilna, 1886; in Targum Sheni this is narrated somewhat differently).

Haman's lineage is given in the [[Targum Sheni]] as follows: "Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, son of Srach, son of Buza, son of Iphlotas, son of Dyosef, son of Dyosim, son of Prome, son of Ma'dei, son of Bla'akan, son of Intimros, son of Haridom, son of Sh'gar, son of Nigar, son of Farmashta, son of Vayezatha, (son of Agag, son of Sumkei,) son of [[Amalek]], son of the concubine of [[Eliphaz]], firstborn son of [[Esau]]". There are apparently several generations omitted between [[Agag]], who was executed by [[Samuel]] the prophet in the time of [[King Saul]], and Amalek, who lived several hundred years earlier.

=== Josephus ===
Haman is mentioned by [[Josephus]] in his [[Antiquities of the Jews]]. Josephus' account of the story is drawn from the [[Septuagint]] translation of the Book of Esther and from other Greek and Jewish sources, some no longer extant.

===Septuagint===
In the [[LXX]], Haman is called a "[[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]]" by [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] (see Esther 16:10). Scholars have had two different explanations for this naming. 1. Macedonian was used to replace the word "Mede", and emphasises this when he also says that there was no Persian blood in him. (In practice the Persians and the [[Medes]] co-ruled an empire, but there was great friction between them.) 2. Another opinion is that Xerxes was calling him a Macedonian Spy, due to his insistence on causing civil war within [[Persia]] between the [[Jews]] and the [[Persian people|Persians]].

== Purim traditions ==
{{Main|Purim}}

The [[Jewish holiday]] of [[Purim]] commemorates the story of the deliverance of the Jews and the defeat of Haman. On that day, the Book of Esther is read publicly and much noise and tumult is raised at every mention of Haman′s name. A type of [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]] noisemaker called in [[Hebrew]] a ''ra'ashan'' (רעשן) (in [[Yiddish]]: "grogger" or "hamandreyir") is used to express disdain for Haman. Pastry known as [[hamentashen|Oznei Haman]] (אזני המן, lit. ''Ears of Haman'') (in Yiddish; Hamentashen) are traditionally eaten on this day.

==Etymology and meaning of the name==
The name has been equated with the Persian name ''Omanes''&lt;ref name=EJ_CDROM&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica CD-ROM Edition 1.0 1997, ''Haman''&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Old Persian]]: 𐎡𐎶𐎴𐎡𐏁 ''Imāniš'') recorded by Greek historians. Several etymologies have been proposed for it: it has been associated with the Persian word ''Hamayun'' meaning "illustrious".&lt;ref name=EJ_CDROM /&gt; (naming dictionaries typically list it as meaning "magnificent"), or with the sacred drink [[Haoma]].&lt;ref name=EJ_CDROM /&gt;  or with the Persian name [[Vohu Manah|Vohuman]] meaning "good thoughts".&lt;ref name="Hosch"&gt;Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century Bible critic Jensen associated it with the [[Elam]]ite god [[Humban]], a view dismissed by later scholars.&lt;ref&gt;A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Book of Esther, Lewis Bayles Paton, The Biblical World, Vol. 33, No. 2 (Feb., 1909)&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ahriman]], a [[Zoroastrian]] spirit of destruction, has also been proposed as an [[etymon]].

==In popular culture==
Haman appeared in ''[[The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible]]'' episode "Queen Esther". The 1994 animated television film ''[[Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights]]'' depicts Haman as an evil vizier to the sultan in its story segment, "[[Aladdin|Aliyah-Din]]". Mr. Lunt portrayed this biblical figure in the 2000 ''[[VeggieTales]]'' episode "Esther the Girl who Became Queen". In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Jewbilee]]," Haman is depicted as the primary antagonist, trying to enter the mortal world once more to rule over the Jews.

[[Image:MTST.jpg|thumb|350px|right|MTST poster for the Quilombo das Guerreiras Occupation.]]

The '''Homeless Workers Movement''' ({{lang-pt|Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto}}. '''MTST''') is a [[shack]]-dwellers' movement in [[Brazil]]. It originated from the [[Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra]] ({{lang-en|Landless Rural Workers' Movement}}) in 1997. It is the biggest organisation of its kind in the country.

Through a combination of direct confrontation and negotiation with the government, it struggles to reduce Brazil's deficit of roughly 8,000,000 housing units by staging [[squatter]]s' occupations in the abandoned government buildings that litter Brazilian cities, resisting the often violent attempts by local governments to evict them and negotiating for their conversion into low-income housing.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} According to the MTST, there are over 5,000,000 housing units available in abandoned buildings in Brazil. The MTST originally emerged as a faction within the MST. MTST, however, focuses on urban instead of rural reform. Although fully autonomous, the organisation has a strategic alliance with the MST and also works closely with other Brazilian urban social movements such as the União Nacional de Moradia Popular ({{lang-en|National Low-income Housing Union}}) and the Centro dos Movimentos Populares ({{lang-en|Center of Popular Social Movements}}).

The movement is politically heterogeneous. On one side, there are branches which resemble a [[Leninist]] political party in terms of structure and hierarchy, and on the other side, branches which are clearly committed to goals such as self-management. There is even a branch (in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]) which works almost as a faction of a political party{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.

[[File:MTST Carapicuíba.JPG|thumb|An occupation by MTST in [[Carapicuíba]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].]]

The homeless movement is the most important social movement in Brazilian cities, since the [[favela]] movement became weaker and weaker since the 1980s (its role was decisive in the 1960s and 1970s resistance against evictions), due to factors such as political clientelism, and the influence of drug traffickers. The homeless also try to co-operate with other emerging social movements, such as "insurgent" [[hip-hop]] groups and, in the case of MTST, with the MST, one of the most important landless organisations.

The best known land occupations conducted by the MTST are:

* João Cândido - Itapecerica da Serra - (2007-)
* Carlos Lamarca - Osasco - (2002-)
* Chico Mendes - Taboão da Serra - (2005 - 2006)
* Santo Dias/"Ocupação da Volks" - São Bernardo do Campo (2003)
* Rosa Luxemburgo - São Paulo /Osasco - (2004)
* Anita Garibaldi - Guarulhos - (2001-)

== Recent Activities ==
MTST was created by the MST in order to ensure representation of land reform advocacy in the urban sphere. According to the João Pinto foundation and with the Ministry of Cities, there are six million Brazilian families that are living in undignified conditions which is a constitutional breach since the constitution of 1988 states that dignified social living conditions are a right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sociologia.uol.com.br/entenda-a-luta-do-mtst/|title=Entenda a luta do MTST {{!}} Sociologia Ciência &amp; Vida|website=sociologia.uol.com.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MTST justifies its activities because of the 1988 constitution where property is defined as a social right. Brazilian cities are often segregated geographically between the wealthy area and the "periferia"which translates to periphery.&lt;ref&gt;''Espaço intra-urbano no Brasil''. São Paulo: Studio Nobel, Fapesp, Lincoln Institute, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time segregated social classes in the  and rising rent is forcing people who were in difficult economic circumstances to move to the outskirts of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Villaça|first=Flávio|date=April 2011|title=São Paulo: segregação urbana e desigualdade|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0103-40142011000100004&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal=Estudos Avançados|volume=25|issue=71|pages=37–58|doi=10.1590/S0103-40142011000100004|issn=0103-4014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Isle of Man]] is a [[Crown Dependencies|Crown Dependency]] located in the [[Irish Sea]] between the islands of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] with a population in 2015 estimated to be approximately 88,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrymeters.info/en/Isle_of_Man Isle of Man Population]&lt;/ref&gt; It enjoys a high degree of domestic, legislative and political autonomy through its ancient Parliament [[Tynwald]]. By convention, the [[United Kingdom Government]] is responsible for the conduct of the international relations and defence of the island.  The Isle of Man does not have a written constitution, or a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] which sets out its [[Human Rights]]. These rights are addressed in the ''Human Rights Act 2001''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/odps/humanrightsact2001.pdf Human Rights Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; The island has also ratified a number of international treaties.

==Legal framework==

===International treaties===
The Isle of Man has ratified six of the nine core human rights treaties. Namely the:
*	[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|(CERD)]]
*	[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|(ICCPR)]]
*	[[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|(ICESCR)]]
*	[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|(CEDAW)]]
*	[[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|(CRC)]]
*	[[Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] [[United Nations Convention against Torture|(UNCAT)]]
As a Crown Dependency, The [[United Kingdom]] [[United Kingdom|(UK)]] is responsible for the international relations for the Isle of Man. The Isle of Man is not subject to the [[Universal Periodic Review]] [[Universal Periodic Review|(UPR)]] process as it is not a member state of the [[United Nations]].  However, in its reports on the UK, the UPR often gives recommendations to the UK to urge its overseas territories to implement its recommendations. The Isle of Man has agreed to some UPR recommendations such as ratifying the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture|Optional Protocol on the Convention against Torture]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/human-rights/uk-upr-mid-term-report-2014.pdf UPR mid-term report 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Convention on Human Rights===
The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] [[European Convention on Human Rights|(ECHR)]] was ratified by the UK in 1951 and in 1953; the UK extended the Convention to the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/offices/cabinet-office/information-archive/government-initiatives/human-rights Information on the Human Rights Act].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ECHR was used in the Isle of Man to protect its citizen’s human rights and fundamental freedoms. The ECHR established the [[European Court of Human Rights]], where any individual who feels his or her rights have been violated under the Convention can take their case to the Court. The judgements of the Court are binding on the States concerned. 
The Convention extends fundamental human rights to individuals such as the [[right to life]], the [[right to a fair trial]] and [[freedom of expression]].

===Human Rights Act 2001===

The ''Human Rights Act'' was passed by Tynwald in 2001 and came fully into force on 1 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/offices/cabinet-office/information-archive/government-initiatives/human-rights Information on the Human Rights Act]&lt;/ref&gt;  This Act is similar in many respects to the [[Human Rights Act 1998|UK Human Rights Act]]. The Act incorporates the fundamental rights and freedoms set out in the ECHR into its domestic law. 
Previously, an Isle of Man resident who believed that their rights had been violated had to go to the Court of Human Rights in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]] to have their case heard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/offices/cabinet-office/information-archive/government-initiatives/human-rights Information on the Human Rights Act]&lt;/ref&gt;  This process could be long and expensive and so the Government decided that the public should be able to guarantee their rights on the Isle of Man.

The ''Human Rights Act'' ensures that all public authorities act in a way which is compliant with the main articles of the ECHR. The rights enshrined within the Act are designed to protect the individual against any abuses by the State. They are not designed to settle disputes between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/offices/cabinet-office/information-archive/government-initiatives/human-rights Information on the Human Rights Act]&lt;/ref&gt;  If the Act cannot be interpreted in a way which complies with the Convention, a declaration of incompatibility can be made. This is a sign to Tynwald that the law should be changed, but there is no obligation for Tynwald to do so. If Tynwald do not amend the law, then the applicant can take their case to the ECHR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.im/about-the-government/offices/cabinet-office/information-archive/government-initiatives/human-rights Information on the Human Rights Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights issues==

===Right to life===
Under pressure from the UK government, and to meet ECHR requirements, the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] was abolished in 1993 on the Isle of Man; however the last execution had not taken place since 1872.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/manx-court-sentences-man-to-be-hanged-1532599.html Manx court sentences man to be hanged]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Isle of Man was the last place in the [[British Isles]] to formally abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/manx-court-sentences-man-to-be-hanged-1532599.html Manx court sentences man to be hanged]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral rights===
The [[House of Keys]] has 24 members, elected for a five-year term. The Isle of Man lowered its voting age from 18 to 16 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislation.gov.im/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/1995/1995-0013/RepresentationofthePeopleAct1995_2.pdf Representation of the People Act 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;  
The Isle of Man became the first action for [[women’s suffrage]] by granting women who owned property the [[suffrage|right to vote]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/world-suffrage-timeline Isle of Man grants women the right to vote]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment rights===
The ''Employment Act 2006'' sets out a number of employee and employer rights on the Isle of Man such as the right to a [[minimum wage]], the right to a minimum [[notice period|period of notice]] and [[unfair dismissal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislation.gov.im/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/2006/2006-0021/EmploymentAct2006_4.pdf Employment Act 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to the ''Miniumum Wage Act 2001'', the Isle of Man has a minimum wage committee who determine different minimum wage amounts depending on the age of the employee.&lt;ref&gt;s 2(1) Minimum Wage Act 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to justice===
Article 6 of the Human Rights Act states that everyone is entitled to the right to a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/odps/humanrightsact2001.pdf Human Rights Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been concern that the current human rights structures on the Isle of Man do not sufficiently represent the [[deaf]] population as the island does not have appropriately qualified persons to assist deaf individuals in arrests and trials which has resulted in questions about the legitimacy of legal outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldcourtchambers.im/blog_detail.php?num=11 My work with Manx deaf society]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the [[legal aid|Legal Aid Committee]]  implemented a fundamental review of the island’s legal aid system to determine the future shape of access to justice for those who do not have the means to pay for it. Committee chairman Andrew Swithinbank stated: "The focus of the committee is to promote access to justice in a manner which is fair, equitable, transparent and professional and which uses public resources carefully and effectively."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/committee-reviewing-access-to-justice-1-6850472 Isle of Man to review access to justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of persons with disabilities===
The ''Disability Discrimination Act 2006'' was given [[royal assent]] in October 2006 after it was approved by the branches of Tynwald. This Act was designed to demand minimum levels of accessibility for disabled people to buildings and prevent discrimination against disabled people in the supply of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://norbertsdad.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/an-islands-shame-the-abject-failure-to-implement-disability-discrimination-laws Failure to implement Disibility Discrimination Act]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act however, still remains to be implemented. In May 2011, the then chief minister [[Tony Brown (Manx politician)|Tony Brown]] stated “the ''Disability Discrimination Act'' is recognised as an important piece of legislation, however before the act is brought into effect a programme of assessment, education and improvements must take place.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://norbertsdad.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/an-islands-shame-the-abject-failure-to-implement-disability-discrimination-laws Failure to implement Disibility Discrimination Act]&lt;/ref&gt;  The House of Keys has repeatedly failed to give a deadline for when the Act will be implemented.

===LGBT rights===
{{See also|LGBT rights in the Isle of Man}}
In April 2016&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-36141145&lt;/ref&gt; the Isle of Man approved The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Amendment) Bill&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tynwald.org.im/business/bills/Bills/Marriage_(Same_Sex_Couples)_Bill_2016-amended.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; legalizing same-sex marriage. Same-sex couples have been allowed to enter civil partnerships, but not marriage, since April 2011.

Since the early 1990s, the Isle of Man has relaxed its position with regards to [[lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) rights. Prior to 1992, same-sex sexual activity was a criminal offence. Post de-criminalisation, the age of consent was set at 21 and then reduced to 18 by the ''Criminal Justice Act 2001''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.im/cms/images/phocadownload/Acts_of_Tynwald/Primary_2001/Criminal%20Justice%20Act%202001.pdf Criminal Justice Act 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 s4(a) of the ''Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2006'' further lowered the minimum age for homosexual acts to 16, thus aligning it with the same age of consent for heterosexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;s 4(a) Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been given more rights with regard to employment protection from discrimination (2006), gender recognition (2009), the right to enter into [[civil partnerships]] and the right to adopt children (2011).&lt;ref&gt;[[LGBT rights in the Isle of Man]]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it continues to apply special legal regulation to adult male homosexual sex.
 
Section 9 of the ''Sexual Offences Act 1992'' contains a number of provisions which criminalise certain “unnatural offences” between men. Sections 9(1) and 9(4) respectively criminalise ‘[[buggery]]’ and ‘[[gross indecency]]’ between men if one party is under the age of sixteen or if the acts are committed “elsewhere than in private.”&lt;ref&gt;s 9(1) Sexual Offences Act 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;s 9(4) Sexual Offences Act 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Section 10(1) provides buggery and gross indecency will not be considered to be in private if “more than two persons are present” or if the act is done in “any place to which the public have or are permitted to have access to, whether on payment or otherwise.”&lt;ref&gt;s 10(1) Sexual Offences Act 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Same-sex marriage]]s are illegal in the Isle of Man pursuant to the ''Marriage and Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2011'' (c. 3).&lt;ref&gt;sch 3, s 1(1)(a) Marriage and Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Policy and Reform Minister [[Chris Robertshaw]] confirmed that same-sex marriages recorded in England and Wales as well as 50 other countries will be treated as civil partnerships in the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/same-sex-marriages-to-be-treated-as-civil-partnerships-in-isle-of-man-1-6691060 Same-sex marriages treated as civil partnerships] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310134028/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/same-sex-marriages-to-be-treated-as-civil-partnerships-in-isle-of-man-1-6691060 |date=2016-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a local Independent [[Methodist]] minister refused to rent a house to two women because they were in a same sex relationship,  causing international outrage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/troubled-past-comes-back-to-haunt-isle-of-mans-gay-residents-after-lesbian-couple-prevented-from-renting-a-house-8621653.html Lesbian couple prevented from renting a house]&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the Isle of Man’s failure to bring in an Equality Act, the discrimination was legal. An Equality Bill, based upon the [[Equality Act 2010|UK Equality Act 2010]] to update the island’s discrimination laws was swiftly put into drafting process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f3f2f280-5f7f-41e5-ad4b-d00f1b85280c Equality Bill put into drafting process]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017 both houses of [[Tynwald]] passed the equality bill with many amendments. In July, 2017 the Equality Bill became the Equality Act after royal assent and will go into effect from July 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iomtoday.co.im/article.cfm?id=34930&amp;headline=Equality%20law%20is%20passed%20at%20last&amp;sectionIs=NEWS&amp;searchyear=2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporal punishment===
[[Birching]] was a form of [[corporal punishment]] used on the Isle of Man during the 1960s and 1970s. It was principally the form of punishment for boys under 15 convicted of stealing, however was altered in 1960 so that birching could be used on males up to 21 years of age.  In 1972 the case of ''Tyrer v The United Kingdom''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695464&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Tyrer v The United Kingdom (application No. 5856/72) 2 Eur. Ct. H.R. (ser. A) 1 (1978).]&lt;/ref&gt; went to Human Rights Court. By a majority of six votes to one, the Court held Tyrer's birching to constitute degrading treatment contrary to the Article 3 of the ECHR. This was labelled a landmark decision by [[Manfred Nowak]], UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.44AEV.pdf UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment]&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn’t until 1993 that birching was formally repealed in the Isle of Man.

Under Article 1 of the ''Children and Young Persons Act 1966'', parents have the right to administer “[[chastisement|reasonable chastisement]]” to children.  The Global Initiative to end all corporal punishment of children prepared a report in 2013 suggesting the Isle of Man repeal a number of statutes relating to corporal punishment of children by all persons with authority over children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/pdfs/states-reports/Isle%20of%20Man.pdf Global Initiative to end all corporal punishment of children]&lt;/ref&gt; This included persons in day care centres, schools and penal institutions. However, the Isle of Man has been reluctant to do so, declining to implement UPR recommendations to the UK in both 2008 and 2013 for it to ban corporal punishment on children in its overseas territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/pdfs/states-reports/Isle%20of%20Man.pdf Global Initiative to end all corporal punishment of children]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Isle of Man stated that it does not see the need for reform as it believes the current law is working well and that parents should be allowed to discipline children.

'''ILGA-Europe''' is the European region of the [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]]. It is an advocacy group promoting the interests of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] persons, at the European level. Its membership comprises more than 500 organisations from throughout Europe and Central Asia. The Association enjoys consultative status at [[Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC)]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/showProfileDetail.do?method=showProfileDetails&amp;profileCode=2936|title=NGO Branch, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|publisher= United Nations |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participatory status at the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngo-coe.org/WebForms/NgoDetails.aspx?ID=298 Base de donées ONG : European Region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA-Europe)] [[Council of Europe]], accessed 2 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ILGA-Europe was founded in 1996, when its parent organisation, the [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]], established separate regions.&lt;ref name="info" /&gt; It took over responsibility for supporting the development of the [[LGBT rights in Europe|LGBT movement in Europe]] including [[Transgender Europe]], [[Inter-LGBT]], and for relationships with the [[European Union]], [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].&lt;ref name="info" /&gt;

Initially ILGA-Europe worked entirely on the basis of volunteer resources. However, in 2001, its potential contribution to the European Union's anti-discrimination policies (established under Article 13 of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]) was recognised through the provision of core funding, currently through the PROGRESS Programme.&lt;ref name="funding" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/about_us/ilga_europe_funding|title=ILGA-Europe's funding|publisher=ILGA-Europe|date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled ILGA-Europe to set up an office in Brussels, to recruit permanent staff, and to conduct an extensive programme of work in relation to sexual orientation discrimination within the [[EU Member States]] and the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession countries]].&lt;ref name="funding" /&gt; Financial support from the Sigrid Rausing Trust, the Open Society Institute, [[Freedom House]], the [[US State Department]] and the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] of the [[Netherlands]] allows ILGA-Europe to extend its work in areas not covered by EU funding, including Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and on transgender issues.&lt;ref name="funding" /&gt;

ILGA-Europe has hosted its annual conference at the end of October, since 2000, where member organisations elect the Executive Board and decide on the next year's working priorities.&lt;ref name="conference" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/about_us/annual_conference|title=Annual Conference|publisher=ILGA-Europe|date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work==
ILGA-Europe works to promote equality and non-discrimination for LGBTI people in [[refugee|asylum]], [[education]], [[employment]], [[family law]], [[freedom of assembly]], [[hate crime]], [[hate speech]] and [[health]]; and works worldwide to protect [[human rights defenders]], trans people and intersex people.&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2014 | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/issues | title = Issues we work on| publisher = ILGA-Europe | accessdate = 2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association provides funding and training for its 500 member organisations, "''to maximise efficiency and the use of resources by LGBTI organisations in working towards achievement of their goals; to maximise the impact of advocacy work at the European level; to ensure sustainability of the LGBTI movement in Europe.''"&lt;ref name="develop"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2014 | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/how_we_work/developing | title = Developing the LGBTI movement | publisher = ILGA-Europe | accessdate = 2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ILGA-Europe works with [[Institutions of the European Union|EU Institutions]], the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] to promote equality by lobbying and advocacy, including supporting the adoption of the proposed [[Directive 2000/43/EC|EU Anti-Discrimination Directive]], that would ban discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation in all areas of [[European Union#Competences|EU competence]].&lt;ref name="work"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2014 | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/how_we_work/european_institutions | title = Working with the European Institutions | publisher = ILGA-Europe | accessdate = 2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses strategic litigation at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the [[European Court of Justice]] to end discrimination, by identifying gaps in protections, encouraging organisations and individuals to develop court cases, and support such cases with legal resources and [[amicus curiae]] briefs.&lt;ref name="how"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2014 | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/how_we_work/litigation | title = Strategic litigation in the European Courts | publisher = ILGA-Europe | accessdate = 2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[European Parliament election, 2014|2014 European Parliament election]], ILGA-Europe promoted its ''Come Out 2014 European Election Pledge'' to candidate [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s, which focused on priority LGBTI issues for the 2014–2019 Parliament: an EU roadmap on LGBTI equality; EU human rights enforcement; completing the EU Anti-Discrimination directive; combating homophobic and transphobic violence; an inclusive definition of 'family'; trans rights and [[gender dysphoria|depatholigisation]]; action against school bullying; health discrimination and inequalities; LGBTI [[right of asylum|asylum seekers]]; and making the EU champion LGBTI rights worldwide.&lt;ref name="pledge"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2014 | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/how_we_work/european_institutions/ep2014/mep/pledge | title = Come Out 2014 European Election Pledge | publisher = ILGA-Europe | accessdate = 2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 187 elected [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s (25 percent) signed the pledge, including 83 members of the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|PES]], 14 [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group|ALDE]] members and 14 from the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP]].&lt;ref name="quarter"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2014 | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/for_media/media_releases/a_quarter_of_elected_european_parliament_committed_to_lgbti_equality | title = A quarter of elected European Parliament committed to LGBTI equality | publisher = ILGA-Europe | accessdate = 2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today ILGA-Europe has more than 20 staff who work in four areas: Advocacy, Communications, Finance and Administration, and Programmes. All are based at the organisation's office in the [[Brussels and the European Union#European Quarter|European Quarter]] in Brussels.

==Rainbow Europe==
Each May, ILGA-Europe releases its ''Rainbow Europe'' review, to mark the [[International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia]]. It reviews the human rights situation and assesses what life is like for LGBTI people in every European country, covering discrimination, family recognition, hate speech/crimes, gender recognition, freedom of assembly, association and express, and asylum laws. In 2016, Malta came top of the rankings; it was rated to have 88% progress toward respect of human rights and full equality, just ahead of Belgium and the United Kingdom. Azerbaijan was ranked as the worst for LGBTI equality, scoring just 5%, closely followed by Russia, Armenia and Turkey. The biggest increase since the 2015 review, was that of Greece by 19 points (picking 58%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2016 | url = http://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/rainbow-europe/2016 | title = Changing laws and changing lives are not always the same thing }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 ''Rainbow Europe'' reviews are given in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2016 | url = https://rainbow-europe.org/country-ranking | title = Country rankings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third forum was held in [[Intersex rights in Malta|Malta]] in 2013 with 34 people representing 30 organisations from all continents. The closing statement affirmed the existence of intersex people, reaffirmed "the principles of the First and Second International Intersex Fora and extend the demands aiming to end discrimination against intersex people and to ensure the right of bodily integrity, physical autonomy and self-determination". For the first time, participants made a statement on [[Intersex#Identification documents|birth registrations]], in addition to other human rights issues.&lt;ref name="star-observer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/latest/intersex_forum_2013 3rd International Intersex Forum concluded] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204073813/http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/latest/intersex_forum_2013 |date=2013-12-04 }}, ILGA-Europe (Creative Commons statement), 2 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nnid.nl/2013/12/03/derde-internationale-intersekse-forum/ {{nl}} Derde Internationale Intersekse Forum], Nederlandse Netwerk Intersekse/DSD (NNID), 3 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice Stupa''' is a form of [[Glacier growing|glacier grafting]] technique that creates artificial [[glacier]]s, used for storing winter water (which otherwise would go unused) in the form of conical shaped ice heaps. During summer, when water is scarce, the Ice Stupa melts to increase water supply for crops. Ice Stupa was invented by [[Sonam Wangchuk (Engineer)|Sonam Wangchuk]] in [[Ladakh]] (India) and the project is undertaken by the [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh]]. Launched in October 2013, the test project started in January 2014 under the project name ''The Ice Stupa project''. On 15 November 2016, Sonam Wangchuk was awarded the [[Rolex Awards for Enterprise]] for his work on Ice Stupa.

==Background==
Ladakh is a [[cold desert]] and during winter [[agriculture]] is not practiced due to frozen soil and low air temperatures. During [[Spring (season)|spring season]], water requirement for [[sowing]] increases whereas [[stream]]s dry up. With annual rainfall of less than {{convert|50|mm|in}}, agriculture  in Ladakh is solely dependent on snow and glacier [[meltwater]]. Due to [[climate change]], the region experiences hotter summers with increase in melts along with shift in the timing and precipitation of the melts. Subsequently, during the spring season water is more scarce which in turn impacts agriculture and food supplies.&lt;ref name="Ice Stupas: Conserving water the 3 Idiots way"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ice Stupas: Conserving water the 3 Idiots way|publisher=[[Forbes India]]|accessdate=21 November 2016|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/checkin/ice-stupas-conserving-water-the-3-idiots-way/39265/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonam Wangchuk Wins the Rolex Award "&gt;{{cite news|title=Sonam Wangchuk Wins the Rolex Award |publisher=thewire.in/|accessdate=21 November 2016|url=http://thewire.in/81327/wangchuk-rolex-stupa-secmol/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ice Stupas: Water conservation in the land of the Buddha"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ice Stupas: Water conservation in the land of the Buddha|publisher=indiawaterportal.org|accessdate=21 November 2016|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/ice-stupas-water-conservation-land-buddha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the month of May, Sonam Wangchuk noticed the ice under  a bridge. Despite summer and lowest elevation in Ladakh, the ice had not melted since it was not under direct sunlight. Wangchuk realized ice could last longer in Ladakh if it could be shaded from the sun. Since providing shade to larger water bodies was not possible, Wangchuk thought of freezing and storing water in the shape of a cone that offers minimum surface area to the sun whilst holding high volume of water.&lt;ref name="Sonam Wangchuk Wins the Rolex Award"/&gt;

In October 2013, Sonam Wangchuk created the first [[prototype]] of {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} Ice Stupa by freezing {{cvt|150000|l|gal}} in [[Leh]] without any shade from the sun. Water was piped from upstream using gravity. Electricity or machinery was not used for pumping water. The Ice Stupa did not melt fully till 18 May 2014, even when the temperature was above {{convert|20|C}}.&lt;ref name="Ice Stupas: Conserving water the 3 Idiots way"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonam Wangchuk Wins the Rolex Award "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ice Stupas: Water conservation in the land of the Buddha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ice Stupa - A Form of Artificial Glacier"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ice Stupa - A Form of Artificial Glacier|publisher=Official website|accessdate=21 November 2016|url=http://icestupa.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and IGOPP's books deal with the financial market, mining royalties, [[executive compensation]], "good governance" in the public or private sector, takeovers of listed companies, regulation of financial markets, Davos, the presence of women on boards and many other themes relevant to governance. These books are constantly looking to provide a measured opinion, sensitive to others', by formulating policy proposals that respect the rights of the parties. Their authors' are always concerned about the perverse and unexpected effects of good intentions.

The '''National Security Committee''' ('''NSC''') of Ireland is a secretive inter-departmental committee responsible for ensuring that the [[Taoiseach]] (Prime Minister of Ireland) and [[Government of Ireland]] are kept informed of high-level [[national security]], intelligence and defence issues, and the state's response to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2013|url=http://www.military.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Info_Centre/documents/Annual_Reports/2013_Annual_Report_English_Version.pdf|publisher=Department of Defence and Defence Forces|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Security Committee|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/debates/?id=2010-11-02.6.0|publisher=Kildare Street|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Security Committee is chaired by the [[Secretary-General|Secretary General]] to the Irish Government/Secretary General of the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], and comprises; the [[Garda Commissioner|Commissioner]] of the [[Garda Síochána]], the Secretary General of the [[Department of Justice and Equality]], the [[Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces (Ireland)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]], the Secretary General of the [[Department of Defence (Ireland)|Department of Defence]], and the Secretary General of the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defence Forces Strategy Statement 2003–2005|url=http://www.military.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Info_Centre/Docs2/strategy_03-05.pdf|publisher=Defence Forces Ireland|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report to the Minister for Defence for 2007|url=http://www.military.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/images/Info_Centre/documents/Annual_Reports/ar_2007_en.pdf|publisher=Department of Defence and Defence Forces|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Revenue Commissioners]], [[Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources]] and [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport]] also have intelligence roles, but are not full members of the NSC.&lt;ref name="nsc 1"/&gt;

==Terrorism threat level==
The constituents of the National Security Committee deliberate on the Republic of Ireland's ''International Terror Threat Level''. Five levels are used to grade the international threat of a terrorist attack to Ireland; low, moderate, substantial, severe and critical. The gradings are based on a series of factors, including information supplied by international authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Paul|title=Intelligence units monitor 40 suspected Isil supporters|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/intelligence-units-monitor-40-suspected-isil-supporters-34359737.html|accessdate=17 January 2016|publisher=Irish Independent|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat level is administered by the Garda Síochána.

'''International Terror Threat Level:'''

* '''Low''' – An attack is deemed unlikely.
* '''Moderate''' – An attack is possible, but not likely.
* '''Substantial''' – An attack is a strong possibility.
* '''Severe''' – An attack is highly likely.
* '''Critical''' – An attack is imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Keeffe|first1=Cormac|title=What is the reality of the threat posed by Islamic extremists in Ireland?|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/what-is-the-reality-of-the-threat-posed-by-islamic-extremists-in-ireland-396021.html|accessdate=11 May 2016|work=Irish Examiner|date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Terror Threat Level was raised from low to moderate following the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks]].&lt;ref name="nsc ct"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brady|first1=Tom|title=Garda snipers and extra Army bomb disposal officers in place for 1916 commemorations|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/garda-snipers-and-extra-army-bomb-disposal-officers-in-place-for-1916-commemorations-34564635.html|accessdate=25 March 2016|publisher=Irish Independent|date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Civil Aviation Security Committee==
The '''National Civil Aviation Security Committee''' ('''NCASC''') is a standing committee established in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Departmental Bodies of the Department of Transport|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/wrans/?id=2010-11-02.1301.0|publisher=kildarestreet.com|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the NCASC is to advise the Irish government and civil aviation industry of security policy for civil aviation, to recommend and review security measures at airports and to co-ordinate the various interests involved. The National Civil Aviation Security Committee meets at a minimum biannually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topical Issue Debate/State Airports|url=https://www.kildarestreet.com/debates/?id=2012-05-17.390.0|publisher=kildarestreet.com|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCASC comprises senior representatives of government departments, Irish airports, Irish airlines, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, [[An Post]], Customs &amp; Excise (Revenue), the [[Irish Aviation Authority]] (IAA), and the Irish Airline Pilots Association (IALPA). The committee was established under the National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP) which is classified on security grounds, and therefore the deliberations of the committee are confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement on Dublin Airport by the Chairman of the National Civil Aviation Security Committee |url=http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/Category-Index/Transport/Ports-Airports/statement-on-dublin-airport-by-the-chairman-of-the-national-civil-aviation-security-committee.html|publisher=Merrion Street|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuity of government==
The National Security Committee is the conduit for officials to communicate with the Taoiseach and/or cabinet members if their minister – the normal channel – became unavailable (or was killed). In preparation for such extreme events drafts of emergency powers legislation have been drawn up in secret by officials from the Department of Justice, including legislation to deal with circumstances such as an attack on cabinet involving numerous deaths.&lt;ref name="national security"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mulqueen|first1=Michael|title=Re-evaluating Irish national security policy : affordable threats?|date=2009|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-8027-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government Security Committee==
In July 2017, a new Government Security Committee designated '''Cabinet Committee F''' (named after the room in which it held its first meeting) was established. Chaired by [[Taoiseach]] [[Leo Varadkar]], the new committee is modelled on the British government [[Cabinet Office Briefing Room|COBRA]] crisis management committee with the aim of bringing together more senior cabinet-level ministers on matters of state security. Its inaugural meeting was attended by the [[Tánaiste]]; Minister of State at the [[Department of Defence (Ireland)|Department of Defence]]; Ministers and senior officials from the Departments of [[Department of Justice and Equality|Justice &amp; Equality]]; Defence; [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Enterprise &amp; Innovation]]; [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Finance]] and [[Department of Public Expenditure and Reform|Public Expenditure &amp; Reform]]; [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade]]; [[Department of Health (Ireland)|Health]]; [[Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government|Housing, Planning &amp; Local Government]]; [[Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment|Communications, Climate Action &amp; Environment]]; and [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Transport, Tourism &amp; Sport]], where senior Defence Forces and Garda officers briefed them on the international terrorism threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murtagh|first1=Peter|title=Army Ranger Wing to get higher anti-terrorist profile|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/army-ranger-wing-to-get-higher-anti-terrorist-profile-1.3166803|accessdate=26 July 2017|work=The Irish Times|date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taoiseach convenes first meeting of Government Security Committee|url=http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Releases/Taoiseach_convenes_first_meeting_of_Government_Security_Committee.html|accessdate=26 July 2017|publisher=MerrionStreet|date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osip Vasiliyevich Aptekman''' ({{Lang-ru|Осип Васильевич Аптекман}}) (March 18(30), 1849, [[Pavlohrad]] – July 8, 1926) was a [[Russia]]n [[revolutionary]], member of the [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty]], and one of the founders of the [[Black Repartition]]. 

==Biography==

Born in Ukraine, Osip Aptekman studied medicine in Kharkov from 1870.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20060513134726/http://narovol.narod.ru/Person/aptekman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1873, as the start of the 'to the people' movement, when idealistic students travelled to the countryside hoping to radicalise the peasants, he and two other students from Kharkov, [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and S.N.Kulasko set up a blacksmith shop in Gherea's home village, Slavyanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kitch |first1=Michael |title=Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Rumanian Marxism |journal=The Slavonic and East European Review |date=October 1973 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=66 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4207387?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had to abandon the project to avoid arrest. He returned to Kharkov to complete his studies. In 1874, a few months after qualifying as a surgeon, he again 'went to the people' in the Volga region, and was one of the organisers of [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Land and Liberty ]] (''Земля и Воля'' - Zemlya i Volya).

When Zemlya i Volya split in August 1879, with one faction - impatient with the failure to politicise the peasantry - breaking off the form the [[People's Will]] and plan the assassination of the Tsar, Aptekman joined the future founder of Russian Marxism, [[Georgi Plekhanov]] and in organising [[Black Partition]] (''Черный Передел'' -Cherny Peredel) grouping which insisted that the continued use of [[propaganda]] was the best means of achieving [[social change]]. He edited the group's journal. In 1880, he was arrested and sentenced to five years exile in [[Yakutsk]], in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shmidt |first1=O.Yu. (chief editor), Bukharin N.I. et al |title=Большаяа Советская Энциклопедия vol 3 |date=1926 |location=Moscow |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his term of exile ended, he emigrated to Munich, to resume his study of medicine. He returned to Russia in 1889, to practise as a country doctor in [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhny Novgorod region]]. 

In 1893 and 1894 Aptekman was one of the primary leaders of the [[People's Rights Party]] ''(Partiia Narodnogo Prava),'' an illegal [[constitutionalism|constitutionalist]] populist organization.&lt;ref&gt;Shmuel Galai, ''The Liberation Movement in Russia, 1900-1905.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1973; pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; But later in the same decade, when Marxist ideas began to spread among the young, he broke with the [[Narodniks]] and joined what became the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. When the RSDLP split, in 1903, he sided with the [[Mensheviks]]. During the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 revolution]], he travelled from district to district, organising armed groups of revolutionaries, until he was arrested and imprisoned. Released in May 1906, he emigrated to Switzerland. After the outbreak of war in 1914. he sided with the Menshevik Internationalists, led by [[Julius Martov|Yuri Martov]] Having returned to Russia after the [[February Revolution]], in 1919, aged 70, he announced that he accepted the legitimacy of the communist government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shmidt |first1=O.Yu. (chief editor), Bukharin N.I. et al |title=Большаяа Советская Энциклопедия vol 3 |date=1926 |location=Moscow |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final years, he worked for the Historical and Revolutionary Archives, in St Petersburg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">A '''power structure''' is an overall system of influence relationships between any individual and every other individual within any selected group of people. A description of a power structure would capture the way in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]] is distributed between people within groups such as a government, nation, institution, organization, or a society.&lt;ref&gt;G. William Domhoff, Thomas R. Dye, ''Power Elites and Organizations'' (1987), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Such structures are of interest to various fields, including [[sociology]], [[government]], [[economics]], and [[business]]. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like [[Social justice|fairness]] or [[efficiency]], as in a [[hierarchical organization]] wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a [[dominance hierarchy]] in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a [[dominator culture]], the opposite of an egalitarian culture of partnership. A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure is often referred to as being [[the Establishment]]. Power structures are fluid, with changes occurring constantly, either slowly or rapidly, evolving or revolutionary, peacefully or violently.

'''Sardinia Nation''' ({{lang-sc|Sardigna Natzione}}, SN) is a minor [[separatism|separatist]] and [[socialism|socialist]] [[list of political parties in Sardinia|political party in Sardinia]], [[Italy]]. Its long-time leader is [[Bustianu Cumpostu]].

==History==
The party was founded by [[Anghelu Caria]] in 1994, in continuity with the [[Independentist Sardinian Party]] (PSIn), of which Caria had been founder and leader. After Caria's sudden death, [[Bustianu Cumpostu]] was elected new leader by defeating [[Gavino Sale]], who would lead the party's left-wing faction for five years, before leaving in 2001.

In the [[Italian general election, 1996 (Sardinia)|1996 general election]] SN won 4.3% in single-seat constituencies (11.6% in [[Tortolì]] and 9.6% in [[Iglesias, Sardinia|Iglesias]]), despite being present only in ten constituencies out of fourteen, and 2.3% for proportional representation, due to competition from the [[Sardinian Action Party]] (PSd'Az), which gained 3.8%.&lt;ref&gt;http://elezionistorico.interno.it/enti.php?tp=C&amp;dt=21/04/1996&amp;cta=I&amp;ord=3&amp;sut1=26&amp;sut2=0&amp;sut3=0&amp;sut4=0&amp;liv=1&amp;descE=%20Circoscrizione:%20SARDEGNA&amp;descA=&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sardinian regional election, 1999|1999 Sardinian regional election]] SN had its best result ever, as Cumpostu received 5.8% of the vote for president, while the PSd'Az gained 8.3% with [[Franco Meloni]]. However, as Cumpostu did not surpass the 6% threshold and the party list stopped at 1.8%, the party did not get into the Regional Council.

Both for the [[Italian general election, 2001 (Sardinia)|2001 general election]] and the [[Sardinian regional election, 2004|2004 regional election]] SN formed an alliance with the PSd'Az. This led Sale, who refused any collaboration with not parties being considered not fully committed to independence, and his faction to leave the party in 2001 to form [[Independence Republic of Sardinia]] (iRS). In the election the Sardist electorate was very fragmented (also because of the presence of the [[Sardinian Democratic Union]], UDS, which ran on a "nationalist" platform) and most of SN former voters voted Sale for President (1.9%) and the iRS party list (0.7%), while only a minority voted for SN (0.4%).

SN won 1.1% of the vote in the [[Italian general election, 2006 (Sardinia)|2006 general election]] and 0.7% in [[Italian general election, 2008 (Sardinia)|2008]]. In the [[Sardinian regional election, 2009|2009 regional election]] the party formed a "nationalist" left-wing alliance with [[To the Left for Independence]], a [[communism|communist]] party, and other minor separatist groups, but gained only 0.5%, while Sale (iRS) 3.1%.

In the [[Sardinian regional election, 2014|2014 regional election]] the party unsuccessfully sought to join the coalition led by [[Michela Murgia]] (centred on [[Project Republic of Sardinia]]), in list with alike separatist parties, and finally decided not to take part to the election.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unionesarda.it/articolo/politica_italiana/2014/01/14/sardigna_natzione_fuori_dalle_elezioni_rifiutati_da_sardegna_possibile-1-349682.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political prosecution==
In 2009, the far-right [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] party filed, before the Greek justice, many documents against several left-wing Greek authors. The police wanted to interrogate all of them, but they jointly agreed not to appear in court and jointly signed a document stating they legally rejected the accusations. After reviewing the documentation, two of them were brought to justice by the Attorney General: Savas Matsas and Constantin Motzouri, the former rector of the [[National Technical University of Athens]]. There was an international petition in his defence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/01/absurd-golden-dawn-hound-friend-court Guardian article oln case&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://linksunten.indymedia.org/de/node/91006 Interview with him about the case&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_04/07/2013_507578 July 4, 2013 note about Savas Mikhail prosecution (Retrieved July 7, 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mtl-fi.org/2013/06/29/greece-stop-the-trial-of-savas-matsas/ Stop the Trial of Savas Matsas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://socialistworker.org/2013/08/19/help-against-the-greek-fascists He needs your help against the fascists&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/gerdowning/posts/10201868529822843 statement by British supporters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://po.org.ar/blog/2013/06/27/grecia-por-el-desprocesamiento-de-savas-matsas/ article (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pclavoratori.it/files/index.php?c3:o3400 article (Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social policies''' are devised to solve or prevent [[social problems]] and evils.

For example, under the purely [[free enterprise]] system or [[market economy]] those individuals who are unable to contribute to the [[production process]] like the [[unemployed]], old people and sick or disabled would not receive any [[income]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Another example of problems that may arise under [[capitalism]] are [[unintended consequence|side effects]] of [[industrial production]] processes like [[noise]] and all kinds of [[pollution]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} [[Governments]] of some countries feel obliged to make available to the [[general public|public]] certain amounts of basic [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]] called [[merit wants]] that contribute to the basic [[Quality of life|welfare]] of the [[society]] regardles of their income levels.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Economics'', Mentor Books&lt;/ref&gt;

It is proposed that the higher an individual moves up the staircase, the fewer alternatives to violence they will see, ultimately resulting in the destruction of themselves, others, or both.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;

==Background==
Moghaddam observed that societal-level variables, such as lack of democratic processes, [[social inequality]], availability of weapons and rapid demographic changes, do not explain why only a small percentage of people living under the same adverse conditions end up committing acts of violence against innocent targets. He proposed the staircase model to explain this phenomenon, describing the pathway to terrorism as a narrowing staircase, that very few people reach the top of.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hewstone |first1=Miles |authorlink1=Miles Hewstone |last2=Stroebe |first2=Wolfgang |author-link2= Wolfgang Stroebe|last3=Jonas |first3=Klaus |date=May 14, 2012 |title=An Introduction to Social Psychology|edition=5th|publisher=BPS Blackwell |pages=305–306 |isbn=978-1444335446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
The model involves six floors.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;&lt;ref name=scand/&gt;
[[File:Staircase model.png|thumb|Diagram of the staircase model]]

===Ground floor===
The ground floor is inhabited by all members of society. All members of society evaluate their [[Standard of living|living conditions]] in terms of fairness. People will remain on the ground floor as long as they consider their living conditions to be fair. Those who perceive injustice move onto the first floor.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===First floor===
On the first floor, people consider their options for improving their situation. People who find options to improve their individual situation and influence decision-makers leave the staircase at this floor in order to pursue non-violent paths. People who are unsatisfied with their available options move onto the second floor.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Second floor===
It is here that feelings of both anger and frustration over not being able to improve the situation instigate a search for a target to blame. This target can either be a direct opponent, such as a government, or a third party to whom aggression is displaced, such as an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or religious group. People who are persuaded that they have an enemy toward whom they can direct their [[aggression]], will proceed to the third floor.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Third floor===
People who arrive here have already developed a readiness towards violence. These feelings can be capitalised on by a violent organisation that is offering a sense of 'moral engagement' to potential recruits. Within these organisations violent actions against a perceived enemy are regarded as acceptable or even as one's duty. Potential recruits are offered a new social identity as members of a selective [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] who aim to bring justice to the world. People who find this offer appealing will move on to the fourth floor.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Fourth floor===
It is here that thinking such as 'us' versus 'them' is promoted. Recruits are isolated from friends and family, strict secrecy is imposed and the legitimacy of the organisation is emphasised. People who reach this floor will rarely withdraw and exit the staircase alive. They will move onto the fifth floor if an opportunity to do so presents.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Fifth floor===
It is here that the violent act is carried out. In order to be as effective as possible, any inhibition about killing innocent people must be overcome. This is done via two means. [[Categorization|Categorisation]] stresses the differentiation between ingroup and out group, and [[Distancing (psychology)|distancing]] exaggerates the differences between the ingroup and the perceived enemy.&lt;ref name=staircase/&gt;&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==Implications==
Moghaddam states the model is not a formal one, but rather a metaphor for the purpose of providing general framework in order to organise current psychological knowledge regarding terrorism.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laurence |first1=Janice |last2=Matthews |first2=Michael |date=February 24, 2012 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Military Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yh9pAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71 |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=71 |isbn= 978-0195399325  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the model is cited as useful for conceptualising the process that results in only a small number of individuals from a large group of disgruntled people will commit acts of violence against the innocent.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; Moghaddam states that it is not enough to simply try and identify and stop potential terrorists, as this will only make room for new people to step forward, and instead proposes that the only way to end terrorism is by reforming the condition on the ground floor so that it is no longer perceived as unjust and hopeless by a large portion of society.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

The empirical basis of the model has been evaluated&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; by an article in the [[Scandinavian Journal of Psychology]]. The findings state that whilst most of the processes in the model are supported by empirical evidence, the quantity and quality of said evidence varies.&lt;ref name=scand&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ragnhild |first=Lygre |last2= |first2= |date=2011 |title=Terrorism as a process: A critical review of Moghaddam's 'Staircase to Terrorism' |url= |journal= Scandinavian Journal of Psychology |volume=52 |issue=6 |page=615 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst praising Moghaddam's model for emphasising potential mechanisms for future study, the review concludes that the staircase model may not be the right metaphor for summarising the phenomena of terrorism, citing a lack of evidence for transition between the floors, and the possibility that some floors and corresponding processes from the model could be removed entirely due to a lack of empirical evidence.&lt;ref name=scand/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4698">The '''State Secretary for Church Affairs''' (German: ''Staatssekretär für Kirchenfragen'') was the head of the Secretariat for Church Affairs in the former [[German Democratic Republic]]. The office was responsible for the relationship of the government toward churches and religious groups. Policy was set by the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED), but direct contact with the churches and religious groups was essentially restricted to the Secretariat in order to preserve the SED's stance as [[Atheism|atheist]] and [[Antireligion|anti-religion]].

== Establishment and function ==
The office was established in 1957 following the example of the [[Soviet Union]] and other communist countries. The SED's goal was to prevent religious involvement in state affairs, particularly with regard to education and training of children and young people. The Secretary was responsible for maintaining the relationship between government and the churches and religious groups, but was kept weak with no power to set policy. Policy towards religion was set by the SED, whose leaders rarely met with religious leaders.&lt;ref name="Cooke-Grix"&gt;Paul Cooke, Jonathan Grix (Editors), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PAR5nQudwUUC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''East Germany: Continuity and Change''] Editions Rodopi B.V., Amsterdam - Atlanta, GA (2000), pp.&amp;nbsp;104-105. {{ISBN|90-420-0579-3}} Retrieved October 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This arrangement allowed the SED to maintain its appearance as an "atheistic party against the Church". However, it also created a situation where, not having direct contact with the churches, the party was forced to rely on other's reports for what was actually going on with the churches, reports that often minimized or omitted serious criticism of the communist government "in order to avoid excited or angry decisions, or to confirm the predominant picture among the recipients of the report of harmonious societal development."&lt;ref&gt;Horst Dohle, quoted in: Paul Cooke, Jonathan Grix (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PAR5nQudwUUC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 105] Retrieved October 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to maintaining relationships with the churches, the Secretary was to ensure that the laws and ordinances kept pace with the development of the socialist state.&lt;ref name="wallmann"&gt;Johannes Wallmann. ''Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands seit der Reformation''. Tübingen (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;300. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SED expected religion to die out over time and sought to restrict the churches to conducting rites and services.&lt;ref name="mm-sm-haw"&gt;Michael Mertes, Steven Muller, Heinrich August Winckler (Editors), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJaHiGHRM6kC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;lpg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''In Search of Germany''] Transaction Publishers. New Brunswick, New Jersey (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;271. {{ISBN|1-56000-880-6}} Retrieved October 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Church representatives viewed the office as the "State Secretariat Against Church Affairs".&lt;ref name="wallmann" /&gt;

== Control and persecution ==
A list, based on religions recognized by the post-war [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet Military Administration]] was drawn up by the [[Ministry of the Interior (East Germany)|Ministry of the Interior]]. Those that were on the list were allowed to hold church services,&lt;ref name="GWS-22"&gt;Gregory W. Sandford, ''Christian Science in East Germany: The Church that Came in from the Cold'' (2013), p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt; though there were waves of persecution in 1953 and 1958, including arrests of ministers and others, and show trials.&lt;ref name="mm-sm-haw" /&gt;

Two religions were kept off the list, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christian Science]]. Jehovah's Witnesses were denied approval based on their "rejection of secular authority". Christian Science was denied because of the religion's affiliation with the United States and a Nazi-era law related to medical practice.&lt;ref name="GWS-7"&gt;Gregory W. Sandford (2013), pp.&amp;nbsp;7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Science was later granted official recognition in November 1989, just prior to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref name="GWS-123"&gt;Gregory W. Sandford (2013), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire''' (abbreviated '''SACQ''') is a 67-item [[self-report inventory]] designed by Robert W. Baker and Bohdan Siryk and published by [[Western Psychological Services]] in 1987 (manual published 1989). The questionnaire is proprietary and copies of the questionnaire as well as the manual can be purchased from the WPS website.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpspublish.com/store/p/2949/student-adaptation-to-college-questionnaire-sacq|title = Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire™ (SACQ™)|publisher = [[Western Psychological Services]]|year = 1987|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In a 1984 paper, Baker and Siryk described the results of a 52-item [[self-report inventory]] that used a [[Likert scale]]. They had administered this inventory to 734 students, and their paper discussed the reliability and validity of the data thus obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring adjustment to college|last= Baker|first = Robert W.|last2 = Siryk|first2 = Bohdan|journal = [[Journal of Counseling Psychology]]|volume = 31|issue = 2|date = April 1984|pages = 179–189|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.31.2.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would later grow into the Student Adaptation to Colleges Questionnaire.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

==Description of the questionnaire==

The questionnaire is a 67-item self-report inventory that assesses overall adjustment to college, as well as adjustment in four specific areas:&lt;ref name=doc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v-psyche.com/doc/IQ/Student%20Adaptation%20to%20College%20Questionnaire.doc|title = Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire|last = Baker|first = Robert W.|last2 = Siryk|first2 = Bohdan|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wpspublish.com/store/Images/Downloads/Product/SACQ_Sample-Test-Report.pdf|title = SACQ Sample Report|last = Baker|first = Robert W.|last2 = Siryk|first2 = Bohdan|publisher = [[Western Psychological Services]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Academic adjustment
* Personal-emotional adjustment
* Social adjustment
* Attachment (to the institution)

The authors claim that if the questionnaire is used at the time people enter college, it can be used for the early detection of potential adjustment problems and can increase the retention of students who might otherwise drop out.&lt;ref name=doc/&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic research===

There is some academic research that relies on the SACQ and judges its usefulness. A 1992 paper by Krotseng used discriminant analysis to determine "(1) the extent to which the SACQ accurately predicts student departure for a private, comprehensive university; (2) SACQ items distinguishing nonpersisters; (3) use with an incoming class; and (4) evidence linking the SACQ with intervention strategies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Predicting persistence from the student adaptation to college questionnaire: Early warning or siren song?|journal = [[Research in Higher Education]]|last = Krotseng|first= Marsha V.|date = February 1992|volume = 33|issue = 1|pages = 99–111|doi = 10.1007/BF00991974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 1992 paper by Dahmus, Bernardin, and Bernardin discussed the SACQ's potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire|last = Dahmus|first = Sue|last2 = Bernardin|first2 = H. John|last3 = Bernardin|first3 = Kathleen|journal = [[Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development]]|volume = 25|issue = 3|date = October 1992|pages = 139–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1994 study by Gerdes and Mallinckrodt used SACQ data to measure the emotional, social, and academic adjustment of college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Emotional, Social, and Academic Adjustment of College Students: A Longitudinal Study of Retention|last = Gerdes|first = Hillary|last2 = Mallinckrodt|first2 = Brent|journal = [[Journal of Counseling and Development]]|date = January–February 1994|volume = 72|issue = 3|pages = 281–288|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227841056_Emotional_Social_and_Academic_Adjustment_of_College_Students_A_Longitudinal_Study_of_Retention/file/72e7e51eda7747339c.pdf|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1994.tb00935.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 paper by Beyers and Goossens from the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]] considered the applicability of the SACQ to [[Europe]] and concluded: "With some reservations regarding the Academic Adjustment subscale, then, the SACQ seems to be a useful tool for research on university life among college students in Europe."&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{cite journal|title = Concurrent and predictive validity of the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire in a sample of European freshman students|last = Beyers|first = Wim|last2 = Goossens|first2 = Luc|journal = [[Educational and Psychological Measurement]]|volume = 62|issue = 3|date = June 2002|pages = 525–536|accessdate = April 22, 2014|url = http://www.sagepub.com/bjohnsonstudy/articles/Beyers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abstract of a 2012 meta-analysis by Credé and Niehorster (k = 237, N = 44,668) reads: "The review, based on studies using the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire, is organized around three primary themes: (1) the structure of students’ adjustment to college, (2) the relationship of adjustment to college constructs with possible antecedents and correlates, and (3) the relationship of adjustment to college constructs with college grades and college retention. Meta-analytic results indicate that adjustment to college is multidimensional, predictive of college grades, and an unusually good predictor of college retention. Adjustment to college is also shown to be moderately related to individual traits, social support, and students’ relationships with their parents. Weaker relationships are evident with demographic variables, prior achievement, coping approaches, and variables that reflect students’ psychological independence from their parents. Theoretical and practical implications for the study of students’ adjustment to college, academic performance, and retention are discussed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Adjustment to College as Measured by the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire: A Quantitative Review of its Structure and Relationships with Correlates and Consequences|last = Credé|first = Marcus|last2 = Niehorster|first2 = Sarah|doi = 10.1007/s10648-011-9184-5|journal = [[Educational Psychology Review]]|volume = 24|issue = 1|pages = 133–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, he was the Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, a currently banned organisation in his homeland. He was notable for his activism for human and religious rights in Vietnam. 

In 1977, Quang wrote a letter to then-[[Prime Minister of Vietnam|Prime Minister]] [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] detailing counts of oppression by the communist regime. For this, he and five other senior monks were arrested and detained.&lt;ref name="hdvnbtdt.org"/&gt; In 1982, he was arrested and put on permanent house arrest for opposition to governmental policy after publicly denouncing the establishment of the state-controlled Vietnam Buddhist Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/07/06/asia/OUKWD-UK-VIETNAM-MONK.php ''International Herald Tribune'' article: "Dissident patriarch of Vietnam Buddhist group dies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he was awarded the [[Homo Homini Award]] for his human rights activism by the Czech group [[People in Need (Czech Republic)|People in Need]], which he shared with [[Thích Quảng Độ]] and [[Nguyen Van Ly|Father Nguyễn Văn Lý]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clovekvtisni.cz/index2en.php?id=549|title=Previous Recipients of the Homo Homini Award|publisher=[[People In Need (Czech Republic)|People in Need]]|accessdate=17 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501192644/http://www.clovekvtisni.cz/index2en.php?id=549|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ToolBank''' is a registered term or 'word mark' registered with the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office used to identify the nonprofit tool lending program model created by the [http://atlanta.toolbank.org Atlanta Community ToolBank]. Each ToolBank increases the impact of its local charitable sector by lending tools to organizations for use in the fulfillment of their missions. The available inventory of a typical ToolBank includes tools for landscaping, carpentry, plumbing, masonry as well as power tools, ladders, wheelbarrows, and others. The Atlanta Community ToolBank is currently the largest ToolBank in existence, with over 200 tool types in its lending inventory. The available inventory of the Atlanta Community ToolBank can be found [http://atlanta.toolbank.org/Portals/18/TRF.pdf here]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}. Nine ToolBanks are currently lending tools in Atlanta GA, Baltimore MD, Charlotte NC, Cincinnati OH, Houston TX, Phoenix AZ, Portland OR, Richmond VA, and Chicago, IL. The national network of ToolBanks is administered by the parent organization [http://www.toolbank.org ToolBank USA], which was founded in 2008 to replicate the impact of the Atlanta ToolBank in cities beyond Atlanta. In 2014, ToolBank USA launched ToolBank Disaster Services, a program to deliver tools to communities affected by disaster. ToolBanks loaned $5.8M worth of tools and equipment to charitable organizations in 2015.   

The ToolBank program model differs from the more common [[tool library]] model in that ToolBanks loan tools exclusively to other charitable organizations; ToolBank tools are not available to individuals. The ToolBank inventory is designated for the purpose of increasing the impact of the nonprofit sector and less formalized grassroots organizations. Typical borrowers of ToolBank tools include faith-based organizations, public schools, neighborhood organizations, public/private partnerships with community-oriented missions, social clubs with a service mission, gardening clubs, and others. Proof of charitable intent is verified prior to accessing ToolBank tools.

The ToolBank performs three primary functions:

1. '''Tool Lending:''' The ToolBank lends tools of all kinds for use in volunteer projects, facility maintenance and improvement projects, community improvement events, and special events.

2. '''Tool Advocacy:''' ToolBank staff advocates for the complete and timely return of all borrowed tools, to guarantee the long-term sustainability of available inventory. Staff also seeks compensation for lost tools and tools returned late.

3. '''Tool Maintenance:''' The ToolBank performs [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] and repairs on all equipment to ensure good condition and to extend the lifespan of the inventory. This function is typically performed by volunteers and community service workers.

Through these three functions, local community organizations may benefit by:&lt;br /&gt;
ensuring that all participating volunteers are properly equipped;&lt;br /&gt;
engaging larger volunteer groups;&lt;br /&gt;
performing a broader scope of service projects;&lt;br /&gt;
engaging more highly skilled volunteers; and&lt;br /&gt;
eliminating tool purchase, repair, and storage costs. 

'''ToolBank''' is a registered mark of the Atlanta Community ToolBank.&lt;ref&gt;{{US servicemark|78934493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlanta Community ToolBank granted a Right to License to [http://www.toolbank.org ToolBank USA] in 2008. ToolBank USA is a nonprofit organization created in February 2008, charged with the successful nationwide replication of the ToolBank program model. ToolBank USA was launched by a founding grant from [http://www.homedepotfoundation.org/ The Home Depot Foundation].

== History ==

The '''Atlanta Community ToolBank''' originated in Atlanta GA as an offshoot of a charitable no-cost home repair program known as Community Reinvestment Inc (CRI), founded in 1990.  CRI's tool inventory grew organically as a result of volunteers donating equipment in support of the program.  Local neighborhood associations and churches periodically borrowed CRI's tools for their own cleanup days and volunteer events, giving rise to the core concept of the ToolBank.  The specific origin of the term ToolBank is unknown; CRI began offering the ToolBank as a formal program in 1992.

The '''[[Political union|unification]]''' of '''[[Albania]]''' and '''[[Kosovo]]''' is a political idea, revived since Kosovo [[Declaration of independence|declared independence]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="WolchikCurry2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sharon L.

This idea has been brought into connection with the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] concept of [[Greater Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tristan James Mabry|author2=John McGarry|title=Divided Nations and European Integration|year=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lenard J.

Unification in the eyes of many has already been achieved. Kosovo is predominately Albanian, and with the Republic of Albania shares some common administrative sectors such as education, policing, and foreign policy. Culture, heritage and trade have also been greatly unified between the two which also share an open border.

==History==
During the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]] Yugoslavia feared a potential unification of Kosovo to Albania.&lt;ref name="Clark2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Clark|title=Civil Resistance in Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTW9XKUmrxsC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1569-0|pages=44–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1990s Albanian politicians' statements were contradictory in regards.&lt;ref name="Ahrens2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geert-Hinrich Ahrens|title=Diplomacy on the Edge: Containment of Ethnic Conflict and the Minorities Working Group of the Conferences on Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3fLRcHYSVAC&amp;pg=PA323|date=6 March 2007|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8557-0|page=323|quote=CSCE mission of May 1992 judged that “on the question of the relations with Albania and of a possible unification, the answers were unclear, vague, and sometimes contraddictory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political activist [[Ukshin Hoti]], founder of the [[Party of Albanian National Union]], eventually killed by Serbian police in 1999, was a very vocal supporter of the unification of Kosovo with Albania.&lt;ref name="Krieger2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heike Krieger|title=The Kosovo Conflict and International Law: An Analytical Documentation 1974-1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OhPTJn8ZWoC&amp;pg=PA75|date=12 July 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80071-6|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[Arben Imami]], a prominent Albanian politician, stated that unification of Kosovo with Albania should be a party goal, but was quickly criticized by his own party.&lt;ref name="Koinova2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Koinova|title=Ethnonationalist Conflict in Postcommunist States: Varieties of Governance in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwpuDCcN8AIC&amp;pg=PA197|date=1 July 2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0837-5|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ahtisaari Plan]] conditioned Kosovo's independence by adopting a multiethnic “Kosovar,” rather than an Albanian identity.&lt;ref name="MabryMcGarry2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tristan James Mabry|author2=John McGarry|author3=Margaret Moore|author4=Brendan O'Leary|title=Divided Nations and European Integration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFCbBW18yU4C&amp;pg=PA182|date=30 May 2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-4497-4|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] surveys revealed that 75% of Kosovo Albanians would prefer to live unified with Albania in a single country. The same support was seen in Albania where 68% of the citizens of Albania preferred a unification of Albania with Kosovo.&lt;ref name="MabryMcGarry2013"/&gt;

In 2017 some mainstream Albanian politicians such as [[Ben Blushi]] have come out in support of unification.&lt;ref&gt;https://koha.net/?id=27&amp;l=153816&lt;/ref&gt; In Kosovo, the largest opposition [[Vetëvendosje]] supports full Albanian unification.

'''War bonds''' are [[Security (finance)#Debt|debt securities]] issued by a government to finance military operations and other expenditure in times of war.
In practice, modern governments finance war by putting additional money into circulation, and the function of the bonds is to remove money from circulation and help to control [[inflation]]. War bonds are either retail bonds marketed directly to the public or wholesale bonds traded on a stock market. Exhortations to buy war bonds are often accompanied by appeals to patriotism and conscience. Retail war bonds, like other retail bonds, tend to have a yield which is below that offered by the market and are often made available in a wide range of denominations to make them affordable for all citizens.

==Before World War I==

[[File:1847 $1,000 6% Loan .jpg|thumb|U.S. Government Loan for the Mexican–American War]]
Governments throughout history have needed to borrow money to fight wars. Traditionally they dealt with a small group of rich financiers such as [[Jakob Fugger]] and [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan Rothschild]], but no particular distinction was made between debt incurred in war or peace. An early use of the term "war bond" was for the ${{formatprice|11000000}} raised by the US Congress in an Act of 14 March 1812, to fund the [[War of 1812]], but this was not aimed at the general public. Until July 2015, perhaps the oldest bonds still outstanding as a result of war were the British [[Consols]], some of which were the result of the refinancing of incurring debts during the Napoleonic Wars, but these were redeemed following the passing of the [[Finance Act 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=gilts/about_gilts |title=About Gilts |publisher=UK Debt Management Office |accessdate=2015-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110155438/http://dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=gilts%2Fabout_gilts |archivedate=2016-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==

===Austria and Hungary===

The government of [[Austria-Hungary]] knew from the early days of the [[World War I|First World War]] that it could not count on advances from its principal banking institutions to meet the growing costs of the war. Instead, it implemented a war finance policy modeled upon that of Germany:&lt;ref name="Bogart 240"&gt;[[#Reference-Bogart|Bogart]], p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1914, the first funded loan was issued.&lt;ref name="Bogart 239"/&gt; As in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian loans followed a prearranged plan and were issued at half yearly intervals every November and May. The first Austrian bonds paid 5% interest and had a five-year term. The smallest bond denomination available was 100 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|kronen]].&lt;ref name="Bogart 239"&gt;[[#Reference-Bogart|Bogart]], p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary issued loans separately from Austria in 1919, after the war and after it had separated from Austria, in the form of stocks that permitted the subscriber to demand repayment after a year's notice. Interest was fixed at 6%, and the smallest denomination was 50 [[Hungarian korona|korona]].&lt;ref name="Bogart 239"/&gt; Subscriptions to the first Austrian bond issue amounted to the equivalent of ${{formatprice|440200000}}; those of the first Hungarian issue were equivalent to ${{formatprice|235000000}}.&lt;ref name="Bogart 239"/&gt;

The limited financial resources of children were tapped through campaigns in schools. The initial minimum Austrian bond denomination of 100 kronen still exceeded the means of most children,&lt;ref name="Healy 244"&gt;Healy, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; so the third bond issue, in 1915, introduced a scheme whereby children could donate a small amount and take out a bank loan to cover the rest of the 100 kronen.&lt;ref name="Healy 244"/&gt; The initiative was immensely successful, eliciting funds and encouraging loyalty to the state and its future among Austro-Hungarian youth.&lt;ref name="Healy 244"/&gt; Over {{Formatprice|13000000}} kronen was collected in the first three "child bond" issues.&lt;ref name="Healy 244"/&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main article|Victory war bond#World War I}}
[[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canada's involvement in the First World War]] began in 1914, with Canadian war bonds called "Victory Bonds" after 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/canada-savings-bonds/ |title=CBC News In Depth: Canada Savings Bonds |publisher=CBC |date=2007-10-03 |accessdate=2010-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811095309/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/canada-savings-bonds/ |archivedate=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first domestic war loan was raised in November 1915, but not until the fourth campaign of November 1917 was the term Victory Loan applied. The First Victory Loan was a 5.5% issue of 5, 10 and 20 year gold bonds in denominations as small as $50. It was quickly oversubscribed, collecting ${{Formatprice|398000000}} or about $50 per capita. The Second and Third Victory Loans were floated in 1918 and 1919, bringing another ${{formatprice|1340000000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victory Loans |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/victory-loans/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |first=Norman |last=Hillier |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica-Dominion |accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who could not afford to buy Victory Bonds, the government also issued War Savings Certificates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The government awarded communities who bought large amounts of bonds Victory Loan Honour Flags.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4532/ |title = 4 Reasons for Buying Victory Bonds |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1917 |accessdate = 2013-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[Image:So hilft dein Geld.jpg|thumb|upright|German war bonds by [[Lucian Bernhard]]]]
Unlike France and Britain, at the outbreak of the First World War Germany found itself largely excluded from international financial markets.&lt;ref name="Chickering 104"&gt;[[#Reference-Chickering1|Chickering (2004)]], p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; This became most apparent after an attempt to float a major loan on Wall Street failed in 1914.&lt;ref name="Chickering 104"/&gt; As such, Germany was largely limited to domestic borrowing, which was induced by a series of war credit bills passing the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]].&lt;ref name="NYT 28Oct1916"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/08/04/104651381.pdf |title=Reichstag Receives $2,856,000,000 Bill |work=The New York Times |date=1916-10-28 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in many forms; however, the most publicised were the public war bond ({{lang|de|Kriegsanleihe}}) drives.&lt;ref name="Chickering 104"/&gt;

Nine bond drives were conducted over the length of the war and, as in Austria-Hungary, the loans were issued at six-month intervals. The drives themselves would often last several weeks, during which there was extensive use of propaganda via all possible media.&lt;ref name="Chickering 196"&gt;[[#Reference-Chickering2|Chickering (2007)]], p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Most bonds had a rate of return of 5% and were redeemable over a ten-year period, in semi-annual payments.&lt;ref name="Chickering 104"/&gt; Like war bonds in other countries, the German war bonds drives were designed to be extravagant displays of patriotism and the bonds were sold through banks, post offices and other financial institutions.&lt;ref name="Chickering 104"/&gt;

As in other countries, the majority investors were not individuals but institutions and large corporations.&lt;ref name="Chickering 198"&gt;[[#Reference-Chickering2|Chickering (2007)]], p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Industries, university endowments, local banks and even city governments were the prime investors in the war bonds.&lt;ref name="Chickering 198"/&gt; In part because of intense public pressure and in part due to patriotic commitment the bond drives proved extremely successful, raising approximately {{formatprice|10000000000}} marks in funds.&lt;ref name="Chickering 105"&gt;[[#Reference-Chickering1|Chickering (2004)]], p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Although extremely successful the war bond drives only covered two-thirds of war-related expenditures.&lt;ref name="Chickering 105"/&gt; Meanwhile, the interest payable on the bonds represented a growing expense which required further resources to pay it.&lt;ref name="Chickering 105"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:The British Sovereign Will Win Invest in the War Loan To-Day poster stamp.JPG|thumb|upright|''The British Sovereign Will Win / Invest in the War Loan To-Day''. A British publicity label from World War One.]]
In August 1914 the gold reserves of the Bank of England, and effectively of all banking institutions in Great Britain, amounted to £{{Formatprice|9000000}} (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|9000000|1914|2015}}}} in 2015).&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;{{cite book | first=Thomas | last=Johnston | authorlink=Tom Johnston (Scottish politician) | title= The Financiers And The Nation | year=1934 | publisher=Methuen | location=London | url=https://archive.org/details/financiersandthe033017mbp | pages=45–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The banks feared the declaration of war would trigger a run on the banks, so the Chancellor [[David Lloyd George]] extended the August [[bank holiday]] for three days to allow time for the passing of the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]], by which Britain left the gold standard. Under this Act the Treasury issued £{{Formatprice|300000000}} (equivalent to £{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|300000000|1914|2013}}}} in 2013) of paper banknotes, without the backing of gold, with which the banks could repay their obligations.&lt;ref name=Johnston /&gt; Leading banker [[Walter Leaf]] described these Treasury notes as "essentially a War Loan free of interest, for an unlimited period, and as such was a highly profitable expedient from the point of view of the Government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Banking | series = Home university library of modern knowledge | first=Walter | last=Leaf | publisher = H. Holt and Company | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLVJAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22expedient+from%22 | page=46 | year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interest-bearing War Loan was issued in November 1914 at an interest rate of 3.5%, to be redeemed at par in 1925–28. It raised £{{Formatprice|332500000}}; £{{Formatprice|350000000}} at face value as it was issued at a 5% discount.&lt;ref name=LloydGeorge&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Lloyd George | title=War Memoirs Volume I | year=1938 | publisher=Odhams Press | location=London | url=https://archive.org/details/warmemoirsvolume035284mbp | pages=73–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was revealed in 2017 that public subscriptions amounted to £91m, and the balance had been subscribed by the Bank of England, under the names of then governor, [[John Gordon Nairne]], and his deputy [[Ernest Harvey (cashier)|Ernest Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Times|date=8 August 2017|page=20|title=Bank governor covered  up failure of war bonds}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was followed by £{{Formatprice|901000000}} of a second War Loan in June 1915, at 4.5%. £{{Formatprice|17600000}} of this was accounted for by conversion of the 3.5% issue, and a further £{{Formatprice|138000000}} by holders of 2.5% and 2.75% [[Consols]], who were also allowed to transfer to the higher interest rate.&lt;ref name=Johnston /&gt;&lt;!-- Lloyd George says £570m new money, £276.5m conversions --&gt; The government also pledged that if they issued War Loans at even higher interest, holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate.&lt;ref name=Johnston /&gt; In his memoirs Lloyd George stated his regret that his successor [[Reginald McKenna]] increased the interest rate at a time when investors had few alternatives. Not only did it directly increase the nation's annual interest payments by £{{Formatprice|100000000}} but it meant interest rates were higher throughout the economy during the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#Postwar stagnation|post-war depression]].&lt;ref name=LloydGeorge /&gt;

Compared to France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I.&lt;ref name=Horn82&gt;{{cite book | title=Britain, France, and the financing of the First World War | first= Martin | last= Horn | publisher = McGill-Queen's Press | year=2002 | isbn=978-0-7735-2294-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1l8CHbZG74C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916, and were available for terms of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at an interest rate of 5%.&lt;ref name=Horn82 /&gt; Although these were not formally designated as war bonds, advertising was explicit about their purpose. This April 1916 advertisement for 5% Exchequer bonds was typical of the time: "LEND YOUR MONEY TO YOUR COUNTRY. The soldier does not grudge offering his life to his country. He offers it freely, for his life may be the price of Victory. But Victory cannot be won without money as well as men, and your money is needed. Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk. If you invest in Exchequer Bonds your money, capital and interest alike, is secured on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, the premier security of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Lend your Money to your Country | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19160413&amp;id=hMdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NKYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6303,4185074 | page=9 | newspaper=The Glasgow Herald | date= April 13, 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy changed when [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]]'s government fell in December 1916 and [[Bonar Law]] became Chancellor in the new [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916–1922)|coalition government]]. The third War Loan was launched in January 1917 at a 5% discount to face value and paying 5% interest (or 4% tax-free for 25 years), a rate Lloyd George described as "penal".&lt;ref name=LloydGeorge /&gt; Holders of existing War Loans, Treasury Bills and War Expenditure Certificates could convert to the 5% issue.&lt;ref name=Johnston /&gt; Of the £{{Formatprice|2075250000}} raised by the 5% War Loan,&lt;ref&gt;Another £{{Formatprice|52000000}} was raised from the 4% tax-free issue in 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; only £{{Formatprice|844750000}} was new money; the rest was conversions of £{{Formatprice|820000000}} of 4.5% Loan, £{{Formatprice|280500000}} of Exchequer Bonds and £{{Formatprice|130000000}} of Treasury Bills.&lt;ref name=Johnston /&gt; Labour politician [[Tom Johnston (Scottish politician)|Tom Johnston]] would later write of the 1917 War Loan "No foreign conqueror could have devised a more complete robbery and enslavement of the British Nation".&lt;ref name=Johnston /&gt;

On 30 June 1932 [[Neville Chamberlain]] announced that the Government would exercise its right to call in the 5% War Loan, offering a choice of taking cash or continuing the loan at 3.5%.&lt;ref name=Hansard19320630&gt;{{citation | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1932/jun/30/me-chamberlains-statement | date=30 June 1932 | title = Mr. chamberlain's statement | journal = Hansard | volume = 267 | pages=2121–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were obliged to give 90 days' notice of such a change, a 1% tax-free cash bonus was offered to holders who acted by 31 July.&lt;ref name=Hansard19320630 /&gt; This conversion saved the government about £{{Formatprice|23000000}} net per year.&lt;ref name=Hansard19320630 /&gt; On 3 December 2014 the UK Government announced it would redeem the outstanding war loans on 9 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press notice Redemption of 3½% War Loan|url=http://www.dmo.gov.uk/documentview.aspx?docName=/gilts/press/pr031214.pdf|author=United Kingdom Debt Management Office|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=23 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923194237/http://www.dmo.gov.uk/documentview.aspx?docName=%2Fgilts%2Fpress%2Fpr031214.pdf|archive-date=2017-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Liberty bond}}
[[Image:LibertyBond-WinsorMcCay.jpg|thumb|upright|Advertising poster for [[World War I]] Liberty Bonds]]
In 1917 and 1918, the United States government issued Liberty Bonds to raise money for its involvement in World War I. An aggressive campaign was created by [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] to popularize the bonds, grounded largely as patriotic appeals.&lt;ref name="Kimble 15"&gt;[[#Reference-Kimble|Kimble]], p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury Department worked closely with the [[Committee on Public Information]] in developing Liberty Bond campaigns.&lt;ref name="Kimble 16"&gt;[[#Reference-Kimble|Kimble]], p.16&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting propaganda messages often borrowed heavily from military colloquial speech.&lt;ref name="Kimble 16"/&gt;

The government used famous artists to make posters, and used movie stars to host bond rallies.  [[Al Jolson]], [[Elsie Janis]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] were among the celebrities who made public appearances promoting the patriotic element of purchasing Liberty Bonds.&lt;ref&gt;''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History''&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin also made a short film, ''[[The Bond]]'', at his own expense for the drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chaplin |first=Charlie |title=My Autobiography |year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] and [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]] sold bonds under the slogan "Every Scout to Save a Soldier". The campaign spurred community efforts across the country to sell the bonds and was a great success resulting in over-subscriptions to the second, third and fourth bond issues.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', March 27, 1918, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]], "Because the first World War cost the federal government more than ${{Formatprice|30000000000}} (by way of comparison, total federal expenditures in 1913 were only ${{Formatprice|970000000}}), these programs became vital as a way to raise funds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.masshist.org/cabinet/june2002/stamps.htm | title = Focus on: Women and War | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Massachusetts Historical Society]] | accessdate = 2006-10-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060520153713/http://www.masshist.org/cabinet/june2002/stamps.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the selling of Liberty Bonds, the government raised ${{Formatprice|21500000000}} for the war effort.&lt;ref name="Kimble 16"/&gt; The majority of sales were not to individuals but to banks and financial groups that ignored the patriotic appeal and bought the bonds principally as an investment opportunity.&lt;ref name="Kimble 16"/&gt; The bond campaigns themselves proved relatively ineffective at gaining widespread public support. The majority of Americans were simply uncomfortable converting a significant portion of their savings into what was, for them, a new and uncertain form of investment.&lt;ref name="Kimble 16"/&gt; The forceful sales atmosphere associated with the Liberty Bond campaigns ultimately produced disappointing sales figures. As such, the bond campaigns are remembered more for their associated level of coercion and bullying than its patriotic and voluntary nature.&lt;ref name="Kimble 17"&gt;[[#Reference-Kimble|Kimble]], p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] would face a balancing act between coercion and volunteerism in his bond campaigns during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Kimble 17"/&gt;

==World War II==
{{anchor|Canada in WWII}}

===Canada===
[[File:GiveUsTheTools.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[A. J. Casson]]'s Canadian Victory Bonds poster ''Give Us The Tools'' 1941]]
[[File:News. First Victory Bond in N.D.G BAnQ P48S1P09334.jpg|left|thumb|Victory Bond sales in Montreal in 1943]]
[[Military history of Canada during World War II|Canada's involvement in the Second World War]] began when Canada declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] on September 10, 1939, one week after the United Kingdom. Approximately half of the Canadian war cost was covered by War Savings Certificates and war bonds known as "Victory Bonds" as in World War I.&lt;ref name="Keshen 31"&gt;[[#Reference-Keshen|Keshen]], p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; War Savings Certificates began selling in May 1940 and were sold door-to-door by volunteers as well as at banks, post offices, trust companies and other authorised dealers.&lt;ref name="Keshen 31"/&gt; They matured after seven years and paid $5 for every $4 invested but individuals could not own more than $600 each in certificates. Although the effort raised ${{Formatprice|318000000}} in funds and was successful in financially involving millions of Canadians in the war effort, it only provided the Government of Canada with a fraction of what was needed.&lt;ref name="Keshen 31"/&gt;

The sale of Victory Bonds proved far more successful financially. There were ten wartime and one postwar Victory Bond drives. Unlike the War Savings Certificates, there was no purchase limit to Victory Bonds.&lt;ref name="Keshen 31"/&gt; The bonds were issued with maturities of between six and fourteen years with interest rates ranging from 1.5% for short-term bonds and 3% for long-term bonds and were issued in denominations of between $50 and $100,000.&lt;ref name="Keshen 31"/&gt; Canadians bought ${{Formatprice|12500000000}} worth of Victory Bonds or some $550 per capita with businesses accounting for half of all Victory Bond sales.&lt;ref name="Keshen 31"/&gt; The first Victory Bond issue in February 1940 met its goal of ${{Formatprice|20000000}} in less than 48 hours, the second issue in September 1940 reaching its goal of ${{Formatprice|30000000}} almost as quickly.&lt;ref name="Keshen 32"&gt;[[#Reference-Keshen|Keshen]], p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

When it became apparent that the war would last a number of years the war bond and certificate programs were organised more formally under the [[National War Finance Committee]] in December 1941, directed initially by the president of the [[Bank of Montreal]] and subsequently by the Governor of the [[Bank of Canada]].&lt;ref name="Keshen 32"/&gt; Under the more honed direction the committee developed strategies, propaganda and the wide recruitment of volunteers for bonds drives. Bond drives took place every six months during which no other organization was permitted to solicit the public for money.&lt;ref name="Keshen 32"/&gt; The government spent over ${{Formatprice|3000000}} on marketing which employed posters, direct mailing, movie trailers, radio commercials and full page advertisement in most major daily newspaper and weekly magazine.&lt;ref name="Keshen 33"&gt;[[#Reference-Keshen|Keshen]], p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Realistic staged military invasion, such as the [[If Day]] scenario in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], were even employed to raise awareness and shock citizens into purchasing bonds.&lt;ref name="Keshen 34"&gt;[[#Reference-Keshen|Keshen]], p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] never attempted to convince the general populace to buy long-term war bonds as had been done during the First World War.&lt;ref name="Aly 294"&gt;[[#Reference-Aly|Aly &amp; Chase]], p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; The Reich government did not want to present any perceived form of public referendum on the war, which would be the indirect result if a bond drive did poorly.&lt;ref name="Aly 298"&gt;[[#Reference-Aly|Aly &amp; Chase]], p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the regime financed its war efforts by borrowing directly from financial institutions, using short-term war bonds as collateral.&lt;ref name="Aly 294"/&gt; German bankers, with no demonstration of resistance, agreed to taking state bonds into their portfolios.&lt;ref name="Aly 294"/&gt; Financial institutions transferred their money to the Finance Department in exchange for promissory notes. Through this strategy, 40 million bank and investment accounts were quietly converted into war bonds, providing the Reich government with a continuous supply of money.&lt;ref name="Aly 295"&gt;[[#Reference-Aly|Aly &amp; Chase]], p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, German bank commissioners compelled occupied Czechoslovakia to buy up German war bonds. By the end of the war, German war bonds accounted for 70% of investments held by [[Czechoslovakian]] banks.&lt;ref name="Aly 295"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the [[National Savings Movement]] was instrumental in raising funds for the [[war effort]] during both world wars. During World War II a ''War Savings Campaign'' was set up by the [[War Office]] to support the war effort. ''Local savings weeks'' were held which were promoted with posters with titles such as "Lend to Defend the Right to be Free", "Save your way to Victory" and "War Savings are Warships".

[[File:1941-05-01 President Buys First Bond.ogv|thumb|President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] introduces the Series E Bond.]]
By the summer of 1940, the victories of [[Nazi Germany]] against [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]] brought urgency to the government, which was discreetly preparing for possible United States involvement in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Kimble 19"&gt;[[#Reference-Kimble|Kimble]], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Of principal concern were issues surrounding war financing. Many of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s advisers favored a system of tax increases and enforced savings program as advocated by British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]].&lt;ref name="Kimble 19"/&gt; In theory, this would permit increased spending while decreasing the risk of inflation.&lt;ref name="Kimble 19"/&gt; Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. however preferred a voluntary loan system and began planning a national defense bond program in the fall of 1940. The intent was to unite the attractiveness of the baby bonds that had been implemented in the interwar period with the patriotic element of the [[Liberty Bonds]] from the First World War.&lt;ref name="Kimble 20"&gt;[[#Reference-Kimble|Kimble]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:"85 Million Americans Hold War Bonds" - NARA - 514205.tif|thumb|upright|left|A poster designed to encourage war bond purchases.]]
[[Hans Morgenthau]] sought the aid of [[Peter Odegard]], a political scientist specialised in propaganda, in drawing up the goals for the bond program.&lt;ref name="Kimble 23"&gt;[[#Reference-Kimble|Kimble]], p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of Odegard the Treasury began marketing the previously successful baby bonds as "defense bonds".&lt;ref name="Kimble 23"/&gt; Three new series of bond notes, Series E, F and G, would be introduced, of which [[Series E bond|Series E]] would be targeted at individuals as "defense bonds".&lt;ref name="Kimble 23"/&gt; Like the baby bonds, they were sold for as little as $18.75 and matured in ten years, at which time the United States government paid the bondholder $25.&lt;ref name="Kimble 23"/&gt; Large denominations of between $50 and $1000 were also made available, all of which, unlike the Liberty Bonds of the First World War, were non-negotiable bonds.&lt;ref name="Kimble 23"/&gt; For those that found it difficult to purchase an entire bond at once, 10-cent savings [[War savings stamps of the United States|stamps]] could be purchased and collected in Treasury-approved stamp albums until the recipient had accumulated enough stamps for a bond purchase.&lt;ref name="Kimble 24"&gt;[[#Reference-Kimble|Kimble]], p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the bonds was eventually changed to War Bonds after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, which resulted in the United States entering the war.

The War Finance Committee was placed in charge of supervising the sale of all bonds, and the [[War Advertising Council]] promoted voluntary compliance with bond buying. Popular contemporary art was used to help promote the bonds such as ''[[Any Bonds Today?]]'', a [[Warner Brothers]] theatrical cartoon. More than a quarter of a billion dollars' worth of advertising was donated during the first three years of the National Defense Savings Program. The government appealed to the public through popular culture. [[Norman Rockwell]]'s painting series, the ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'', toured in a war bond effort that raised ${{Formatprice|132000000}}.&lt;ref name=MAMPFAIRaHfF&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.michenermuseum.org/press/?item=2007-08-08 |title=Michener Art Museum Pairs Famed American Illustrators Rockwell and Hargens for Fall Exhibitions in New Hope |publisher=The James A.

Many motion pictures during the time, especially war dramas (a form of propaganda itself), included a graphic shown during the [[closing credits]] advising patrons to "Buy War Bonds and Stamps", which were sometimes sold in the lobby of the theater. The Music Publishers Protective Association encouraged its members to include patriotic messages on the front of their sheet music like "Buy U.S. Bonds and Stamps". Over the course of the war 85 million Americans purchased bonds totalling approximately ${{Formatprice|185000000000}}.

The [[Center on Conscience &amp; War|National Service Board for Religious Objectors]] offered civilian bonds in the United States during World War II, primarily to members of the [[Peace churches|historic peace churches]] as an alternative for those who could not conscientiously buy something meant to support the war. These were U.S. Government Bonds not labelled as defense bonds. In all, 33,006 subscriptions were sold for a total value of ${{Formatprice|6740161}}, mostly to [[Mennonite]]s, [[Church of the Brethren|Brethren]], and [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gingerich | first = Melvin | year = 1949 | title = Service for Peace, A History of Mennonite Civilian Public Service | location = Akron, Pa. | publisher = Mennonite Central Committee | pages = 355–358 | oclc = 1247191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gameo.org/index.php?title=Mennonite_Central_Committee_Peace_Section |title=Mennonite Central Committee Peace Section |publisher=Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online |date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Azizi speaking in Torento 2.jpg|thumb|Yousef Azizi Bani-Torof]]
'''Yousef Azizi (Bani-Torof)''' (born April 21, 1951 in [[Susangerd]], [[Iran]]) is an [[Iranian Arab]] journalist and Arab rights activist living in exile in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. Azizi is a former member of the ''Association of Iran's Writers'' and has translated many works from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] to [[Persian language|Persian]]. He has adopted a second surname, Bani-Torof, to indicate his roots from the "Bani Torof" (in Arabic meaning "Children of Torof") Arab tribe.

On April 25, 2005, he was arrested at his home by security forces in connection with the Arab youth unrest in Khuzestan earlier that month and held at [[Evin Prison]] with other Iranian journalists and dissidents. He was released on June 28, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/032/2005/en/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008 he was sentenced to five years in prison. While appealing the decision, he left Iran and gained political asylum in [[United Kingdom]].
