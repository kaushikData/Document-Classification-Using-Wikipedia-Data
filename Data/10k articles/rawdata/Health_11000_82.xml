      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14269">The '''Amazon Malaria Initiative (AMI)''' is a regional program that was created in 2001 by several countries sharing the Amazon basin with technical support from PAHO/WHO and financial support from the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID), and managed by USAID/Peru as part of its South American Regional Infectious Disease Program (SARI).&lt;ref name="external" /&gt; The initiative uses a multi-pronged approach to achieve the overall aims of preventing and controlling [[malaria]] and reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality in countries of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name="qualitycontrol" /&gt; AMI priorities  for [[malaria prevention]] are as follows, diagnosis and treatment, [[drug resistance]] and epidemiological surveillance, vector control, pharmaceutical management, quality of medicines, communication and networking.&lt;ref name="Goal 2009" /&gt;

== History ==

The rationale for creating AMI was and still remains the need to provide and invest in targeted activities to improve malaria control in the Amazon basin countries where 88% of malaria cases in Latin America and the Caribbean are reported.&lt;ref name="WHO_Rollback" /&gt; The Americas  also where medication used to treat ''P. falciparum'' malaria are being reported to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="Brochure 2014" /&gt; Nearly 95% of the malaria burden in the Americas is located in the [[Amazon basin]] region, as well as 98% of the [[Plasmodium falciparum]] infection.&lt;ref name="novel" /&gt; When AMI first launched the initial participating countries included [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], Bolivia, and Venezuela.&lt;ref name="CDCcountries" /&gt; By  2008 [[Venezuela]] ceased participation,&lt;ref name="qualitycontrol" /&gt; [[Bolivia]]  followed in 2013.&lt;ref name="CDCcountries" /&gt; AMI later expanded to eleven countries adding [[Central American]] countries [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Panama]].&lt;ref name="CDCcountries" /&gt;

== Description ==

AMI's approach to enhance malaria control in the eleven participating countries is to identify, support, and implement evidence-based interventions.&lt;ref name="Brochure 2014" /&gt; AMI partners share knowledge and lessons learned by networking across different countries, both in the Americas and around the world.&lt;ref name="Brochure 2014" /&gt; AMI hopes that all participating countries will develop strong health systems, strategic planning programs, monitoring, and evaluation, operational research and country level capacity-building.&lt;ref name="plantr" /&gt; To achieve the malaria control objective, AMI has created  the following  set of goals and priorities.&lt;ref name=Regional /&gt;

===Goals===

#Ensure malaria control programs incorporate selected best practices
#Improve malaria control at the sub-regional level
#Contribute to decrease malaria morbidity and mortality

===Priorities===

Provide effective malaria control and treatment by:
*Assessing efficacy of currently used medicines and suitable replacements
*Choosing and implementing new treatment policies
*Improving diagnostics quality assurance and quality control
*Expanding access to diagnostics test and good quality antimalarial medicines
* Strengthening vector surveillance and control and disseminating information

Since AMI has been introduced, the Americas have seen a 60% decrease in reported cases and 70% decrease in death due to malaria.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; From 2007 to 2008  the Americas reported 30% less cases of malaria as well as a 52%  decrease in mortality.&lt;ref name="healthnews" /&gt; By 2008, reports of fatal malaria cases dropped by 83%.&lt;ref name="Minsa" /&gt;  There was a decline in [[incidence rate]] from 2000 to 2012 in 18 of the 21 [[endemic]] countries.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; By 2015 Brazil, Colombia, and Peru are estimated to achieve reduction of &gt; 75%, while Panama is estimated to achieve a reduction of 25% to 50%.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;  Guyana is the only participating country to report an increase in cases between the years 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; As of 2013 Belize moved from the control phase to the pre-elimination phase joining Ecuador, while the other endemic countries remain in the control phase.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; Admiral Tim Ziemer, U.S Global Malaria Coordinator, said the work of PAHO, WHO member countries and the U.S. (supported through the Amazon Malaria Initiative) have been critical to this success.&lt;ref name="caribbean" /&gt;

Currently AMI is working on five priority areas for the AMI region: 1) consolidating the gains achieved during the first ten years of work and contributing further attention to P. vivax malaria and to populations with special needs;&lt;ref name="WHO_Rollback" /&gt; 2) making malaria control activities more feasible, independent of AMI contribution; 3) developing a regional approach to malaria prevention and control; 4) helping national malarial control programs contribute to the decentralization effect in the health sector as well as modifying malaria control strategies to divers and emerging epidemiological setting; &lt;ref name="WHO_Rollback" /&gt; 5) implementing the ''Strategy and Plan of Action for Malaria in the Americas for 2011-2015''.

=== Strategy and plan of action for malaria ===

In September 2011, countries in the Americas approved a strategy and plan of action for malaria and established key targets for 2015.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; The Americas plan of action includes a 75% reduction in malaria [[morbidity]] as well as 25% reduction in malaria related deaths by 2015.&lt;ref name="plantr" /&gt; The plan also calls to implement malaria elimination activities in areas where elimination seems possible, reverse trends in countries where malaria case were on the rise, and prevent any reintroduction of malaria in countries deemed malaria-free.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; A new multi-year strategy and plan of action will be presented to the 55th Directing Council in 2016.

As part of strategic communication and advocacy on behalf of malaria control in the region, AMI partners participate in the commemoration of international awareness days such as [[World Malaria Day]] on April 25 and [[Malaria Day in the Americas]] on November 6.

== Amazon Network for the Surveillance of Antimalarial Drug Resistance ==

Through its support for AMI, USAID helped the Pan American Health Organization to create the Amazon Network for the Surveillance of Antimalarial Drug Resistance (RAVREDA). The goal of RAVREDA is to use a network of sentinel sites to monitor medicine efficacy and address [[antimalarial drug]] resistance.&lt;ref name="global" /&gt; RAVREDA first launched as an effort to support participating countries to revise their antimalarial drug treatment policies, and promote the implementation of science-based malaria control policies.&lt;ref name="external" /&gt; RAVREDA is a country-led collaborative that monitors the emergence and spread of resistance to antimalarial medicines and addresses the risk of malaria reemergence.&lt;ref name="Brochure 2014" /&gt;  The AMI/RAVREDA  has assisted countries in the region to develop drug efficacy protocols.&lt;ref name="WHO_Report" /&gt; REVREDA tailors to local epidemiological situations as well as conducts studies of therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref name="WHO_Report" /&gt; The purpose of AMI/RAVREDA is to be the motivating role in partnerships, filling regional gaps, assisting regional and subregional coordination, supporting in the preparation of Global found applications, and creating a foundation for malaria elimination in areas where it seems feasible.&lt;ref name="WHO_Report" /&gt;

== Current partner countries ==

=== Amazon Basin countries ===

*[[Ecuador]]
*[[Guyana]]
*[[Peru]]
*[[Suriname]]

=== Central American countries ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5804">[[File:EQbrain optical stim en.jpg|thumb|300px|Amygdala hijack—fear caused by optical stimulus]]
'''Amygdala hijack''' is a term coined by [[Daniel Goleman]] in his 1996 book ''Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ''.&lt;ref name="nadler"&gt;{{cite web | last =Nadler | first =Relly | title =What Was I Thinking? Handling the Hijack | url=http://www.busmanagement.com/article/What-Was-I-Thinking-Handling-the-Hijack/ | accessdate = 2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of [[Joseph E. LeDoux]], Goleman uses the term to describe emotional responses from people which are immediate and overwhelming, and out of measure with the actual stimulus because it has triggered a much more significant emotional threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conflict and Your Brain aka The Amygdala Hijacking | url=http://www.sportnz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/attachments/managing-sport/officials-and-volunteers/Conflict-and-your-brain.pdf | accessdate = 2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Definition ==
The output of sense organs is first received by the [[thalamus]]. Part of the thalamus' stimuli goes directly to the [[amygdala]] or "emotional/irrational brain", while other parts are sent to the [[neocortex]] or "thinking/rational brain". If the amygdala perceives a match to the [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], i.e., if the record of experiences in the [[hippocampus]] tells the amygdala that it is a [[Fight-or-flight response|fight, flight or freeze situation]], then the amygdala triggers the HPA (hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal) axis and hijacks the rational brain. This emotional brain activity processes information milliseconds earlier than the rational brain, so in case of a match, the amygdala acts before any possible direction from the neocortex can be received. If, however, the amygdala does not find any match to the stimulus received with its recorded threatening situations, then it acts according to the directions received from the neocortex. When the amygdala perceives a threat, it can lead that person to react irrationally and destructively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freedman |first=Joshua |title=Hijacking of the Amygdala |url=http://www.inspirations-unlimited.net/images/Hijack.pdf |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122194535/http://www.inspirations-unlimited.net/images/Hijack.pdf |archivedate=November 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goleman states that emotions "make us pay attention right now—this is urgent—and gives us an immediate action plan without having to think twice.  The emotional component evolved very early: Do I eat it, or does it eat me?"  The emotional response "can take over the rest of the brain in a millisecond if threatened."&lt;ref name="horowitz"&gt;{{cite web | last =Horowitz | first =Shell | title =Emotional Intelligence - Stop Amygdala Hijackings  | url=http://www.umass.edu/fambiz/articles/values_culture/primal_leadership.html | accessdate = 2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hughes | first =Dennis | title =Interview with Daniel Goleman | url=http://www.shareguide.com/Goleman.html | accessdate = 2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An amygdala hijack exhibits three signs: strong emotional reaction, sudden onset, and post-episode realization if the reaction was inappropriate.&lt;ref name="horowitz"/&gt;

Goleman later emphasised that "self-control is crucial...when facing someone who is in the throes of an amygdala hijack"&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Working with Emotional Intelligence'' (1999) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; so as to avoid a complementary hijacking—whether in work situations, or in private life. Thus for example 'one key marital competence is for partners to learn to soothe their own distressed feelings...nothing gets resolved positively when husband or wife is in the midst of an emotional hijacking.'&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The danger is that "when our partner becomes, in effect, our enemy, we are in the grip of an 'amygdala hijack' in which our emotional memory, lodged in the [[limbic]] center of our brain, rules our reactions without the benefit of logic or reason...which causes our bodies to go into a 'fight or flight' response."&lt;ref&gt;Rita DeMaria et al., ''Building Intimate Relationships'' (2003) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive hijacks==
Goleman points out that "'not all limbic hijackings are distressing. When a joke strikes someone as so uproarious that their laughter is almost explosive, that, too, is a limbic response. It is at work also in moments of intense joy."&lt;ref&gt;Goleman,  ''Emotional Intelligence'' p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

He also cites the case of a man strolling by a canal when he saw a girl staring petrified at the water. "[B]efore he knew quite why, he had jumped into the water—in his coat and tie. Only once he was in the water did he realize that the girl was staring in shock at a toddler who had fallen in—whom he was able to rescue."&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotional relearning==

LeDoux was positive about the possibility of learning to control the amygdala's hair-trigger role in emotional outbursts. "Once your emotional system learns something, it seems you never let it go. What therapy does is teach you how to control it—it teaches your neocortex how to inhibit your amygdala. The propensity to act is suppressed, while your basic emotion about it remains in a subdued form."&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, ''NYTimes'', ''[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/15/science/brain-s-design-emerges-as-a-key-to-emotions.html?pagewanted=all Brain's Design Emerges As a Key to Emotions]''

'''Capital punishment in Norway''' ({{lang-no|dødsstraff}}) has been  constitutionally prohibited since 2014. 

Before that, it had been fully abolished in 1979, and earlier, from 1905 the penal code had abolished capital punishment in peacetime.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; 

In practice the last execution in peacetime was carried out on 25 February 1876, when [[Kristoffer Nilsen Svartbækken Grindalen|Kristoffer Nilsen Grindalen]] was beheaded in [[Løten]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltfortalt.no/show_single.aspx?art_id=111350|title=Den siste halshuggingen|last=Øversveen|first=Jørn|date=28 January 2009|publisher=Digitalt Fortalt|accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but several people, mainly Norwegians and Germans, were executed after the [[Second World War]] and the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|years of Nazi occupation]]; among them [[Vidkun Quisling]]. 

==History==
===Early use===
In addition to the usual capital crimes of murder and treason, medieval Norwegian law demanded execution also of people who were found guilty of witchcraft. During the [[witch-hunt]]ing of the 16th and 17th centuries, 300 persons were [[execution by burning|burned]]. About a hundred of them were from the [[Vardø]] area. Women in the north, especially in [[Finnmark]], were at particular risk due to the clergy and authorities believing that the devil resided at the edge of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/innsikt/article1941900.ece |title=Heksejakt foregår fremdeles |last=Rapp |first=Ole Magnus |date=17 August 2007 |work=Aftenposten |language=Norwegian |accessdate=27 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215155622/http://www.aftenposten.no/fakta/innsikt/article1941900.ece |archivedate=15 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V's Norwegian Law]] of 1687 described several capital crimes. A law of 16 October 1697 increased the penalty for some murders by coupling [[torture]] with the executions. On the way to the execution site the convict would be pinched with red hot tongs, and a hand would be cut off prior to decapitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhd.uit.no/birte/bygdeboka.html|title=Kjærvikmordet|publisher=University of Tromsø|language=Norwegian|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern use===
Until the 19th century, [[Lèse majesté in Norway|lèse majesté]] could result in capital punishment.{{cn|date=September 2017}} By 1815 the most inhumane forms of execution were abolished, and [[decapitation]] or shooting were the remaining authorised methods. Capital crimes were premeditated or otherwise heinous [[murder]]s as well as [[treason]].&lt;ref name=caplex&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.caplex.no/Web/ArticleView.aspx?id=9308517|encyclopedia=[[Caplex]]|title=Dødsstraff|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway abolished the death penalty for civilian crimes in 1905, but was retained for certain military crimes in wartime.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-04-28/news/mn-1445_1_death-penalty-penalty-question-capital-punishment/2 "Norway, With No Death Penalty, Balks at Treaty to Ban It"], LA Times&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation of Norway]] (1940&amp;ndash;1945), capital punishment was introduced by [[Vidkun Quisling]]'s [[Quisling regime|regime]] in September 1942, and the first of a total of nineteen executions was carried out on 16 August 1943, when police officer [[Gunnar Eilifsen]] was executed for disobedience. Before this, German law had applied, and four hundred Norwegians had already been executed. 

In 1941, the [[Cabinet Nygaardsvold]] exiled in [[London]] allowed for the death penalty after the war, and expanded its scope in 1942 to cover torture and murder. The [[legal purge in Norway after World War II|legal purge]] that followed the occupation resulted in several death sentences, of which 37 people, 25 Norwegians and 12 Germans, were executed.&lt;ref name=nkl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Nøkleby |first=Berit |authorlink=Berit Nøkleby |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl, Hans Fredrik]] |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=dødsstraff |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/d/d3.html#dodsstraff |accessdate=27 February 2009 |edition= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |volume= |location=Oslo |isbn= |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227030240/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/d/d3.html#dodsstraff |archivedate=27 December 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The last execution took place on 27 August 1948, when [[Ragnar Skancke]] was put before a [[firing squad]] at [[Akershus Fortress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side3.no/article3027687.ece|title=Den siste Norge henrettet|last=Steen Jensen|first=Øyvind|date=15 November 2010|publisher=Nettavisen (side3)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Convention on Human Rights===
In 1988 Norway signed on to protocol 6 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] which bans the use of capital punishment in peacetime&lt;ref name=caplex/&gt; and ratified protocol 13 which bans all use of capital punishment whatsoever in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nn/dokumentarkiv/Regjeringa-Bondevik-II/utanriksdepartementet/Nyheter-og-pressemeldinger/2005/noreg_har_i_dag_ratifisert_emk.html?id=258081|title=Noreg har i dag ratifisert EMK protokoll 13 om avskaffing av dødsstraff|date=16 August 2005|publisher=Regjeringen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway generally opposes capital punishment outside of the country as well. The government has banished [[Mullah Krekar]] from Norway, but has not sent him to [[Iraq]] due to the possibility of him being charged with capital crimes in his home county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=185536|title=Krekar-saken: Irak vil ikke oppgi dødsstraffen nå|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=14 November 2007|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Murder of Martine Vik Magnussen|Martine Vik Magnussen case]], Norway has declined to cooperate with the [[Yemen]]ese government unless a guarantee is made that the death penalty is off the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/article2558777.ece|title=Støre: - Dødsstraff er ikke aktuelt|last=Gunnersen|first=Anja Tho|date=12 February 2009|publisher=TV 2|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional prohibition===
The [[Constitution of Norway]] was extensively amended in May 2014. The new article 93 in the constitution explicitly prohibits capital punishment (''"Every person has the right to life. No one can be sentenced to death."'') along with torture, inhumane or degrading punishments, and slavery, and compels the government to protect against these practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1814-05-17#KAPITTEL_5|title=Kongeriket Norges Grunnlov|publisher=Lovdata|language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Public opinion==
Opinion polls have showed that about 1 in 4 Norwegians support the death penalty, with the highest support among [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] voters, among whom the support, as expressed in a poll from 2010, is at 51 percent.&lt;ref name="vilha"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article3881217.ece |title=Frp-velgere vil ha dødsstraff i Norge |date=30 October 2010 |publisher=Aftenposten/NTB |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031082844/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article3881217.ece |archivedate=31 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Progress Party politicians like [[Ulf Erik Knudsen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vl.no/samfunn/article100283.zrm |title=Frp-representant: Gi dødsstraff |date=29 October 2010 |publisher=Vårt Land/NTB |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031001233/http://www.vl.no/samfunn/article100283.zrm |archivedate=31 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jan Blomseth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/frpleder-i-tromsoe-stoetter-doedsstraff-3327878.html|title=Frp-leder i Tromsø støtter dødsstraff|last=Pettersen|first=Egil|date=28 October 2010|publisher=TV2 Nyhetene|language=Norwegian|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have expressed support for the death penalty for egregious cases of rape and murder, the party's policy is opposed to the death penalty.&lt;ref name="vilha"/&gt; An opinion poll taken after the [[2011 Norway attacks]] showed that the opposition to the death penalty remained firmly entrenched, with 16 percent supporting and 68 percent opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/10/07/nyheter/innenriks/terror/anders_behring_breivik/dodsstraff/18499197/|title=Nordmenn vil ikke at Breivik skal henrettes|last=Meldalen|first=Sindre Granly|date=8 October 2011|publisher=Dagbladet|language=Norwegian|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)''' is a psychological questionnaire designed to measure [[sleep]] behaviors in children and adolescents ages 4-12. The 52-question test is filled out by the parent and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.  The CSHQ has demonstrated good [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] and [[Test validity|validity]] in measuring child sleep habits and problems. &lt;ref name=GoodlinJonesEtAl2008/&gt; &lt;ref name=OwensEtAl2000/&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}
'''Clarifiers''' are settling tanks built with mechanical means for continuous removal of solids being deposited by [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]].&lt;ref name=b2/&gt; A clarifier is generally used to remove solid particulates or suspended solids from liquid for clarification and (or) thickening. Concentrated impurities, discharged from the bottom of the tank are known as sludge, while the particles that float to the surface of the liquid are called scum.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1002-002, Güstrow, Zuckerwerk, Klärwerk.jpg|thumb|Circular clarifier with surface skimmer visible in the lower right.  As the skimmer slowly rotates around the clarifier, skimmed floating material is pushed into the trap visible above the fenced enclosure at the lower left.]]

==Applications==
===Pretreatment===
Before the water enters the clarifier, coagulation and [[flocculation]] reagents, such as [[polyelectrolyte]]s and [[ferric sulfate]],&lt;ref name=brent&gt;Brentwood Industries, Inc. (2013). [http://www.brentwood-ind.com/water/tubesettlersystems.html "Tube Settler Systems For Clarification."] Accessed 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; can be added. These reagents cause finely suspended particles to clump together and form larger and denser particles, called flocs, that settle more quickly and stably. This allows the separation of the solids in the clarifier to occur more efficiently and easily; aiding in the conservation of energy.&lt;ref name=brent/&gt; Isolating the particle components first using these processes may reduce the volume of downstream [[water treatment]] processes like filtration.

===Potable water treatment===
Water being [[Water purification|purified]] for human consumption, is treated with floculation reagents, then sent to the clarifier where removal of the flocculated coagulate occurs producing clarified water. The clarifier works by permitting the heavier and larger particles to settle to the bottom of the clarifier. The particles then form a bottom  layer of sludge requiring regular removal and disposal. Clarified water then proceeds through [[Water purification#Treatment|several more steps]] before being sent for storage and use.&lt;ref name=brent/&gt;

===Waste water treatment===
Sedimentation tanks have been used to treat wastewater for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Chatzakis, M.K., Lyrintzis, A.G., Mara, D.D., and Angelakis, A.N. (2006). "Sedimentation Tanks through the Ages." Proceedings of the 1st IWA International Symposium on Water and Wastewater Technologies in Ancient Civilizations, Iraklio, Greece, 28–30 October 2006, pp. 757–762.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|Primary treatment]] of [[sewage]] is removal of floating and settleable solids through sedimentation.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; ''Primary clarifiers'' reduce the content of suspended solids and pollutants embedded in those suspended solids.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;{{cite report |date=2004 |title=Primer for Municipal Wastewater Treatment Systems |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-resources |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 832-R-04-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–9}} Because of the large amount of [[reagent]] necessary to treat domestic wastewater, preliminary chemical coagulation and flocculation are generally not used, remaining suspended solids being reduced by following stages of the system. However, coagulation and flocculation can be used for building a compact treatment plant (also called a "package treatment plant"), or for further polishing of the treated water.&lt;ref name="EPA Package"&gt;{{cite report |date=2000 |title=Package Plants |series=Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/package_plant.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 832-F-00-016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedimentation tanks called ''secondary clarifiers'' remove flocs of biological growth created in some methods of [[Sewage treatment#Secondary treatment|secondary treatment]] including [[activated sludge]], [[trickling filter]]s and [[rotating biological contactor]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|13}}

===Mining===
Methods used to treat suspended solids in mining wastewater include sedimentation and floc blanket clarification and filtration.&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;Gorshkov, V. A., Kharionovsky A. A., "Main Methods and Techniques of Mine Water Treatment in the USA", ''International Journal of Mine Water,'' 4 (1983), Spain. pp. 27-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Sedimentation is used by Rio Tinto Minerals to refine raw ore into refined borates. After dissolving the ore, the saturated borate solution is pumped into a large settling tank. Borates float on top of the liquor while rock and clay settles to the bottom.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;Rio Tinto Minerals. [http://www.riotintominerals.com/ENG/ourapproach/34_Mining_refining_borates.asp "Mining &amp; Refining Borates."] Accessed 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[File:Decantação.jpg|thumb|Rectangular sedimentation tanks with effluent weir structure visible above the fluid surface.]]
[[File:Sedimentation tank.jpg|thumb|Drained circular sedimentation tank showing central inlet baffles on the right with solids scraper and skimmer arms visible under the rotating bridge.]]

Although sedimentation might occur in tanks of other shapes, removal of accumulated solids is easiest with [[conveyor belt]]s in rectangular tanks or with scrapers rotating around the central axis of circular tanks.&lt;ref name=Metcalf/&gt; Mechanical solids removal devices move as slowly as practical to minimize resuspension of settled solids.  Tanks are sized to give water an optimal residence time within the tank.  Economy favors using small tanks; but if flow rate through the tank is too high, most particles will not have sufficient time to settle, and will be carried with the treated water.  Considerable attention is focused on reducing water inlet and outlet velocities to minimize [[turbulence]] and promote effective settling throughout available tank volume.  [[Baffle (in vessel)|Baffles]] are used to prevent fluid velocities at the tank entrance from extending into the tank; and overflow [[weir]]s are used to uniformly distribute flow from liquid leaving the tank over a wide area of the surface to minimize resuspension of settling particles.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp. 128–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tube settlers===
{{main|Lamella clarifier}}
Tube settlers are commonly used in rectangular clarifiers to increase the settling capacity by reducing the vertical distance a suspended particle must travel. High efficiency tube settlers use a stack of parallel tubes, rectangles or flat pieces separated by a few inches (several centimeters) and sloping upwards in the direction of flow.  This structure creates a large number of narrow parallel flow pathways encouraging uniform laminar flow as modeled by [[Stokes' law]].&lt;ref name="web"&gt;Weber, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; These structures work in two ways:
#They provide a very large surface area onto which particles may fall and become stabilized.
#Because flow is temporarily accelerated between the plates and then immediately slows down, this helps to aggregate very fine particles that can settle as the flow exits the plates.

Structures inclined between 45°&amp;nbsp; and 60°&amp;nbsp; may allow gravity drainage of accumulated solids, but shallower angles of inclination typically require periodic draining and cleaning.  Tube settlers may allow the use of a smaller clarifier and may enable finer particles to be separated with residence times less than 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="web"/&gt; Typically such structures are used for difficult-to-treat waters, especially those containing [[colloid]]al materials.

Tube settlers capture the fine particles allowing the larger particles to travel to the bottom of the clarifier in a more uniform form. The fine particles then build up into a larger mass which then slides down the tube channels. The reduction in solids present in the outflow allows a reduction in the clarifier footprint when designing. Tubes made of [[PVC]] plastic are a minor cost in clarifier design improvements and may lead to an increase of operating rate of 2 to 4 times.&lt;ref&gt;SBS Enviro Concepts (2008). [http://www.sbsenviro.com/tube-settlers.htm "Tube Settlers."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202814/http://www.sbsenviro.com/tube-settlers.htm |date=2013-10-29 }} Accessed 14 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foroozan, L. (2001). [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/9913.html "Hydrologic Analysis and Flow Control Design/BMPs."] ''Stormwater Management Manual for Western Washington,'' Vol. III. Washington State Department of Ecology. Publication 9913. p. 93. Accessed 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation===
In order to maintain and promote the proper processing of a clarifier, it is important to remove any corrosive, reactive and polymerisable component first, or any material that may foul the outlet stream of water to avoid any unwanted side reactions, changes in the product or cause damage to any of the water treatment equipment. This is done by routine inspections and the frequent cleaning of the quiescent zones and the inlet and outlet areas of the clarifier in order to ascertain the extent of sediment build up and to clean and remove any scouring, litter, weeds or debris that may have accumulated over time.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Western Regional Aquaculture Center, University of Washington. Seattle, WA (2001). "Settling Basin Design." WRAC Publication No. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water being introduced into the clarifier should be controlled to reduce the velocity of the inlet flow. Reducing the velocity maximizes the hydraulic retention time inside the clarifier for sedimentation and helps to avoid excessive turbulence and mixing; thereby promoting the effective settling of the suspended particles. To further discourage the overt mixing within the clarifier and increase the retention time allowed for the particles to settle, the inlet flow should also be distributed evenly across the entire cross section of the settling zone inside the clarifier, where the volume is maintained at 37.7 percent capacity.

The sludge formed from the settled particles at the bottom of each clarifier, if left for an extended period of time, may become gluey and viscous, causing difficulties in its removal. This formation of sludge, promotes anaerobic conditions and a healthy environment for the growth of bacteria. This can cause the resuspension of particles by gases and the release of dissolved nutrients throughout the water fluid, reducing the effectiveness of the clarifier. Major health issues and problems can also occur further down the track of the [[water purification]] system or hinder the health of the fish found downstream of the clarifier.

==New development==
Improvements and modifications have been made to enhance clarifier performance dependent on the constraints of the substance undergoing the separation.

Addition of flocculants is common to aid separation in clarifiers, but density difference of flocculant concentrate may cause treated water to have an excessive flocculant concentration. Uniform flocculent concentration can be improved and flocculant dosage reduced by installation of an intermediate diffused wall perpendicular to the flow in the clarifier.&lt;ref&gt;Zytner, Richard G.
[http://www.soe.uoguelph.ca/webfiles/rzytner/WQ/Settling_DW.pdf "Solids Separation."] School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Accessed 14 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two dominant forces acting upon the solid particles in clarifiers are gravity and particle interactions. Disproportional flow can lead to turbulent and hydraulic instability and potential flow short-circuiting. Installation of perforated baffle walls in modern clarifiers promotes uniform flow across the basin. Rectangular clarifiers are commonly used for high efficiency and low running cost. Improvements of these clarifiers were made to stabilize flow by elongation and narrowing of the tank.

==History==
*1896 Women Sanitary Inspectors' Association founded by seven women sanitary workers, all based in London.
*1915 renamed the Women Sanitary Inspectors' and Health Visitors' Association. 
*1917 removed the limitation of membership to qualified [[Sanitary Inspector]]s.  
*1918 Association registered as a Trade Union, affiliated to [[National and Local Government Officers' Association]] and to the [[National Union of Women Workers]]
*1921 membership widened to include School Nurses and other kinds of public health work
*1924 affiliated to the [[Trades Union Congress]]
*1930 renamed Women Public Health Officers' Association 
*1962 renamed  Health Visitors' Association
*1992 amalgamated with the [[Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Visitors' Association|url=http://archives.wellcome.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=(AltRefNo==%27SA/HVA%27)|website=Wellcome library|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health visitors were involved with [[Women's suffrage]]. The colours of the CPHVA’s logo are still mauve and green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Cheryl|title=A paper by Cheryll Adams on the History of Health Visiting|url=http://www.ihv.org.uk/policy_professional/history_of_health_visiting_2/a_paper_by_cheryll_adams_on_the_history_of_health_|website=Institute of Health Visiting|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archives of the organisation from 1902 to 1984, when Jane Wyndham-Kaye retired as General Secretary, are held in the [[Wellcome Collection]].

==Campaigns==

It is concerned about the wider determinants of health as well as the prospects for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Political parties and NHS proposals|url=http://www.nursinginpractice.com/article/political-parties-and-nhs-proposals|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=Nursing Practice|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association is concerned about changes to the commissioning of community services for children, which will be transferred to [[Local government in England|local councils]] in October 2015, as commissioning of school nursing was in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concerns raised about health visiting once councils take over|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/specialisms/public-health/health-visitors-warned-to-be-very-clear-about-your-value/5076293.article|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=Nursing Times|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a member of the Paediatric Continence Forum, which presses for improvements in paediatric continence care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Specialist nurses call for more funding in child continence services|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/specialisms/childrens-nursing/specialist-nurses-call-for-more-funding-in-child-continence-services/5074966.article|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=Nursing Times|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 there were 12292 health visitors in England and Wales, an increase from 10,046 in 2000.  In 2000 there were 297 children under 5 per health visitor, a figure which rose to 419 in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#HVFactsandFigures|url=http://www.unitetheunion.org/how-we-help/list-of-sectors/healthsector/healthsectoryourprofession/cphva/cphva---facts-and-figures/|website=CPHVA|publisher=Unite|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but is now declining after an increase in the numbers of health visitors trained, a pledge of the [[Coalition Government 2010–2015|coalition government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Health visiting revitalised|url=http://www.independentnurse.co.uk/news/health-visiting-revitalised/75106/|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=Independent Nurse|date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cut of £200 million in local authority public health visitors is seen by the association as a threat to health visitor numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: 'Grave concerns' for hard-won health visitor gains|url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice/specialisms/district-and-community-nursing/exclusive-grave-concerns-for-hard-won-health-visitor-gains/5087773.article|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=Nursing Times|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''De Barsy syndrome''' is a rare [[Recessive#Autosomal recessive gene|autosomal recessive]] [[genetic disorder]]. Symptoms include [[cutis laxa]] (loose hanging skin) as well as other eye, [[musculoskeletal disorder|musculoskeletal]], and [[neurological disorder|neurological]] abnormalities.&lt;ref name="cigna"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Cigna| title=De Barsy Syndrome| accessdate=2011-08-14| url=http://www.cigna.com/healthinfo/nord979.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually progressive, manifesting side effects that can include clouded [[cornea]]s, [[cataract]]s, short stature, [[dystonia]], or [[progeria]] (premature aging).&lt;ref name="ARCL II"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1099–110 |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2009.22 |pmc=2986595 |title=Autosomal recessive cutis laxa syndrome revisited |year=2009 |last1=Morava |first1=Éva |last2=Guillard |first2=Maïlys |last3=Lefeber |first3=Dirk J |last4=Wevers |first4=Ron A |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=17 |issue=9 |pmid=19401719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first described in 1967 by De Barsy et al. and, as of 2011, there have been 27 cases reported worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=99–107 |doi=10.1097/MCD.0b013e3282f4a964 |title=De Barsy syndrome: A review of the phenotype |year=2008 |last1=Kivuva |first1=Emma C. |last2=Parker |first2=Michael J. |last3=Cohen |first3=Marta C. |last4=Wagner |first4=Bart E. |last5=Sobey |first5=Glenda |journal=Clinical Dysmorphology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pmid=18388779}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes that cause De Barsy syndrome have not been identified yet,&lt;ref name="ARCL II"/&gt; although several studies have narrowed down the symptoms' cause.&lt;ref name="ATP"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2009.218 |pmc=2987315 |title=De Barsy syndrome and ATP6V0A2-CDG |year=2009 |last1=Leao-Teles |first1=Elisa |last2=Quelhas |first2=Dulce |last3=Vilarinho |first3=Laura |last4=Jaeken |first4=Jaak |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=526 |pmid=20010974}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Reversade et al. has shown that a mutation in [[PYCR1]], the genetic sequence that codes for [[mitochondrian|mitochondrial]] [[enzyme]]s that break down [[proline]], are prevalent in cases of autosomal recessive cutis laxa (ARCL), a condition very similar to De Barsy syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1016–21 |doi=10.1038/ng.413 |title=Mutations in PYCR1 cause cutis laxa with progeroid features |year=2009 |last1=Reversade |first1=Bruno |last2=Escande-Beillard |first2=Nathalie |last3=Dimopoulou |first3=Aikaterini |last4=Fischer |first4=Björn |last5=Chng |first5=Serene C |last6=Li |first6=Yun |last7=Shboul |first7=Mohammad |last8=Tham |first8=Puay-Yoke |last9=Kayserili |first9=Hülya |last10=Al-Gazali |first10=Lihadh |last11=Shahwan |first11=Monzer |last12=Brancati |first12=Francesco |last13=Lee |first13=Hane |last14=O'Connor |first14=Brian D |last15=Kegler |first15=Mareen Schmidt-von |last16=Merriman |first16=Barry |last17=Nelson |first17=Stanley F |last18=Masri |first18=Amira |last19=Alkazaleh |first19=Fawaz |last20=Guerra |first20=Deanna |last21=Ferrari |first21=Paola |last22=Nanda |first22=Arti |last23=Rajab |first23=Anna |last24=Markie |first24=David |last25=Gray |first25=Mary |last26=Nelson |first26=John |last27=Grix |first27=Arthur |last28=Sommer |first28=Annemarie |last29=Savarirayan |first29=Ravi |last30=Janecke |first30=Andreas R |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=9 |pmid=19648921|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Leao-Teles et al. has shown that De Barsy syndrome may be related to mutations in ATP6V0A2 gene, known as ATP6V0A2-CDG by the new naming system.&lt;ref name="ATP"/&gt;

Alternative names for De Barsy syndrome include corneal clouding-cutis laxa-mental retardation, cutis laxa-growth deficiency syndrome, De Barsy–Moens–Diercks syndrome, and progeroid syndrome of De Barsy.&lt;ref name="cigna"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1389">'''Enamel spindles''' are "short, linear defects, found at the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) and extend into the [[Tooth enamel|enamel]], often being more prevalent at the [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]] tips."&lt;ref name="Histology Course Notes 2004, page 2"&gt;Histology Course Notes: "Mature Enamel", New Jersey Dental School, 2003-2004, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The DEJ is the [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] of the enamel and the underlying [[dentin]].  Because they are "formed by entrapment of [[odontoblast]] processes between [[ameloblast]]s prior to and during [[amelogenesis]]," they cannot be found at the enamel surface protruding inward, as [[enamel lamellae]] are often located. 

Enamel spindles are often confused with two other entities: [[enamel lamellae]] and [[enamel tufts]]. Lamellae are linear enamel defects that extend from the surface of the enamel towards the DEJ, or vice versa. Enamel tufts are "small, branching defects that are found only at the DEJ, protruding into the enamel towards the enamel surface. Enamel spindles however, are in fact odontoblast processes that extend into the enamel. &lt;ref name="Histology Course Notes 2004, page 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oral Biology Course Notes: "Dentine and Pulp", Otago University School of Dentistry, 2006-2007, pg 109. &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34212">The '''epidemiology of herpes simplex''' is of substantial [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] and [[public health]] interest. Worldwide, the rate of [[infection]] with [[herpes simplex virus]]—counting both HSV-1 and HSV-2—is around 90%.&lt;ref name="pmid21348071"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wald |first1=Anna |last2=Corey |first2=Lawrence |title=Human Herpesviruses: Biology, Therapy, and Immunoprophylaxis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2007|chapter=Chapter 36: Persistence in the population: epidemiology, transmission |isbn=978-0-521-82714-0 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47447}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many people infected with HSV develop labial or genital lesions ([[herpes simplex]]), the majority are either undiagnosed or display no physical symptoms—individuals with no symptoms are described as asymptomatic or as having [[Subclinical infection|subclinical]] herpes.&lt;ref name="pmid11095834"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Handsfield HH |title=Public Health Strategies to Prevent Genital Herpes: Where Do We Stand? |journal=Curr Infect Dis Rep |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=25–30 |year=2000 |pmid=11095834 |doi=10.1007/s11908-000-0084-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many infections, the first symptom a person will have of their own infection is the horizontal transmission to a sexual partner or the vertical transmission of neonatal herpes to a newborn at term. Since most asymptomatic individuals are unaware of their infection, they are considered at high risk for spreading HSV.  Many studies have been performed around the world to estimate the numbers of individuals infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 by determining if they have developed antibodies against either [[viral species]].&lt;ref name="pmid12353183"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith JS, Robinson NJ |title=Age-specific prevalence of infection with herpes simplex virus types 2 and 1: a global review |journal=J.

This information provides population prevalence of HSV viral infections in individuals with or without active disease. It has to be remembered that there are population subgroups that are more
vulnerable for HSV infections, such as [[cancer chemotherapy]] patients.&lt;ref name="Syst"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Elad S, Zadik Y, Hewson I, etal |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993–1006 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20544224 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
Large differences in HSV-1 [[seroprevalence]] are seen in different [[Europe|European countries]]. HSV-1 seroprevalence is high in [[Bulgaria]] (83.9%) and The [[Czech Republic]] (80.6%), and lower in Belgium (67.4%), The [[Netherlands]] (56.7%), and [[Finland]] (52.4%).&lt;ref name="pmid15170000"/&gt;

The typical age at which HSV-1 infection is acquired ranges from 5 to 9 years in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an countries like Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, to over 25 years of age in [[Northern Europe]]an countries such as Finland, The Netherlands, Germany, and England and [[Wales]]. Young adults in Northern European countries are less likely to be infected with HSV-1.  European women are more likely to be HSV-1 [[seropositive]] than men.&lt;ref name="pmid15170000"/&gt;

HSV-2 seropositivity is widely distributed in Europeans older than 12, although there are large differences in the percentage of the population exposed to HSV-2. Bulgaria has a high (23.9%) HSV-2 seroprevalence relative to other European countries: Germany (13.9%), Finland (13.4%),
Belgium (11.1%), The Netherlands (8.8%), the Czech Republic (6.0%), and England and Wales (4.2%).&lt;ref name="pmid15170000"/&gt;

Women are more likely to be seropositive than men, and likely acquire the virus at an earlier age.  In each country of Europe, HSV-2 seropositivity becomes more common from adolescence onwards and increases in the population with age, with a decline in the older age groups in some countries.&lt;ref name="pmid15170000"/&gt;

==North America==

===United States===
The most recent data for HSV-2 was published in March 2010, based on a [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] study performed between 2005 and 2013 by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]. About 1 in 6 Americans (16.2%) aged 14 to 49 is infected with HSV-2. HSV-2 prevalence was nearly twice as high among women (20.9%) than men (11.5%), and was more than three times higher among blacks (39.2%) than non-Hispanic whites (12.3%).&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Xu F, Sternberg MR, Gottlieb SL, Berman SM, Markowitz LE, Forhan SE, Taylor |title=Seroprevalence of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Among Persons Aged 14–49 Years—United States, 2005–2013|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)|date=23 April 2010|volume=59|issue=15|pages=456–459|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5915a3.htm|accessdate=12 April 2011 |pmid=20414188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most affected group was black women, with a prevalence rate of 48%. Prevalence increased with age and number of partners. Only 18.9% of those infected had previously been aware of their infection.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
HSV-2 is more common in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] than in Europe or the North America. Up to 82% of women and 53% of men in Sub-Saharan Africa are seropositive for HSV-2.  &lt;!-- Referenced in table. --&gt;These are the highest levels of HSV-2 infection in the world, although exact levels vary from country to country in this continent.&lt;ref name="pmid15115627"&gt;{{cite journal

In most African countries, HSV-2 prevalence increases with age. However, age-associated decreases in HSV-2 seroprevalence has been observed for women in [[Uganda]] and [[Zambia]], and in men in [[Ethiopia]], [[Benin]], and Uganda.&lt;ref name="pmid12353183"/&gt;

===Northern Africa===
Genital herpes appears less common in [[North Africa|Northern Africa]] compared to Sub-Saharan Africa.  For example, only 26% of middle-aged women have antibodies for HSV-2 in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="pmid18080353"/&gt;  Women are more likely to be infected with HSV-2 once they are over the age of 40.&lt;ref name="pmid18080353"/&gt;

The highest HSV-2 prevalence in Central or South America—60%—has been found in [[Colombia]]n middle-aged women, although similar HSV-2 prevalence has been observed in younger women in [[Haiti]] (54%).&lt;ref name="pmid12353183"/&gt; HSV-2 infects about 30% of women over 30 years old in [[Colombia]], Costa Rica, Mexico, and [[Panama]]. HSV-2 antibodies were found in more than 41% of women of childbearing age in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name="pmid12353183"/&gt;

However, no increase in seroprevalence was associated with age in women over 40 years old in Brazil—HSV-2 prevalence was estimated at 50% among women aged 40–49, 33% among women 50–59, and 42% among women over 60. Women in Brazil are more likely to acquire an HSV-2 infection if their male partners had history of anal sex and had many sexual partners in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="pmid18080353"/&gt;   In [[Peru]], HSV-2 prevalence is also high among women in their 30s but is lower in men.&lt;ref name="pmid12353183"/&gt;

'''Ernest Joachim Sternglass''' (September 24, 1923 – February 12, 2015) was a [[Professor#Other designations|professor emeritus]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and director of the [[Radiation and Public Health Project]]. He is an American [[physicist]] and author, best known for his controversial research on the health risks of [[Ionizing radiation#Radiation levels|low-level radiation]] from [[nuclear testing|atmospheric testing]] of [[nuclear weapons]] and from [[nuclear power|nuclear power plants]].

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
&lt;!-- headed the Apollo Lunar Scientific station project at [[Westinghouse Research Laboratories]]. His 1997 memoir details a classical model for the [[pion|neutral pi meson]] (p. 134), first disclosed to [[Richard Feynman]]. He was personally encouraged by [[Albert Einstein]]: ''Be stubborn''. --&gt;

Both of his parents were physicians. When Ernest was fourteen, the Sternglass family left Germany in 1938 to avoid the Nazi regime. He completed high school at the age of sixteen, then entered [[Cornell University|Cornell]], registering for an engineering program.

Financial difficulties encountered by his family forced him to leave school for a year. By the time he returned to Cornell, the U.S. had entered World War II. Sternglass volunteered for the navy. He was about to ship out when the atomic bomb was detonated over [[Hiroshima]]. After the war Sternglass married.

== Research career ==
In [[Washington, D.C.]] he worked as a civilian employee at the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]], which researched military weapons. Sternglass began studying [[night vision devices]], which led him to work with radiation. In 1947, his first son was born, and he had the opportunity to meet [[Albert Einstein]]. They discussed his results which suggested  a low energy creation of neutrons, a work that came to be rediscovered four decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Anderson, [http://nautil.us/issue/7/waste/einsteins-lost-hypothesis ''Einstein’s Lost Hypothesis''], [[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]], issue 7, Nov. 28, 2013 
&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1952 to 1967 Sternglass worked at the [[Westinghouse Research Laboratory]]. Early in his time at Westinghouse, he proposed a technology for image intensification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

All his work there involved nuclear instrumentation.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} At first he studied [[fluoroscopy]], which "exposes an individual to a considerable dose of radiation."{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Then he worked on a new kind of television tube for satellites.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Eventually, he was put in charge of the Lunar Station program at [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]].&lt;ref&gt;Scientific studies on the moon (Proposed emplaced scientific station for lunar surface studies) MORRIS, V B | SHELTON, R D | STERNGLASS, E J WESTINGHOUSE ENGINEER. Vol. 27, pp. 66-72. May 1967&lt;/ref&gt;
During his time at Westinghouse, he worked on a wide range of projects, including applying [[magnetohydrodynamics]] to [[gas-cooled reactor]] systems, and helping to develop the video cameras used in [[Project Apollo]].&lt;ref name=ns1980&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Sternglass moved to the Department of Radiology at the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine]], where he eventually was named professor emeritus. While there, through the early 1990s, he led pioneering work on the development of digital X-ray technology for medical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/02/physicist-ernest-sternglass-dies-91|title=Physicist Ernest Sternglass dies at 91|first=Blaine|last=Friedlander|newspaper=Cornell Chronicle|date=February 17, 2015|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternglass was director, co-founder, and chief technical officer of the [[Radiation and Public Health Project]] (RPHP). He died of heart failure on February 12, 2015, in Ithaca, New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/02/physicist-ernest-sternglass-dies-91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of radiation harm==
In the early 1960s Sternglass became aware of the work of [[Alice Stewart]]. Stewart was head of the Department of Preventive Medicine of [[Oxford University]], responsible for a pioneering study on the [[Linear no-threshold model|effects of low-level radiation]] in [[England]]. Stewart had discovered that a small amount{{Quantify|date=August 2016}} of radiation to an unborn child could double the child's chances for [[leukemia]] and [[cancer]].

In the 1960s, Sternglass studied the effect of [[nuclear fallout]] on infants and children. He claimed not only an increase in leukemia and cancer, but a significant increase in [[infant mortality]]. In 1963 he published the paper "Cancer: Relation of Prenatal Radiation to Development of the Disease in Childhood" in the journal ''Science''.&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Sternglass. "[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/140/3571/1102 Cancer: Relation of Prenatal Radiation to Development of the Disease in Childhood]", ''Science'', 7 June 1963: Vol. 140. no. 3571, pp. 1102 - 1104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Sternglass testified before the congressional [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] regarding the level of [[strontium-90]] found in children as part of the [[Baby Tooth Survey]]. The result of bomb-test fallout, strontium-90, was associated with increased childhood leukemia. His studies played a role in the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In 1969, Sternglass reached the conclusion that 400,000 infants had died because of medical problems caused by fallout—chiefly lowered resistance to disease and reductions in birth weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerald H. |last=Clarfield |first2=William M. |last2=Wiecek |year=1984 |title=Nuclear America: Military and Civilian Nuclear Power in the United States 1940–1980 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-015336-9 |page=359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an article in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', he claimed that the fallout from the nuclear explosions of an [[Anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) system would kill all children in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Sternglass, Sep 1969, "The Death of All Children", Esquire magazine&lt;/ref&gt; (This claim was distorted by [[Dixy Lee Ray]] in 1989, asserting that Sternglass had said this of all ''nuclear weapons testing'', in an op-ed in which she also dismissed [[anthropogenic global warming]] as "the current scare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dixy Lee |last=Ray |title=Who Speaks for Science? |journal=[[Journal of Nuclear Medicine]] |volume=30 |issue=11 |year=1989 |pages=1768–72 [p. 1772] |url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/30/11/1768.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Freeman Dyson]], taking up the debate over ABM systems in the pages of [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]], disagreed with Sternglass, although he admitted
:The evidence is not sufficient to prove Sternglass is right [but] the essential point is that Sternglass may be right. The margin of uncertainty in the effects of world-wide fallout is so large that we have no justification for dismissing Sternglass's numbers as fantastic."&lt;ref name=BAS69dyson&gt;Freeman Dyson, "A Case for Missile Defense," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, April 1969; and Dyson, "Comments on Sternglass's Thesis," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, June 1969, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Sternglass claimed that infant mortality rates increased in communities living in close proximity to nuclear industrial facilities. His study included several nuclear power plants and a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility. He claimed that when setting allowable limits for nuclear industrial emissions "the AEC grossly misjudged the sensitivity of the fetus."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pittsburgh professor claims nuclear power plants increase infant deaths (1971) - on Newspapers.com|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3149218/pittsburgh_professor_claims_nuclear/|website = Newspapers.com|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Sternglass identified elevated levels of radiation and increased cancer and infant mortality incidence in [[Shippingport, Pennsylvania]]. This prompted a scientific review initiated by Pennsylvania governor, Milton Shapp. The review concluded that "it was impossible to rule out the fact that there may have been a relationship between environmental radiation exposure from the Shippingport operation and an increased death rate in the population."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10443469/dying_town_update_shippingport/|title=Dying Town Update - Shippingport, Pennsylvania (1977)|date=1977-11-16|work=The Daily Times|access-date=2017-04-22|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Sternglass began extending his analyses of fallout effects to embrace behavioral disorders, including academic deficits seen in high school students.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Sternglass and Stephen Bell, "Fallout and the Decline of Scholastic Aptitude Scores," a paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]], New York, New York, September 3, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;
Later he was to blame radioactivity for higher crime rates and higher AIDS mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical responses==

Alice Stewart, whose work was the inspiration for the work of Sternglass on radiation health effects, firmly repudiated it, saying of an encounter with him in 1969:
:Sternglass had been tremendously excited about our findings [....] But he had exaggerated what we'd said, grossly exaggerated, and we comment on this in the ''New Scientist''.&lt;ref name =stewart69ns&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He's said that we'd shown that fetal x-rays had doubled the infant mortality rate, when all we'd said was you'd doubled the chance of a child's dying from cancer. Well, the difference is that one is measured in thousands and the other in single figures [....] Sternglass was a supporter of our work, but he had got our figures very wrong, and we couldn't have our statistics misused like that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn = 0-472-08783-5 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] of Sternglass's 1972 ''Low-Level Radiation'' lauded the author for bringing the risks (and the nuclear industry's reluctance to discuss them openly) to public attention, with a relatively "calm presentation" compared to other recent titles, however, the reviewers sided more with Stewart on methodology, saying that it was
:... over-confident in its manner of reaching conclusions. [....] his method is to [...] to amass many instances of events under various conditions, necessarily uncontrolled, that seem to corroborate the same trend. [...] it seems likely that he has exercised some selectivity, emphasizing favorable cases over those showing no distinct trend. [....] his work should be but a beginning.

== Three Mile Island ==

In April 1979, Sternglass was invited to testify to Congressional hearings on the [[Three Mile Island accident]]. Two days later, when the hearings were moved from the House to the Senate, he was told his testimony was no longer desired.  Sternglass believed that an effort was being made to suppress any evidence about possible deaths as a result of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest J. Sternglass (1981) ''[http://www.ratical.org/radiation/SecretFallout/SFchp17.html Secret Fallout: low-level radiation from Hiroshima to Three-Mile Island]''&lt;/ref&gt; In a paper presented at an engineering and architecture congress, Sternglass argued that an excess of 430 infant deaths in the U.S. northeast that summer could largely be attributed to Three Mile Island radiation releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

&lt;/ref&gt;
This led some writers on environmental issues to claim that he had proven that figure as a ''minimum''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oJi8ufgzrAwC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=Ernest+J.+Sternglass+professor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4bPpn9nOGb&amp;sig=haKA6KiFmsq6hufJXUeXcVy3OHI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OuIySpnMKYSgkQW22qn7CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7 An introduction to global environmental issues by Kevin T. Pickering] p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sternglass's methodology was criticized—including by the medical researcher who provided him with the statistics (Gordon MacLeod), and by an otherwise-sympathetic researcher with the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] ([[Arthur Tamplin]]) -- on several counts:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

*for not attaining statistical significance (Frank Greenberg, [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], CDC);
*for lacking a sufficient baseline, since screening for hypothyroidism hadn't started until 1978 (Greenberg)
*for not looking at the number of babies who ''didn't'' die (Gary Stein, CDC);
*for not noticing that the sex ratio of newborns hadn't changed—males being more susceptible to fetal injury than females (Stein; George Tokuhata, Pennsylvania Health Department, director of epidemiology),
*for "ignoring [areas for analysis] close to the reactor, where the infant mortality was very low" (Tokuhata);
*for simply being incomplete (Tamplin).
As well, he had relied on figures that had incorrectly compounded fetal deaths with infant mortality (Tokuhata).

==Cosmological theories==

Sternglass also wrote the book ''Before the Big Bang: the Origins of the Universe'', in which he offers an argument for the [[Georges Lemaître|Lemaître]] theory of the primeval atom. He offers technical data showing the plausibility of an original super massive relativistic electron-positron pair. This particle contained the entire mass of the universe and through a series of 270 divisions created everything that now exists. If true, this would help ameliorate some of the problems with the current models, namely inflation and black hole singularities.

'''FitTV''' was an [[United States|American]] [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] channel, owned by [[Discovery Communications]]. The channel focused on fitness and exercise-related programming. FitTV offered programming with such fitness celebrities as [[Cathe Friedrich]], Sharon Mann, Gilad Janklowicz, [[Marilu Henner]], [[Tamilee Webb]] and others. On February 1, 2011, it merged with [[Discovery Health Channel]] to become Discovery Fit &amp; Health, now known as [[Discovery Life]].

==History==
===Cable Health Club===
[[ABC Family Worldwide|International Family Entertainment]] debuted a continuous preview of the ''Cable Health Club'' on August 20, 1993. Beginning Aug. 31, the channel would be available in a half-hour continuous programming format to cable system operators for free. In October, the channel moved to 24-hour programming.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Rich|title=Family plans health channel|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13250007.html|accessdate=February 17, 2016|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=August 23, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jake Steinfeld]], who had starred on the network's ''Big Brother Jake'', hosted its first program&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; and was a constant presence on the channel in its early years.

The original formatting of an hour on Cable Health Club included a 20-minute aerobic conditioning workout at the top of the hour featuring Tamilee Webb; a segment on healthy living; a Body by Jake workout starting at the bottom of the hour; and "Fitness Plus", a home shopping segment for fitness items and equipment.

In 1994, Cable Health Club received new sponsors and minority partners, [[Reebok International]] (its first charter advertiser) and [[Liberty Media]]. By this time, the channel was received in one million homes and carried for two hours a day on the Family Channel.&lt;ref&gt;"Cable Health Club takes new partners." ''Adweek Western Edition'' 2 May 1994: 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Molly|title=TV Workouts -- All Exercise Shows Are Not Created Equal |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941106&amp;slug=1940016 | accessdate=February 19, 2016|work=Seattle Times|date=November 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1994, the Club was sharing a channel with [[Prime Sports Northwest]] on Seattle cable.&lt;ref name="st"/&gt;

In January 1997, [[Cox Communications]] paired the service with [[Home Team Sports]] between the hours of 5:30–11 a.m. The service took out full-page ads in ''The Virginian-Pilot'' newspaper through May 4, requesting viewers to call a toll free number to register support for the channel to be 24 hours with responses forwarded to Cox.&lt;ref name=dp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicholson|first1=David|title=After Cutback, Fit Tv Seeks Viewer Support|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1997-04-19/features/9704190125_1_c-span-journey-cable-cox-communications|accessdate=February 19, 2016|work=Daily Press|date=April 19, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Fit TV====
By April 1997, the Cable Health Club was renamed Fit TV.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; On June 11, 1997, Fox Kids Worldwide Inc. purchased International Family Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdoch Set To Buy Family Cable Concern|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/12/business/murdoch-set-to-buy-family-cable-concern.html|accessdate=19 February 2016|date=June 12, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Virginia|title=Special Report: Family Programming: New relations: Fox keeping mum about plans for The Family Channel|url=http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/19971201/20077.html?word=Haim&amp;word=Saban|accessdate=November 21, 2010|newspaper=Kidscreen|date=December 1, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===America's Health Network===
'''America's Health Network''' was in separate operation from FitTV from March 1996&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-05-23/business/9605221198_1_america-health-network-health-care-new-cable-channel Health Care], ''Orlando Sentinel'', May 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; until 1999. The channel was based in [[Orlando, Florida]] and had an $11 million production center with {{convert|16,500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} soundstage built at [[Universal Studios]] in late 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Universal+Studios+Florida+is+site+of+new+America%27s+Health+Network...-a017118357 Universal Studios Florida is Site of New America's Health Network Production Center], ''The Free Library'', August 7, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The executives at the channel were Joe Maddox (a former [[Discovery Channel]] executive) and Webster "Web" Golinkin, who had spent two and a half years&lt;ref name="hinmanlaunch"&gt;Hinman, Catherine. [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-03-24/business/9603211418_1_america-health-network-cable-network-mayo Network Set to Make House Calls], ''Orlando Sentinel'', March 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; planning, raising $75 million in capital, and building the channel. The majority owner was the [[Providence Journal]] Company. The channel also had a five-year agreement with [[Mayo Clinic]] and [[IVI Publishing]], its electronic publisher, to provide medical information and illustrative graphics. Mayo and IVI were also minority owners of the channel, and other investors included venture capital firm Medical Innovation Partners, Inc.

15 minutes an hour on AHN was devoted to shopping. The "Health Mall" carried upscale, harder-to-find items for a healthy living. AHN had a deal with [[Clearwater, Florida]]-based [[Home Shopping Network]] to provide orders and shipping infrastructure. For cable operators, carriage deals included a small percentage of advertising and shopping revenue.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

With an initial cable audience of 200,000 subscribers, America's Health Network had reached 700,000 subscribers by May 1996 and 6 million by the time of the sale of its first majority owners. However, cable carriage was a long struggle for AHN and other cable outlets that launched in this time frame (''Electronic Media'', now [[TV Week]] magazine, described the environment many cable networks launched in 1996 faced as a "jungle"). [[Time Warner Cable]], the primary cable provider in Orlando, did not carry AHN, and so many people in the channel's own hometown were unable to see its programs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

====Providence Journal acquisition====
In 1997, Providence Journal was bought by the [[A.H. Belo Corporation]]. It was Belo's first venture into cable television; according to Golinkin, Belo did not desire to gain any market share in cable.&lt;ref&gt;McConville, Jim. "1996 launches hunt subs: It's a jungle out there." ''Electronic Media'' 25 August 1997: 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; 161 of the channel's 200 employees were laid off,&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Jim, and Hagstrom, Suzy. [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-08-02/business/9708011567_1_america-health-network-cable-network-columbia Cable Network Cuts 161 Jobs], ''Orlando Sentinel'', August 2, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and they ceased producing live programs. The 39 employees that remained (including the entire management team) were a skeleton crew to keep the channel running. A sale of most of the Belo stake to Columbia/HCA Health Care Corp. for $50 million&lt;ref&gt;[[John M. Higgins (journalist)|Higgins, John M.]], "Belo scrubs America's Health." ''Broadcasting and Cable'' 11 August 1997: 71.&lt;/ref&gt; was soon proposed. Columbia wanted to put AHN in its nearly 500 hospitals and surgery centers, plus many more outpatient clinics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-05-15/business/9705141287_1_america-health-network-maddox-columbia Columbia Tunes In to Health Network], ''Orlando Sentinel'', May 15, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; However, during this time period, federal investigations over its billing practices; government raids; charges of Columbia officials with conspiracy and fraud; and changes in management at Columbia/HCA "turned [the company] upside down", according to a senior official.&lt;ref&gt;Asplund, Jon. "Ex-Columbia exec spins Web for health care cable network." ''AHA News'' 11 May 1998: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This turmoil spurred reviews of company strategies and the cancellation of some transactions, including the sale of the AHN stake. New York real estate tycoon [[Howard Milstein]] offered a bridge loan, which was accepted. Belo's stake eventually was brought back by AHN.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Jim. [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-08-06/business/9708051047_1_belo-america-health-network-network-reaches Health Network Buys Controlling Stake]; ''Orlando Sentinel'', August 6, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; An investment group of former Columbia/HCA officials, including Richard Scott and David Vandewater, took control of the network in late 1997, and live series resumed.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Lee. "AHN finds pulse in '98". ''Electronic Media'' 30 March 1998: 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, another minority investor in the channel was [[Access Health]], a referral service.

====1998–99: New milestones====

On June 16, 1998, AHN presented the first human birth carried live over the Internet, from Orlando's [[Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children]]. The birth brought AHN major national and worldwide media attention and was even the focus of an editorial cartoon two days later in ''[[USA Today]]''. By this time, it reached 8 million cable homes, comparable to the [[CNN/SI]] cable network (which would fold in 2002) and the [[Game Show Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-06-19/business/9806180728_1_america-health-network-cable-systems-cable-companies Channel Is Glowing], ''Orlando Sentinel'', June 19, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 1999, Scott and Vandewater had reduced their stake in America's Health.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchheimer, Barbara. "Scott, Vandewater tuning out network." ''Modern Healthcare'' 21 June 1999: 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shows in the AHN era====
*''Ask the Doctor'' was a program where medical professionals took viewer calls in two-hour time blocks. At launch, AHN had hired 16 doctors, seven of them from the Orlando area. Shows filmed during Universal Studios theme park hours had studio audiences.&lt;ref name="hinmanlaunch" /&gt; By the time AHN ceased producing live series in 1997, it had filmed approximately 7,000 hours of studio shows.

===Merger and acquisition===
On September 12, 1999, [[News Corporation|News Corp.'s]] Fox Cable Networks Group bought FitTV and merged it with America's Health Network, which Fox Cable already owned in a joint venture with Scott and Vandewater. The resulting network was named '''The Health Network'''. In December, Fox Cable sold 50% of the channel to [[WebMD]].

By the start of 2000, The Health Network reached 17.5 million homes. At the start of 2000, the station began new headquarters in Los Angeles, and about half of its Orlando workforce was laid off, leaving 40 people out of work. The station also ran supplementary offices in New York and Nashville. At the time, The Health Network said it was moving more of its production to New York and Los Angeles so it could feature more celebrities on its lineup.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Jim. [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-01-21/business/0001200466_1_america-health-network-cable-orlando The Health Network Lays Off 40 Employees]; ''Orlando Sentinel'', January 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 2000, it very nearly relaunched as WebMD Television, with new programs and the removal of the AHN studio program library from its schedule;&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Steve. "Health net may become WebMDTV." ''Multichannel News'' 14 February 2000: 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; that plan was put on hold, and Fox received the 50% of the channel it had sold back from WebMD, which had lost $2 billion in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Linda. "News Corp. Gets All of Health Network." ''Multichannel News'' 8 January 2001: 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2001, Discovery Communications bought The Health Network for $255 million in cash and equity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA329062.html Discovery Finds That FitTV Was Best Fit After All], ''Multichannel News'', October 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2004, Discovery reinstated the "FitTV" name, as Discovery already owned its own health channel, Discovery Health.

In March 2006, New York's [[Cablevision]] dropped the channel from its systems, resulting in the loss of some three million subscribers (down to 35 million).&lt;ref&gt;R. Thomas Umstead. [http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6321568.html Cablevision Drops Fit TV], ''Multichannel News'', April 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the channel's carriage remained significantly lower than most cable networks, only holding a reach of 50 million homes.

===Back to "Health"===
{{Main|Discovery Fit &amp; Health}}
On January 1, 2011, Discovery Communications used the Discovery Health channel space to launch [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]]. FitTV's programming was merged with the programming of its former sister station. Fitness-oriented programs moved to the mornings, and much of Discovery Health's content, including the former Discovery Health National Body Challenge, took up the remaining airtime.

On January 17, 2011, Discovery Communications announced that FitTV would be rebranded as Discovery Fit &amp; Health on February 1, reflecting the addition of former Discovery Health programs to its lineup..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/discovery-health-lives-combining-fittv/362449|title=Discovery Health Lives On, Combining With FitTV |website=Multichannel|language=en|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/01/17/48429/discovery-to-launch-new-health-fitness--ch|title=Discovery To Launch New Health, Fitness Channel|work=TVNewsCheck|date=January 17, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flint water crisis''' first started in 2014 when the drinking water source for the city of [[Flint, Michigan]] was changed from [[Lake Huron]] and the [[Detroit River]] to the cheaper [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]]. Due to insufficient [[water treatment]], [[lead]] leached from the lead water pipes into the drinking water, exposing over 100,000 residents.

After a pair of scientific studies proved lead contamination was present in the water supply, a federal state of emergency was declared in January 2016 and Flint residents were instructed to use only bottled or filtered water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. As of early 2017, the water quality had returned to acceptable levels; however, residents were instructed to continue to use bottled or filtered water until all the lead pipes have been replaced, which is expected to be completed no sooner than 2020.

== Synopsis ==
[[File:Rick Snyder in 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Governor [[Rick Snyder]] and his administration have been widely blamed for the mistakes that led to the crisis, with numerous people calling for his resignation.  After serving his second term, term limits prevented his running for re-election in 2018; his term expires on December 31, 2018.|251x251px]]{{Cleanup section|reason=This section is redundant. Use the article's intro section to concisely summarize the article, and incorporate this sections details into the article's body.|date=June 2018}}
The Flint drinking water contamination began in April 2014 when Flint changed its water source from treated [[Detroit Water and Sewerage Department]] water (sourced from [[Lake Huron]] and the [[Detroit River]]) to the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]]. Officials failed to apply [[corrosion inhibitor]]s to the water. As a result, several problems occurred that culminated with [[lead poisoning|lead contamination]], creating a serious [[public health]] danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meltdown: Why Our Systems Fail and What We Can Do About It|last=Clearfield|first=Chris|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2018|isbn=9780735222632|location=New York|pages=121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flint River water that was treated improperly caused [[lead]] from aging [[Water pipe|pipes]] to [[leaching (chemistry)|leach]] into the water supply, leading to extremely elevated levels of the [[Lead poisoning|heavy metal neurotoxin]]. In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have been exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead and they may experience a range of serious health problems.&lt;ref name=healthstats/&gt; Due to the change in water source, the percentage of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels may have risen from about 2.5% in 2013 to as much as 5% in 2015.&lt;ref name=drmonaajph /&gt; The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of [[Legionnaires' disease]] in the county that has killed 10 people and affected another 77.&lt;ref name=legionnaires/&gt;

Several lawsuits have been filed against government officials on the issue, and several investigations have been opened. On January 5, 2016, the city was declared to be in a state of emergency by the Governor of Michigan, [[Rick Snyder]], before President [[Barack Obama]] declared it to be in a federal state of emergency, authorizing additional help from the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] less than two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/16/president-obama-signs-michigan-emergency-declaration|title=President Obama Signs Michigan Emergency Declaration|type=Official White House press release|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four government officials—one from the city of Flint, two from the [[Michigan Department of Environmental Quality]] (MDEQ), and one from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]—resigned over the mishandling of the crisis, and one additional MDEQ staff member was fired. There have also been fifteen criminal cases filed against local and state officials in regards to the crisis.&lt;ref name=thirdcriminal/&gt;

Snyder issued an apology to the citizens and promised to fix the problem, and then sent $28 million to Flint for supplies, medical care, and infrastructure upgrades,&lt;ref name=28mbillsigned/&gt; and later budgeted an additional $30 million to Flint that will give water bill credits of 65% for residents and 20% for businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc12.com/news/headlines/Gov-Snyder-signs-30-million-budget-bill-370275451.html|title=Gov.

On January 24, 2017 the MDEQ told Flint Mayor Karen Weaver that the lead content of Flint water had fallen below the federal limit. The 90th percentile of lead concentrations in Flint was 12 parts per billion from July 2016 through December 2016—below the "action level" of 15 ppb. It was 20 ppb in the prior six-month period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2017/01/flint_water_has_fallen_below_f.html Flint water has fallen below federal lead limit] The Associated Press via MLive.com, January 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day, Flint Spokeswoman Kristin Moore said that anywhere from 18,000 to 28,000 homes in the city still needed service lines replaced, and that the city was planning to complete 6,000 homes per year through 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/01/officials_say_it_may_take_at_l.html Officials say it may take 3 more years to replace Flint's water pipes] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, January 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2017, it was reported Flint water sampled by the state in February registered below the federal threshold for lead with 90 percent of samples at or below eight parts per billion, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality says. The MDEQ said February's water tests mark the seventh straight month in which city water was below the 15 ppb level enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. February's testing also showed 95.8 percent of samples taken at homes at risk of high lead levels were at or below 15 ppb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/03/state_reports_february_water_t.html State says February testing showed Flint water met EPA lead rule] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, March 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Some water service lines in Flint were installed between 1901 and 1920.&lt;ref name=gcsd/&gt; As with many other municipalities at the time, all of the service lines from the cast iron water mains to end users' homes were constructed of lead, because it was relatively inexpensive and easy to work. Lead pipes can [[Leaching (chemistry)|leach]] lead into the water, especially if certain contaminants are present. However, the water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, where Flint had obtained its water since 1967, had been [[water treatment|treated]] well enough that the leaching from the lead pipes was at levels considered acceptable by state and federal environmental protection agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snyder-emails.pdf|title=The City of Flint Police Department Crime Reduction Strategy|last1=Snyder|first1=Richard D.|last2=Calley|first2=Brian|author-link1=Rick Snyder|author-link2=Brian Calley|date=January 20, 2016|publisher=Flint Water Study|access-date=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 43,000 service lines in the city; these include 3,500 lead lines, 9,000 known galvanized lines, and 9,000 unknown service lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/05/city_ready_to_accept_proposals.html|title=City officials set to accept proposals to replace lead lines in Flint|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead exposure across the U.S. has fallen dramatically since the 1980s, but no blood-lead level is considered completely safe. Children under age five, and especially infants and unborn children, bear the greatest risk of deleterious and irreversible health outcomes.&lt;ref name=drmonaajph /&gt; From 2012 to 2016, the CDC set a "reference level" of 5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL), in order to target for case management the 2.5% of young American children with the highest blood-lead levels. At 45&amp;nbsp;µg/dL, [[chelation therapy]] is considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Update on Blood Lead Levels in Children|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many ways lead can enter a modern American's bloodstream is through lead plumbing. Acidic water makes it easier for the lead found in pipes, leaded solder, and brass faucets to dissolve and to enter a home's drinking water. Therefore, public water treatment systems are legally required to use control measures to make water less acidic. Plumbing that contains lead is often found in buildings constructed in the 1980s and earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp13.pdf|date=August 2007|agency=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|title=ATSDR Toxicological Profile for Lead|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switching to a new water source===
{{main|Karegnondi Water Authority}}
In 2011, [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] initiated the switch to the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA); the KWA would supply water to both Genesee County and Flint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fonger|first=Ron|title=DTE Energy tells new regional authority it may want 3 million gallons of Lake Huron water daily |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/05/dte_energy_tells_regional_wate.html|newspaper=Flint Journal|accessdate=December 6, 2011|date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 25, 2013, the purchase of 16 million gallons per day from the KWA was approved by the Flint City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Dominic|date=March 25, 2013|title=Flint council supports buying water from Lake Huron through KWA|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/03/flint_city_council_again_delay.html|newspaper=Flint Journal|access-date=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KWA informed the council that they could dig to Lake Huron (the new water supply) in 30 months using a bored tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/11/karegnondi_water_authorities_p.html Karegnondi Water Authority prepares to drill 1.5 miles into Lake Huron for new water pipeline to Flint] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, November 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Kurtz, Flint's [[Financial emergency in Michigan|emergency manager]], along with Mayor Dayne Walling and Flint City Council, approved the action and awaited the State Treasurer's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fonger|first=Ron|date=March 29, 2013|title=Flint emergency manager endorses water pipeline, final decision rests with state of Michigan|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/03/flint_emergency_manager_endors.html|newspaper=Flint Journal|access-date=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this decision, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) negotiated with Flint officials by offering to restructure water payments. Flint refused, insisting that KWA was the best water supplier. DWSD argued that Flint could not spend more money on a new water system and that Lake Huron's system was more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/pages/interactives/flint-water-crisis-timeline/ How Flint's water crisis unfolded] ''Detroit Free Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department demanded that the state deny Flint's request, as it would start a [[water war]], which would essentially hurt DWSD.

==Early water contamination==
After the permanent switch to the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]], city residents began complaining about the color, taste, and odor of their water. In August and September 2014, city officials detected levels of coliform bacteria, so residents were advised to boil their water. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality determined that cold weather, aging pipes, and a population decline were the cause of this bacteria. According to Stephen Busch, a DEQ district supervisor, the city took appropriate measures to limit a recurrence. [[General Motors]] (GM) made the first complaint about the corrosivity of the water. GM stopped using Flint water in October 2014, after reporting that the water was corroding car parts.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/21/us/flint-lead-water-timeline.html|title=Events That Led to Flint's Water Crisis|date=January 21, 2016|work=New York Times|last2=Rutter|first2=Jean|last3=Park|first3=Haeyoun|last1=Lin|first1=Jeremy C.F.|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors requested to switch back to the Detroit Water source, which was later approved by city officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulido|first=Laura|date=July 2, 2016|title=Flint, Environmental Racism, and Racial Capitalism|journal=Capitalism Nature Socialism|volume=27|issue=3|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/10455752.2016.1213013|issn=1045-5752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to August 2014, additional chlorine had been added to eliminate bacteria from the Flint River. This is likely the cause of a spike in [[trihalomethane|THM]]s, an unsafe chlorine byproduct, in one of eight water locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/01/flint_water_has_high_disinfect.html|title=City warns of potential health risks after Flint water tests revealed too much disinfection byproduct|date=January 2, 2015|work=Flint Journal|publisher=Michigan Live Media Group|last1=Fonger|first1=Ron|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term exposure to this chemical has been linked to cancer and other diseases. Following this test, the DEQ placed Flint on violation notice, but did not reveal the information to residents until January 2015.

The employees of the [[Flint Public Library (Flint, Michigan)|Flint Public Library]] declared the water undrinkable after noticing that it was discolored, despite the city's claim that the water was safe. Since 2014, the library has provided safe water for the public alongside the state's most prominent bottled water provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrlibs.blogspot.com/2016/01/letter-from-flint-public-library-on.html|title=Letter from Flint Public Library about Lead in Water Crisis to PUBLIB|last=Schwarts|first=K.|year=2016|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

January and February 2015 tests showed that the city water met all health and safety standards.&lt;ref name="fjf10"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/03/flint_emergency_manager_calls.html|title=Emergency manager calls City Council's Flint River vote 'incomprehensible'|date=March 25, 2015|work=Flint Journal|publisher=Michigan Live Media Group|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Detroit water system offered to reconnect Flint, waiving a $4 million connection fee, but was declined by emergency manager Jerry Ambrose. DEQ officials indicated that there is no "imminent threat to public health," as the nature of the issue was "communicated poorly."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

=== Return to Detroit water ===
In March 2015, Flint voted to switch back to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. This vote was motivated by residential complaints and recommendations from [[Veolia]] North America to prevent the city from further violating the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]. Jerry Ambrose, Flint's emergency manager and financial supervisor, disagreed with the reintroduction of the Detroit water source. Ambrose argued, "Flint water today is safe by all Environmental Protection Agency and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality standards, and the city is working daily to improve its quality."&lt;ref name=fjf10/&gt;

On March 2, 2016, Michigan declared that returning to the Detroit water system must be approved by the State. When approved, the city was granted an emergency loan of $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/03/02/dems-say-state-blocked-flint-return-detroit-water/81199076/|title=Dems say state blocked Flint return to Detroit water|website=The Detroit Free Press|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=March 2, 2016|first=Paul|last=Egan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, local organizations observed that high concentrations of chloride caused the water to be orange and that the water contained high levels of lead. The lead levels were caused by the omission of orthophosphate; this caused excessive corrosion of the iron pipes. Consequently, the three organizations,&amp;nbsp;"... delivered more than 26,000 online petition signatures to Mayor [[Dayne Walling]], demanding the city end its use of the Flint River and reconnect to the Detroit water system."&lt;ref name="SeptReport"/&gt; Flint's water supply was switched back to Detroit water systems in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/08/us/michigan-flint-water/index.html|title=Flint returning to Detroit water amid lead concerns|date=October 8, 2015|publisher=CNN|last2=Shortell|first2=David|accessdate=December 30, 2015|first1=Jason|last1=Hanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/news/news/flint-detroit-michigan-genesee-county-lead-water-contamination#/!|title=Contaminants Found in Flint, Michigan, Drinking Water; City to Reconnect to Detroit Water Supply|last=Carr|first=Ada|date=October 9, 2015|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Flint started adding additional [[orthophosphate]] to the water to rebuild the pipe lining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/12/flint_will_pay_for_independent.html|title=Flint will pay for independent water tests, added phosphate treatment|last=Fonger|first=Ron|date=December 10, 2015|website=Michigan Live|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 27, 2016, Flint officials announced that the city will continue to use Detroit water until a new stretch of pipeline is constructed and the Flint River is tested and treated by the KWA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/09/27/flint-detroit-water-crisis-lead/91176828/ Flint to stay on Detroit water for another year] ''Detroit Free Press'', September 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2017, the Genesee County Water and Waste Services Advisory Board voted to construct a new pipeline; it would be a 7-mile, 42-inch connector to the KWA pipeline. The pipeline would allow the treatment of raw [[Lake Huron]] water, so the city of Flint can continue to buy pre-treated water from the [[Great Lakes Water Authority]]. The $12 million project will allow Flint to remain a customer of the GLWA until at least 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/03/genesee_county_will_add_to_pip.html County will build new connector, allowing Flint to stay on Detroit water] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, March 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hurley Medical Center study I (2015) ====

[[File:Dr. Hanna Attisha smiling in lab coat.jpg|thumb|upright|Dr. [[Mona Hanna-Attisha]] led the first Hurley Medical Center lead poisoning study.]]
On September 24, 2015, [[Hurley Medical Center]] in Flint released a study, led by Dr. [[Mona Hanna-Attisha]], the program director for pediatric residency at Hurley Children's Hospital, confirming that the proportion of infants and children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had nearly doubled since the city switched from the Detroit water system to using the Flint River as its water source.&lt;ref name="ErbHanna-Attisha"/&gt;&lt;ref name=waterwashpost/&gt; Using hospital records, Hanna-Attisha found that a steep rise in blood-lead levels corresponded to the city's switch in water sources.&lt;ref name="ErbHanna-Attisha"/&gt; The study was initially dismissed by [[Michigan Department of Environmental Quality]] (DEQ) spokesman Brad Wurfel, who repeated a familiar refrain: "Repeated testing indicated the water tested within acceptable levels."&lt;ref name="ErbHanna-Attisha"/&gt; Later, Wurfel apologized to Hanna-Attisha.&lt;ref name="ErbHanna-Attisha"/&gt; The team's study appears in the February 2016 issue of ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]''.&lt;ref name=drmonaajph&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Children Associated With the Flint Drinking Water Crisis: A Spatial Analysis of Risk and Public Health Response |journal = American Journal of Public Health|date = December 21, 2015|issn = 0090-0036|pages = 283–290|volume = 106|issue = 2|doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2015.303003|first = Mona|last = Hanna-Attisha|first2 = Jenny|last2 = LaChance|first3 = Richard Casey|last3 = Sadler|first4 = Allison|last4 = Champney Schnepp|pmid=26691115|pmc=4985856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanna-Attisha's research found that the average proportion of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels (above five [[microgram]]s per deciliter, or 5 × 10{{Sup|–3}} grams per 100 milliliters of blood) rose from 2.4% (2013, before the change in water source) to 4.9% (2015, after the change in water source), and in some hotspot areas rose from 4% to 10.6%. Michigan Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program data agree an increase occurred, suggesting an increase from 2.2% of children (May 2013 – April 2014) to 3.0% (May 2014 – April 2015). Hanna-Attisha's data were taken from hospital laboratory records for children less than five years old. Hanna-Attisha's sample numbers were large, both for the pre-switch and post-switch time periods and for Flint children (1,473) and for children not exposed to Flint water (2,202). Elevated lead levels in children's blood was shown to be correlated with elevated lead levels in Flint water. Because lead screening is not completed for all children, such data may be skewed toward higher-risk children and thus overestimate lead exposure, especially in non–high-risk areas.&lt;ref name=drmonaajph/&gt;

Hanna-Attisha and Flint resident LeeAnne Walters were awarded PEN America's Freedom of Expression Courage Award on May 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pen.org/2016-PEN-gala|title=2016 PEN Literary Gala &amp; Free Expression Awards|website=PEN America|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a much expanded study of blood lead levels measured at Hurley Medical Center. The original 2015 study of Hurley records involved a total of 1,473 children "younger than 5 years" whose address could be mapped to a site inside Flint in two pre/post 8.5 month periods. The 2018 study, led by Hernán F. Gómez, involved 15,817 children "aged ≤5 years" over the 11 year period 2006–2016. Data for 2012–2016 were available from center's Epic EMR system; records for earlier years were scrounged from legacy systems.  The results show an increase in the fraction of children with elevated lead blood levels immediately pre/post the water switch (from 2.2% to 3.7%); invoking a [[Bonferroni correction]], Gómez argues the change is not statistically significant.  These results are consistent with a CDC report&lt;ref name=cdc160624&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0624-water-lead.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which found that the fraction of "all children under age 6" with elevated lead blood level "was nearly 50 percent higher after the switch to Flint River water." The striking result of Gómez et al. however is that during the 11 year period, the "crisis years" are actually the third and fourth lowest years for lead blood levels.  That is, the upward blip during the water switch sits on a rapid declining curve (presumably due to the many lead mitigation projects that have been initiated nationally) so that blood lead levels during the crisis are actually lower than those two years earlier.

==== Virginia Tech water study ====
[[File:Marc Edwards 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Dr. [[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]] led the&lt;br&gt; Virginia Tech Flint water study.]] 
In September 2015 a team from [[Virginia Tech]] arrived in Flint. Led by professor Dr. [[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]], an expert on municipal water quality, the team came to perform lead level testing on the Flint water supply, working under a [[National Science Foundation]] grant. Edwards had been contacted by Flint resident, Lee-Anne Walters, whose family suffered from extreme health problems, almost immediately following the switch to the Flint River water. Walters had attempted to act locally, but she was repeatedly ignored by city, state, and EPA officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/23/virginia-tech-expert-helped-expose-flint-water-crisis/79251004/|title=Virginia Tech expert helped expose Flint water crisis|last=Kozlowski|first=Kim|date=January 24, 2016|website=Detroit News|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that Flint water was "very corrosive" and "causing lead contamination in homes". It concluded in its report that "Flint River water leaches more lead from plumbing than does Detroit water. This is creating a public health threat in some Flint homes that have lead pipe or lead solder."&lt;ref name="SeptReport"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering's Marc Edwards heads to Flint as part of study into unprecedented corrosion problem|url=http://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2015/09/091415-engineering-edwardsflint.html|publisher=Virginia Tech|date=September 14, 2015|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lazarus"&gt;{{cite web|first=Oliver|last=Lazarus|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-01-07/flint-michigan-crisis-over-lead-levels-tap-water|title=In Flint, Michigan, a crisis over lead levels in tap water|publisher=[[Public Radio International]]|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards was shocked by the extent of the contamination, but even more so by the inaction of the proper authorities after being made well aware of the contamination. Edwards and his team found that at least a quarter of Flint households had levels of lead above the federal level of 15 [[parts per billion]] (ppb) and that in some homes, lead levels were at 13,200 ppb. Edwards said, "It was the injustice of it all and that the very agencies that are paid to protect these residents from lead in water, knew or should've known after June at the very very latest of this year, that federal law was not being followed in Flint, and that these children and residents were not being protected. And the extent to which they went to [[Coverup|cover this up]] exposes a new level of arrogance and uncaring that I have never encountered."&lt;ref name="Lazarus" /&gt;

Edwards' team created a website, called "''Flint Water Study''", with the main purpose of informing, and creating support for Flint residents during the crisis. The site also summarized study results and became a comprehensive public database for all information related to the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flintwaterstudy.org/about-page/about-us/|title=The Virginia Tech Research Team|last=|first=|date=2017|website=www.flintwaterstudy.org|access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2016, the Virginia Tech research team led by Edwards announced that it had completed its work. Edwards said, "We now feel that Flint's kids are finally on their way to being protected and decisive actions are under way to ameliorate the harm that was done." Edwards credited the Michigan [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] and the group Water You Fighting For with doing the "critical work of collecting and coordinating" many water samples analyzed by the Virginia Tech team. Although the labor of the team (composed of scientists, investigators, [[graduate student]]s, and undergraduates) was free, the investigation still spent more than $180,000 for such expenses as water testing and payment of Michigan Freedom of Information Act costs. A [[GoFundMe]] campaign has raised over $116,000 of the $150,000 needed for the team to recover its costs.&lt;ref name="CarmodyJan11"&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Carmody|url=http://michiganradio.org/post/virginia-tech-ending-flint-water-investigation#stream/0|title=Virginia Tech ending Flint water investigation|publisher=Michigan Radio|date=January 11, 2016|accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VATechWrapup"&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Egan|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/01/12/virginia-tech-wrapping-up-its-work-flint-water/78692066/|title=Virginia Tech wrapping up its work on Flint water|website=The Detroit Free Press|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, the city of Flint retained Dr. Edwards to monitor the city's water testing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/virginia_tech_researcher_hired.html|title=Virginia Tech researcher hired by Flint to test water|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2016|first=Gary|last=Ridley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2016, the Virginia Tech team was given $80,000 from an EPA grant to re-test the lead levels in 271 Flint homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/03/virginia_tech_returns_to_flint.html|title=Virginia Tech gets EPA grant to re-test Flint water for lead|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016|first=Ron|last=Fonger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 2016, Kelsey Pieper, a member of Dr. Edwards' research team, said 45 percent of residents that collected samples in July for the lead testing program had no detectable level of particulate lead in their water supply. She added the study yielded a lead reading of 13.9 ppb, just below the federal action level of 15 ppb. However, Pieper acknowledged the sampling, which was conducted by volunteer residents, does not fulfill the testing requirements of the federal Lead and Copper Rule. State testing of the most-recent six month monitoring period, which began January 1 and complied with Lead and Copper Rule regulations, showed a 90th percentile lead reading of 20 ppb, which exceeds the federal action level. Roughly 93 percent of samples from the third round of expanded state sentinel site testing showed results below the lead action level. Dr. Edwards called the results the "beginning of the end" of the public health disaster associated with the water crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/08/flint_in_beginning_of_the_end.html|title='Beginning of the end' for Flint water crisis health disaster, Edwards says|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=August 11, 2016|accessdate=August 11, 2016|first=Gary|last=Ridley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2016, Dr. Edwards said lead wasn't detected in 57 percent of 154 Flint homes tested in November 2016 – up from 44 percent in July 2016. He also advised  people to continue using filters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbc25news.com/news/local/virginia-tech-professor-marc-edwards-to-announce-latest-water-testing-results-in-flint Researchers: Flint water improving, but stick with filters] WEYI-TV, December 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible link to Legionnaires' disease spike==
{{See also|Legionnaires' disease}}
On January 13, 2016, Snyder said that 87 cases of [[Legionnaires' disease]], a [[waterborne diseases|waterborne disease]], were reported in Genesee County from June 2014&amp;nbsp;– November 2015, resulting in 12 deaths (two more people later died from the disease). Although the [[Michigan Department of Health and Human Services]] (MDHHS) said that there is no evidence of a clear link between the spike in cases and the water system change,&lt;ref name=legionnaires&gt;{{cite web|first=Khalil|last=Al Hajal|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2016/01/legionaires_disease_spike_disc.html|title=87 cases, 10 fatal, of ''Legionella'' bacteria found in Flint area; connection to water crisis unclear|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards stated the contaminated Flint water could be linked to the spike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc12.com/home/headlines/Gov-snyder-press-conference-in-detroit-365186461.html|title=VA Tech Professor says Flint River water and Legionnaires Disease could be linked|publisher=WJRT-TV|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second report released January 21, state researchers had still not pin-pointed the source of the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/sourcce_of_flint_legionnaires.html|title=Source of deadly Flint Legionnaires' outbreak still unknown, new report says|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, an official at [[McLaren Regional Medical Center]] in Flint confirmed that there was a spike in ''Legionella'' cases in Flint and elsewhere in Genesee County, but noted that there was "no definitive data to support that McLaren Flint is the source of exposure for any patient testing positive for the Legionella antigen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/officials_confirm_legionella_f.html|title=Officials confirm Legionella bacteria found in Flint's McLaren Hospital's water supply in 2014|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of one of the people who died of Legionnaires has filed a $100 million lawsuit against McLaren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/02/fieger_seeking_100_million_in.html|title=Attorney Geoffrey Fieger seeks $100 million in Flint Legionnaires' lawsuit|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=February 2, 2016|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Flint Journal'' obtained documents via the Michigan Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on the Legionnaires' outbreak and published an article on them on January 16, 2016. The documents indicated that on October 17, 2014, employees of the Genesee County Health Department and the Flint water treatment plant met to discuss the county's "concerns regarding the increase in Legionella cases and possible association with the municipal water system." By early October 2014, the Michigan DEQ were aware of a possible link between the water in Flint and the Legionnaires' outbreak, but the public was never informed, and the agency gave assurances about water safety in public statements and at public forums. An internal January 27, 2015 email from a supervisor at the health department said that the Flint water treatment plant had not responded in months to "multiple written and verbal requests" for information. In January 2015, following the complete breakdown in communication between the city and the county on the Legionnaires' investigation, the county filed a FOIA request with the city, seeking "specific water testing locations and laboratory results ... for [[coliform]], [[E-coli]], [[heterotroph]]ic bacteria and [[trihalomethane]]s" and other information. In April 2015, the county health department contacted the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and in April 2015 a CDC employee wrote in an email that the Legionnaires' outbreak was "very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation." However, MDHHS told the county health department at the time that federal assistance was not necessary.&lt;ref name="FongerLegionnaireEarlyWarning"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ron|last=Fonger|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/documents_show_agencies_knew_o.html|title=Public never told, but investigators suspected Flint River tie to Legionnaires' in 2014|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emails obtained by Progress Michigan in February 2016 indicate Snyder's office knew about the outbreak since March 2015, despite Snyder's claim he was only informed in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2016/02/officials_were_warned_of_flint.html|title=Officials were warned of Flint water, Legionnaires' link months before public|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Michigan Live|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2016, Governor Snyder ordered an investigation of the MDHHS regarding the outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/03/governor_wants_investigation_i.html|title=Governor wants investigation into MDHHS in handling of Legionnaires' outbreak|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2017, it was reported the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] discovered the first genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County. "The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread," said Dr. Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and a national expert on the disease. "The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system." Virginia Tech researcher Amy Pruden published a study that found Legionella levels up to 1,000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient whose clinical isolates—or bacteria—matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there "suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/cdc_finds_first_genetic_link_b.html CDC finds first genetic link between Legionnaires' outbreak, Flint water] ''The flint Journal'' via MLive.com, February 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://michiganradio.org/post/new-tests-raise-questions-about-source-legionnaires-disease-outbreak New tests raise questions about the source of Legionnaires Disease outbreak], ''Michigan Radio'', February 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2017, affidavits filed by experts in court supported the conclusion that Flint water was connected to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak. Dr. Janet Stout wrote in an affidavit: "(It) is my opinion to a reasonable degree of probability that the source water change and the subsequent management of the municipal water system caused conditions to develop within the municipal water distribution system that promoted Legionella growth and dispersion, amplification, and the significant increases in cases of Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County in 2014 and 2015." J. David Krause, director of Forensic Analytical Consulting Services, and Dr. Hung K. Cheung, a doctor specializing in environmental and occupational medicine agreed with her claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/03/experts_affidavits_point_to_fl.html Experts' affidavits point to Flint water as source of Legionnaires' outbreak] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, May 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2018, a study published in the journals ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' and ''[[mBio]]'' concluded that the 2014-2015 outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Flint was due to low levels of chlorine which, at higher levels, would have made it difficult for bacteria to replicate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because chlorine reacts with [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]]s like lead and iron, high levels of both in Flint's water may have been responsible for the decreased amount of chlorine available.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Inquiries, investigations, resignations, and release of documents==
{{cleanup|reason=Choppy list of events needs to be reorganized into subsections on specific topics.|date=May 2018}}
One focus of inquiry is when Snyder became aware of the issue, and how much he knew about it.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web|first=David A.|last=Graham|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/what-did-the-governor-know-about-flints-water-and-when-did-he-know-it/423342/|title=What Did the Governor Know About Flint's Water, and When Did He Know It?|website=The Atlantic|date=January 9, 2016|accessdate=January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2015 email, Dennis Muchmore (then Snyder's [[chief of staff]]) wrote to a [[Michigan Department of Health and Human Services]] (MDHHS) official, "I'm frustrated by the water issue in Flint. I really don't think people are getting the benefit of the doubt. These folks are scared and worried about the health impacts and they are basically getting blown off by us (as a state we're just not sympathizing with their plight)."&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wisely"&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Wisely|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/01/07/flint-water-emails/78412292/|title=Were Flint water fears 'blown off' by state?|website=The Detroit Free Press|date=January 7, 2016|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate email sent on July 22, 2015, MDHHS local health services director Mark Miller wrote to colleagues that it "Sounds like the issue is old lead service lines." These emails were obtained under the Michigan Freedom of Information Act by Virginia Tech researchers studying the crisis, and were released to the public in the first week of January 2016.&lt;ref name="Wisely"/&gt;

In October 2015, it was reported that the city government's data on lead water lines in the city was stored on 45,000 [[index card]]s (some dating back a century) located in [[filing cabinet]]s in Flint's public utility building.&lt;ref name="FongerIndex"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fonger|first1=Ron|title=Flint data on lead water lines stored on 45,000 index cards|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/10/flint_official_says_data_on_lo.html|accessdate=February 4, 2016|work=Flint Journal|publisher=MLive|date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lindsey|last=Smith|url=http://michiganradio.org/post/after-ignoring-and-trying-discredit-people-flint-state-was-forced-face-problem#stream/0|title=After ignoring and trying to discredit people in Flint, the state was forced to face the problem|publisher=Michigan Radio|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Public Works said that it was trying to transition the data into an electronic spreadsheet program, but as of October 1, 2015, only about 25% of the index card information had been [[Digitization|digitized]].&lt;ref name="FongerIndex"/&gt;

On October 21, 2015, Snyder announced the creation of a five-member Flint Water Advisory Task Force, consisting of Ken Sikkema of Public Sector Consultants and Chris Kolb of the Michigan Environmental Council (co-chairs) and Dr. Matthew Davis of the [[University of Michigan Health System]], Eric Rothstein of the Galardi Rothstein Group and Dr. Lawrence Reynolds of [[C.S. Mott Children's Hospital|Mott Children's Health Center]] in Flint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57577_57657-367761--,00.html|title=Gov.

The task force also found that "Throughout 2015, as the public raised concerns and as independent studies and testing were conducted and brought to the attention of MDEQ, the agency's response was often one of aggressive dismissal, belittlement, and attempts to discredit these efforts and the individuals involved. We find both the tone and substance of many MDEQ public statements to be completely unacceptable." The task force also found that the Michigan DEQ has failed to follow the federal [[Lead and Copper Rule]] (LCR). That rule requires "optimized corrosion control treatment," but MDEQ staff instructed City of Flint water treatment staff that corrosion control treatment (CCT) would not be necessary for a year. The task force found that "the decision not to require CCT, made at the direction of the MDEQ, led directly to the contamination of the Flint water system."&lt;ref name="JohnsonTaskForce"/&gt;

The task force's findings prompted the resignation of MDEQ director Dan Wyant and communications director Brad Wurfel.&lt;ref name="WyantResigns"&gt;{{cite web|first=Emily|last=Lawler|url=http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/12/deq_director_dan_wyant_resigns.html|title=Director Dan Wyant resigns after task force blasts MDEQ over Flint water crisis|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=December 29, 2015|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Emily|last=Lawler|url=http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2015/12/deq_spokesman_also_resigns_ove.html|title=DEQ spokesman also resigns over Flint water crisis, says city 'didn't feel like we cared'|publisher=Michigan Live|date=December 30, 2015|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Department of Public Works director Howard Croft also resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ron|last=Fonger|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/11/howard_croft_flint_official_re.html|title=Howard Croft, Flint official responsible for water oversight, resigns|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flint Water Advisory Task Force's final report, released March 21, 2016, found the MDEQ, MDHHS, Governor's office, and the state-appointed emergency managers "fundamentally accountable" for the crisis, saying the people of Flint were "needlessly and tragically" exposed to toxic levels of lead and other hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc12.com/home/headlines/Gov-Snyders-Flint-water-task-force-report-could-be-released-as-soon-as-Wednesday-373187741.html|title=Inquiry: State "fundamentally accountable" for Flint crisis|publisher=WJRT-TV|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.graytvinc.com/documents/FINAL+FWATF+REPORT+21March20161.pdf|title=Flint Water Advisory Task Force Final Report|website=Flint Water Advisory Task Force|date=March 21, 2016|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flintwaterstudy.org/2016/03/flint-water-advisory-task-force-final-report/|title=Flint Water Advisory Task Force (Final Report)|website=Flint Water Study Updates|date=March 23, 2016|accessdate=March 23, 2016|first=Siddhartha|last=Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2016, the [[U.S. Attorney's Office]] for the Eastern District of Michigan said that it was investigating.&lt;ref name="FedInvestigation"/&gt; A month later, they said they were working with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the EPA's Office of Inspector General, the EPA's Criminal Investigation Division, and the [[United States Postal Inspection Service|Postal Inspection Service]] on the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/02/fbi_others_involved_in_federal.html|title=FBI, others involved in federal Flint water investigation|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=February 2, 2015|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) "battled Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality behind the scenes for at least six months over whether Flint needed to use chemical treatments to keep lead lines and plumbing connections from leaching into drinking water" and "did not publicize its concern that Flint residents' health was jeopardized by the state's insistence that such controls were not required by law".&lt;ref name="LynchEPA"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Lynch|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/12/epa-stayed-silent-flints-tainted-water/78719620/|title=EPA stayed silent on Flint's tainted water|website=The Detroit News|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, EPA water expert Miguel A.

Until now|publisher=Michigan Radio|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Marc Edwards, who investigated the lead contamination, wrote that Del Toral had made a "heroic effort" that was stymied by the EPA and MDEQ spending months "wrangling over jurisdiction, technicalities and legalities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marc|last=Edwards|url=http://flintwaterstudy.org/2016/01/del-torals-heroic-effort-was-ultimately-vetted-in-the-blood-lead-of-flints-children/|title=Del Toral's Heroic Effort Was Ultimately Vetted in the Blood Lead of Flint's Children|website=Flint Water Study Updates|date=January 13, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Detroit News]]'' published on January 12, 2016, Hedman said that "the recommendation to DEQ (regarding the need for corrosion controls) occurred at higher and higher levels during this time period. And the answer kept coming back from DEQ that 'no, we are not going to make a decision until after we see more testing results.'" Hedman said the EPA did not go public with its concerns earlier because (1) state and local governments have primary responsibility for drinking water quality and safety; (2) there was insufficient evidence at that point of the extent of the danger; and (3) the EPA's legal authority to compel the state to take action was unclear, and the EPA discussed the issue with its legal counsel, who only rendered an opinion in November. Hedman said the EPA discussed the issue with its legal counsel and urged the state to have MDHHS warn residents about the danger.&lt;ref name="LynchEPA"/&gt; On January 21, Hedman's resignation (effective February 1) was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Melissa Nann|last1=Burke|first2=Jim|last2=Lynch|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/21/top-epa-official-midwest-resigning-amid-flint-crisis/79140290/|title=Top EPA official in Midwest resigning amid Flint crisis|website=The Detroit News|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessments of the EPA's action varied. Edwards said that the assessment in Del Toral's original June memo was "100 percent accurate" and criticized the EPA for failing to take more immediate action. State Senate Minority Leader [[Jim Ananich]], Democrat of Flint, said, "There's been a failure at all levels to accurately assess the scale of the public health crisis in Flint, and that problem is ongoing. However, the EPA's Miguel Del Toral did excellent work in trying to expose this disaster. Anyone who read his memo and failed to act should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law."&lt;ref name="LynchEPA"/&gt; Del Toral later told ''The Flint Journal'', "I was stunned when I found out they did not have corrosion control in place. In my head, I didn't believe that. I thought: That can't be true ... that's so basic." He also confirmed that unfiltered Flint water is still unsafe to drink, and doesn't know when that will change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/epa_official_says_he_was.html|title=EPA official 'stunned' by failure to treat Flint water for lead leaching|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 21, 2015|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New York Times'' summarized, "the documents provide a glimpse of state leaders who were at times dismissive of the concerns of residents, seemed eager to place responsibility with local government and, even as the scientific testing was hinting at a larger problem, were reluctant to acknowledge it."&lt;ref name=BosmanDaveySmith/&gt; Later that month in a class action lawsuit related to the crisis, Snyder and the MDEQ were served subpoenas for the release of additional emails dating back to the beginning of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gary|last=Ridley|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/subpoenas_served_for_gov_snyde.html|title=Subpoenas served for Gov.

On January 22, 2016, two MDEQ employees (Liane Shekter Smith, former chief of the department's Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance; and Steve Busch, former district supervisor in the division) were suspended, pending an investigation, as a result of questions regarding actions related to water testing in Flint. In response, Snyder said, "Michiganders need to be able to depend on state government to do what's best for them and in the case of the DEQ that means ensuring their drinking water is safe.

On January 15, Snyder asked President Obama to grant a [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|federal emergency/major disaster designation]] for Genesee County, seeking federal financial aid for emergency assistance and infrastructure repair in order to "protect the health, safety and welfare of Flint residents."&lt;ref name="DolanStatus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gary|last=Ridley|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/snyder_asks_obama_to_declare_f.html|title=Snyder asks Obama to declare federal emergency for Flint water|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 14, 2016|accessdate=January 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Chad|last1=Livengood|first2=Jonathan|last2=Oosting|first3=Melissa Nann|last3=Burke|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/14/snyder-asks-obama-declare-federal-emergency-flint/78831312/|title=White House to decide soon on Flint emergency request|website=The Detroit News|date=January 15, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Obama signed an emergency declaration giving Flint up to $5 million in federal aid to handle the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ashley|last=Southall|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/us/obama-flint-michigan-water-fema-emergency-disaster.html|title=State of Emergency Declared Over Man-Made Water Disaster in Michigan City|website=The New York Times|date=January 17, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA released a statement that said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The President's action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|Stafford Act]], to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in Genesee County. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. This emergency assistance is to provide water, water filters, water filter cartridges, water test kits, and other necessary related items for a period of no more than 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Roberto|last=Acost|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/president_obama_signs_emergenc.html|title=President Obama signs emergency declaration over Flint's water crisis|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Snyder's request for a "Major Disaster Declaration" status was turned down, FEMA Administrator [[W. Craig Fugate]] wrote a letter to Snyder saying that the water contamination "does not meet the legal definition of a 'major disaster'" under federal law because "[t]he incident was not the result of a [[Natural disaster|natural catastrophe]], nor was it created by a fire, flood or explosion."&lt;ref name="MajorDisaster"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Chad|last1=Livengood|first2=Jonathan|last2=Oosting|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/17/snyder-appeal-obama-flint-disaster-declaration/78944416/|title=Snyder to appeal Obama's denial of Flint disaster zone|website=The Detroit News|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Snyder asked Obama for emergency funding under FEMA's Individuals and Households Program, which provides housing assistance and replacement of personal property.

On March 3, 2016, Governor Snyder filed a second appeal for federal help to replace lead pipes and provide medical support and supplies for affected residents which said the estimated economic impact of the Flint water crisis is beginning to exceed $140 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/03/snyder_appeals_feds_for_fundin.html|title=Snyder launches 2nd appeal for federal money to replace Flint water pipes|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=March 3, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA rejected his request again on March 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc12.com/home/headlines/FEMA-denies-request-for-federal-aid-for-Flint-second-time-372228992.html|title=FEMA denies request for federal aid for Flint for a second time|publisher=WJRT-TV|date=March 16, 2016|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal doctrines of [[sovereign immunity]] (which protects the state from suit) and official immunity (which in Michigan shields top government officials from personal liability, even in cases of [[gross negligence]]) resulted in comparatively few lawsuits being filed in the Flint case, and caused large national plaintiffs' law firms to be reluctant to become involved with the case.&lt;ref name="Pierson"&gt;{{cite web|first=Brendan|last=Pierson|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-michigan-water-lawsuits-insight-idUSKCN0V32O9|title=Plaintiffs' lawyers wary of taking on Flint water scandal|publisher=Reuters|date=January 25, 2016|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a news conference on February 9, 2016, Flint mayor Karen Weaver said that the city would remove and replace all of the city's 15,000 water service lines containing lead piping. Work was expected to begin in March 2016. The project will receive technical advice from the Lansing Board of Water and Light, which removed over 13,000 lead pipes in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. Lansing mayor [[Virg Bernero]] volunteered to provide the assistance. Weaver appointed Michael C.H. McDaniel, a retired [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] [[brigadier general]], to oversee the group leading the project, the Flint Action and Sustainability Team (FAST). The city government hopes to complete the project within a year, using 32 work crews, with priority given to the most at-risk households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Katrease|last=Stafford|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/02/09/flint-mayor-details-plan-replace-lead-pipes/80049056/|title=Flint mayor: Pipe replacement to begin next month|website=The Detroit Free Press|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Jacob|last1=Carah|first2=Chad|last2=Livengood|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/02/09/flint-mayor-announces-lead-pipe-removal-plan/80052634/|title=Flint mayor announces lead pipe removal plan|website=The Detroit News|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FundingLeadPipeReplacement"&gt;{{cite web|first=Roberto|last=Acosta|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/02/funding_still_needed_for_new_5.html|title=Funding still needed for new $55M plan to replace lead service lines|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is expected to cost $55 million, and the funding sources are not yet secured, but the city plans to seek it from local, state, and federal sources.&lt;ref name="FundingLeadPipeReplacement"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Ashley|last1=Fantz|first2=Kristina|last2=Sgueglia|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/09/politics/flint-mayor-cost-replace-pipes/|title=Flint mayor says $55 million needed to replace lead pipes|publisher=CNN|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crews began working on March 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/03/flint_to_begin_first_lead_serv.html|title=Flint to begin first lead service line replacement amid water crisis|publisher=''The Flint Journal''|agency=Michigan Live|date=March 3, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long term effects of lead poisoning===
Childhood lead exposure causes a reduction in intellectual functioning and [[IQ]], [[academic performance]], and [[problem-solving]] skills, and an increased risk of [[attention deficit disorder]], aggression, and hyperactivity. According to studies, children with elevated levels of lead in the blood are more likely as adults to commit crimes, be imprisoned, be unemployed or underemployed, or be dependent on government services.&lt;ref name="LeadCosts"&gt;{{cite web|first=Julie|last=Mack|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/02/thousands_of_michigan_children.html|title=Lead levels elevated for thousands of Michigan children outside of Flint|publisher=Michigan Live|date=February 1, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Kathryn M.|last1=Barker|first2=Farah|last2=Qureshi|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/public-health/lead-poisoning-exposure-health-policy|title=Lead poisoning: Sources of exposure, health effects and policy implications|website=Journalist's Resource|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Aaron E.|last=Carroll|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/upshot/what-the-science-says-about-long-term-damage-from-lead.html|title=What the Science Says About Long-Term Damage From Lead|website=The New York Times|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, early-life exposure to lead may increase risk of later-life neurological disorders such as [[Alzheimer's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lahiri | first1 = Debomoy K. | last2 = Maloney | first2 = Bryan | title = The "LEARn" (Latent Early–life Associated Regulation) model integrates environmental risk factors and the developmental basis of Alzheimer's disease, and proposes remedial steps | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 291–296 | date = April 1, 2011 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556510000331 | doi = 10.1016/j.exger.2010.01.001| pmid = 20064601 | pmc = 2881328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this risk is likely to persist into late life long after lead has been removed from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Basha | first1 = M.

Both candidates called for Governor Snyder to resign during the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/democratic_debate_in_flint_wha.html Democrats Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders debate in Flint: What you need to know] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, March 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Donald Trump====
On January 19, 2016, then-[[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican-candidate]] [[Donald Trump]] said, "It's a shame what's happening in Flint, Michigan. A thing like that shouldn't happen."&lt;ref name=repprescomments&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/01/19/trump-rubio-try-to-stay-clear-of-flint-water-crisis/|title=Donald Trump, Rubio Try to Stay Clear of Flint Water Crisis|website=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=January 19, 2016|first1=Colleen McCain|last1=Nelson|first2=Laura|last2=Meckler}}&lt;/ref&gt; After clinching the Republican nomination, Trump visited Flint on September 14, 2016 and toured the water plant and a Flint church, where he promised to fix the water crisis, and in a brief speech there, he blamed [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] for [[General Motors]]' [[Flint, Michigan auto industry|abandonment of Flint]] and the area's subsequent ongoing [[recession]] caused by it, saying, "It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint. That's terrible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/flint_pastor_cuts_donald_trump.html Donald Trump visits Flint church, asked to leave politics out of speech] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, September 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lead poisoning and aging infrastructure problems in other cities===

An investigative report by Reuters released December 19, 2016 found nearly 3,000 areas in the United States with lead contamination rates at least double those in Flint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pell|first1=M.B. and Joshua Schneyer|title=Off the Charts – The thousands of U.S. locales where lead poisoning is worse than in Flint|url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/|accessdate=May 2, 2017|work=Reuters|date=December 16, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502091728/https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/|archive-date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Trump Administration]] blocked publishing a federal health study on the nationwide water-contamination crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/14/emails-white-house-interfered-with-science-study-536950 |title=White House, EPA headed off chemical pollution study |author=Annie Snider |date=May 14, 2018 |website=Politico.com |publisher= |access-date=May 17, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water disaster called attention to the problem of aging and seriously neglected [[water infrastructure]] nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/01/02/461735226/lead-poisoning-in-michigan-highlights-weakened-water-systems-nationwide|title=Lead Poisoning In Michigan Highlights Aging Water Systems Nationwide|publisher=NPR|agency=''Weekend Edition Saturday''|date=January 2, 2016|type=Interview with Robert Puentes, director of the Metropolitan Infrastructure Initiative at the [[Brookings Institution]]|accessdate=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WinesSchwartz"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Michael|last1=Wines|first2=John|last2=Schwartz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/us/regulatory-gaps-leave-unsafe-lead-levels-in-water-nationwide.html|title=Unsafe Lead Levels in Tap Water Not Limited to Flint|website=The New York Times|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Flint crisis recalled recent lead contamination crises in the tap water in various cities, such as the [[lead contamination in Washington, D.C. drinking water]] (2001), [[Columbia, South Carolina]] (2005); [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] and [[Greenville, North Carolina]] (2006); [[Jackson, Mississippi]] (2015); and [[Sebring, Ohio]] (2015). ''The New York Times'' notes, "Although Congress banned lead water pipes 30 years ago, between 3.3 million and 10 million older ones remain, primed to leach lead into tap water by forces as simple as jostling during repairs or a change in water chemistry." Inadequate regulation was cited as one reason for unsafe lead levels in tap water and "efforts to address shortcomings often encounter push-back from industries like agriculture and mining that fear cost increases, and from politicians ideologically opposed to regulation." The crisis called attention to a "resource gap" for water regulators. The annual budget of the EPA's drinking water office declined 15% from 2006 to 2015, with the office losing over 10% of employees, and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators reported in 2013 that "federal officials had slashed drinking-water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees," with "serious implications for states' ability to protect public health."&lt;ref name="WinesSchwartz"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the water crisis, it was noted that elevated blood-lead levels in children are found in many cities across Michigan, including Detroit, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]]. Although statewide childhood lead-poisoning rates have dramatically declined since the [[Tetraethyllead|removal of lead from gasoline]], certain areas of the state (particularly low-income areas with older housing stock) continue to experience lead poisoning, mostly from lead paint in homes built before 1978 and lead residue in dust and soil. [[Lead abatement]] efforts are slow.&lt;ref name="WilkinsonBridge"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Wilkinson|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/01/27/many-michigan-cities-higher-lead-levels-flint/79438144/|title=Kids' lead levels high in many Michigan cities|website=Bridge Magazine|date=January 28, 2016|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of environmental racism===

[[Civil rights]] advocates characterized the crisis as a result of [[environmental racism]] (Flint's population is 56.6% [[African American]] per the 2010 census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26/2629000.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102163755/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26/2629000.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 2, 2016 |title=Flint (city), Michigan |website=State &amp; County QuickFacts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term primarily referring to the disproportionate exposure of ethnic minorities to pollution as a result of "poverty and [[Housing segregation in the United States|segregation]] that has relegated many blacks and other racial minorities to some of the most industrialized or dilapidated environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Eligon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/us/a-question-of-environmental-racism-in-flint.html|title=A Question of Environmental Racism in Flint|website=The New York Times|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[Shaun King (activist)|Shaun King]], for example, wrote that the crisis was "a horrific clash of race, class, politics and [[public health]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shaun|last=King|author-link=Shaun King (activist)|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-water-crisis-flint-mich-environmental-racism-article-1.2493271|title=King: Michigan Gov.

The [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights|Michigan Civil Rights Commission]] later reiterated this belief in a 138-page report titled "The Flint Water Crisis: Systemic Racism Through the Lens of Flint". Its writers said of it, "Policy makers, government leaders, and decision makers at many levels failed the residents of Flint," said Agustin Arbulu, Director of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. "By not challenging their assumptions, by not asking themselves the tough questions about how policy and decisions play out in different communities, especially communities primarily made up of people of color, those decisions and actions – or in some cases, lack of action – led to the tragedy taking place in Flint." "We strongly believe that the actions that led to the poisoning of Flint's water and the slow response resulted in the abridgement of civil rights for the people of Flint," said Arthur Horwitz, co-chair of the Commission during the time of the investigation.  "We are not suggesting that those making decisions related to this crisis were racists, or meant to treat Flint any differently because it is a community of color. Rather, the response is the result of implicit bias and the history of systemic racism that was built into the foundation of Flint. The lessons of Flint are profound. While the exact situation and response that happened in Flint may never happen anywhere else, the factors that led to this crisis remain in place and will most certainly lead to other tragedies if we don't take steps to remedy them. We hope this report is a step in that direction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/racism_played_a_role_in_flint.html Racism played a role in Flint water crisis, says state report] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, February 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdcr/MDCR_Flint_Water_Crisis_Report_552190_7.pdf The Flint Water Crisis: Systemic Racism Through the Lens of Flint] Michigan Civil Rights Commission,  February 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Governor's office responded: "Some findings of the report and the recommendations are similar to those of the (Flint Water Advisory Task Force and) the legislative panel and the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee," said Gov. Rick Snyder spokeswoman Anna Heaton. "The Governor takes the reporting of each of these panels very seriously, and appreciates the public input that was shared." The findings were no surprise for State Senate Minority Leader [[Jim Ananich]]. "The presence of racial bias in the Flint water crisis isn't much of a surprise to those of us who live here, but the Michigan Civil Rights Commission's affirmation that the emergency manager law disproportionately hurts communities of color is an important reminder of just how bad the policy is. Now is the time to address this flawed law," Ananich said. He went on to say, "The people of Flint deserve the same level of safety, opportunity and justice that any other city in Michigan enjoys".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/belief_that_racism_played_role.html Racism playing a role in Flint water crisis is not new, officials say] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, February 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media responses===
On October 8, 2015, the editorial board of the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' wrote that the crisis was "an obscene failure of government" and criticized Snyder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/10/08/flint-water-crisis-obscene-failure-government/73578640/|title=Flint water crisis: An obscene failure of government|website=The Detroit Free Press|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2015, the editorial board of the [[MLive]] group of Michigan newspapers called upon Snyder to "drop [[executive privilege]] and release all of his communications on Flint water," establish a procedure for compensating families with children suffering from elevated lead blood levels, and return Flint to local control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/12/gov_rick_snyder_needs_to_do_mo.html|title=Gov.

Some of the most important reporting on the crisis was conducted by investigative reporter Curt Guyette, who works not for a news organization but for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s Michigan Democracy Watch Project. The work of Guyette and the ACLU was credited with bringing the water contamination to public light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Margaret|last=Sullivan|url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/flint-water-margaret-sullivan-new-york-times-public-editor/?ref=topics|title=Should The Times Have Been a Tougher Watchdog in Flint?|website=The New York Times|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ann|last=Clark|url=http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/flint_water_lead_curt_guyette_aclu_michigan.php|title=How an investigative journalist helped prove a city was being poisoned with its own water|website=Columbia Journalism Review|date=November 3, 2015|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groups===
In January 2016, the watchdog group [[Common Cause]] called upon Snyder to release all documents related to the Flint water crisis.

===Prominent figures===
[[Michael Moore]], a [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] native and director/producer of several movies related to Flint, called for Snyder's arrest for mishandling the water crisis in an [[open letter]] to the governor, writing, "The facts are all there, Mr. Snyder. Every agency involved in this scheme reported directly to you. The children of Flint didn't have a choice as to whether or not they were going to get to drink clean water." A spokesman for the governor called Moore's call "inflammatory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/06/michael-moore-calls-arrest-gov-snyder/78394712/|title=Michael Moore calls for arrest of Gov.

Robby Soave, writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, said that administrative bloat in [[public-sector trade union]]s was to blame for the crisis: "Let's not forget the reason why local authorities felt the need to find a cheaper water source: Flint is broke and its desperately poor citizens can't afford higher taxes to pay the pensions of city government retirees. As recently as 2011, it would have cost every person in Flint $10,000 each to cover the unfunded legacy costs of the city's public employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robby|last=Soave|url=https://reason.com/blog/2016/01/21/the-government-poisoned-flints-waterso-s|title=The Government Poisoned Flint's Water—So Stop Blaming Everyone Else|website=Reason|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Flint was a government-made disaster from top to bottom.

The crisis brought the National Water Infrastructure Conference to Flint in early March 2017. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver spoke on the first day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnem.com/story/34682627/flints-lead-water-crisis-part-of-infrastructure-conference Flint's lead water crisis part of infrastructure conference] WNEM-TV, March 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Marc Edwards spoke there two days later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc12.com/content/news/Dr-Marc-Edwards-speaks-on-the-current-state-of-the-Flint-Water-Crisis-415919093.html Dr. Marc Edwards speaks on current state of the Flint Water Crisis] WJRT-TV (ABC 12), March 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2017 Stephen Estes-Smargiassi, director of planning and sustainability at the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]], told a forum on lead water contamination at the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|Harvard School of Public Health]] that a chain-reaction of failures, including those by the financial managers, allowed the water crisis to develop as long as it did. He stated "What happened in Flint? Well, a firestorm of things that went wrong. (Flint) changed (its) source water, didn't do a good job on corrosion control in their treatment", and added "They had, about half of the homes had lead service lines. Money was more important to the emergency manager than people were. That's pretty clear from the evidence,"  and later went on to say, "State regulators could have picked up on this, but fell down on the job, maybe worse than that. We'll see what happens to those who were indicted. And the federal regulators could have picked up the problem, but didn't until quite late. All of those things, that firestorm of events, resulted in really awful water quality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/05/water_expert.html Expert at Harvard forum says Flint EMs cared more about money than people] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, May 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Upholding the Clean Water Act passed in 1972 would have prevented an outbreak of lead poisoning in Flint. This act "established the basic structure for regulating pollutant discharges into the waters of the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act|title=History of the Clean Water Act {{!}} US EPA|last1=EPA,OA,OP,ORPM,RMD|first1=US|website=US EPA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA has also updated its standards and created six goals for improving the drinking water of the nation.

==Indirect mental health impact==
As the water crisis unfolded, residents experienced considerable anxiety over the physical and mental health impacts of lead poisoning on both adults and children, stress, and anger and political leaders.  Some adults felt guilty about giving children contaminated water, and in some cases family members stopped visiting.  Some residents related the water crisis to depression and even thoughts of suicide; some sought treatment for mental breakdowns. The state government gave a $500,000 grant to the Genesee Health System for free counseling in addition to sending state mobile crisis teams and expanding Medicaid programs for affected residents. Volunteer social workers arrived from across the state, and the United States Public Health Service offered training.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/us/flint-michigan-water-crisis-mental-health.html A Potent Side Effect to the Flint Water Crisis: Mental Health Problems] ''The New York Times'', April 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 8, 2017, the Ruth Mott Foundation and the Community Foundation of Greater Flint have directed a combined $33,480,494 to various programs to aid both children and adults affected by Flint's water crisis. This total reflects donations from many of the celebrities mentioned in this section, as well as from other groups and organizations. This money has gone to fund not only immediate aid for the Flint crisis (such as bottled water distribution), but also to build community organizations and infrastructure in Flint. This money has not gone to actually repairing the Flint water system, which remains the responsibility of local and state governments. The Ruth Mott foundation says much of their work is going towards helping Flint's children, in the form of programs for health, nutrition, and education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/09/see_how_334m_in_flint_water_cr.html See how $33.4M in Flint water crisis grants, donations have been spent] ''The Flint Journal'' via MLive.com, September 8, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21868">The term '''food system''' is used frequently in discussions about nutrition, food, health, community economic development and agriculture. A food system includes all processes and infrastructure involved in feeding a population: growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, [[Agricultural marketing|marketing]], consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. It also includes the inputs needed and outputs generated at each of these steps. A food system operates within and is influenced by social, political, economic and environmental contexts. It also requires human resources that provide labor, research and education. Food systems are either [[#Conventional food systems|conventional]]  or [[#Alternative food systems|alternative]] according to their model of food lifespan from origin to plate.&lt;ref&gt;Discovering the Food System - A Primer on Community Food Systems: Linking Food, Nutrition and Agriculture http://foodsys.cce.cornell.edu/primer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conceptualizing food systems for global environmental change research – Polly J.

==Conventional food systems==
'''Conventional food systems''' operate on [[economies of scale]]. These food systems are geared towards a production model that requires maximizing [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] in order to lower consumer costs and increase overall production, and they utilize economic models such as [[vertical integration]], economic [[Post-Fordism#Flexible Specialization|specialization]], and [[global trade]].

The term “conventional” when describing food systems is in large part due to comparisons made to it by proponents of other food systems, collectively known as [[#Alternative food systems|alternative food systems]].

===History of conventional food systems===

The development of food systems can be traced back to the origins of in-situ [[agriculture]] and the production of food surpluses. These surpluses enabled the development of settled areas and contributed to the development of ancient civilizations, particularly those in the [[Fertile Crescent]].&lt;ref&gt;(2004); Manning, R.; Against the Grain: How Agriculture Hijacked Civilization, New York:North Point Press&lt;/ref&gt; The system of trade associated with the exchange of foodstuffs also emerged in East Asia, North America, South America, and Subsaharan Africa with common commodities of exchange such as [[salt]], [[spices]], [[fish]], [[Food grain|grains]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;(1994); Toussaint-Samat, M. and Bell, A.; A History of Food ; Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Through events in world history such as the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Crusades]], the expansion of [[Islam]], the journeys of [[Marco Polo]], and the exploration and [[colonization of the Americas]] by Europeans led to the introduction and redistribution of new foods to the world at large, and food systems began to intermingle on a global scale. After [[World War II]], the advent of [[industrialized agriculture]] and more robust [[global trade]] mechanisms have evolved into the models of [[food industry|food production]], presentation, delivery, and disposal that characterizes conventional food systems today.&lt;ref&gt;(1998); Welch, R., Graham, R.; "A new paradigm for world agriculture: meeting human needs, Productive, sustainable, nutritious"; Field Crops Research #60,.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts of conventional food systems===

Lower food costs and greater food variety can be directly attributed to the evolvement of conventional food systems. [[Agronomy|Agronomic]] efficiency is driven by the necessity to constantly lower production expenses, and those savings can then be passed on to the consumer. Also, the advent of industrial agriculture and the [[infrastructure]] built around conventional food systems has enabled the world population to expand beyond the "[[Malthusian catastrophe]]" limitations.

However, conventional food systems are largely based on the availability of inexpensive [[fossil fuels]], which is necessary for [[mechanized agriculture]], the manufacture or collection of chemical [[fertilizers]], the processing of food products, and the packaging of the foods. Food processing began when the number of consumers started growing rapidly. The demand for cheap and efficient calories climbed resulting in nutrition decline.&lt;ref&gt;Nestle, Marion. (2013). ''Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health." Los Angeles, California: University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0520275966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialized agriculture, due to its reliance on economies of scale to reduce production costs, often leads to the compromising of local, regional, or even global [[ecosystems]] through fertilizer runoff, [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]] pollution,&lt;ref&gt;(1993); Schnitkey, G.D., Miranda, M.; "The Impact of Pollution Controls on Livestock Crop producers", Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics&lt;/ref&gt; and [[greenhouse gas emission]]. Also, the need to reduce production costs in an increasingly global market can cause production of foods to be moved to areas where economic costs (labor, taxes, etc.) are lower or environmental regulations are more lax, which are usually further from consumer markets. For example, the majority of salmon sold in the United States is raised off the coast of Chile, due in large part to less stringent Chilean standards regarding fish feed and regardless of the fact that salmon are not indigenous in Chilean coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;(2001); Bjorndal, T., "The Competitiveness of the Chilean Salmon Aquaculture Industry", Foundation for Research in Economics and Business Administration, Bergen, Norway&lt;/ref&gt; The globalization of food production can result in the loss of traditional food systems in [[Developing country|less developed countries]], and have negative impacts on the [[population health]], ecosystems, and [[cultures]] in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;(1996); Kuhnlein, H.V., Receveur, O.; Dietary Change and Traditional Food Systems of Indigenous Peoples; Centre for Nutrition and the Environment of Indigenous Peoples, and School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, McGill University, Quebec, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative food systems&lt;!-- [[Alternative food]] redirects to this heading --&gt;==

'''Alternative food systems''' are those that fall outside the scope of conventional [[agriculture]].

=== Local food systems===

[[Local food]] systems are networks of food production and consumption that aim to be geographically and economically accessible and direct. They contrast to industrial food systems by operating with reduced food transportation and more [[direct marketing]], leading to fewer people between the farmer and the consumer. As a result, relationships that are developed in local food systems emerge from face-to-face interactions, potentially leading to a stronger sense of trust and social connectedness between actors.&lt;ref&gt;Hinrichs, Clare. 2000. "Embeddedness and local food systems: notes on two types of direct agricultural market" Journal of Rural Studies 16: 295-303&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, consumers can also encourage farmers to be environmentally friendly by teaching them about practices such as organic farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.learngrowconnect.org/about/local-food-systems#localfood|title=About Local Food Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, some scholars suggest that local food systems are a good way to revitalize a community.&lt;ref&gt;Feenstra, Gail. 1997. "Local food systems and sustainable communities" American journal of alternative agriculture 12(1) p. 28-36&lt;/ref&gt; The decreased distance of food transportation has also been promoted for its environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Andy. 2002. "An Environmental Assessment of Food Supply Chains: A Case Study on Dessert Apples" Environmental Management 30(4) p. 560-576&lt;/ref&gt; Also, farmers can enjoy a better quality of life because producing healthier food will allow them to be paid more, and not live under the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.learngrowconnect.org/about/local-food-systems#foodsecurity|title=About Local Food Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both proponents and critics of local food systems warn that they can lead to narrow inward-looking attitudes or ‘local food patriotism’,&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Valentine (1997). D. Bell and G. Valentine Consuming Geographies: We are Where We Eat, Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt; and that price premiums and local food cultures can be elitist and exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Guthman, Julie. 2004. Agrarian Dreams: the Paradox of Organic Farming in California. Berkeley : University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of local food systems include [[community-supported agriculture]], [[farmers' markets|farmers markets]] and [[farm to school]] programs. They have been associated with the [[100 Mile Diet]] and [[Low Carbon Diet]], as well as the [[food sovereignty]] movement and [[slow food movement]]. Various forms of [[urban agriculture]] locate food production in densely populated areas not traditionally associated with farming. [[Garden sharing]], where urban and suburban homeowners offer land access to food growers in exchange for a share of the harvest, is a relatively new trend, at the extreme end of direct local food production.

===Organic food systems===

[[Organic food]] systems are characterized by a reduced dependence on [[fertilizer|chemical inputs]] and an increased concern for transparency and information. Organic produce is grown without the chemical pesticides and fertilizers of industrial food systems, and [[livestock]] is reared without the use of [[antibiotics]] or [[growth hormones]]. The reduced inputs of organic agriculture can also lead to a greater reliance on local knowledge, creating a stronger knowledge community amongst farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, K and J. Murdoch (2000) "Organic vs. conventional agriculture: knowledge, 	power and innovation in the food chain" Geoforum 31(2): 159-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renkin, A.M., K. Lyons and R.C.N. Laurence (2002) in Proceedings from the 14th IFOAM Organic World Congress, Victoria, BC, August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The transparency of food information is vital for organic food systems as a means through which consumers are able to identify organic food.&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, L. (2000) "Re-embedding global agriculture: The international organic and fair trade movements" Agriculture and Human Values 17(3): 297-309&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a variety of certification bodies have emerged in organic food systems that set the standards for organic identification. Organic agriculture is promoted for the ecological benefits of reduced chemical application, the health benefits of lower chemical consumption, the economic benefits that accrue to farmers through a price premium, and the social benefits of increased transparency in the food system.

Like local food systems, organic food systems have been criticized for being elitist and inaccessible. Critics have also suggested that organic agriculture has been conventionalized such that it mimics industrial food systems while using pesticides and fertilizers that are organically derived &lt;ref&gt;Altieri, M. and P. Rossett. 1997. "Agroecology versus input substitution: A fundamental contradiction of sustainable agriculture" Society and Natural Resources 10(3): 283 - 296&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperatives in food systems===

Cooperatives can exist both at the farmer end of food production and the consumer end. [[Agricultural cooperative|Farming cooperatives]] refer to arrangements where farmers pool resources, either to cultivate their crops or get their crops to market. Consumer cooperatives often refer to [[food cooperative]]s where members buy a share in the store. Co-operative grocery stores, unlike corporate grocery stores, are socially owned and thus surpluses cannot be taken from the store as profit. As a result, food co-ops do not work for profit, potentially keeping prices more cost representative. Other forms of cooperatives that have developed more recently include [[community-supported agriculture]], where community members buy a share in a farm’s harvest, and may also be engaged in farm labour, operating at both the consumer and producer end of food systems. [[Garden sharing]] pairs individual landowners and food growers, while variations on this approach organize groups of food gardeners for mutual assistance.

The benefits of cooperatives are largely in the redistribution of risk and responsibility. For farming cooperatives that share resources, the burden of investment is disbursed to all members, rather than being concentrated in a single individual. A criticism of cooperatives is that reduced competition can reduce efficiency&lt;ref&gt;Deininger, Klaus (1995) Collective agricultural production: A solution for transition economies?. WorldDevehpmenr, Vol. 23, No. 8, pp. 1317-1334&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair Trade===

[[Fair trade]] has emerged in global food systems to create a greater balance between the price of food and the cost of producing it. It is defined largely by more direct trading systems whereby producers have greater control over the conditions of trade and garner a greater fraction of the sale price. The main goal of Fair Trade is to "change international commercial
relations in such a way that disadvantaged producers can increase their control over their own future, have a fair and just return for their work, continuity of income and decent working and living conditions through sustainable development" &lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Foundation (1999). "The Fairtrade Foundation." &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrade.org.uk |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050601080608/http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/ |archivedate=2005-06-01 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Like organic food systems, fair trade relies on transparency and the flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;Raynolds, L. (2000) "Re-embedding global agriculture: The international organic and fair 	trade movements" Agriculture and Human Values 17(3): 297-309&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known examples of fair trade commodities are [[coffee]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]].

==Transparency==

Transparency within food systems refers to full disclosure of information about rules, procedures and practices at all levels within a food production and [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;VonBailey, D., Jones, E., &amp; Dickinson, D. L. (2002). Knowledge Management and Comparative International Strategies on Vertical Information Flow in the Global Food System. Amer. J. Agr. Econ. 87: 1337-1344.&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency ensures that consumers have detailed information about production of a given food item. [[Traceability]], by contrast, is the ability to trace to their origins all components in a food production and marketing chain, whether processed or unprocessed (e.g., meat, vegetables) foods. Concerns about transparency and traceability have been heightened with [[food safety]] scares such as [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy]] (BSE) and [[Escherichia coli]] (E. coli), but do not exclusively refer to [[food safety]]. Transparency is also important in identifying foods that possess extrinsic qualities that do not affect the nature of the food per se, but affect its production, such as [[animal welfare]], [[social justice]] issues and environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Unnevehr, L. &amp; Roberts, T. (2002). Food safety incentives in a changing world food system. Food Control 13(2):73-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary ways transparency is achieved is through [[certification]] and/or use of food labels. In the United States, some certification originates in the public sector, such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) Organic label. Others have their origin in private sector  certification (e.g., Humanely Raised, Certified Humane). There are also labels which do not rely on certification, such as the USDA's Country of Origin Label (COOL).

Participation in local food systems such as [[Community Supported Agriculture]] (CSA), Farmers Markets, food cooperatives and farmer cooperatives also enhances transparency, and there are diverse programs promoting purchase of locally grown and marketed foods.

===Labeling===

{| border="0" cellpadding="0"
|- valign="top"
| style="width:30pt;"|[[Image:USDA organic seal.svg|thumb|80px | USDA Organic Label]]
| style="width:400pt;"|'''Organic (USA)''' – The USDA Organic label indicates that the product has been produced in accordance with the USDA's Federal Organic Standard.  This label is applied to [[fruits]], [[vegetables]], [[meat]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[dairy products]]. Some states, such as [[California]], have their own organic label.  Organic labelling is prominent internationally as well.
|- valign="top"
||[[Image:Faitrade display.jpg|thumb|80px | Fair Trade Show in UK]]
||'''Fair Trade''' – Indicates that the product has been grown and marketed in accordance with [[Fair Trade]] standards. This is an independent certification, awarded by FLO-CERT  and overseen by FLO International.  Major food items that are marketed under Fair Trade are coffee, tea and chocolate.  Many items other than food are sold with a Fair Trade label.
|- valign="top"
||
||'''Food Alliance Certified''' – Food Alliance is a nonprofit organization that certifies farms, ranches, and food processors and distributors for safe and fair working conditions, humane treatment of animals, and good environmental stewardship. Food Alliance Certified products come from farms, ranches and food processors that have met meaningful standards for social and environmental responsibility, as determined through an independent third-party audit. Food Alliance does not certify [[genetically modified crops]] or livestock. Meat or dairy products come from animals that are not treated with antibiotics or growth hormones. Food Alliance Certified foods never contain artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. Food Alliance Certified. http://www.foodalliance.org
|- valign="top"
||[[Image:COOLExample1.jpg|thumb|80px | Examples of COOL Labeling]]
||'''Country of Origin''' – This label was created by enactment  of the 2002 [[Farm Bill]]. The US Department of Agriculture is responsible for its implementation, which began 30 September 2008.  The bill mandates [[country of origin]] labeling for several products, including [[beef]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[pork]], [[fish]], [[chicken as food|chicken]], perishable agricultural [[commodity|commodities]] and some [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]].  USDA rules provide specifics as to documentation, timetables and definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling - Interim Final Rule for Meat, Perishable Agricultural Commodities, Peanuts, Macadamia Nuts, Pecans, and Ginseng.  USDA 8/28/08. http://www.ams.usda.gov/.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is not one specific label to indicate the country of origin; they will vary by country.
|- valign="top"
||
||'''American Humane Certified''' – This certification is provided by the [[American Humane Association]], and ensures that farm animals are raised according to welfare standards that provide  for adequate housing, feed, healthcare and behavior expression. [[Antibiotics]] are not used except for therapeutic reasons; growth promoters are not used.  Other issues including transport, processing and [[biosecurity]] are  addressed as well.  Species covered are [[poultry]], [[cattle]] and [[swine]].&lt;ref&gt;American Humane Association. http://www.americanhumane.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
|- valign="top"
||
||'''Certified Humane Raised &amp; Handled''' – This label ensures that production meets the Humane Farm Animal Care Program standards, which addresses housing, diet (excluding routine use of [[hormones]] or antibiotics) and natural behavior.  Additionally, producers must comply with food safety and environmental protection regulations. They must meet standards set by the [[American Meat Institute]], that are more stringent than those laid out in the Federal Humane Slaughter Act.  Certification has been applied to beef, poultry and eggs, pork, lamb, [[goat]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[veal]], [[dairy products]] and [[wool]].&lt;ref&gt;Humane Farm Animal Care. http://www.certifiedhumane.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The killing of Herrick has unleashed a side of George that he had never shown before. He is looking for a fight and gets involved with a couple of new vampires. He doesn’t even see that his girlfriend Nina is feeling bad. That George had scratched her while transforming had turned her into a werewolf. Instead of taking care of her George flirts with the vampire Daisy.

George is sceptical about this and decides not to join Nina. Instead, he goes to a parents meeting at school, along with Sam. There he starts transforming into a werewolf and manages only to get away within the last second. This makes George realise that being a werewolf is endangering the people in his life, and he decides to go to the CenSSA organisation along with Annie and Nina to finally get rid of his condition.&lt;ref name=IGN27&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/22/being-human-series-2-episode-7-review|title=Being Human: "Series 2, Episode 7" Review|publisher=''[[IGN]]''|date=22 February 2010|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally  George, Annie and Nina figure out that Kemp can’t keep what he has promised and that a lot of werewolves are killed during his experiments. For Annie however it is already to late. She is sent to hell by Kemp. Meanwhile, Mitchell kills most of the people from the company. Later George, Mitchell and Nina move into a new home in Barry.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Joane: Being Human, Cambridge: Classic TV Press 2011, S. 248-264&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casting ==
[[File:Russell Tovey.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Russell Tovey]] played George]]
After the Being Human pilot, almost all the rôles were recast. Russell Tovey was the only regular cast member that stayed. He later told in an interview that the George that he played alongside [[Guy Flanagan]] (Mitchell - Pilot) and [[Andrea Riseborough]] (Annie - Pilot) was different from the George that he played alongside [[Lenora Crichlow]] and [[Aidan Turner]], as each actor would respond differently to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifipulse.net/russell-tovey-discusses-being-human-season-two/|title=Russell Tovey Discusses ‘Being Human’ Season Two.|publisher=''SciFi Pulse''|author=Ian Cullen|date=22 January 2010|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leaving the series ==
In November 2011 Tovey announced on Twitter that he would leave Being Human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/tv/russell-tovey-quits-being-human-878535|title=Russell Tovey quits ‘Being Human’.|publisher=''[[NME]]''|date=12 November 2011|author=Tom Goodwyn|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said that he would feel strange to film the series without Aidan Turner, who had announced his departure of the series a few time before Tovey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/original-being-human-cast-return-8083621|title=Russell Tovey: why I'm leaving Being Human (and loving Him &amp; Her).|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=11 November 2011|author=Nosheen Iqbal|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2016 at the [[MCM London Comic Con]] Russell Tovey said that he would like to film another one-off special of Being Human with his former co-stars [[Aidan Turner]] and [[Lenora Crichlow]]. He suggested that the special could take place in the after life.&lt;ref name="Natalie Corner"/&gt;

== Characterisation ==
Originally the BBC asked Whithouse to write a story about three college graduades buying a house together. In Whithouse's early ideas George was a man with anger management issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/being-human/38943/being-human-celebrating-bbc-three-originals|title=Being Human: celebrating BBC Three originals.|publisher=''[[Den of Geek]]''|author=Caroline Preece|date=16 February 2016|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was very punctilious, old fashioned and romantic. George had his own travel agency. At his office there was a girl who was in love with him. However, George turned out to be a werewolf.&lt;ref&gt;Inhuman Nature. in: [[SFX (magazine)|SFX]], The 50 Greatest Vampires of All Time (2011), P. 54-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Brent Hartinger from ''[[Logo TV]]'' feels that Russell Tovey’s George is a “very fussy, neurotic character, and he’s also extremely adorkable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://burrunjor.com/2015/03/31/being-human-review/|title=In "Being Human," a Vampire, a Werewolf, and a Ghost Share a Flat….|publisher=''[[Logo TV]]''|date=24 July 2009|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{POV|date=August 2017}}
The '''Gokhale Method''' or '''Primal Posture''' method is a postural awareness technique developed by [[acupuncturist]] and yoga instructor Esther Gokhale.&lt;ref name="Khaleeli 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khaleeli|first1=Homa|title=A simple cure for back pain: grow up in the Ecuadorian mountains|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2015/jun/10/a-simple-cure-for-back-pain-grow-up-in-the-ecuadorian-mountains|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method proposes that certain patterns exist in the way people in pre-modern and less industrialized societies move and adopt posture. Gokhale claims that these patterns, which she calls ''{{dfn|primal posture}}'', can be learned through practice. The method became popular in the beginning of the 2010s among professionals in the [[Silicon Valley]], where Gokhale is located.&lt;ref name="Schoenfeld 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schoenfeld|first1=Amy|title=Soothing Back Pain by Learning How to Sit Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/business/soothing-back-pain-by-learning-how-to-sit-again.html|accessdate= February 11, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kriegman 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kriegman|first1=Mitchell|title=The Gokhale Method|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2014/may/13/gokhale-method/|accessdate=February 11, 2017|work=[[Santa Barbara Independent]]|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Esther Gokhale teaching at Ancestral Health Symposium 2013.png|thumb|Esther Gokhale teaching at the [[Ancestral Health Symposium]] in 2013.|200x200px]]
Gokhale started searching for a method to cope with her own back pain,&lt;ref name="Kriegman 2014" /&gt; including [[sciatica]] and [[spinal disc herniation]] which began with her first pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doucleff|first1=Michaeleen|title=Lost Posture: Why Some Indigenous Cultures May Not Have Back Pain|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/08/412314701/lost-posture-why-indigenous-cultures-dont-have-back-pain|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[NPR]]|date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She based the method on training in the [[Feldenkrais Method]] and from a French organization for postural awareness called the Aplomb Institute.&lt;ref name="Schoenfeld 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref
name="Wallace 2013" /&gt; Gokhale also spent ten years observing and photographing people's posture in less industrialized societies.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Charles|title=Exercises to tackle bad posture can avert back surgery|url=https://www.ft.com/content/92e767ea-6417-11e3-98e2-00144feabdc0|accessdate=April 21, 2017|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=December 16, 2013|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.ft.com/content/92e767ea-6417-11e3-98e2-00144feabdc0|archivedate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaswani 2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/columns/you/sit-up-smart/articleshow/56721166.cms|title=Sit up smart|date=January 23, 2017|work=[[Bangalore Mirror]]|publisher=[[Bennett, Coleman and Co]]|last1=Vaswani|first1=Anjana|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gokhale started teaching in a studio at [[Palo Alto]], California.&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt;

== Features ==
The result of Esther Gokhale's observations was an eight-step method that emphasizes a posture with a J-shaped spine as the ideal form, created through repositioning the pelvis.&lt;ref name="Schoenfeld 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt; The method emphasizes training posture through everyday activities, rather than exercise,&lt;ref name="Kriegman 2014" /&gt; and involves as much {{em|unlearning}} former habits of [[poor posture]] as learning new habits of good posture. Postural training involves the shoulders, neck, back, hips and knees,&lt;ref name="Vaswani 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sen 2017"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/x34a1wwrb356UmYVgJH3XJ/Bad-posture-is-not-just-about-having-a-hunched-back.html |title=Bad posture is not just about having a hunched back |last=Sen |first=Sohini |date=February 6, 2017 |work=[[Live Mint]] |access-date=February 11, 2017 |publisher=[[HT Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporates yoga and dance.&lt;ref name="Ben 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Shachar|first1=Rotem|title=Good moves for a better back|journal=[[Palo Alto Weekly]]|date=August 8, 2007|pages=21–2|url=http://gokhalemethod.com/sites/default/files/news_events/PA_Weekly_8-8-07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gokhale 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gokhale|first1=Esther|editor1-last=Adams|editor1-first=Susan|title=8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back: Natural Posture Solutions for Pain in the Back, Neck, Shoulder, Hip, Knee, and Foot|date=2013|publisher=Pendo Press|isbn=978-0-9793036-8-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MBeYBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the method aims to elongate the spine and lessen the burden on the lower back.&lt;ref name="Browne 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Browne|first1=David|title=Rethinking the Right Way to Sit|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/expert-advice/the-right-way-to-sit-20131204|website=[[Men's Journal]]|date=December 4, 2013|accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Esther Gokhale teaching at Ancestral Health Symposium 2014.png|left|thumb|Esther Gokhale demonstrates posture.|170x170px]]The method consists of consecutive steps, with instructions on how to sit, stand, lie down, bend over, walk, and lift heavy objects.&lt;ref name="Cooks 2017"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=http://gokhalemethod.com/your_familys_health_gokhale_method_dr_roberta_cooks |title=Your Family's Health: Gokhale Method |date=2017-08-29 |last=Buckley, Joan (host); Cooks, Roberta (Gokhale Method trainer) |access-date=April 24, 2017 |medium=Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goins|first1=Liesa|title=Back Problems: 5 Common Causes and Prevention Tips|url=http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/features/how-to-wreck-your-back#3|website=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gokhale uses [[kinesthetic]], visual and intellectual teaching methods in her classes.&lt;ref name="Ben 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Cristo, Paul (host)|title=Posture Guru and Pain Relief |date= January 27, 2014|medium=Podcast|url=http://gokhalemethod.com/node/56051 |access-date=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming legitimacy from medical literature and anatomical arguments,&lt;ref name="Ben 2017" /&gt; Gokhale has made statements that certain medical conditions such as RSI ([[Repetitive strain injury]]) are strongly related to posture and can be solved by improving posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gokhale|first1=Esther|title=Shoulder Posture Contributes to Syndromes Involving Multiple Meridians|journal=California Journal of Oriental Medicine|date=2009|volume=20|issue=1|page=8|url=http://gokhalemethod.com/sites/default/files/news_events/CJOMmag.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also spoken out against the widespread notion that "sitting is the new smoking", stating that "we are much better designed than that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=Lauren|title=Esther Gokhale: Primal Posture For Wellness|url=http://wellnessforce.com/radio/esther-gokhale-primal-posture-for-wellness/|website=Wellness Force|accessdate=April 21, 2017|time=15:02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohn 2010"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-mtblog-2010-06-when_it_comes_to_back_pain_don-story.html |title=When it comes to back pain, don't believe the myths |last=Cohn |first=Meredith |date=June 10, 2010 |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] |access-date=April 22, 2017|quote=Myth: Good posture naturally comes from being physically fit and active: If you have poor posture, increased activity is not an efficient way to arrive at better posture and can even result in injuries instead of improvement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and analysis ==
The method quickly caught on in the [[Bay Area]], as she has been described as the "posture guru of Silicon Valley".&lt;ref name="Doucleff 2015" /&gt; Apart from the United States, the method has been taught in the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Wallace 2013" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">The case of the '''Healer of Berne''' (German ''Heiler von Bern'') involves an Italian-Swiss music teacher and owner of a [[acupuncture]] practice which operated without a license. He is accused of knowingly infecting at least 16 people with the [[HIV virus]], and 14 of them were also infected with [[Hepatitis C]].

The acts were carried from 2001 to 2005 in the Swiss capital, [[Bern]]. A manager who in 2004 was jabbed in his back during the acupuncture treatment and subsequently was tested positive for the HIV virus set the medical investigation into motion. His clues were only followed up in a criminal investigation after several other patients accumulated at Bern's main hospital, the [[Inselspital]], who also were infected with the same strain of the virus. The blood used for infecting the victim was, over the course of several years, drawn from a man who was promised a potential cure for his HIV infection. According to the criminal charges, two former girlfriends of the acupuncture therapist were also infected by him.

The trial at the regional court Bern-Mittelland began on March 6, 2013. The accused denied any involvement in the infections. When the trial opened, he hid for 24 hours in his home instead of arriving at the court, making a [[SWAT team]] necessary for apprehending him. On March 13, he was sentenced to 12 years and 9 months of prison for serious [[bodily injury]].

He appealed to the Obergericht of the Canton of Bern, as did the prosecutor. It then raised the sentence to the maximum allowed for bodily injury, namely 15 years of prison. Again, an appeal was made to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], which confirmed the 15 years of prison in its ruling (decision ''141 IV 97''), and rejected the plea to be acquitted for serious bodily injury, and instead be tried for minor bodily injury as well as proliferation of human diseases.

Statistics from the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] indicated that 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse and 6 percent are dependent on alcohol. Doctors hope that the new definition will help identify severe cases of alcoholism early, rather than when the problem is fully developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyemerald.com/2012/05/22/redefining-alcoholic-what-this-means-for-students/ | title=About 37 percent of college students could now be considered alcoholics | date=May 22, 2012 | accessdate=September 17, 2016 | first=Megan | last=Sanderson | website=Daily Emerald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many HFAs are not viewed as alcoholics by society because they do not fit the common alcoholic [[stereotype]]. Unlike the stereotypical alcoholic, HFAs have either succeeded or [[Overachievement|over-achieved]] throughout their lifetimes. This can lead to [[denial]] of alcoholism by the HFA, co-workers, family members, and friends. Functional alcoholics account for 19.5 percent of total U.S. alcoholics, with 50 percent also being smokers and 33 percent having a multigenerational family history of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers Identify Alcoholic Subtypes|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jun2007/niaaa-28.htm|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] – [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] |accessdate= February 18, 2012|author= Press release | date =June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:More neighbors D'autres voisins.jpg|right|thumb|Unidentified members of the IMS in France, during World War I.]]
The '''Indian Medical Service''' ('''IMS''') was a military medical service in [[British Raj|British India]], which also had some civilian functions. It served during the two World Wars, and remained in existence until the independence of India in 1947. Many of its officers, who were both British and Indian, served in civilian hospitals.

Among its notable ranks, the IMS had Sir [[Ronald Ross]], a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[Benjamin Franklin (surgeon)|Sir Benjamin Franklin]], later honorary physician to three British monarchs and [[Henry Vandyke Carter]], best known for his illustrations in the anatomy textbook ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]''.

==History==
The earliest positions for medical officers in the [[British East India Company]] (formed as the Association of Merchant Adventurers in 1599 and receiving the royal charter on the last day of 1600) were as ship surgeons. The first three surgeons to have served were John Banester on the ''Leicester'', Lewis Attmer on the ''Edward'' and Robert Myssenden on the ''Francis''. The first Company fleet went out in 1600 with [[James Lancaster]] on the Red Dragon and three other ships, each with two surgeons and a barber.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford I:1-3&lt;/ref&gt; This was the voyage on which the serendipitous experiment on lemon juice as a cure for scurvy was carried out. The establishment of the East India Company in India was greatly aided by a doctor, although a lot of fiction may have been introduced into accounts relating to this. Gabriel Boughton is said to have saved Shah Jahan's daughter princess Jahanara from injuries due to burns. In reward he was given duty-free trading rights and this document was utilized by the East India Company to obtain a ''farman'' or rights for itself from the ruler in Surat.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:37-57&lt;/ref&gt;

As more factories of the East India Company were established in India at this time, new positions began to be created for the appointment of surgeons and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=D. G.|date=1901|title=Notes on the History of the Bengal Medical Service |quote=The following notes were compiled altogether from the point of view of a member of the Bengal Medical Service, but I believe that the statements about pay, rank, furlough, &amp;c., in fact all the notes on the early history of the Bengal service, would apply equally, mutatis mutandis, to Madras and Bombay.|journal=The Indian Medical Gazette|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–4|issn=0019-5863|pmc=5164180|pmid=29004198}}&lt;/ref&gt; These men of medicine included Nicholas Manucci, a [[Venice|Venetian]] born in 1639 who served [[Dara Shikoh]] before studying medicine in [[Lahore]] where he served [[Shah Alam]] from 1678-82. Later, he then settled in Madras. An [[Armenians|Armenian]] named Sikandar Beg served as surgeon to [[Suleiman Shikoh]], son of Darah Shikoh, and there are records of several Dutch and French physicians in various courts across India.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:7-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Browne (surgeon)|Samuel Browne]] served around 1694 at Fort St. George, Madras from where he also reported on his botanical and other natural history studies.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:16&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Martin served Haider Ali and Jean Castarede served under Tipoo Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:11-14&lt;/ref&gt; A hierarchy was introduced into the establishment of the East India Company in 1614 with the appointment of a surgeon general. The first to accept this position was John Woodall, who was however accused of embezzling pay from apprentices that he used to hire. With continuing complaints and financial crunch he was retrenched in 1642.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Another Surgeon Walter Chesley was sent home from service in Sumatra for drunkenness, while a Dr. Coote was removed from Bencoolen for debauchery in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:34&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgeons were often assigned on diplomatic missions to various courts and they were found to be very influential. The first surgeon at Calcutta was a Dutchman who resigned in 1691. [[William Hamilton (surgeon)|William Hamilton]] was particularly famous.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:116-127&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Zephaniah Holwell]] who came to Bengal as a Surgeon in 1732 was appointed as ''Zamindar'' of Calcutta. He was captured in 1756 by Siraj-ud-Daulah and survived the Black Hole. Holwell was noted as a careful student of native customs and it has been suggested that if he had been in charge of Fort William, the entire incident would not have happened. He returned to England and became as an advisor on various matters of government.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:150-176&lt;/ref&gt; Surgeons were often spared in wartime. William Fullerton was the sole survivor in 1763 at Patna when the English fought Nawab Mir Qasim.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:180-196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh|year=1993|volume=38|issue=3|pages=125–126|title=Gabriel Boughton and William Hamilton: surgeons who helped build British power in India|author=Sinha, K.K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, around 1830, John Martin Honigberger from Transylvania served Ranjit Singh. He also worked at a hospital set up by Sir Henry Lawrence at Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:15-16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Simpson]] is particularly well known for capturing numerous photographs during his service in the second half of the 19th century.

Later, in the nineteenth century, the IMS became one of the routes to becoming a [[Political officer (British Empire)|Political officer]] in the [[Indian Political Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Organization==
The first signs of organization began with the establishment of the Bengal Medical Service on 20 October 1763 with fixed grades, rules for promotion and service. Similar services were established by 1764 in both Madras and Bombay.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:197-198&lt;/ref&gt; In Bengal increasing military actions required the separation of Military Surgeons from Civil Surgeons. Each non-native regiment had a surgeon and over time the strength of the Medical Service grew. The Bengal service had 382 in 1854 while Madras had 217 and Bombay 181.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 1:201-222&lt;/ref&gt; For a while the military service also required combat service and upon promotion they could choose one branch either as Captain or Surgeon. The first Indian natives to join the service was [[Soorjo Coomar Goodeve Chuckerbutty]] who entered the service on 24 January 1855 followed by Rajendra Chandra Chandra on 27 January 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=D.

==Later development==
The [[British Raj|British Indian government]] set up the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine between 1910 and its opening in 1921 as a postgraduate center for tropical medicine on the periphery of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Power, "The Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine: Institutionalizing Medical Research in the Periphery," ''Medical History'' (1996) 40#2 pp 197-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8183">An '''intention-to-treat''' ('''ITT''') '''analysis''' of the results of an [[experiment]] is based on the initial treatment assignment and not on the treatment eventually received. ITT analysis is intended to avoid various misleading artifacts that can arise in intervention research such as non-random [[Attrition (medicine, epidemiology)|attrition]] of participants from the study or [[crossover study|crossover]]. ITT is also simpler than other forms of study design and analysis because it does not require observation of [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] status for units assigned to different treatments or incorporation of compliance into the analysis. Although ITT analysis is widely employed in published clinical trials, it can be incorrectly described and there are some issues with its application.&lt;ref name="hollis"&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there is no consensus on how to carry out an ITT analysis in the presence of missing outcome data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0049163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
[[Randomized controlled trial|Randomized clinical trials]] analyzed by the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach provide unbiased comparisons among the treatment groups. Intention to treat analyses are done to avoid the effects of [[crossover study|crossover]] and [[Selection bias#Attrition|dropout]], which may break the [[random assignment]] to the treatment groups in a study. ITT analysis provides information about the potential effects of treatment policy rather than on the potential effects of specific treatment.

Since it started in the 1960s, the principle of ITT has become widely accepted for the analysis of controlled clinical trials.

===Example===
In an ITT population, none of the patients are excluded and the patients are analyzed according to the randomization scheme. In other words, for the purposes of ITT analysis, everyone who is randomized in the trial is considered to be part of the trial regardless of whether he or she is dosed or completes the trial.

For example, if people who have a more refractory or serious problem tend to drop out of a study at a higher rate, even a completely ineffective treatment may appear to be providing benefits if one merely compares the condition before and after the treatment for only those who finish the study (ignoring those who were enrolled originally, but have since been excluded or dropped out).

==Issues==
Medical investigators often have difficulties in completing ITT analysis because of clinical trial issues like missing data or poor treatment protocol adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cochrane-net.org/openlearning/html/mod14-4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110154948/http://www.cochrane-net.org/openlearning/html/mod14-4.htm |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address some of these issues, many clinical trials have excluded participants after the random assignment in their analysis, which is often referred to as ''modified intention-to-treat analysis'' or mITT. Trials employing mITT have been linked to industry sponsorship and conflicts of interest by the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing data===
{{main|Missing data}}
An important problem is the occurrence of missing data for participants in a clinical trial. This can happen when patients are [[lost to follow-up]] (for instance, by withdrawal due to adverse effects of the intervention) and no response is obtainable for these patients. However, full application of ITT analysis can only be performed where there is complete outcome data for all randomized subjects.

In order to include such participants in an analysis, outcome data could be imputed which involves making assumptions about the outcomes in the lost participants. Another approach would be ''efficacy subset analysis'' which selects the subset of the patients who received the treatment of interest—regardless of initial randomization—and who have not dropped out for any reason. This approach can introduce biases to the statistical analysis. It can also inflate the chance of [[Type I and type II errors|a false positive]]; this effect is greater the larger the trial.&lt;ref name="lachin"&gt;{{

|volume = 21

|pmid = 10822117
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adherence to protocol===
ITT analysis requires participants to be included even if they did not fully adhere to the protocol. Participants who strayed from the protocol (for instance, by not adhering to the prescribed intervention, or by being withdrawn from active treatment) should still be kept in the analysis. An extreme variation of this is the participants who receive the treatment from the group they were not allocated to, who should be kept in their original group for the analysis. This issue causes no problems provided that, as a systematic reviewer, you can extract the appropriate data from the trial reports. The rationale for this approach is that, in the first instance, we want to estimate the effects of allocating an intervention in practice, not the effects in the subgroup of the participants who adhere to it.

In comparison, in a [[Analysis of clinical trials#Per protocol|per-protocol analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/glossary/clinicalpractice/defDetails.do?uid=ncp_488 Per-protocol analysis] – [http://www.nature.com/glossary/clinicalpractice/ Glossary] of the [[Nature Clinical Practice]]&lt;/ref&gt; only patients who complete the entire clinical trial according to the protocol are counted towards the final results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/102214217.html Intent-to-treat versus on treatment analysis: how to interpret the results of a clinical trial?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Cannabinoid Research Society''' (ICRS) is a [[Learned society|professional society]] for scientific research in all fields of the [[cannabinoids]].

==History==
The ICRS was formally incorporated as a scientific research society in 1992. Prior to that, early ICRS Symposia were organized by various researchers in the field since 1970. Membership in the Society has risen from 50 original members in its first year to 650+ members from all over the world.

==Mission statement==
The International Cannabinoid Research Society is a:
*Non-political, non-religious organization dedicated to scientific research in all fields of the cannabinoids, ranging from biochemical, chemical and physiological studies of the endogenous cannabinoid system to studies of the abuse potential of recreational ''[[Cannabis]]''. 
*In addition to acting as a source for impartial information on ''Cannabis'' and the cannabinoids, the main role of the ICRS is to provide an open forum for researchers to meet and discuss their research.&lt;ref name= "Home"&gt;[http://www.cannabinoidsociety.org/], The International Cannabinoid Research Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mission of the ICRS is to:
#Foster cannabinoid research; 
#promote the exchange of scientific information and perspectives about ''Cannabis'', the cannabinoids and endocannabinoids through the organization of scientific meetings; 
#serve as a source of reliable information regarding the chemistry, pharmacology, therapeutic uses, toxicology and the behavioral, psychological, and social effects of ''Cannabis'' and its constituents, of synthetic and endogenous compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors, and of any compounds that target other components of the endocannabinoid system.

==Annual Symposia==
The Society holds an annual meeting, which generally alternates between [[North America]] and [[Europe]].

The '''International Health Partnership''' ('''IHP+''') is a group of partners committed to improving the health of citizens in developing countries. International organizations, bilateral agencies and country governments all sign the IHP+ Global Compact. They commit to putting the principles for [[aid effectiveness]] and development cooperation into practice in the health sector. IHP+ achieves results by mobilizing national governments, development agencies, civil society and others to support a single, country-led national health strategy. Partners aim to hold one another to account. This global initiative is administered by the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]].

Faster progress to achieve results requires governments, CSOs, the private sector and especially international development partners to take action. The most critical areas for action for development partners have become known as the "seven behaviours".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/news-events/article/seven-behaviours-how-development-partners-can-change-for-the-better-325359/&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.smartglobalhealth.org/blog/entry/leaders-re-focus-ihp-to-improve-health-aid-coordination Global health agency leaders] recently endorsed these seven behaviours, and have met five times in order to discuss obstacles to progress in these key seven areas. As of June 2014, Agencies have committed to action in one specific area: streamlining the measurement of results and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/news-events/ihp-news/article/global-health-agency-leaders-take-steps-towards-a-common-set-of-health-indicators-327655/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Principles of the IHP+ ==
Improving health and health services involves governments, health workers, civil society, parliamentarians and other stakeholders working together. In developing countries, money for health comes from both domestic and external resources. This means that governments must also work with a range of international development partners. These partners are increasing in number, use different funding streams and have diverse bureaucratic demands. As a result, development efforts can become fragmented and resources can be wasted.

In 2005, the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]] set out principles for making aid more effective. These principles include ownership, alignment, harmonization, mutual accountability and managing for results. In 2011, the Busan High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness signaled a shift in thinking from traditional aid effectiveness to a broader, more inclusive approach to development cooperation, a greater emphasis on considering domestic and external resources together, and on results.

IHP+ began in September 2007 in order to put these international principles into practice in the health sector and accelerate progress towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-09-06/britain-launches-global-healthcare-plan-for-poor/661550?section=world "Britain launches global healthcare plan for poor countries"], [[ABC News (Australia)]], September 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200709051541.htm "Brown launches global health plan"], [[Associated Press]] in ''[[The Hindu]]'', September 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Ramakant, [http://www.asiantribune.com/node/7329 "International Health Partnership to strengthen health systems"], ''[[Asian Tribune]]'', September 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has worked to encourage more inclusive national health planning and joint assessment (JANS) processes, more unified support to national plans through country compacts, one monitoring &amp; evaluation platform to track strategy implementation, greater mutual accountability, improved civil society engagement and financial management harmonization and alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== IHP+ Partners ==
IHP+ has partners from around the world including developing countries, civil society organizations (CSOs) and development partners. Originally, 26 signatories including 7 countries, 18 bilateral and multilateral partners, and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] signed the IHP+ [[Pact|Global Compact]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/CMS_files/documents/ihp_global_compact_EN.pdf PDF signed version from the Global Compact]&lt;/ref&gt; for achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals. The Global Compact is the initiative's foundational global document that is signed by all partner countries, international agencies and bilateral donors when they join the IHP+. The Compact sets out the goals and approach of IHP+ and contains collective and individual commitments by signatories to adhere to agreed aid effectiveness principles. Signatories agree to support country and government-led national health plans. Currently, there are 63 signatories to the Global Compact (as of June 2014).

[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/CSO/0,,contentMDK:20127718~menuPK:288622~pagePK:220503~piPK:220476~theSitePK:228717,00.html Civil Society Organizations] (CSOs) play an important role in IHP+ at both the country and global level. At the country level, civil society encompasses patient groups, health workers, medical or health unions and associations, faith-based organizations, [[non-governmental organization]]s, community-based organizations, academic institutions, media, advocacy groups, refugees, women, youth and other neglected or vulnerable groups. At the global level, civil society is included in IHP+ governance bodies. The IHP+ Steering Committee and Reference Group each include one northern and one southern civil society representative, who draw on a Civil Society Consultative Group of up to 12 civil society members, to discuss IHP+ related issues and activities. IHP+ thematic working groups also include civil society representation. IHP+ supports a small grants programme for southern CSOs called the [http://www.healthpolicyactionfund.org/ Health Policy Action Fund]. This is designed to strengthen the capacity of southern CSOs so that they can engage more meaningfully with national health policy processes.

In addition, IHP+ collaborates with related initiatives including Harmonization for Health in Africa (HHA); the Global Health Workforce Alliance (GHWA); H8;&lt;ref&gt;H8 stands for Health eight, an informal gathering of eight international agencies coming together to improve their effectiveness in providing health in Low and Middle Income Countries.Composed of the [[WHO]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNFPA]], [[UNAIDS]], [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]], [[GAVI Alliance]], [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], and the [[World Bank]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health Metrics Network]] (HMN); Providing for Health (P4H); and follow-up activities of the Commission for Information and Accountability for Women’s and Children’s Health (COIA).

==Key Issues==
IHP+ encourages inclusive ways of working, and governments, CSOs, private organizations, parliaments and international development partners all have a role to play in the process. IHP+ works in six key areas to change the way we work together in countries: 
* Inclusive health planning and joint assessment (JANS) processes.  [http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/key-issues/national-health-planning-jans/ JANS] is a shared, systematic approach to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a national health strategy.
* Country compacts. These are negotiated agreements in which governments and development partners make commitments on ways to support implementation of a national health strategy. Compacts include agreements on aid modalities, and management and monitoring arrangements.
* Harmonization with and alignment to country financial management systems. Joint Financial Management Assessments and Joint Fiduciary Arrangements are useful tools for strengthening &amp; aligning with government systems and reducing transaction costs. These also help to improve the use of scarce resources and increase transparency and accountability.
* Monitoring &amp; Evaluation. IHP+ supports the development of one common country platform to monitor and review the implementation of a national health strategy. 
* Mutual Accountability. Building stronger health systems means holding each other to account for decisions and actions. IHP+ encourages greater mutual accountability by monitoring progress on partners' commitments. The [http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/tools/ihpresults-survey-tool/ IHP+ results] monitors progress on commitments made, with indicators based on the [[Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness]].
* Civil society engagement. CSOs are crucial partners in countries and at the global level. They make important contributions to planning, implementing and monitoring national health strategies.

IHP+ also works to enable greater south-south knowledge exchange. Experience of working with multiple partners to deliver better results is growing. IHP+ is fostering more systematic approaches to learning with and across countries, through existing networks where possible.

'''Late life depression''' refers to a [[major depressive episode]] occurring for the first time in an older person (usually over 50 or 60 years of age). Concurrent medical problems and lower functional expectations of elderly patients often obscure the degree of impairment. Typically, elderly patients with depression do not report depressed mood, but instead present with less specific symptoms such as [[insomnia]], [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. Elderly persons sometimes dismiss less severe [[depression (mood)|depression]] as an acceptable response to life stress or a normal part of aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=George S.

==Symptoms==
To meet criteria for a major depressive episode, a patient must have five of these nine symptoms nearly every day for at least two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richard B. Birrer |author2=Satahta P. Vemuri | title=Depression in Later Life:A Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge | journal = American Family Physician | year = 2004 | volume = 69 | issue = 10 | pages=2375–2382 | pmid=15168957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Depressed or sad mood
# [[Anhedonia]] (loss of interest in pleasurable activities)
# Sleep disturbance (increased or decreased sleep)
# Appetite disturbance (increased or decreased appetite) typically with weight change
# Energy disturbance (increased or decreased energy/activity level), usually fatigue
# Poor [[memory]] or [[concentration (psychology)|concentration]]
# Feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or worthlessness
# [[Psychomotor retardation]] or [[psychomotor agitation|agitation]] (a change in mental and physical speed perceived by other people)
# Thoughts of wishing they were dead; [[suicidal ideation]] or [[suicide attempt]]s

==Causes==
The exact changes in [[brain chemistry]] and function that cause either late life or earlier onset depression are unknown. It is known, however, that brain changes can be triggered by the stresses of certain life events such as illness, childbirth, death of a loved one, life transitions (such as retirement), [[interpersonal conflict]]s, or [[social isolation]]. Risk factors for depression in elderly persons include a history of depression, [[chronic illness|chronic medical illness]], female sex, being single or divorced, [[brain disease]], [[alcohol abuse]], use of certain medications, and stressful life events.

==Treatments==
Treatment is effective in about 80% of identified cases, when treatment is provided. Effective management requires a [[biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial approach]], combining pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Therapy generally results in improved [[quality of life]], enhanced functional capacity, possible improvement in medical health status, increased [[longevity]], and lower health care costs. Improvement should be evident as early as two weeks after the start of therapy, but full therapeutic effects may require several months of treatment. [[Psychotherapy]] and medication are the two primary treatment approaches.Therapy for older patients should be continued for longer periods than are typically used in younger patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cathy J. Frazer |author2=Helen christensen |author3=Katheleen M. Griffiths | title=Effectiveness of treatments for depression in older people | journal = Medical Journal of Australia | year = 2005 | volume = 182 | issue = 12 | pages=627–632 | pmid=15963019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/gps.2335 |vauthors=Smith GS, Alexopoulos GS | title=Neuroimaging in geriatric psychiatry | journal = Int J Geriatr Psychiatry | year = 2009 | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages=783–7 | pmid=19593778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
Psychologic therapies are recommended for elderly patients with depression because of this group’s vulnerability to [[adverse effect]]s and high rates of medical problems and medication use. Psychotherapeutic approaches include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[supportive psychotherapy]], problem-solving therapy, and interpersonal therapy. The potential benefit of psychotherapy is not diminished by increasing age. Older adults often have better treatment compliance, lower dropout rates, and more positive responses to psychotherapy than younger patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/gps.1988 |vauthors=Alexopoulos GS, Raue PJ, Kanellopoulos D, Mackin S, Arean PA | title=Problem solving therapy for the depression-executive dysfunction syndrome of late life | journal = Int J Geriatr Psychiatry | year = 2008 | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages=782–8 | pmid=18213605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consultation with a [[Clinical Geropsychology|clinical geropsychologist]] is useful.

===Pharmacotherapy===
[[Pharmacotherapy]] for acute episodes of depression usually is effective and free of complications. Underuse or misuse of [[antidepressant]]s and prescribing inadequate dosages are the most common mistakes physicians make when treating elderly patients for depression. Only 10% to 40% of depressed elderly patients are given medication. Different types of antidepressants may by used such as TCAs ([[tricyclic antidepressant]]s), [[SSRI]]s, and [[MAOI]]s, but more studies are still needed about TCAs recommendations.&lt;ref name="AntiD 2001" /&gt;  Antidepressants, in general, may also work by playing a [[neuroprotective]] role in how they relieve anxiety and depression. It's thought that antidepressants may increase the effects of brain receptors that help nerve cells keep sensitivity to [[glutamate]] which is an organic compound of a nonessential amino acid. This increased support of [[nerve cell]]s lowers glutamate sensitivity, providing protection against the glutamate overwhelming and exciting key brain areas related to depression. Antidepressant medications are often the first treatment choice for adults with moderate or severe depression, sometimes along with psychotherapy. The most promising therapeutic effect is achieved when the treatment continues for at least six weeks.&lt;ref name="AntiD 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=K|last2=Mottram|first2=P|last3=Sivanranthan|first3=A|last4=Nightingale|first4=A|title=Antidepressant versus placebo for depressed elderly.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2001|issue=2|pages=CD000561|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000561|pmid=11405969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although antidepressants may not cure depression, they can lead to remission, which is the disappearance or nearly complete reduction of depression symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Taylor WD, Kuchibhatla M, Payne ME, Macfall JR, Sheline YI, Krishnan KR, Doraiswamy PM. | title=Frontal white matter anisotropy and antidepressant remission in late-life depression | journal = PLoS ONE | year = 2008 | volume = 3 | pmid=18813343 | issue = 9 | pages=24 | pmc=2533397 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003267 | editor1-last=García | editor1-first=Antonio Verdejo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.10.1830 |author1=Murphy GM Jr |author2=Kremer C |author3=Rodrigues HE |author4=Schatzberg AF. | title=Pharmacogenetics of antidepressant medication intolerance | journal = Am J Psychiatry | year = 2003 | volume = 160 | issue = 10 | pages=1830–5 | pmid=14514498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1182/blood-2002-07-2044 |vauthors=Serafeim A, etal | title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors directly signal for apoptosis in biopsy-like Burkitt lymphoma cells | journal = Blood | year = 2003 | volume = 101 | issue = 8 | pages=3212–3219 | pmid=12515726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

[[Major Depressive Disorder|Major depression]] is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by an all-encompassing low mood accompanied by low [[self-esteem]], and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. Nearly five million of the 31 million Americans who are 65 years or older are clinically depressed, and one million have major depression. Approximately 3% of healthy elderly persons living in the community have major depression. Recurrence may be as high as 40%. [[Suicide]] rates are nearly twice as high in depressed patients as in the general population. Major depression is more common in medically ill patients who are older than 70 years and hospitalized or institutionalized. Severe or chronic diseases associated with high rates of depression include [[stroke]] (30–60%), [[coronary heart disease]] (8–44%), [[cancer]] (1–40%), [[Parkinson's disease]] (40%), [[Alzheimer's disease]] (20–40%), and [[dementia]] (17–31%).&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association 2000a, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minor depressive disorder|Minor depression]] is a clinically significant depressive disorder that does not fulfill the duration criterion or the number of symptoms necessary for the diagnosis of major depression. Minor depression, which is more common than major depression in elderly patients, may follow a major depressive episode. It also can be a reaction to routine stressors in older populations. 15–50% of patients with minor depression develop major depression within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.4.637 |vauthors=Rapaport MH, Judd LL, Schettler PJ, Yonkers KA, Thase ME, Kupfer DJ, Frank E, Plewes JM, Tollefson GD, Rush AJ | title=A descriptive analysis of minor depression | journal = Am J Psychiatry | year = 2002 | volume = 159 | issue = 4 | pages=637–43 | pmid=11925303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Brain imaging ([[functional MRI|functional]]/structural [[MRI]]) may help direct the search for microscopic abnormalities in brain structure and function responsible for late life depression. Ultimately, imaging technologies may serve as tools for early diagnosis and subtyping of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0006-3223(96)00006-6 |vauthors=Soares JC, Mann JJ | title=The anatomy of mood disorders--review of structural neuroimaging studies |journal= Biol Psychiatry | year = 1997 | volume = 41 | issue =  1| pages=86–106 | pmid=8988799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''list of cuisines'''. A '''[[cuisine]]''' is specific set of [[cooking]] traditions and practices, often associated with a specific [[culture]] or region. Each cuisine involves [[Outline of food preparation|food preparation]] in a particular style, of [[food]] and [[drink]] of particular types, to produce individually consumed items or distinct meals. A cuisine is frequently named after the region or place where it originated.  A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. [[Religion|Religious]] food laws can also exercise a strong influence on such culinary practices.

== Cuisines by region ==
* [[Global cuisine]] &amp;ndash; a cuisine that is practiced around the world. A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cuisine Cuisine (definition)]. Thefreedictionary.com. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; often associated with a specific region, country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cuisine?q=cuisine | title=Cuisine (definition) | publisher=Oxford Dictionaries | accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or culture. To become a global cuisine, a local, regional or national cuisine must spread around the world with its food served worldwide.
* [[Regional cuisine]] &amp;ndash; based upon national, state or local regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/region "Region."] (Definition). [http://www.merriam-webster.com Merriam-Webster dictionary]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional cuisines may vary based upon [[food]] availability and trade, varying [[climate]]s, [[cooking]] traditions and practices, and [[culture|cultural]] differences.&lt;ref name="cuisine"&gt;[http://www.eldrbarry.net/hatr/eldrcuis.htm "The American Food Revolutions: Cuisines in America."] [http://www.eldrbarry.net Eldrbarry.net]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One noteworthy definition is based upon ''traditional cuisine'': "A traditional cuisine is a coherent tradition of food preparation that rises from the daily lives and kitchens of a people over an extended period in a specific region of a country, or a specific country, and which, when localized, has notable distinctions from the cuisine of the country as a whole."&lt;ref name="cuisine"/&gt;

'''Little Miss Nobody''' is the name posthumously given to a young girl whose body was found in [[Congress, Arizona|Congress]], [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]], [[Arizona]] on July 31, 1960. Her body is estimated to have been discovered between one and two weeks of the date of her death.

Due to the advanced state of [[decomposition]] of the child's remains, the specific [[cause of death|cause of her death]] has never been established, although it has always been considered to be a [[homicide]]. Furthermore, despite extensive local and national efforts to discover the identity of this child, her identity remains [[unidentified decedent|unknown]], and the case remains unsolved.

This unidentified decedent became known as "Little Miss Nobody" after no family or friends came forward to either report her [[missing person|missing]], or to claim her body. Following recent advances in technology, a [[forensic facial reconstruction]] of ''Little Miss Nobody'' was released to the media in 2018 in renewed efforts to identify this unidentified [[child murder]] victim's remains.

==Discovery and examination==
The partially buried body&lt;ref name=trying/&gt; of a female child was found in Sand Wash Creek Bed on Old Alamo Road in [[Congress, Arizona]] on July 31, 1960.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|title=Unidentified Girl Buried|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=The Free-Lance Star|date=August 11, 1960|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=9fRKRCJz75UC&amp;dat=19600811&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was discovered by a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] schoolteacher named Russell Allen, who had been searching for rocks to decorate his garden,&lt;ref name=network/&gt;&lt;ref name=found/&gt; and was found buried in a sitting position, with her arms stretched outwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baby Doe Missed Her Chance at Life but Regained Name |date=November 10, 1996 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-10/news/mn-63244_1_baby-jane-doe |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators at the scene observed that the individual or individuals responsible for the child's burial had possibly made two separate attempts to dig an alternate grave for her body. This was determined by two evident disturbances in the sand close to the actual burial site.&lt;ref name=found/&gt;

The body was clothed in white shorts and a checkered blouse with a distinctive chain pattern, along with a pair of adult rubber thong [[sandal]]s that had been cut to fit the child's feet and fastened with leather straps.&lt;ref name=namus&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 10741|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/10741|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=May 13, 2015|date=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=found&gt;{{cite news|title=Unidentified Body Found on Desert|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=Prescott Evening Courier|date= August 1, 1960|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=MNNNGtAgD4EC&amp;dat=19600801&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; The child's toes and fingernails had reportedly been painted a bright red color. Investigators also found an apparently bloodstained pocket knife near the body, but were unable to definitively determine whether this utensil held any relation to the crime scene.&lt;ref name=network/&gt;&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name=found/&gt;

The [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] who performed the autopsy determined that the body was that of a [[Caucasian race|white]] girl between the ages of 5- and 7-years old,&lt;ref name="trying"&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeHoff|first1=Faye|title=Trying to identify "Little Miss Nobody"|url=http://www.kvoa.com/story/37833294/trying-to-identify-little-miss-nobody|accessdate=31 March 2018|work=News 4 Tucson|agency=NBC|date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3 feet–6 inches to 4 feet–5 inches in height, and likely weighing 50 to 60 pounds (later examinations of the child's remains indicated she may have been as old as 9&lt;ref name=found/&gt; or as young as 2 at the time of her death). The child had been deceased for between one and two weeks prior to the discovery of her remains.&lt;ref name=network&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 1202UFAZ|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/1202ufaz.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=May 13, 2015|date=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hair color was brown, possibly having been tinted or dyed auburn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=9 Murder Victims Whose Names Remain a Mystery|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-lineup/9-murder-victims-whose-na_b_8031378.html|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=Huffington Post|date=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she had a full set of intact [[deciduous teeth|milk teeth]] described as being in a markedly good condition. (Although the actual race of the decedent has since been described as being indeterminable, the highest likelihood of her actual age at the time of her death has since been determined as being 3 to 6 years.&lt;ref name=buried&gt;{{cite news|title='Little Miss Nobody' Buried by Community|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=Rome News-Tribune|date=August 11, 1960|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&amp;dat=19600811&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who is 'Little Miss Nobody'?

The actual [[cause of death]] of the decedent was never determined by [[medical examiner]]s,&lt;ref name=buried/&gt;&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; although her death was officially declared to be a homicide.&lt;ref&gt;''Someone's Daughter: In Search of Justice for Jane Doe'' {{ISBN|978-1-589-79420-7}} p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the forensic pathologist was able to definitively state that she had not suffered any [[bone fracture]]s at the time of her death, or in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mendocino County Cold Case Identifications Made Nearly 37 Years Later |date=March 28, 2018 |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2018/03/28/little-miss-nobody-sheriffs-office-hopes-image-helps-solve-58-year-old-case/467973002/ |publisher=Arizona Central |accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the contemporary report pertaining to the child's autopsy indicates her remains were charred, presumably from her body having been set alight around the time of her death.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Jaime|title=Little Miss Nobody|url=http://blog.jaimegipe.com/2011/03/little-miss-nobody/|accessdate=December 27, 2015|date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the decedent had been in an advanced state of decomposition at the time of her discovery, creating an actual [[facial composite|composite drawing]] of the child's facial features was not possible.&lt;ref name=network/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEC/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Contemporary records retained at the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]] state the child's face had actually been in a "recognizable" state at the time of her discovery.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;}}

===Initial investigations===
With active assistance from the local media, private citizens, and (later) assistance from officials as eminent as individuals within the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the Yavapai County sheriff's office worked tirelessly in their efforts to discover the decedent's identity. An [[all-points bulletin]] was initially broadcast across all sheriff radio and [[teletype]] networks following the discovery of this child's body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clue to 'Little Miss Nobody' Still Sought |date=November 4, 1960 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19601104&amp;id=BhxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6557%2C19 |publisher=Prescott Evening Courier |accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Yavapai County Sheriff Jim Cramer, Deputy County Attorney George Ireland and other local law enforcement personnel would subsequently travel hundreds of miles in radius via both air and land in their efforts to discover her identity. Individuals previously convicted of various offenses involving young children would be subjected to prolonged interrogations, and the sheriff's office also received dozens of letters, telephone calls, and telegrams in response to their public appeals for information in their efforts to discover the child's identity. Furthermore, any possibility the decedent had been any known missing young girl was investigated, and discounted.{{refn|group=n|Investigators initially speculated that this decedent may have hailed from an [[Poverty|impoverished]] background, and/or have been the child of migrants, although all investigative lines of inquiry into these theories failed to bear fruition.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;}}

By August 1960, investigators began to suspect the remains may have been those of a four-year-old girl named Sharon Lee Gallegos, who had been abducted in [[New Mexico]] ten days before the discovery of the child's body. Despite the fact that the clothing the victim wore was inconsistent to that Gallegos was last seen wearing, they could not eliminate Gallegos as being the decedent due to this fact, as the clothing could have easily been changed in the intervening week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Officers Still Seek Clues {{not a typo|T}}o Identify Body of Girl: Missing Girl in N.M.

Initial speculation that the child may have been a member of a family of transients, also from New Mexico. Police also subjected one Lester Davidson and two of his four children to in excess of an hour of questioning. Davidson and his children had been known to have been hitchhiking near [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] in late July 1960. This questioning concluded that the family likely had no connection to either the unidentified child or Sharon Gallegos.

Following the verification of the Davidsons' [[alibi]]s, police sent the clothing, knife, and  footprints found with or near the child's body to an [[FBI]] laboratory to undergo further examination.&lt;ref name=footprints&gt;{{cite news |title=Footprints may lead to body ID |work=Prescott Evening Courier |date=August 5, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1961, a possibility arose that the decedent may have been one Debbie Dudley; a four-year-old girl missing from [[Virginia]]. Investigators had failed to find the bodies of Dudley and her remaining siblings after the body of her seven-year-old sister, Carol Ann, was found wrapped in a blanket on February 9, 1961, she having died due to a combination of the [[malnutrition]], [[Infant exposure|exposure]], and [[Child neglect|neglect]] she had endured from her parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Little Miss: She's 'God's Little Child'|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19610302&amp;id=L29QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gREEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3348,708824&amp;hl=en|accessdate=December 27, 2015|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=March 2, 1961|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie's remains were later found in [[Southern Virginia]].

On August 8, 1961, Sheriff Cramer led a party of law enforcement officers and a camera crew to film the location where the child's body had been found.&lt;ref name=screen/&gt; Later that afternoon, Sheriff Cramer and Yavapai County Attorney George Ireland presented evidence—including the adult-sized rubber sandals which had been purposely cut to fit the child's feet&lt;ref name=network/&gt;—to the media, with Sheriff Cramer stating: "Somewhere, there is someone who has the answer that we have been looking for; maybe this will be the thing that will bring that person forward." &lt;ref name=PEC/&gt; The footage of this scene and the interview with Sheriff Cramer was later broadcast on television in the hope fresh leads toward establishing the identity of the child would ensue, although the program brought no significant new information.&lt;ref name=screen/&gt;

Despite the numerous and extensive local and national efforts conducted to identify the decedent, all contemporary efforts to either identify the child, or trace any of her relatives, failed.&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt;

==Funeral==
The funeral of this unidentified child was conducted on August 10, 1960. She was laid to rest in Mountain View Cemetery, with the campaign for funds to provide a dignified burial—as opposed to anonymous interment inside a [[pauper's grave]]—being spearheaded by a local radio announcer named Dave Palladin,&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; who successfully initiated a fundraising and donations appeal to local businesses, funeral homes and residents to ensure the child received a respectful burial. Palladin referred to his primary motivation for this fundraising campaign as being that he found the thought of a "little girl buried in [[Boot Hill]]"&lt;ref name=milwaukee&gt;{{cite news|title="Little Miss Nobody" Buried as Somebody|accessdate=September 24, 2015|work=The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=March 2, 1961|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19610302&amp;id=L29QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gREEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2034,505900&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an insufferable one, adding of his insistence the child received a decent [[Christian burial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clue to 'Little Miss Nobody' Still Sought |date=November 4, 1960 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19601104&amp;id=BhxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6557,190483 |publisher=Prescott Evening Courier |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her funeral, the child had become colloquially known within and around Yavapai County as "Little Miss Nobody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 1960 Cold Case: 'Little Miss Nobody' |date=March 25, 2018 |url=https://www.prescottenews.com/index.php/news/current-news/item/31703-1960-cold-case-little-miss-nobody |publisher=Prescott News |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral service for Little Miss Nobody was conducted at the Congregational Church in [[Prescott, Arizona]], and was officiated by Dr. Charles Franklin Parker, with over 70 mourners in attendance.&lt;ref name=buried/&gt; At this service, a placard was placed upon Little Miss Nobody's pale blue casket, with the inscription reading: "God's little child, date of birth unknown, date of death unknown."&lt;ref name=buried/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEC/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Among the several messages of condolence for Little Miss Nobody placed among the floral arrangements around her casket, one anonymous writer had written a note stating: 'Forgive us, child, for the weakness of men and, in turn, when in your final home, pray for us.'&lt;ref&gt;''Someone's Daughter: In Search of Justice for Jane Doe'' {{ISBN|978-1-589-79420-7}} pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;}} Her headstone is inscribed with a section of a quote from [[Matthew the Apostle|St. Matthew]], which reads, "Blessed are the Pure in Heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Little Miss Nobody': Sheriff's Office Hopes Image Helps Solve 58-year-old Case |date=March 28, 2018 |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2018/03/28/little-miss-nobody-sheriffs-office-hopes-image-helps-solve-58-year-old-case/467973002/ |publisher=Arizona Central |accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29194">In many parts of the world, '''mandated reporters''' are people who have regular contact with vulnerable people such as [[children]], disabled persons, and [[senior citizen]]s, and are therefore legally required to ensure a report is made when abuse is observed or suspected. Specific details vary across jurisdictions—the abuse that must be reported may include [[neglect]], or [[financial abuse|financial]], [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or other types of [[abuse]]. Mandated reporters may include paid or unpaid people who have assumed full or intermittent responsibility for the care of a child, [[dependent adult]], or [[Senior citizen|elder]].

== History ==
In 1962, United States doctors [[C. Henry Kempe]] and [[Brandt Steele]] published "The Battered Child Syndrome,"&lt;ref&gt;C. Henry Kempe and Ray E. Helfer, editors: ''The Battered Child''. 1st edition, 1968. 2nd edition, Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1974. 3rd edition, 1980. 5th edition by M. E. Helfer, R. Kempe, and R. Krugman, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Kempe, Frederic N. Silverman, Brandt F. Steele, William Droegemuller, Henry K. Silver: "The Battered Child Syndrome." ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 1962, 181: 17-24. Tardieu's syndrome. Also called Caffey-Kempe syndrome.&lt;/ref&gt; which helped doctors identify child abuse, its effects, and the need to report serious physical abuse to legal authorities. Its publication changed the prevalent views in the United States, where child abuse was previously seen as uncommon, and not a regular issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-wolff/battered-child-syndrome_b_2406348.html|title = The Battered-Child Syndrome: 50 Years Later|date = 4 January 2013|accessdate = |website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Wolff|first = Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[US Congress|United States Congress]] passed the [[Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act]] (CAPTA), which provides funds to states for development of [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) and [[hotline]]s to prevent serious injuries to children. These laws and the media and advocacy coverage and research brought about a gradual change in societal expectations on reporting in the United States and, at different rates, in other western nations.&lt;ref name="Krason_Lit_Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255631799_THE_CRITICS_OF_CURRENT_CHILD_ABUSE_LAWS_AND_THE_CHILD_PROTECTIVE_SYSTEM_A_SURVEY_OF_THE_LEADING_LITERATURE|title = The Critics Of Current Child Abuse Laws And The Child Protective System: A Survey Of The Leading Literature|author = Krason, Stephen M.|publisher = The Catholic Social Science Review|year = 2007|page = 307,308,307–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/hjlpp8&amp;div=46&amp;id=&amp;page= | title = "Doing Something" About Child Abuse: The Need to Narrow the Grounds For State Intervention | author = Douglas J.

Originally created to respond to physical abuse, reporting systems in various countries began to expand to address sexual and emotional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic abuse. This expansion was accompanied by broader requirements for reporting abuse: previously reports were only submitted when an incident caused serious physical injury, but as the definitions changed, more minor physical injuries and developmental and psychological trauma began to be included as well.&lt;ref name="AIFS submission"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.385.2444&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title = Australian Institute of Family Studies Submission to the Special Commission of Inquiry into Child Protection Services in NSW|publisher = National Child Protection Clearinghouse|last = Bromfield|first = Leah|last2 = Holzer|first2 = Prue|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a huge increase of reporting over the decades with enormous numbers of unsubstantiated cases.&lt;ref name = "unfoundedallegations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MondaleAct"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.faithandreason.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mondale-Act-After-Forty-Years_-True.pdf |title= The Mondale Act and Its Aftermath: An Overview of Forty Years of American Law, Public Policy, and Governmental Response to Child Abuse and Neglect | author = Krason, Stephen M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2013 |pages =1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referrals increase each year, but the actual substantiated cases remain low and are approximately the same or decline each year.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt;
Media and commentators often take the number of referrals to be synonymous with the number of cases of actual child maltreatment, which makes the problem appear larger than it actually is.&lt;ref name="Child Sweden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalchild.org/guest/joan_durrant.html |title=Child Abuse in Sweden |author= Joan E.

== Statistics==
Nationwide, there was a 2348% increase in hotline calls from 150,000 in 1963 to 3.3 million in 2009.&lt;ref name="MondaleAct"/&gt; In 2011, there were 3.4 million calls.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 1996 to 2011" /&gt;
From 1992 to 2009 in the US, substantiated cases of sexual abuse declined 62%, physical abuse decreased 56% and neglect 10%. About 1% of the child population are substantiated victims of abuse.&lt;ref name="finkelhor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV203_Updated%20trends%202010%20FINAL_12-19-11.pdf |title=Updated Trends in Child Maltreatment, 2010 |last=Finkelhor  |first=David |author2=Lisa Jones |author3=Anne Shuttuch   |publisher=University of New Hampshire, Crimes Against Children Research Center |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, approximately 85% of hotline calls either do not warrant investigation or are not substantiated. Approximately 78% of all investigations are unsubstantiated and approximately 22% are substantiated, with around 9% where "alternative responses" are offered in some states, which have a focus on working with the family to address issues rather than confirming maltreatment.&lt;ref name="NCANDS 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archive.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm09/cm09.pdf |title= National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) 2009 Child Maltreatment Report |author= U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Youth and Families, Children’s Bureau | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and the Department for Children and Families (DCF) define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/CMP/CMP-Surveillance.htm|accessdate=20 October 2008|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |title=Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements|date=1 January 2008|author=Leeb, R.T.|author2=Paulozzi, L.J. |author3=Melanson, C. |author4=Simon, T.R. |author5= Arias, I. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four major categories of child abuse: [[child neglect|neglect]], [[physical abuse]], [[psychological abuse|psychological or emotional abuse]], and [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]]. [[Neglect]] may include [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]], denial of proper care and attention physically, emotionally, or morally, or living under conditions, circumstances or associations injurious to well-being.
Typically, minimum requirements for what must be reported include:
*  A description of how the reporter learned of the injuries or neglect and of any actions taken to assist
*  Information on previous injuries, assaults, neglect or [[financial abuses]] (if known)
*  The date, time, nature, and extent of the abuse or neglect (if known)
*  The date of the report
*  The perpetrator's name, address, and relationship to the (possible) victim (if known)
*  The reporter's name, agency, position, address, telephone number, and signature. 
Typically, reporters are encouraged to report their suspicions and not to investigate or wait for absolute proof, which can lead to further harm directed at the suspected victim, and allow for perpetrators to prepare their defence through intimidation. The investigation of the abuse is then left to professionals. 
Some jurisdictions allow clear protections for reports made in good faith, protecting the disclosure of the reporter's name.
Innocence should be presumed unless and until evidence establishing guilt is obtained and it must be remembered that only suspicions are being reported.&lt;ref name="welfareacademy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.welfareacademy.org/pubs/childwelfare/respondingto_94.pdf |title= Responding to Child Sexual Abuse: The Need for a Balanced Approach |author=Besharov, Douglas J, |journal=The Future of Children| volume = 4|number = 2| pages = 136, 135–155| date = Summer 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mandated professions ==
States frequently amend their laws, but as of November 2013, all States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have statutes identifying persons who are required to report suspected child maltreatment to an appropriate agency.&lt;ref name="us"/&gt;

Approximately 48 States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands designate professions whose members are mandated by law to report child maltreatment. Mandated professions may include, but are not limited to the following:&lt;ref name="us"&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information (NAIC)|title=Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect|date=2003 | url =https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/manda.pdf | publisher = Child Welfare Information Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Child care providers
* [[Caregivers]]
* [[Clergy]], clergy-penitent privileged communication is exempt in most states.
* Counselors and other [[mental health]] professionals
* Medical examiners and coroners
* Health care providers
* [[Police]] and other law enforcement officers
* School [[teacher]]s, [[coach (sport)|coach]]es, guidance counselors, principals and other school personnel
* [[Social worker]]s
* Women's Health clinic practitioners (in some states)
* Film Developers (for child pornography purposes)

{{As of|November 2013}}, any person who suspects child abuse or neglect is required to report suspected abuse or neglect regardless of profession in 18 States and Puerto Rico. In all other States, territories, and the District of Columbia, any person is permitted to report. These voluntary reporters of abuse are often referred to as "permissive reporters."&lt;ref name="us"/&gt;

== Anonymity and immunity ==
Mandated reporters are usually required to give their name when they make a report, but may request [[anonymity]] to protect their [[privacy]].  A mandated reporter who knowingly makes a false report will ordinarily have their identity disclosed to the appropriate law enforcement agency, and their identity may be disclosed to the alleged perpetrator of the reported abuse or neglect.

A mandated reporter may be subject to penalties, though immunity from civil or criminal liability is granted to reporters who report in good faith.  Immunity is also granted to reporters who, in good faith, have not reported.  However, failure to report suspected abuse or neglect could result in fines or other sanctions, such as participation in a training program.  Failure to act may result in even stiffer penalties, such as [[civil litigation]] or criminal prosecution with the prospect of potential imprisonment.

=== Clergy-penitent privilege and other exemptions ===
Conflicts between a mandated reporter's duties and some [[privileged communication]] statutes are common but, in general, [[attorney-client privilege]]s and clergy-penitent privileges are usually exempt from mandatory reporting. In some states in the US, Psychiatrist and PhD. psychologists are also exempt from mandatory reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=ORS 418.750|author= Oregon Revised Statutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Clergy-penitent privilege]]" is privileged communication that protects communication between a member of the clergy and a communicant, who shares information in confidence. When applied, neither the minister nor the "penitent" can be forced to testify in court, by deposition, or other legal proceedings, about the contents of the communication.&lt;ref name= "abanow.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.abanow.org/2006/12/answers-to-questions-about-the-attorney-client-privilege/  |title= Answers to Questions about the Attorney-Client Privilege| author=American Bar Association |journal=ABA Now| editor = American Bar Association| date = December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most US states provide the privilege, typically in rules of evidence or civil procedure, and the confidentiality privilege has also been extended to non-Catholic clergy and non-Sacramental counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/clergymandated.pdf | title = Clergy as Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect| author=Child Welfare Information Gateway | editor = Children’s Bureau | year = 2012 | pages = 1–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation of reports ==
Each year in the US approximately 2 million allegations are investigated, affecting 1 out of 16 families in the US with children under 18.&lt;ref name= "NCANDS 2009"/&gt; 
Law enforcement or public health agencies are responsible for immediately evaluating all reports of abuse. Referrals in most states are screened to determine which are investigated – many clearly do not constitute abuse or neglect, or provide insufficient information to conduct an investigation. Rates of screening vary considerably between states – some investigate all reports, others screen out between 5% to 78% in this manner.&lt;ref name = "urban institute"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.urban.org/publications/309534.html | title = The Decision to Investigate- Understanding State Child Welfare Screening Policies and Practices | publisher = Urban Institute | authors = Karen C. Tumlin, Rob Geen | date = May 1, 2000 |accessdate = 14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When reports contain sufficient information to warrant an investigation, authorities must make efforts within a reasonable time frame to begin (and conclude) an effective investigation, particularly when there is an imminent risk of physical harm or another emergency. Agencies should coordinate activities to minimize impacts upon the (possible) victim. In the US in 1985 the Children Advocacy Center model was founded, including "Multi-Discipline Teams" (law enforcement, child protection, prosecution, mental health) to interview, treat, manage and prosecute child abuse cases.&lt;ref name = "CAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.nationalchildrensalliance.org/|title= Home Page |author=National Children's Alliance|year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consent to interview(s) of the (possible) victim often must be obtained from guardians, unless there is reason to believe such person is the alleged perpetrator. In cases where serious abuse or neglect is substantiated, local law enforcement, prosecutors or other public offices must be notified, and a copy of the investigation report must be sent.

US school districts adopted policies, following the 9th Circuit's ruling in Greene v. Camreta, requiring police or state case workers to produce a warrant, court order, parental permission or exigent circumstances prior to interviewing a student on school grounds as part of a sexual abuse investigation.&lt;ref name= "osba.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.osba.org/News%20Center/Announcements/2011-05-27_Camreta%20Summary.aspx |title= Greene v. Camreta summary |author= Oregon School Board Association | date = May 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Substantiation by maltreatment type===
Total U.S. maltreatment substantiation annual rate is less than 1% of U.S. child population (9.3 per 1000 non-duplicates).&lt;ref name = "2009 NCANDS page ix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm09/cm09.pdf |title= National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) 2009 Child Maltreatment Report |author= U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Youth and Families, Children's Bureau | date = 2010 | page = ix }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of those:
* Neglect is 78.3% 
* Physical Abuse is 17.8% 
* Sexual Abuse  is 9.5% 
* Psychological Maltreatment  is 7.6%&lt;ref name="2009 NCANDS page ix"/&gt;
The % of US children affected annually by substantiated neglect, physical and sexual abuse: 
* Neglect – less than ¾ of 1% (74.7 per 10,000) 
* Physical Abuse – less than 1/5th of 1% (16.2 per 10,000)
*Sexual Abuse – less than 1/10th of 1% (8.6 per 10,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV203_Updated%20trends%202010%20FINAL_12-19-11.pdf |title=Updated Trends in Child Maltreatment, 2010 |last=Finkelhor  |first=David |author2=Lisa Jones |author3=Anne Shuttuch  |publisher=University of New Hampshire, Crimes Against Children Research Center |accessdate=19 December 2011|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeals/expunction===
An attempt to appeal a decision is administrative, involving a review within the CPS agency, by CPS staff.&lt;ref name = "interim report"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/09/childabuseregistryinterimreport/report.pdf/  |title= Interim Report to the Congress on the Feasibility of a National Child Abuse Registry | author = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|  date = 2009 | pages = 1–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAPTA requires that states have procedures for expunging records.  Procedures for doing so vary and may not be adhered.  Ten states do not have provisions.&lt;ref name = "central registries"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/registry.cfm/ |title= Review and Expunction of Central Registries and Reporting Records: Summary of State Laws | author = Child Welfare Information Gateway| editor = Children's Bureau | year = 2011 | pages = 1–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas, a CAPTA compliant state and a leader in addressing problems with the Child Maltreatment Registry has laws and procedures to remove one's name from the Central Abuse Registry after one year. (see Arkansas Department of Human Services Policy and Procedure Manual).&lt;ref name = "Arkansas registry removal"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Arkansas Department of Human Services, Division of Children and Family Services, Policy and Procedure Manual: Child Maltreatment Central Registry |author = Arkansas Department of Human Services, Division of Children and Family Services| publisher = Arkansas Department of Human Services, Division of Children and Family Services | date = 2013 | pages = 293–328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Child removals as a result of mandatory reporting==
CPS can take a child into protective custody with assistance from the police. Each day in the US approximately 700 children are removed from their parents to protect them from alleged abuse or neglect.&lt;ref name = "paul chill"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://lsr.nellco.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=uconn_wps|title= Burden Of Proof Begone: The Pernicious Effect Of Emergency Removal In Child Protective Proceedings |author= Paul Chill | date = 2003 | pages = 1–43 |website=[[Social Science Research Network]]|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, one US child every 5 minutes (approximately 100,000 children) was removed from their family who was later determined not to be maltreated.&lt;ref name = "paul chill"/&gt;

Due to the human impact of removal, the law in the US requires it to be used sparingly. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides a fundamental right to family integrity, requiring the state to provide notice and a hearing before forcibly separating a parent and child- with the exception of occasions when a child’s life or health is in danger. Most removals are done on an emergency basis, bypassing the courts but requiring a post removal hearing.&lt;ref name = "paul chill"/&gt;

== Consequences/effects of investigations on children and their families ==
Critics of investigations into reports of child abuse state that
* A child may be wrongfully removed. 
* Long, repeated interrogations and physical examinations can leave emotional scars. 
* Even if not removed, there may be ongoing fear, distrust and insecurity. 
* Long term foster care can leave lasting psychological scars and do irreparable damage to the parent/child bond. 
* An accusation of wrongdoing may disrupt a family even if allegations are dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ipt-forensics.com/journal/volume3/j3_2_5.htm| title = The Dynamic of Shame in Interactions Between Child Protective Services and Families Falsely Accused of Child Abuse|author1=Sabrina Luza  |author2=Enrique Ortiz  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = IPT | volume = 3 | year =1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, threats and an assumption of guilt over innocence lead to feelings of powerlessness, inadequacy, depression, denial of due process and liberties, reputations tarnished and privacy invaded, and legal consequences if assumed guilty.&lt;ref name="paul chill"/&gt;
* There may be economic harm due to the need to obtain legal representation to defend one’s self and comply with the requirements demanded of them. Often, names are listed on CPS Central Registries/databases (different from [[Sex offender registry|Sex Abuse Registries]]) for decades, used for employment and licensing background checks.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Frequently an accusation triggers placement of a person's name on the registry without being charged or convicted of a crime, resulting in a registry with "false-positives" entangled with wrongdoers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There is a 1.2–12.3% recidivism rate (repeat substantiations within 6 months of initial substantiations).&lt;ref name= "Report Congress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cwo07-10/cwo07-10.pdf|title= Child Welfare Outcomes 2007-2010, Report to Congress|author=US Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Children’s Bureau| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training==
Training is typically offered wherever mandated reporting laws are enforced, entailing matters such as recognition of abuse and neglect, what must be reported, how to report it, anonymity, immunity and penalties.

Training programs often use educational materials that use pat phrases and ambiguous indicators: e.g. defining emotional abuse to include the failure to provide a child with "adequate love" or reporting children who are withdrawn or shy as well as children who are friendly to strangers, despite the fact that only a small minority of children who exhibit such behaviors have been abused.&lt;ref name = "unfoundedallegations"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.welfareacademy.org/pubs/childwelfare/unfoundedallegations_86.pdf |title= Unfounded allegations- a new child abuse problem |author=Besharov, Douglas J, |journal=The Public Interest| number = 83| pages = 18–33| date = Spring 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "welfareacademy.org"/&gt;

Training is available through a variety of sources. Many local child protective service organizations conduct classroom training. Training is also available through video and web-based courses.

== Criticism ==
Critics state that mandatory reporting may make the public more vigilant or overload the child welfare system which may increase tax dollars and needlessly separate children from their parents.&lt;ref name = oregonlive&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.oregonlive.com/today/index.ssf/2012/06/jerry_sandusky_sex_abuse_case.html | title = Jerry Sandusky sex abuse case has states re-examining mandatory reporter laws | author = The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predicted that expanding the list of mandated reporters or creating tougher penalties for failure to report will increase the number of unfounded reports.&lt;ref name= dcbar&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/resources/publications/washington_lawyer/june_2012/childabuse.cfm | title = Beyond the Penn State Scandal: Child Abuse Reporting Laws | author = Anna Stolley Persky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory reporting is also criticized because it jeopardizes the ability of people, including abused people, to seek medical treatment or maintain a therapeutic relationship, for fear of being reported. It has also been criticized for disproportionately affecting [[African American|African-American]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mandated Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect: A Practical Guide for Social Workers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FHiBniv8-GEC|publisher = Springer Publishing Company| date = 2008-12-02|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9780826117823|first = Dr Kenneth Lau|last = LCSW|first2 = Ms Kathryn Krase JD|last2 = LCSW|first3 = Mr Richard H. Morse|last3 = LMSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also state that much that is now defined as child abuse and neglect (due to vague and broad laws) does not merit governmental interference.&lt;ref name=Orr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heartland.org/sites/all/modules/custom/heartland_migration/files/pdfs/6882.pdf |title=Policy Study 262 Child Protection at the Crossroads: Child Abuse, Child Protection and Recommendations for Reform |author=Orr, Susan |date=1 October 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524064542/http://heartland.org/sites/all/modules/custom/heartland_migration/files/pdfs/6882.pdf |archivedate=24 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsubstantiated rates are enormous and go beyond anything reasonably needed and should concern everyone.&lt;ref name= "welfareacademy.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Besharov"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=51&amp;articleid=271 |title=Protecting Children from Abuse and Neglect |journal = The Future of Children |publisher = Princeton Brookings | volume = 8 | number = 1 |author=Douglas Besharov | date=Spring 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions about child abuse and sensational media coverage has led to an overreaction by some professionals and citizens, who report many cases that do not amount to child abuse.&lt;ref name= "welfareacademy.org"/&gt; Eagerness to protect children cannot be allowed to overcome commitment to fairness and due process.&lt;ref name= "welfareacademy.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Besharov"/&gt;

A further criticism is that mandatory reporting laws have had unintended consequences. Individuals, including juveniles, who have never been convicted of anything may be placed on child abuse registries for decades, limiting educational and employment opportunities due to background checks. Unnecessary reporting by professionals (under threat of prosecution) discourages fellow citizens from taking positive neighborhood action with families in trouble, as they may consider that their responsibilities have been met when they call in an anonymous hotline.&lt;ref name=Orr/&gt;

Better publicized and widely known use of statistics may have important implications for public policy.&lt;ref name="finkelhor"/&gt; This would reduce hysteria about child abuse, which would lower rhetoric and high rates of unfounded reporting. This would reduce the burden on child protection agencies and would be fairer to the children and parents involved.&lt;ref name= "welfareacademy.org"/&gt;

'''Max Guevara''' (X5-452) is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[cyberpunk]] [[science fiction]] television program ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]''. During both seasons of the series, Max was portrayed by [[Jessica Alba]]; [[Geneva Locke]] played the character during [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to her childhood. Over one thousand actresses were considered for the part of Max before Alba was given the role. Max also appears in three [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] novels based on the series as well as an [[Apocrypha (fiction)|apocryphal]] [[Dark Angel (video game)|video game adaptation]]. Created by [[James Cameron]] and [[Charles H. Eglee]], Max followed a long line of strong female characters created by Cameron, including [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] and [[Ellen Ripley]].

Max is a [[genetic engineering|genetically enhanced]] [[transgenics|transgenic]] supersoldier, created in a secret government lab known as Manticore. Along with 11 other children, Max escapes from the facility when she is 9 years old. Max attempts to live a normal life while eluding recapture by Manticore. She also searches for other escaped transgenics with the help of [[Logan Cale]], a cyber-journalist also known as "Eyes Only". The character received mostly positive reception from critics, and Alba won several awards for her portrayal of Max. In 2004, Max was ranked at No. 17 in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the "25 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends."

==Creation and appearances==
Following his success with the film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', director [[James Cameron]] teamed up with [[Charles H. Eglee]]. The two formed a production company, Cameron/Eglee Productions, and began working on ideas for a television series, eventually deciding on the idea of ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]''. Cameron said they began with the idea that Max would be a genetic construct who appeared normal but was different on a genetic level, saying "We explored what that could mean. Do her eyes look different? Were there things that manifest themselves? Were there negatives to it? We wanted her to have flaws, things that were built in{{dash}}like [[Kryptonite]]."{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=57}} Max followed a long line of strong female characters in films directed Cameron, including [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] and [[Ellen Ripley]]. Cameron believes such characters are well received all round as women respond favourably to strong female characters and male audiences "want to see girls kick ass".&lt;ref name=jay&gt;{{cite news |last=Bobbin |first=Jay |date=September 29, 2000 |title=James Cameron's "Dark Angel" fights the future in new Fox series |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dP9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Bo4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4288%2C3054832 |newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]] |access-date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than one thousand young actresses were considered for the part of Max before [[Jessica Alba]] was chosen;&lt;ref name=jay/&gt; Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when it had been narrowed down to 20 or 30 applicants. Cameron said he was not overly impressed with Alba's acting skill or appearance in her audition tape, though he kept coming back and watching it as there was something about her attitude that he liked, eventually deciding he needed to see her in person.{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=57{{dash}}58}} Alba was hired for the role before the scripts were written. Eglee said "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." In order to train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.&lt;ref name=storm&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626111712/http://articles.philly.com/2000-10-01/entertainment/25585350_1_charles-eglee-dark-angel-dodges-bullets |archivedate=June 26, 2015 |url=http://articles.philly.com/2000-10-01/entertainment/25585350_1_charles-eglee-dark-angel-dodges-bullets |title=Actress Lights Up Screen In Fox's 'Dark Angel' |last=Storm |first=Jonathon |date=October 1, 2000 |publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]] |access-date=June 23, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max is the lead character in both seasons of the TV series ''Dark Angel'', where she is portrayed primarily by Alba but also by [[Geneva Locke]] as a child in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. She appears in three original [[novels]] based on the series,{{sfn|Muir|2008|page=246}} two of which pick up directly where the series ended{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=61}} and one that serves as a prequel novel, filling in the time between Max's escape from Manticore and the beginning of the first season. Max is also the [[playable character]] in the video game adaptation, ''[[Dark Angel (video game)|Dark Angel]]'', where she is voiced by Alba.&lt;ref name=spell&gt;{{cite web |author=Miss Spell |date=December 30, 2002 |url=http://www.gamepro.com/sony/ps2/games/reviews/27587.shtml |title=Dark Angel for PS2 on GamePro.com |publisher=''[[GamePro]]'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212120522/http://www.gamepro.com/sony/ps2/games/reviews/27587.shtml |archivedate=February 12, 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
Max was genetically engineered and carried to term by a woman who was not permitted to meet her.{{sfn|Terrace|2002|page=61}} She was created for a secret government [[supersoldier]] program called Manticore, then located in [[Gillette, Wyoming]].{{sfn|Terrace|2002|page=58}}{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=56}} As with almost all Manticore's soldiers, Max has a [[barcode]] on the nape of her neck, with her identifying number sequence (332960073452).

==Storyline==
In 2009 twelve of the X5s, including 9-year-old Max, escape from Manticore into a snowy forest. Max is found and given shelter by Hannah, a sympathetic Manticore nurse.{{sfn|Terrace|2002|page=58}} Several months later [[terrorist]]s detonate an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] weapon in [[Earth's atmosphere|the atmosphere]] over the US, destroying all electronic devices in the country and throwing it into chaos and poverty. In the prequel novel, ''Dark Angel: Before the Dawn'', after escaping Manticore, Max makes her way to [[Casper, Wyoming]], where she meets Lucy Barrett, a little girl who helps Max stow away in her mother's SUV. Later, after arriving in [[Los Angeles, California]], Lucy's mother, Joann, agrees to let Max live with them. Max and Lucy endure physical and emotional abuse from Lucy's alcoholic father, Jack. Max runs away from her foster home in 2013 and heads to Hollywood, where she joins the Chinese Clan, a group of thieves taking refuge in the remains of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]. In 2019, Max leaves Los Angeles to search for one of her Manticore siblings in Seattle, Washington. While stopping in [[Eureka, California]], Max meets "Original Cindy" McEachin when she comes to McEachin's aid in a bar fight,{{sfn|Collins|2002|pages=92–93}} and the two of them travel to Seattle together. In Seattle, the duo meet Kendra Maibaum, a young woman who offers Max a place to stay after Max defends her from her boss who was sexually harassing her.{{sfn|Collins|2002|pages=100–101}} McEachin and Maibaum feature as regular characters in the TV series.&lt;ref name=ellen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/53859-top-11-lesbianbi-sidekicks/2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922050201/http://www.afterellen.com/tv/53859-top-11-lesbianbi-sidekicks/2 |archivedate=September 22, 2016 |title=Top 11 Lesbian/Bi Sidekicks |last=Hogan |first=Heather |date=July 9, 2009 |work=[[After Ellen]] |access-date=July 16, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/general/dark-angels-jennifer-blanc-57158266/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094018/http://www.hollywood.com/general/dark-angels-jennifer-blanc-57158266/ |archivedate=March  4, 2016 |title="Dark Angel"'s Jennifer Blanc |date=May 21, 2001 |work=[[Hollywood.com]] |access-date=July 16, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV series begins with Max, now 19, living in a [[post-apocalyptic]] Seattle.{{sfn|Terrace|2002|page=58}} She lives in fear of Colonel Donald Lydecker, who had been assigned by Manticore to capture Max and the other escapees. Max holds a job as a [[bicycle messenger]] for the company "Jam Pony X{{dash}}Press", and also operates at night as a [[burglar]],{{sfn|Wright, Jr.|2010|page=163}} explaining, "I steal things in order to sell them for money. It's called commerce." Max is caught by Logan Cale, a vigilante cyber journalist who uses the alias "Eyes Only", while she is attempting to burglarize him. Cale notices and recognizes Max's barcode, and offers to help her locate her Manticore brothers and sisters if she agrees to team up with him. Max initially refuses, but changes her mind after Cale is rendered a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] after he attempts a mission without her assistance.{{sfn|Terrace|2002|page=59}} Max spends season one  "jugg[ling] 'Eyes Only' missions" while searching for fellow Manticore escapees.{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=59}} A complicated romantic interest develops between Max and Cale.{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=60}}

Near the end of the season, Lydecker is betrayed by his superior, Elizabeth Renfro, and subsequently defects from Manticore. He aids Max in an assault on the Manticore headquarters, though Max is badly wounded and captured. In season two Cale exposes Manticore to the world, and Renfro [[Arson|torches]] the facility in an attempt to cover up the evidence, though she is killed in the process. Max escapes the facility and frees hundreds of other super soldiers and failed Manticore experiments. Lydecker disappears under mysterious circumstances. [[National Security Agency]] agent Ames White, who is also a member of a secretive cult that wishes to eliminate transgenics, is tasked with recapturing the Manticore escapees. Both the authorities and cult members pursue Max, though she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding. When the police begin to surround Terminal City, Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run. The second and final season ends with the military surrounding and possibly preparing to invade Terminal City.

The novel ''Dark Angel: Skin Game'' picks up where season two ends. Reports of a transgenic serial killer in Seattle are exacerbating the stand-off at Terminal City. Max uncovers that the killer's psychosis was caused by him unwillingly being given a [[psychoactive drug]] by White. A truce develops between transgenics and the authorities after Max publicly reveals the information, and White goes into hiding. The final novel, ''Dark Angel: After the Dark'', picks up where the previous novel ends. Cale is kidnapped by the cult, who are trying to provoke Max into attacking them. Max eventually leads an assault on the cult's headquarters, which frees Cale and results in White's death and the compound being set on fire. As the headquarters burn Max finds Lydecker in a prison cell, and he promises to help her find her mother if she saves him, to which she agrees. The book ends with Cale and Max finally consummating their relationship.

==Reception==
Max has been cited as a [[feminism|feminist]] character and is considered a symbol of [[Women's empowerment|female empowerment]]. Writing for the [[University of Melbourne]], Bronwen Auty considered Max to be the "archetypal modern feminist hero – a young woman empowered to use her body actively to achieve goals", citing Max's refusal to use firearms and instead using martial arts and knowledge as weapons as contributing to this status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahcca.unimelb.edu.au/Superheroes/abstracts-full-A-E.html#auty |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050618113318/http://www.ahcca.unimelb.edu.au/Superheroes/abstracts-full-A-E.html |archivedate=June 18, 2005 |deadurl=yes |title=Dark Angel: Kicking Ass Without A Gun – Justification for Max Guevera as a Modern Feminist Superhero |last=Auty |first=Bronwen |work=[[University of Melbourne]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''Science Fiction Film &amp; Television'', Clarice Butkus noted Max has been considered a "distinctly millennial post-[[Third-wave feminism|third-wave feminist]] warrior",{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=182}} and considered Max's relationship and dialogue with Original Cindy, an [[African American]] lesbian, to convey [[Women's empowerment|female empowerment]]. For example Cindy encourages Max not to feel guilt over her sexual behaviour and instead to embrace a traditionally masculine approach to sex.{{sfn|Butkus|2012|page=194}} Writing in ''Reconstruction: Studies in Contemporary Culture'', Lorna Jowett also considered Max an example of female empowerment, saying she appeared to be the "usual postmodern, [[Postfeminism|postfeminist]] representation of the female action hero" who displayed mixtures and reversals of traditional gender traits.{{sfn|Jowett|2005}}

The character received mainly positive reviews from critics. In October 2000 [[Howard Rosenberg]] commented "If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping out the entire planet. It's actually quite moving. And she looks great on her bike."{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=59}} Hal Boedeker from the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' gave a positive review of Max, and compared her skills to those of [[Catwoman]], [[Xena]], [[Emma Peel]] and [[Wonder Woman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-10-03/lifestyle/0010030012_1_max-logan-cale-alba |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104504/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-10-03/lifestyle/0010030012_1_max-logan-cale-alba |archivedate=March  4, 2016 |title=Dazzling 'Dark Angel' |last=Boedecker |first=Hal |date=October 3, 2000 |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |access-date=October 11, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' commented favorably on Alba's physical skills portraying Max, though stated she had "an emotional range unusual among action babes." Conversely, [[Joyce Millman]] said "Cameron and Eglee give us very little incentive to care about Max as a person, the way we care about [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] or [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]. And that's because Max is little more than lips and ass and a premise reminiscent of other, better shows".{{sfn|Garcia|2012|page=59}} In December 2000 ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the [[Breakthrough role|breakthrough]] performances of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20133326,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092845/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C%2C20133326%2C00.html |archivedate=March  4, 2016 |title=Breakthroughs 2000 |date=December 25, 2000 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=July 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are normally present as [[glycan]]s: oligosaccharide chains linked to [[lipid]]s or to compatible [[amino acid]] side chains in [[protein]]s, by ''N''- or ''O''-[[glycoside|glygosidic bonds]]. N-linked oligosaccharides are always pentasaccharides attached to [[asparagine]] via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Voet | first1 = Donald | last2 = Voet | first2 = Judith | last3 = Pratt | first3 = Charlotte | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2013 | title = Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level | edition = 4th | location = Hoboken, NJ | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | isbn = 978-0470-54784-7 | page = }}.{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, [[O-linked glycosylation|O-linked]] oligosaccharides are generally attached to threonine or serine on the alcohol group of the side chain. Not all natural oligosaccharides occur as components of glycoproteins or glycolipids.  Some, such as the [[raffinose]] series, occur as storage or transport [[carbohydrates]] in plants.  Others, such as [[maltodextrin]]s or [[cellodextrins]], result from the microbial breakdown of larger [[polysaccharides]] such as [[starch]] or [[cellulose]].

==Glycosylation==
In biology, [[glycosylation]] is the process by which a carbohydrate is covalently attached to an organic molecule, creating structures such as glycoproteins and glycolipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | editor-first = Ajit | editor-last = Varki | name-list-format = vanc | edition = 2nd | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press | isbn = 978-0-87969-770-9 | page = }}.{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===N-linked Oligosaccharides===
[[File:N Linked Oligosh.png|thumb|An example of N-linked oligosaccharide, shown here with GlcNAc. X is any amino acid except proline.]]
N-linked glycosylation involves oligosaccharide attachment to [[asparagine]] via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; The process of N-linked glycosylation occurs cotranslationally, or concurrently while the proteins is being translated. Since it is added cotranslationally, it is believed that N-linked glycosylation helps determine the folding of polypeptides due to the hydrophilic nature of sugars. All N-linked Oligosaccharides are pentasaccharides: five monosaccharides long.

In [[N-linked glycosylation|N-glycosylation]] for eukaryotes, the oligosaccharide substrate is assembled right at the membrane of the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmatic reticulum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwarz F, Aebi M | title = Mechanisms and principles of N-linked protein glycosylation | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 576–82 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21978957 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2011.08.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[prokaryote]]s, this process occurs at the [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]]. In both cases, the acceptor substrate is an [[asparagine]] residue. The asparagine residue linked to an N-linked oligosaccharide usually occurs in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr,&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; where X can be any amino acid except for [[proline]], although it is rare to see Asp, Glu, Leu, or Trp in this position.

===O-linked Oligosaccharides===
[[File:Oolinked Oligosaccharide.png|thumb|An example of O-Linked oligosaccharide with β-Galactosyl-(1n3)-α-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-Ser/ Thr.]]
Oligosaccharides that participate in O-linked glycosylation are attached to [[threonine]] or [[serine]] on the [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl group]] of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; O-linked glycosylation occurs in the [[golgi apparatus]], where monosaccharide units are added to a complete polypeptide chain. Cell surface proteins and extracellular proteins are O-glycosylated.&lt;ref name="Peter-Katalinić_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peter-Katalinić J | title = Methods in enzymology: O-glycosylation of proteins | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 405 | issue = | pages = 139–71 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16413314 | doi = 10.1016/S0076-6879(05)05007-X | isbn = 978-0-12-182810-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycosylation sites in O-linked oligosaccharides are determined by the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary]] and [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structures]] of the polypeptide, which dictate where [[Glycosyltransferase|glycosyltransferases]] will add sugars.

==Glycosylated biomolecules==
Glycoproteins and glycolipids are by definition [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to carbohydrates. They are very abundant on the surface of the cell, and their interactions contribute to the overall stability of the cell.

===Glycoproteins===
[[Glycoprotein]]s have distinct Oligosaccharide structures which have significant effects on many of their properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goochee CF | title = Bioprocess factors affecting glycoprotein oligosaccharide structure | journal = Developments in Biological Standardization | volume = 76 | pages = 95–104 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1478360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; affecting critical functions such as [[antigenicity]], [[solubility]], and resistance to [[protease]]s. Glycoproteins are relevant as [[Cell surface receptor|cell-surface receptors]], cell-adhesion molecules, [[immunoglobulins]], and tumor antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elbein AD | title = The role of N-linked oligosaccharides in glycoprotein function | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 346–52 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1367760 | doi = 10.1016/0167-7799(91)90117-Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycolipids===
[[Glycolipid]]s are important for cell recognition, and are important for modulating the function of membrane proteins that act as receptors.&lt;ref name="Manna_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manna M, Róg T, Vattulainen I | title = The challenges of understanding glycolipid functions: An open outlook based on molecular simulations | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1841 | issue = 8 | pages = 1130–45 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24406903 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.12.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycolipids are lipid molecules bound to oligosaccharides, generally present in the [[lipid bilayer]]. Additionally, they can serve as receptors for cellular recognition and cell signaling.&lt;ref name="Manna_2014" /&gt; The head of the oligosaccharide serves as a binding partner in [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] activity. The binding mechanisms of receptors to the oligosaccharides depends on the composition of the oligosaccharides that are exposed or presented above the surface of the membrane. There is great diversity in the binding mechanisms of glycolipids, which is what makes them such an important target for pathogens as a site for interaction and entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fantini J | title = Interaction of proteins with lipid rafts through glycolipid-binding domains: biochemical background and potential therapeutic applications | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 14 | issue = 27 | pages = 2911–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18045136 | doi = 10.2174/092986707782360033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[chaperone (protein)|chaperone]] activity of glycolipids has been studied for its relevance to HIV infection.

==Functions==
===Cell Recognition===
All cells are coated in either glycoproteins or glycolipids, both of which help determine cell types.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; [[Lectin]]s, or proteins that bind carbohydrates, can recognize specific oligosaccharides and provide useful information for cell recognition based on oligosaccharide binding.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

An important example of oligosaccharide cell recognition is the role of glycolipids in determining [[blood type]]s. The various blood types are distinguished by the glycan modification present on the surface of blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kailemia MJ, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB, Amster IJ | title = Oligosaccharide analysis by mass spectrometry: a review of recent developments | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 196–212 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24313268 | pmc = 3924431 | doi = 10.1021/ac403969n }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be visualized using mass spectrometry. The oligosaccharides found on the A, B, and H [[antigen]] occur on the [[Non-reducing sugar|non-reducing]] ends of the oligosaccharide. The H antigen (which indicates an O blood type) serves as a precursor for the A and B antigen.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; Therefore, a person with A blood type will have the A antigen and H antigen present on the glycolipids of the red blood cell plasma membrane. A person with B blood type will have the B and H antigen present. A person with AB blood type will have A, B, and H antigens present. And finally, a person with O blood type will only have the H antigen present. This means all blood types have the H antigen, which explains why the O blood type is known as the "universal donor".{{fact|date=January 2018}}

===Cell Adhesion===
Many cells produce specific carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins, which mediate cell adhesion with oligosaccharides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0959-440X(93)90053-N |title=Oligosaccharides that mediate mammalian cell-cell adhesion |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=701–10 |year=1993 |last1=Feizi |first1=Ten | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Selectin]]s - a family of lectins - mediate certain cell-cell adhesion processes, including those of leukocytes to endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; In an immune response, endothelial cells can express certain selectins transiently in response to damage or injury to the cells. In response, a reciprocal selectin-oligosaccharide interaction will occur between the two molecules which allows the white blood cell to help eliminate the infection or damage. Protein-Carbohydrate bonding is often mediated by [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonding]] and [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals forces]].{{fact|date=January 2018}}

==Dietary oligosaccharides==
[[Fructooligosaccharide|Fructo-oligosaccharides]] (FOS), which are found in many vegetables, are short chains of [[fructose]] molecules. They differ from [[inulin]], which has a much higher [[degree of polymerization]] than FOS and is therefore a polysaccharide, but like inulin, they are considered soluble dietary fibre. [[Galactooligosaccharides]] (GOS), which also occur naturally, consist of short chains of [[galactose]] molecules. These compounds cannot be digested in the human small intestine, and instead pass through to the large intestine, where they promote the growth of ''[[Bifidobacterium|Bifidobacteria]]'', which are beneficial to gut health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.de/books?id=0oE5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58| title = The Gut Microbiome: Exploring the Connection between Microbes, Diet, and Health | last = Moise | first = Ana Maria R. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2017-10-31 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year=|isbn=978-1-4408-4265-8|location=|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mannan Oligosaccharide based nutritional supplements (MOS)|Mannan oligosaccharides]] (MOS) are widely used in [[compound feed|animal feed]] to improve gastrointestinal health. They are normally obtained from the yeast cell walls of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. Mannan oligosaccharides differ from other oligosaccharides in that they are not fermentable and their primary mode of actions include agglutination of type-1 fimbria pathogens and immunomodulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smiricky-Tjardes MR, Flickinger EA, Grieshop CM, Bauer LL, Murphy MR, Fahey GC | title = In vitro fermentation characteristics of selected oligosaccharides by swine fecal microflora | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 81 | issue = 10 | pages = 2505–14 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14552378 | doi = 10.2527/2003.81102505x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Oligosaccharides are a component of [[Dietary fiber|fibre]] from plant tissue. FOS and inulin are present in [[Jerusalem artichoke]], [[burdock]], [[chicory]], [[Leek (vegetable)|leek]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[asparagus]]. Inulin is a significant part of the daily diet of most of the world’s population. FOS can also be synthesized by enzymes of the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' acting on [[sucrose]]. GOS is naturally found in [[soybeans]] and can be synthesized from [[lactose]]. FOS, GOS, and inulin are also sold as nutritional supplements.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

'''OpenNotes''' is an international movement dedicated to making health care more open and transparent by encouraging doctors, nurses, therapists, and other health care professionals to share visit notes with patients, facilitating patients' legal right to access to their own [[medical record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://health.usnews.com/health-news/hospital-of-tomorrow/articles/2014/02/04/opennotes-helps-keep-patients-informed-and-engaged |title=OpenNotes Helps Keep Patients Informed and Engaged |first=Neil |last=Versel |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=Feb 4, 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients who have access to their full medical record, including their notes, report understanding their conditions better, feeling more in control of healthcare decisions, and being able to identify errors and inaccuracies in the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/health/policy/project-puts-records-in-the-patients-hands.html?_r=2&amp;ref=health |title=Project Puts Records in the Patients’ Hands |first=Roni Caryn |last=Rabin|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=Jan 9, 2012 |accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Co-founded by Tom Delbanco and Jan Walker of [[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Delbanco, MD|url=http://www.opennotes.org/about-opennotes/project-team/tom-delbanco/|website=OpenNotes|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Walker, RN, MBA|url=http://www.opennotes.org/about-opennotes/project-team/jan-walker-rn-mba/|website=OpenNotes|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OpenNotes began as a demonstration project involving 105 primary care doctors at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Geisinger Health in rural Pennsylvania, and Harborview Medical Center, a safety net hospital in Seattle. 20,000 patients were invited to read their notes on each health system's online patient portal.&lt;ref name="WalkerDarer2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Darer|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Elmore|first3=Joann G.|last4=Delbanco|first4=Tom|year=2014|title=The Road toward Fully Transparent Medical Records|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=1|pages=6–8|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1310132|issn=0028-4793|pmid=24304001|last1=Walker|first1=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwelmingly positive results of the study funded by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rwjf.org/en/grants/grantees/OpenNotes.html |title=OpenNotes - Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |author=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |work=rwjf.org |year=2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were published in 2012 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Researchers reported that at the year's end, 99% of patients surveyed wanted to continue accessing their notes, 85% said open notes helped them feel more in control of their care, 70% of patients taking medications reported better adherence, and 85% of patients said the availability of open notes would affect their future choice of doctor. Doctors reported little change to [[workflow]], and none chose to discontinue participation.&lt;ref name="WalkerDarer2014" /&gt;

In 2015 the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Peterson Center on Healthcare, and the Cambia Health Foundation joined the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and announced new funding to support innovation, research, and the goal of spreading OpenNotes nationwide.

==History==
In 1991 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report, “The Computer-Based Patient Record: An Essential Technology for Health Care.” The report made a strong case for electronic health records, saying they are essential to improving health care quality and safety.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1996. An important component of this complicated act was the establishment of [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/index.html/ national standards for Electronic Health Care] mandating that patients nationwide have the right to inspect, review, and receive copies of their medical records. This eliminated a critical barrier to access and eased the path toward open notes.

By the late 1990's health systems and technology companies had begun to develop and adopt secure online websites called patient portals, which allow patients to access some of the personal health information in their medical record. Using the portals, patients can read information such as medication lists and test results, and many can send secure email to their health care team.

The '''Order of Malta Ireland – Ambulance Corps''' is a [[Volunteering|voluntary]] [[ambulance]] and [[first aid]] [[organisation]] operating in [[Ireland]] in affiliation with the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], founded in 1938. Its purposes include teaching [[first aid]], providing ambulance cover at large events, medical aid, patient transport, and community and [[nursing]] services. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta has over 5,000 volunteers throughout the island of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110221213053/http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Government_Press_Office/Taoiseach's_Speeches_Archive_2006/General_Assembly_of_the_Order_of_Malta_Ambulance_Corps,_in_the_Regency_Hotel,_Drumcondra.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are located in Saint John House, 32 [[Clyde Road]], [[Ballsbridge]], [[Dublin]] [[Dublin 4|4]], Ireland.

==Senior members==
The national director of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps is Comdr. John Wright, KM. In common with all members of the Ambulance Corps, Wright is a volunteer.  He is assisted by two Deputy Directors, David Birchall KM and Brian Coote KM, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Diarmuid Murray, and a staff with responsibility for different areas of ambulance corps work.

The president of the Irish Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta is Richard Duc de Stacpoole, KM, who succeeded Sir Adrian FitzGerald, Bt., the Knight of Kerry, KM.

==History==
The first unit of the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps was founded in 1938, when [[Charles Conor O'Malley|Conor O'Malley]], a Galway doctor, was asked by Marquis McSweeney, the then chancellor of the Irish Association, to recruit members to form an ambulance corps, aimed initially for Connaught only.

Thirteen men were recruited by Professor O'Malley: six sixth year students from St. Josephs College "the Bish", Secondary School; four members from C.Y.M.S., Galway ; two Scout Masters; and one "lay" member. These thirteen members were the founding members of the ambulance corps in Galway.

The new recruits were enrolled on a series of First Aid lectures, given by Professor O'Malley in the X-Ray Department of the Central Hospital . The bandaging was taught by Theatre Sister Mary Shaughnessy. Examinations in First Aid were held in January
1938 and all were successful. In February 1938 First Aid services were requested for a National League match in Castlebar. The duties were allocated in alphabetical order meaning "Burke" and "Coogan" were first on duty.

The first Officer in Charge of the Galway Unit was Sgt. Timothy Murphy. A second unit was set up in 1939 in Kilkenny and since then the Ambulance Corps has grown in strength providing First Aid cover for many major sporting and cultural events and concerts.

==Modern Ambulance Corps==
The Ambulance Corps is a national organisation with 5,346&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orderofmalta.ie/fundraising-event.asp?id=28&amp;cid=516 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307204945/http://www.orderofmalta.ie/fundraising-event.asp?id=28&amp;cid=516 |archivedate=2010-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; members involved in 86 units across the Island of Ireland. For administration purposes, the country is divided into regions which are managed by regional directors. Each region consists of a number of units which deliver services at local level. The organisation operates over 165 ambulances,  mobile accident and emergency suites, support vehicles, medical bikes and command centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orderofmalta.ie/index.php/what-we-do/ambulance-corps/introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Order of Malta Ireland - Ambulance Corps Cadets.jpg|thumb|Cadets]]
The organisations headquarters are located in St John's House [[Clyde Road]], [[Ballsbridge]], [[Dublin]] 4. Within the building there are modern lecture halls for training and a command and control centre to coordinate vehicles and personnel in the event of major incidents.
[[File:Order of Malta Ireland Ambulance Corps.jpg|left|thumb|Ambulance Corps volunteers]]
Through their youth section, '''Order of Malta Cadets '''accommodates children aged 10–16 years. Cadets are trained in basic life saving skills: first aid, CPR and assisting with activities of daily living.  The organisation provides a full program of youth development and sporting activities for young people and encourages them to continue developing their citizenship skills. Additionally, cadets are involved in the community helping the elderly and disabled both locally and internationally.

[[File:Order of Malta Ireland - Ambulance Corps.jpg|thumb|Lourdes Pilgrimage]]
The ambulance corps coordinate a range of community care services including day care centres, community care centres and centres for older people.  They also provide essential respite for young disabled people at their purpose facilities in the Share Holiday Village.

The ambulance corps assist pilgrims to Knock, Croagh Patrick and Lourdes annually.

Order of Malta Ireland is a registered as a charity in the Republic of Ireland as Malta Charities, CHY4538. Malta Charities is accepted

as a charity in Northern Ireland by HMRC under reference XR40765.

Strategically, cyber defence refers to operations that are conducted in the cyber domain in support of mission objectives. To help understand the practical difference between cyber security and cyber defence, is to recognize that cyber defence requires a shift from network assurance (security) to mission assurance where cyber defence is fully integrated into operational planning across the Joint Functions. Cyber defence focuses on sensing, detecting, orienting, and engaging adversaries in order to assure mission success and to out-manoeuver that adversary. This shift from security to defence requires a strong emphasis on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and the integration of staff activities to include intelligence, operations, communications, and planning. Defensive cyber operations refer to activities on or through the global information infrastructure to help protect and institutions’ electronic information and information infrastructures as a matter of mission assurance. Does not normally involve the direct engagement with the adversary.

The distinction between cyber defence, active cyber defence, proactive cyber defence and offensive cyber operations has been influenced by doctrine, pragmatics of technology or tradecraft and legal thresholds.

Active cyber operations refers to activities on or through the global information infrastructure to degrade, disrupt, influence, respond to or interfere with the capabilities, intentions or activities of a foreign individual, state, organization or terrorist group as they relate to international affairs, defence or security.  Active cyber defence decisively engages the adversary and includes hunt and adversarial pursuit activities.

Proactive Cyber Defence means acting in anticipation to oppose an attack involving computers and networks.  It represents the thermocline between purely offensive and defensive action; interdicting and disrupting an attack or a threat’s preparation to attack, either pre-emptively or in self-defence. The mission of the pre-emptive proactive operations is to conduct aggressive interdiction and disruption activities against an adversary using: Psychological operations, Managed Information Dissemination, Precision Targeting, Information Warfare Operations and computer network exploitation and other active threat reduction measures. The proactive defense strategy is meant to improves information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents, provide strike options and to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battle space. A measure for detecting or obtaining information as to a cyber attack, or impending cyber operation or for determining the origin of an operation that involves launching a pre-emptive, preventive, or cyber counter-operation against the source. Proactive cyber defence operations pre-emptively engage the adversary

The offensive capacity includes the manipulation or disruption of networks and systems with the purpose of limiting or eliminating the adversary´s operational capability. This capability can be required to guarantee one´s freedom of action in the cyber domain. Cyber-attacks can be launched to repel an attack (active defence) or to support the operational action. The distinction between active cyber defence and offensive cyber operations (OCO) is that the later requires legislative exceptions or executive prerogative to undertake. Hence, offensive cyber capabilities may be developed in collaboration with industry, or facilitated by private sector but operations are led by nation states.  There are some exceptions, notably in self-defence or with judicial authority (civil warrants) or assisting law enforcement. 

CyberISR (Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance) focuses a powerful lens onto the Internet-of-Everything. The capability provides strategic listening, enhanced situational understanding, precision and mission-confidence though a keen awareness of both adversary dynamics and one’s attack surface, thus facilitating anticipatory threat reduction, accelerated evidence-based decision support, contextualization, targeting, the ability to mount an defence against. 

Cyber threat hunting is the process of proactively and iteratively searching through networks to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions.

Offensive, proactive cyber activities and active cyber defence facilitate anticipatory threat reduction while informing protection, detection and incident response given its ability to engage the adversary at distance and time.


An Active Defence: 

Has greater efficacy than reactive systems;

Drastically reduces the volume and severity of attacks leading to an order-of-magnitude fewer alerts, incidents, and costs. Thus, passing this savings to cyber security

Provides early warning and indicators to model zero-day signatures to incident response mechanisms and enumerate attack networks through cyber threat intelligence.

In not subject to scalability issues around performance and cost like reactive systems.

Uniquely has the capability to shape contested space. 


==History==

In the fifth century, B.C., [[Sun Tzu]] advocated foreknowledge (predictive analysis) as part of a winning strategy. He warned that planners must have a precise understanding of the active threat and not "remain ignorant of the enemy's condition". The thread of proactive defense is spun throughout his teachings.

Psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]] was likely the first to use of the term proactive in his 1946 book ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'' to distinguish the act of taking responsibility for one's own circumstances rather than attributing one's condition to external factors.

Later in 1982, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) used "proactive" as a contrary concept to "reactive" in [[Risk assessment|assessing risk]]. In the framework of risk management "proactive" meant taking initiative by acting rather than reacting to threat events. Conversely "reactive" measures respond to a stimulus or past events rather than predicting the event. Military science then and now considers defense as the science-art of thwarting an attack. Furthermore, doctrine poses that if a party attacks an enemy who is about to attack this could be called active-defense. Defense is also a [[euphemism]] for war but does not carry the negative connotation of an offensive war. Usage in this way has broadened the term to include most military issues including offensive, which is implicitly referred to as active-defense. Politically, the concept of national self-defense to counter a war of aggression refers to a defensive war involving pre-emptive offensive strikes and is one possible criterion in the 'Just War Theory'. Proactive defense has moved beyond theory. It has been put into practice in theatres of operation.

In 1989 [[Stephen Covey]]'s ''[[The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]]'', published by Free Press, transformed the meaning "to act before a situation becomes a source of confrontation or crisis". Since then, "proactive" has been placed in opposition to the words "reactive" or "passive".

==Origins==
Cyber is derived from "[[cybernetics]]", a word originally coined by a group of scientists led by [[Norbert Wiener]] and made popular by Wiener's book of 1948, ''Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine''. Cyberspace typically refers to the vast and growing logical domain composed of public and private networks; independently managed networks linked together through the lingua franca of the Internet, the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). The definition of Cyberspace has been extended to include all network-space which at some point, through some path, may have eventual access to the public internet. Under this definition, cyberspace becomes virtually every networked device in the world, which is not devoid of a network interface entirely. There is no air-gap anymore between networks.

The origins of cyber defense undoubtedly evolved from the original purpose of the Internet which was to harden military networks against the threat of a nuclear strike. Later cyber defense was coveted by the tenets of [[information warfare]] and information operations.

The rapid evolution of information warfare operations doctrine in the 1990s embraced a proactive preemptive cyber defense strategy.

==Current status==

"Information Warfare is an emergent reality that comes from a self-organization process that has never seen before. The problem is that we talk about it using terms that have well known connotations. And it is difficult to talk about something completely new using words that bring with them specific understanding and expectancies. The early period of the automobile faced a similar situation. At one time it was called a "horseless carriage" as this was the only way to define its essential quality. The car is more than a carriage without a horse. This is the dilemma we face when we discuss Information Warfare. The danger is that the uses of familiar words misrepresent and mask the true extend of the revolution that will have to take place if we are to be able to retain a military capacity in a new physical, social and cognitive space." - [[Robert Garigue|Dr. Robert Garigue]] in ''[http://fc0.co/all.net/books/iw/iwframe/index.html Information Warfare]'', 1994.

''The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace'' was published in February 2003 to outline an initial framework for both organizing and prioritizing efforts to secure the cyberspace. It highlighted the necessity for public private partnerships. Proactive threads include the call to deter malicious activity and prevent cyber attacks against America's critical infrastructures.

The notion of "proactive defense" has a rich history. The hype of "proactive cyber defence" reached its zenith around 1994. This period was marked by intense "hype" discussions under the auspices of Information Warfare. Much of the current doctrine related to proactive cyber defense was fully developed by 1995.  A number of programs were initiated then, and advanced to full operation by 2005 including those of hostile states. Meanwhile, the public discussions diminished until the most recent resurgence in proactive cyber defense 2004-2008. Now most of the discussions around proactive defence in the literature are much less "proactive" than the earlier discussions in 1994 or existing operational programs.  'Proactive' is often used to hype marketing of security products or programs, in much the same way that "extreme" or "quality" adjectives have been misused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proactive Cyber Defense|url=http://wn.com/proactive_cyber_defense?upload_time=all_time&amp;orderby=rating|publisher=Google Tech Talk|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hype-cycle of discussion reached its peak in 1994. Present-day proactive cyber defense strategy was conceived within the context of the rich discussion that preceded it, existing doctrine and real proactive cyber defense programs that have evolved globally over the past decade. Dr. Robert John Garigue, a computational epistemologist and father of information warfare in Canada, published Information Warfare, Developing a Conceptual Framework. This was a landmark document in 1994 and genesis for proactive cyber defensive theory in Canada.

Founding members of the interdepartmental committee on Information Warfare (Canada 1994), Dr. Robert Garigue and Dave McMahon wrote: Strategic listening, core intelligence and a proactive defence provide time and precision. Conversely, reacting in surprise is ineffective, costly and leaves few options. Strategic deterrence needs a credible offensive, proactive defence and information peacekeeping capability in which to project power and influence globally through Cyberspace in the defence of the nation. Similarly, Deterrence and diplomacy are required in the right dosage to dissuade purposeful interference with the national critical cyber infrastructures in influence in the democratic process by foreign states. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Warfare 2.0|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/information-warfare-20-dave-mcmahon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vulnerabilities Equities==

Intelligence agencies such as the [[NSA]] were criticized for buying up and stockpiling [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day vulnerabilities]], keeping them secret and developing mainly [[cyberweapon|offensive capabilities]] instead of defensive measures and helping patch vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|title=New leaks prove it: the NSA is putting us all at risk to be hacked|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/8/24/12615258/nsa-security-breach-hoard|publisher=Vox|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cisco confirms NSA-linked zeroday targeted its firewalls for years|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/cisco-confirms-nsa-linked-zeroday-targeted-its-firewalls-for-years/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=The Shadow Brokers Mess Is What Happens When the NSA Hoards Zero-Days|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/shadow-brokers-mess-happens-nsa-hoards-zero-days/|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump Likely to Retain Hacking Vulnerability Program|url=https://www.bna.com/trump-likely-retain-n73014448325/|publisher=Bloomberg BNA|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This criticism was widely reiterated and recognized after the May 2017 [[WannaCry ransomware attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/12/global-cyber-attack-ransomware-nsa-uk-nhs|title=Massive ransomware cyber-attack hits 74 countries around the world|first1=Julia Carrie|last1=Wong|first2=Olivia|last2=Solon|date=12 May 2017|access-date=12 May 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heintz|first1=Sylvia Hui, Allen G.

In a March 9 press release on the [[Vault 7]] documents [[WikiLeaks]] released 2 days earlier, [[Julian Assange]] states that much of the leak's remainder included unpatched vulnerabilities and that he was working with IT companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Google]] to get these vulnerabilities patched as he would not release information which would put the public at risk, and as fixes were released by manufacturers he would release details of vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=transc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steemit.com/wikileaks/@ausbitbank/wikileaks-vault-7-march-9th-press-conference-transcript|title=Wikileaks Vault 7 March 9th Press Conference [Full Transcript] — Steemit|date=10 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proactive pre-emptive operations===
"Effective cyber defenses ideally prevent an incident from taking place.  Any other approach is simply reactive. FedCIRC, the NIPC, the NSIRC, the Department of Defense and industry components realize that the best [action] is a pre-emptive and proactive approach." - Sallie McDonald, the Assistant Commissioner for the Office Of Information Assurance and Critical Infrastructure Protection, Federal Technology Service and [[General Services Administration]]; in offering testimony about the [[National Infrastructure Protection Center]] (NIPC) and the [[Federal Computer Incident Response Center]] or FedCIRC; before The Subcommittee on Terrorism Technology and Government Information Committee on Judiciary and the [[United States Senate]] on July 25, 2001.

The notion of a Proactive Pre-emptive Operations Group (P2OG) emerged from a report of the [[Defense Science Board]] (DSB), 2002 briefing. The briefing was reported by Dan Dupont in Inside the Pentagon on September 26, 2002, and was also discussed by William M. Arkin in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on October 27, 2002. The ''Los Angeles Times'' has subsequently quoted [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] revealing the creation of the "Proactive, Pre-emptive Operations Group". The mission of the P2OG is reportedly to conduct Aggressive, Proactive, Pre-emptive Operations to interdiction and disruption the threat using: Psychological operations, Managed Information Dissemination, Precision Targeting, Information Warfare Operations, and [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]]...  The proactive defense strategy is meant to improves information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents, provide strike options and to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battle space.  The P2OG has been recommended to be constituted of "one hundred 'highly specialized people with unique technical and intelligence skills such as information operations, [[Psychological warfare|PSYOPS]], network attack, covert activities, SIGINT, [[Human Intelligence|HUMINT]], SOF, influence warfare/deception operations and to report to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] with an annual budget of $100 million". The group would be overseen by the White House's deputy national security adviser and would carry out missions coordinated by the secretary of defense or the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director. "The proposal is the latest sign of a new assertiveness by the Defense Department in intelligence matters, and an indication that the cutting edge of intelligence reform is not to be found in Congress but behind closed doors in the Pentagon." - Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. DoD doctrinally would initiate a 'pre-emptive' attack on the basis of evidence that an enemy attack is imminent. Proactive measures, according to DoD are those actions taken directly against the preventive stage of an attack by the enemy.

'''The Public Health Act 1875''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/38-39/55/contents/enacted c 55]) is an Act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], one of the [[Public Health Acts]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[Short Titles Act 1896]], section 2(1) and Schedule 2&lt;/ref&gt; and a significant step in the advance of [[public health]] in Britain.

Its purpose was to codify previous measures aimed at combating filthy urban living conditions,&lt;ref&gt;E Halévy, ''Victorian Years'' (London 1961) p. 451&lt;/ref&gt; which caused various health threats, including the spread of many diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[typhus]].

==Background== 
Reformers had since the 1830s wanted to resolve sanitary problems in urban areas, because sewage was flowing down the street daily, including the presence of sewage in living quarters.  In 1848 their efforts led to the establishment of a three-man Board of Health – if one with very limited powers.&lt;ref&gt;E Halévy, ''Victorian Years'' (London 1961) p. 176 and p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;  Many factors delayed effective implementation of reform, however, such as the fact that to perform a cleanup would cost money, and neither government, factory owners, or local authorities were keen to pay.  Gradually, however, reformers helped to counteract the laissez-faire attitude of the government and public. In 1871, the Board of Health was subsumed into the [[Local Government Board]] by the Liberal Party; and when the Conservatives came to power in 1874, they were committed by [[Disraeli]] to extending social reform.  A public health Act was introduced in 1875. Home Secretary [[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|Richard Cross]] was responsible for drafting the legislation, and received much good will from trades union groups in the consequent years for "humanising the toil of the working man".   Disraeli ensured the passing of the 1875 Act; and when mocked by his opponents for neglecting more important political reforms, retorted on them with the resounding phrase ‘”sanitas sanitatum, omnia sanitas” [Health above Everything].&lt;ref&gt;E Halévy, ''Victorian Years'' (London 1961) p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of Act==
The Act provided local authorities with new powers:
# to purchase, repair or create sewers
# to control water-supplies
# to regulate cellars and lodging-houses
# to establish by-laws for controlling new streets and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;J N Tarn, ''Five Per Cent Philanthropy'' (1973) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid urbanisation that accompanied the Industrial Revolution, huge swathes of [[Terraced houses in the United Kingdom|terraced houses]] had been built to accommodate the factory workers. The contrast between [[Pre-regulation terraced houses in the United Kingdom|the housing stock built before the passage of the Act]] and [[Byelaw terraced house|that built after it]] was stark.
The Act required all new residential construction to include running water and an internal drainage system, and also led to the government prohibiting the construction of shoddy housing by building contractors.{{citeneeded|date=May 2018}}

The Act also meant that every public health authority had to have a medical officer and a sanitary inspector,&lt;ref&gt;M Walsh, ''Social Policy and Welfare'' (2000) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the laws on food, housing, water and hygiene were carried out; and that towns had to have pavements and [[street lighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/learning/bitesize/standard/history/1830_1930/public_health_rev3.shtml|title=History - Government and Public Health|work=BBC Bitesize|accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, however, important to realise that the new powers provided were permissive, not compulsory: they provided a model of best practice for municipalities, but actual implementation remained for the most part up to the individual local authority.&lt;ref&gt;J N Tarn, ''Five Per Cent Philanthropy'' (1973) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Punjab Healthcare Commission''' ([[reporting name]]: '''PHC''') is an autonomous health regulatory body that regulate the hospitals, clinics, laboratories and other health centres in [[Punjab, Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.phc.org.pk/rolesresponsibilites.aspx |title=WELCOME TO : Punjab Healthcare Commission |website=www.phc.org.pk |access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by the [[Government of Punjab, Pakistan|Government of the Punjab]] under the Punjab Healthcare Commission Act 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.phc.org.pk/downloads/PHC_Final_Act.pdf |title=PHC Final Act |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PHC is responsible for developing and enforcing Minimum Service Delivery Standards (MSDS) at all levels of healthcare, to improve the quality of healthcare services and foster a culture of Clinical Governance. All Healthcare Establishments are required to implement MSDS to acquire a License to deliver healthcare services in Punjab.

== Background ==
The progress towards achieving health goals for Punjab for its nearly 96 million people has remained uneven. Regulatory functions in the health sector have always been underdeveloped, poorly managed, and improperly implemented. In light of the increasing series of medical negligence, maladministration and malpractice cases in recent years, a need was felt for an autonomous authority at a provincial level to regulate healthcare services delivery in both Public and Private Healthcare Establishments.

The Punjab Government took notice of incidences of medical negligence and promulgated the PHC Act, 2010. The Punjab Healthcare Commission was set up to ensure quality healthcare service delivery at all levels and also to protect the well being of the patients.

== Mandate  ==
The PHC is mandated to regulate healthcare service delivery through the registration and licensing of HCEs, the development of Minimum Service Delivery Standards (MSDS) and the enforcement of these standards through inspections, the adjudication of complaints from both patients and healthcare service providers and deciding on cases involving illegal and unqualified practitioners.

== Core Functions ==
The Punjab Healthcare Commission aims to improve the quality, safety and efficiency of healthcare services and ban quackery in all its forms and manifestations.

=== Prescribing Standards ===
Practicing a distinct and internationally accepted approach, utilizing literature reviews and consultations with experts and stakeholders, the PHC has developed MSDS for a wide array of HCEs, ranging from multispecialty, tertiary care hospitals to previously unregulated disciplines of treatment, e.g. homeopathic clinics, matabs, etc.

=== Adjudicating Complaints ===
Designed to conform with high standards of fairness and equity, the PHC's responsive complaints management system ensures due diligence in investigating and deciding on cases of medical negligence, malpractice, administrative failure, harassment and damages to property. This includes a thorough consideration of all documentary evidence, cross-examination of parties and witnesses, field visits to inspect reported HCEs and expert opinion to warrant the course of treatment rendered.

=== Registration and Licensing ===
The PHC has formalized a process to license all legitimate HCEs demonstrating compliance with MSDS. Staff of HCEs registered and provisionally licensed with the Commission are trained on the MSDS and facilitated on their implementation through a pre-assessment, after which a formal inspection is conducted to assess MSDS compliance and thus, eligibility for the Regular License.

=== Banning Quackery ===
Operating under a pro-active Anti-Quackery Strategy, the PHC is running an organized, strategic and consolidated campaign against quackery. This involves mobilizing the general public and utilizing district administrations and its own enforcement team to undertake decisive, sustainable and synchronized action against quacks.

== Achievements ==

* First statutary body in the SAARC region
* to regulate healthcare service deliver
* Pioneered the development of standards for previously
* unregulated systems of treatment
* Introduced the concept of quality in healthcare service delivery
* Launched a strategic campaign against quackery

'''Skeletal fluorosis''' is a [[bone]] disease caused by excessive accumulation of [[fluoride]] in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints.

==Symptoms ==
Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluoride concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Ligaments and cartilage can become ossified.&lt;ref&gt;Kalia LV, Lee L, Kalia SK, Pirouzmand F, Rapoport MJ, Aviv RI, Mozeg D, Symons SP. Thoracic myelopathy from coincident fluorosis and epidural lipomatosis. [[Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences]]. 2010 March; 37(2):276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; Most patients suffering from skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluoride dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gönnewicht, Daniela |title=Untersuchung eines Zusammenhanges von Fluoridkonzentrationen in privaten Trinkwasserversorgungsanlagen und Kariesentwicklung im Raum Ascheberg (Südliches Münsterland/Westfalen) |year=2005 |work=Dissertation |publisher=Universität Münster, Fachbereich Medizinische Fakultät |url=http://miami.uni-muenster.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-2190/diss_goennewicht.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fluoride can also damage the [[parathyroid gland]]s, leading to hyperparathyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. As a result, bone flexibility decreases making the bone more susceptible to fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teotia SP, Teotia M |title=Secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with endemic skeletal fluorosis |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue=5854 |pages=637–40 |date=March 1973 |pmid=4692708 |pmc=1588649 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5854.637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Common causes of fluorosis include inhalation of fluoride dusts/fumes by workers in industry, consumption of fluoride from drinking water (levels of fluoride in excess of levels that are considered safe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/safety/nrc_report.htm |title=CDC – National Research Council (NRC) Report – Safety – Community Water Fluoridation – Oral Health |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and consumption of fluoride from drinking tea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=2013-03-21 | author = Naveen Kakumanu, M.D. | author2 = Sudhaker D. Rao, M.B., B.S. | last-author-amp = yes | title = Skeletal Fluorosis Due to Excessive Tea Drinking | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1200995 | doi=10.1056/NEJMicm1200995}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly [[Tea brick|brick tea]].  Skeletal fluorosis can be caused by [[cryolite]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, sodium hexafluoroaluminate), and the disease was first recognized among workers processing cryolite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hazmap.nlm.nih.gov/category-details?id=247&amp;table=tbldiseases Skeletal fluorosis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], most in nalgonda, telangana, the most common cause of fluorosis is fluoride-laden drinking water which is sourced as [[groundwater]] from [[water well|deep-bore wells]]. Over half of groundwater sources in India have fluoride above recommended levels.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reddy DR |title=Neurology of endemic skeletal fluorosis |journal=Neurol India |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=7–12 |year=2009 |pmid=19305069 |doi=10.4103/0028-3886.48793 |url=http://neurologyindia.com/article.asp?issn=0028-3886;year=2009;volume=57;issue=1;spage=7;epage=12;aulast=Reddy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluorosis can also occur as a result of volcanic activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/2590/1/D%27Alessandro_EnvTox06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 1783 eruption of the [[Laki]] volcano in Iceland is estimated to have killed about 22% of the Icelandic population, and 60% of livestock, as a result of fluorosis and sulfur dioxide gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/2013/06/local-and-global-impacts-1793-laki-eruption-iceland/ | title=Eruptions Local and Global Impacts of the 1783–84 Laki Eruption in Iceland | work=Wired | date=7 June 2013 | accessdate=3 November 2014 | author=Klemetti, Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1693 eruption of [[Hekla]] also led to fatalities of livestock under similar conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/vwdocs/volc_images/europe_west_asia/eruption_history.html Eruption History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The best way to view the [[mechanism of action]] by which fluorine breaks down bones and causes skeletal fluorosis is in a stepwise fashion.

# Fluoride enters the body by two paths: Ingestion or respiration. Both paths lead to corrosion of exposed tissue in high concentrations. Since the most likely form of fluoride to enter the body is [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF) gas, this is what starts the process. Exposed tissues will be utilized by HF in [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/labsafetymanual/cheminfo/flourine.htm |title=Fluorine |accessdate=2011-03-18 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# This will leave {{chem|F|−}} free to pass further into the body.
# It reacts with the concentrated HCl in the stomach to form the weak acid, HF.
# This compound is then absorbed by the [[gastro-intestinal tract]] and passes into the liver via the [[portal vein]]. Since elemental F is one of the strongest oxidizers currently known, the anion {{chem|F|−}} is immune to [[Drug metabolism|phase 1 metabolic reactions]], which are generally [[oxidation reaction]]s, in the liver. These reactions are the body’s first line of defense to [[Biotransformation|biotransform]] harmful compounds into something more [[hydrophilic]] and more easily excreted.
# The HF is now free to pass into the blood stream and be distributed to all tissues including bones.
# Bones are largely composed of Ca compounds, particularly carbonated [[hydroxyapatite]] ({{chem|Ca|5|(PO|4|)|3|(OH)}}); the reaction of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and HF forms an insoluble salt, {{chem|link=Calcium fluoride|CaF|2}}.
# This salt must be cleared by the body, which concomitantly leaches out some of the calcium that would be part of the bone matrix.
# This process results in increased [[density]], but decreased strength in bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitford GM |title=Intake and Metabolism of Fluoride |journal=Advances in Dental Research |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |year=1994 |pmid=7993560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whyte MP, Essmyer K, Gannon FH, Reinus WR |title=Skeletal fluorosis and instant tea |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=78–82 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15639213 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.07.046 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9343(04)00601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the amount in bone will decrease and be excreted via urine.  However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients.
Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing cannot be guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grandjean P, Thomsen G |title=Reversibility of skeletal fluorosis |journal=Br J Ind Med |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=456–61 |date=November 1983 |pmid=6626475 |pmc=1009220 |doi=10.1136/oem.40.4.456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
In some areas, skeletal fluorosis is endemic.  While fluorosis is most severe and widespread in the two largest countries – India and China – [[UNICEF]] estimates that "fluorosis is endemic in at least 25 countries across the globe. The total number of people affected is not known, but a conservative estimate would number in the tens of millions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/wes/index_wes_related.html |title=UNICEF – Water, environment and sanitation – Common water and sanitation-related diseases |accessdate=2007-09-17 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, 20 states have been identified as endemic areas, with an estimated 60 million people at risk and 6 million people disabled; about 600,000 might develop a neurological disorder as a consequence.&lt;ref name=Reddy/&gt;
==Effects on animals==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2499">'''Sonosalpingography''' ('''SSG'''), also known as '''Sion test''', is a diagnostic procedure primarily used for evaluating patency of [[fallopian tubes]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams gynecology | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071716727|pages=46–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Padubiri, Daftary|title=Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology, 15e|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier India|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788131225486|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was introduced as a screening procedure for [[infertility]] investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allahbadia|first=GN|author2=Nalawade, YV |author3=Patkar, VD |author4=Niyogi, GM |author5= Shah, PK |title=The Sion test.|journal=The Australian &amp; New Zealand journal of obstetrics &amp; gynaecology|date=Feb 1992|volume=32|issue=1|pages=67–70|pmid=1534011|doi=10.1111/j.1479-828x.1992.tb01904.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is becoming more popular among practitioners due to absence of side effects.&lt;ref name=shaw/&gt;

==Procedure==
Under [[ultrasound]] scanning, a slow and deliberate injection of about 200 ml [[Normal saline|physiologic saline]] into the uterine cavity is accomplished via [[Foley catheter]]. An inflated bulb of the catheter prevents leakage of fluid outside uterine cavity. By visualizing the flow of saline along the tube and observing it as a shower at [[Fimbriae of uterine tube|fimbrial]] end, [[tubal patency]] can be tested. Presence of free fluid in [[pouch of Douglas]] also confirms tubal patency.

==Uses==
* For detecting patency of fallopian tube
* Detection of submucous fibroid polyp 
* Detection of some intrauterine lesions
* Part of infertility investigations
* Investigation of [[amenorrhea]], especially in [[Asherman's syndrome]]
* Investigating repeat pregnancy losses for uterine anomalies

==Eponym==
The term 'Sion test' was popularized by Gautam Allahbadia after the popular government hospital in Sion, [[Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital]], locally known as 'Sion hospital',&lt;ref name=shaw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allahbadia|first=GN|title=Fallopian tubes and ultrasonography: the Sion experience.|journal=Fertility and Sterility|date=Nov 1992|volume=58|issue=5|pages=901–7|pmid=1426374}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he invented the test.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30170">[[Victimization]] refers to a person being made into a victim by someone else and can take on psychological as well as physical forms, both of which are damaging to victims.&lt;ref name="number7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Erika|last2=Yoon|first2=Jeungeun|last3=Langer|first3=Amie|last4=Ro|first4=Eunyoe|title=Is Psychological Aggression as Detrimental as Physical Aggression?&lt;BR&gt; The Independent Effects of Psychological Aggression on Depression and Anxiety Symptoms|journal=Violence and Victims|date=1 February 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=20–35|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.24.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of victimization include (but are not limited to) [[bullying]] or [[peer victimization]], [[physical abuse]], [[sexual abuse]], [[verbal abuse]], [[robbery]], and [[assault]]. Some of these forms of victimization are commonly associated with certain populations, but they can happen to others as well. For example, bullying or peer victimization is most commonly studied in children and adolescents but also takes place between adults.&lt;ref name="number6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aquino|first1=Karl|last2=Douglas|first2=Scott|last3=Martinko|first3=Mark J.|title=Overt Anger in Response to Victimization: Attributional Style and Organizational Norms as Moderators.|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|date=2004|volume=9|issue=2|pages=152–164|doi=10.1037/1076-8998.9.2.152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although anyone may be victimized, particular groups (e.g. children, the elderly, individuals with disabilities) may be more susceptible to certain types of victimization and as a result to the symptoms and consequences that follow. Individuals respond to victimization in a wide variety of ways, so noticeable '''symptoms of victimization''' will vary from person to person. These symptoms may take on several different forms (e.g. psychological, behavioral, or physical), be associated with specific forms of victimization, and be moderated by individual characteristics of the victim and/or experiences after victimization.

==Categories of outcomes==
Symptoms of victimization may include negative physical, [[psychology|psychological]], or [[behavior]]al consequences that are direct or indirect responses (see physical symptoms section) to victimization experiences. Symptoms in these categories sometimes overlap, are closely related, or cause each other. For example, a behavioral symptom such as an increase in aggressiveness or irritability may be part of a particular psychological outcome such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Much of the research on symptoms of victimization is cross-sectional (researchers only collected data at one point in time). From a research perspective this means that the symptoms are associated with victimization, but the causal relationship is not always established and alternative explanations have not been ruled out.&lt;ref name="number1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juvonen|first1=Jaana|last2=Graham|first2=Sandra|title=Bullying in Schools: The Power of Bullies and the Plight of Victims|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=3 January 2014|volume=65|issue=1|pages=159–185|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030|pmid=23937767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the symptoms described also may put individuals at risk for victimization. For example, there may be a two-way relationship between victimization and certain internalizing symptoms such as depression or withdrawal, such that victimization increases these symptoms, and individuals exhibiting these symptoms may be targeted for victimization more often than others.&lt;ref name="number2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reijntjes|first1=Albert|last2=Kamphuis|first2=Jan H.|last3=Prinzie|first3=Peter|last4=Telch|first4=Michael J.|title=Peer victimization and internalizing problems in children: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|date=April 2010|volume=34|issue=4|pages=244–252|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2009.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
The experience of being victimized may cause an individual to feel vulnerable or helpless, as well as changing their view of the world and/or their self-perception; the psychological distress this causes may manifest in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=Ronnie|last2=Frieze|first2=Irene Hanson|title=A Theoretical Perspective for Understanding Reactions to Victimization|journal=Journal of Social Issues|date=July 1983|volume=39|issue=2|pages=1–17|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1983.tb00138.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diagnosable psychological disorders that are associated with victimization experiences include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Psychological symptoms that are disruptive to a person's life may be present in some form even if they do not meet diagnostic criteria for a specific disorder. A variety of symptoms such as [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], and [[nightmares]], may be part of one of these diagnosable disorders or may occur in milder or more isolated form; diagnoses of particular disorders require that these symptoms have a particular degree of severity or frequency, or that an individual exhibits a certain number of them in order to be formally diagnosed.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt;

====Depression====

[[Depression (mood)|Depression]] has been found to be associated with many forms of victimization, including sexual victimization, violent crime, property crime, peer victimization, and [[domestic abuse]].&lt;ref name="number3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feiring|first1=Candice|last2=Simon|first2=Valerie A.|last3=Cleland|first3=Charles M.|title=Childhood sexual abuse, stigmatization, internalizing symptoms, and the development of sexual difficulties and dating aggression.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=2009|volume=77|issue=1|pages=127–137|doi=10.1037/a0013475|pmid=19170459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="number4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herek|first1=Gregory M.|last2=Gillis|first2=J.

Depression can impact many other areas of a person's life as well, including interpersonal relationships and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammen|first1=Constance L.|last2=Peters|first2=Stefanie D.|title=Interpersonal consequences of depression: Responses to men and women enacting a depressed role.|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1978|volume=87|issue=3|pages=322–332|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.8.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penninx|first1=Brenda WJH|last2=Milaneschi|first2=Yuri|last3=Lamers|first3=Femke|last4=Vogelzangs|first4=Nicole|title=Understanding the somatic consequences of depression: biological mechanisms and the role of depression symptom profile|journal=BMC Medicine|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|pages=129|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-11-129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression in response to victimization may be lethal, as it can result in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Examples of this include a ten-fold increase found in suicide attempts among [[rape]] victims compared to the general population, and significant correlations between being victimized in school and suicidal ideation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilpatrick|first1=Dean G.|last2=Best|first2=Connie L.|last3=Veronen|first3=Lois J.|last4=Amick|first4=Angelynne E.|last5=Villeponteaux|first5=Lorenz A.|last6=Ruff|first6=Gary A.|title=Mental health correlates of criminal victimization: A random community survey.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=1985|volume=53|issue=6|pages=866–873|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.53.6.866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rigby|first1=Ken|last2=Slee|first2=Phillip|title=Suicidal ideation among adolescent school children, involvement in bully-victim problems, and perceived social support|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|date=1999|volume=29|issue=2|pages=119–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anxiety====

A connection between victimization and [[anxiety]] has been established for both children and adults.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellmore|first1=Amy D.|last2=Witkow|first2=Melissa R.|last3=Graham|first3=Sandra|last4=Juvonen|first4=Jaana|title=Beyond the Individual: The Impact of Ethnic Context and Classroom Behavioral Norms on Victims' Adjustment.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2004|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1159–1172|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1159|pmid=15535764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="help"/&gt; The particular types of anxiety studied in relation to victimization vary; some research references anxiety as a general term while other research references more specific types such as social anxiety.&lt;ref name="context"/&gt; The term anxiety covers a range of difficulties and several specific diagnoses, including panic attacks, phobias, and generalized anxiety disorder.  Panic attacks are relatively short, intense bursts of fear that may or may not have a trigger (a cause in the immediate environment that happens right before they occur). They are sometimes a part of other anxiety disorders. Phobias may be specific to objects, situations, people, or places. They can result in avoidance behaviors or, if avoidance is not possible, extreme anxiety or panic attacks. Generalized anxiety is characterized by long-term, uncontrolled, intense worrying in addition to other symptoms such as irritability, sleep problems, or restlessness.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Anxiety has been shown to disrupt many aspects of people's lives as well, e.g. academic functioning, and to predict worse health outcomes later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Ameringen|first1=Michael|last2=Mancini|first2=Catherine|last3=Farvolden|first3=Peter|title=The impact of anxiety disorders on educational achievement|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=January 2003|volume=17|issue=5|pages=561–571|doi=10.1016/S0887-6185(02)00228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=BARDONE|first1=ANNA M.|last2=MOFFITT|first2=TERRIE E.|last3=CASPI|first3=AVSHALOM|last4=DICKSON|first4=NIGEL|last5=STANTON|first5=WARREN R.|last6=SILVA|first6=PHIL A.|title=Adult Physical Health Outcomes of Adolescent Girls With Conduct Disorder, Depression, and Anxiety|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=June 1998|volume=37|issue=6|pages=594–601|doi=10.1097/00004583-199806000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Posttraumatic stress disorder====

[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is a specific anxiety disorder in response to a traumatic event in a person's life. It is often discussed in the context of mental health of combat veterans, but also occurs in individuals who have been traumatized in other ways, such as victimization. PTSD involves long-term intense fear, re-experiencing the traumatic event (e.g. nightmares), avoidance of reminders of the event, and being highly reactive (e.g. easily enraged or startled).&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; It may include feeling detached from other people, self-guilt, and difficulty sleeping. Individuals with PTSD may experience a number of symptoms similar to those experienced in both anxiety and depression.

In addition to the established diagnostic criteria for PTSD, [[Frank Ochberg]] proposed a specific set of victimization symptoms (not formally recognized in diagnostic systems such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]]) that includes [[shame]], [[self-blame]], obsessive hatred of the person who victimized them alongside conflicting positive feelings toward that person, feeling defiled, being [[sexually inhibited]], despair or resignation to the situation, secondary victimization (described below), and risk of [[victimisation|revictimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ochberg|first1=edited by Frank M.|title=Post-traumatic therapy and victims of violence|date=1988|publisher=Brunner/Mazel|location=New York|isbn=0876304900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Additional symptoms of victimization may take on physical or behavioral forms. These may be direct, individual symptoms of victimization, or they may result from the psychological outcomes described above.

====Physical====
The most direct and obvious physical symptoms of victimization are injuries as a result of an aggressive physical action such as assault or sexual victimization. Other physical symptoms that are not a result of injury may be indirectly caused by victimization through psychological or emotional responses. Physical symptoms with a psychological or emotional basis are called [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] symptoms. Common psychosomatic symptoms associated with victimization include headaches, stomachaches and experiencing a higher frequency of illnesses such as colds and sore throats.&lt;ref name="number1"/&gt; Though psychosomatic symptoms are referred to as having psychological causes they have a biological basis as well; stress and other psychological symptoms trigger [[nervous system]] responses such as the release of various chemicals and hormones which then affect biological functioning.&lt;ref name="PTSD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=edited by Andrew Baum, Tracey A. Revensen, Jerome|title=Handbook of health psychology|date=2010|publisher=Psychology|location=Hove|isbn=9780805864618|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behavioral====
Individuals who have been victimized may also exhibit behavioral symptoms after the experience. Some individuals who have been victimized show externalizing (outwardly directed) behaviors. For example, an individual who has not previously acted aggressively toward others may begin to do so as after being victimized, such as when a child who has been bullied begins to bully others. Aggressive behaviors may be associated with PTSD (described above). Externalizing behaviors associated with victimization include hyperactivity, [[hypervigilance]], and attention problems that may resemble [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]].&lt;ref name="number1"/&gt; Others may exhibit internalizing (inwardly directed) behavioral symptoms. Many internalizing symptoms tend to be more psychological in nature (depression and anxiety are sometimes referred to as internalization), but particular behaviors are indicative of internalization as well.&lt;ref name="number2"/&gt; Internalizing behaviors that have been documented in victimized individuals include withdrawing from social contact and avoidance of people or situations.&lt;ref name="number2"/&gt;

====Substance use====
Drug and alcohol use associated with victimization is sometimes explained as a form of [[self-medication]], or an attempt to alleviate other symptoms resulting from victimization through substance use.&lt;ref name="drinking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaysen|first1=Debra|last2=Atkins|first2=David C.|last3=Simpson|first3=Tracy L.|last4=Stappenbeck|first4=Cynthia A.|last5=Blayney|first5=Jessica A.|last6=Lee|first6=Christine M.|last7=Larimer|first7=Mary E.|title=Proximal relationships between PTSD symptoms and drinking among female college students: Results from a daily monitoring study.|journal=Psychology of Addictive Behaviors|date=2014|volume=28|issue=1|pages=62–73|doi=10.1037/a0033588|pmc=3825767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting this, alcohol use has been empirically connected to particular symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="drinking"/&gt; Sexual abuse in particular has been identified as one significant precursor to serious alcohol use among women, although it is not as well-established as a causal link and may be mediated by PTSD or other psychological symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moncrieff|first1=Joanna|last2=Farmer|first2=Roger|title=Sexual abuse and the subsequent development of alcohol problems|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|date=1998|volume=33|issue=6|pages=592–601|doi=10.1093/alcalc/33.6.592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connections have been established between victimization and the use of other drugs as well. Drug use in adolescence and peer victimization based on sexual orientation are correlated.&lt;ref name="SOV"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darwich|first1=Lina|last2=Hymel|first2=Shelley|last3=Waterhouse|first3=Terry|title=School avoidance and substance use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning youths: The impact of peer victimization and adult support.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2012|volume=104|issue=2|pages=381–392|doi=10.1037/a0026684}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has drawn connections between substance use and childhood physical abuse in the general population.&lt;ref name="Malinosky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malinosky-Rummell|first1=Robin|last2=Hansen|first2=David J.|title=Long-term consequences of childhood physical abuse.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1993|volume=114|issue=1|pages=68–79|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.114.1.68|pmid=8346329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug use has also been connected to both physical and sexual victimization among high risk, incarcerated youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dembo|first1=Richard|last2=Dertke|first2=Max|last3=La Voie|first3=Lawrence|last4=Borders|first4=Scott|last5=Washburn|first5=Mark|last6=Schmeidler|first6=James|title=Physical abuse, sexual victimization and illicit drug use: A structural analysis among high risk adolescents|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=March 1987|volume=10|issue=1|pages=13–34|doi=10.1016/S0140-1971(87)80030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Specific types of victimization have been strongly linked to particular symptoms or outcomes. These symptoms are not exclusively associated with these forms of victimization but have been studied in association with them, possibly because of their relevance to the specific victimization experiences.

===Sexual===
Some individuals who have experienced victimization may have difficulty establishing and maintaining [[intimate relationships]].&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt; This is not a subset of symptoms that is exclusive to sexual victimization, but the link between sexual victimization and intimacy problems has been particularly well-established in research. These difficulties may include sexual dysfunction, anxiety about sexual relationships, and dating aggression.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt; Those who experience sexual victimization may have these difficulties long-term, as in the case of victimized children who continue to have difficulty with intimacy during adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt; Some research suggests that the severity of these intimacy problems is related directly to the severity of victimization, while other research suggests that self-blame and shame about sexual victimization mediates (causes) the relationship between victimization and outcomes.&lt;ref name="number3"/&gt;

===Childhood bullying===
One symptom that has been associated particularly with school-based peer victimization is poor academic functioning.&lt;ref name="number9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Junsheng|last2=Bullock|first2=Amanda|last3=Coplan|first3=Robert J.|title=Predictive relations between peer victimization and academic achievement in Chinese children.|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|date=2014|volume=29|issue=1|pages=89–98|doi=10.1037/spq0000044}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symptom is not exclusive to peer victimization, but is contextually relevant due to the setting in which such victimization takes place. Studies have shown poor academic functioning to be a result of peer victimization in elementary, middle, and high school in multiple countries.&lt;ref name="number9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|last2=Gorman|first2=Andrea Hopmeyer|last3=Nakamoto|first3=Jonathan|last4=Toblin|first4=Robin L.|title=Victimization in the Peer Group and Children's Academic Functioning.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2005|volume=97|issue=3|pages=425–435|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.97.3.425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though academic functioning has commonly been studied in relation to childhood bullying that takes place in schools, it is likely associated with other forms of victimization as well, as both depression and anxiety affect attention and focus.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt;

===Childhood physical abuse===
Researchers have drawn connections between childhood physical abuse and tendencies toward violent or aggressive behaviors both during childhood and later in life.&lt;ref name="Malinosky"/&gt; This aligns logically with increases in aggression and reactivity described above (see psychological symptoms section). The increased risk for engaging in aggressive behavior may be an indirect symptom, mediated by changes in the way that individuals process social information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dodge|first1=K.|last2=Bates|first2=J.|last3=Pettit|first3=G.|title=Mechanisms in the cycle of violence|journal=Science|date=21 December 1990|volume=250|issue=4988|pages=1678–1683|doi=10.1126/science.2270481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased risk does not mean that everyone who was physically victimized during childhood will continue the cycle of violence with their own children or engage in aggressive behaviors to a point that it is highly detrimental or requires legal action; estimated numbers of individuals who do continue this pattern vary based on the type of aggressive behavior being studied. For example, 16-21% of abused and/or neglected children in one particular study were arrested for violent offenses by around the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maxfield|first1=Michael G.|title=The Cycle of Violence|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|date=1 April 1996|volume=150|issue=4|pages=390|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1996.02170290056009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moderating factors==
In psychology, a [[Moderation (statistics)|moderator]] is a factor that changes the outcome of a particular situation. With regards to victimization, these can take the form of environmental or contextual characteristics, other people’s responses after victimization has occurred, or a victimized person’s internal responses to or views on what they have experienced.

===Attributions===

[[Attribution (psychology)|Attribution]]s about a situation or person refer to where an individual places the blame for an event.  An individual may have a different response to being victimized and exhibit different symptoms if they interpret the victimization as being their own fault, the fault of the perpetrator of the victimization, or the fault of some other external factor.&lt;ref name="number6"/&gt; Attributions also vary by how stable or controllable someone believes a situation to be. Characterological self-blame for victimization (believing that something is one's own fault, that it is a stable characteristic about themselves, and that it is unchangeable or out of their control) has been shown to make victims feel particularly helpless and to have a negative effect on psychological outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Sandra|last2=Bellmore|first2=Amy|last3=Nishina|first3=Adrienne|last4=Juvonen|first4=Jaana|title="It Must Be Me": Ethnic Diversity and Attributions for Peer Victimization in Middle School|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=7 January 2009|volume=38|issue=4|pages=487–499|doi=10.1007/s10964-008-9386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While self-blaming attributions have potentially harmful moderating effects on the symptoms of victimization for those who are already prone to self-blame, it is worth noting that self-blame may itself be a result of victimization for some individuals as noted above (see [[#Posttraumatic_stress_disorder|section on PTSD]]).&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D’Andrea|first1=Wendy|last2=Ford|first2=Julian|last3=Stolbach|first3=Bradley|last4=Spinazzola|first4=Joseph|last5=van der Kolk|first5=Bessel A.|author-link5= Bessel van der Kolk|title=Understanding interpersonal trauma in children: Why we need a developmentally appropriate trauma diagnosis.|journal=American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|date=2012|volume=82|issue=2|pages=187–200|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.2012.01154.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping and help-seeking===

Victimized individuals who participate in active forms of [[coping (psychology)|coping]] experience fewer or less severe psychological symptoms after victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Julian D.|title=Ethnoracial and educational differences in victimization history, trauma-related symptoms, and coping style.|journal=Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy|date=2012|volume=4|issue=2|pages=177–185|doi=10.1037/a0023670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One form of active coping is seeking help from others. Help-seeking can be informal (e.g. seeking help from friends or family) or formal (e.g. police reporting of victimization).&lt;ref name="help"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuevas|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Bell|first2=Kristin A.|last3=Sabina|first3=Chiara|title=Victimization, psychological distress, and help-seeking: Disentangling the relationship for Latina victims.|journal=Psychology of Violence|date=2014|volume=4|issue=2|pages=196–209|doi=10.1037/a0035819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributions about victimization may play a role in whether an individual seeks help or from whom they seek it. For example, a recent study showed that children who are being victimized by peers are less likely to seek support from friends or teachers if they attribute victimization to a group factor such as race, and more likely to seek support if they attribute victimization to more individualized personal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visconti|first1=Kari Jeanne|last2=Sechler|first2=Casey M.|last3=Kochenderfer-Ladd|first3=Becky|title=Coping with peer victimization: The role of children’s attributions.|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|date=2013|volume=28|issue=2|pages=122–140|doi=10.1037/spq0000014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, adult victims who blame themselves and are ashamed of being victimized may wish to hide the experience from others, and thus be less willing to seek help.&lt;ref name="number 8"/&gt; Gender may affect willingness seek help as well; men who have been victimized may be less willing to disclose this information and ask for help due to differing societal expectations for men in addition to the shame and stigmatization experienced by both men and women in response to victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorsoli|first1=Lynn|last2=Kia-Keating|first2=Maryam|last3=Grossman|first3=Frances K.|title="I keep that hush-hush": Male survivors of sexual abuse and the challenges of disclosure.|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2008|volume=55|issue=3|pages=333–345|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.55.3.333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased social support that sometimes results from seeking help may alleviate some of the symptoms of victimization and decrease the risk of continued or future victimization.&lt;ref name="SOV"/&gt; However, seeking help may also make the outcomes and symptoms worse, depending on the context and responses to help-seeking behavior. Help-seeking may be received more positively from some individuals than others; for example, elementary school aged girls who seek social support after victimization may benefit from it socially, while victimized boys of the same age may experience worse social problems as a result of the same support-seeking behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kochenderfer-Ladd|first1=Becky|last2=Skinner|first2=Karey|title=Children's coping strategies: Moderators of the effects of peer victimization?|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2002|volume=38|issue=2|pages=267–278|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.38.2.267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking help may also increase the severity of victimization symptoms if an individual experiences [[victimisation|secondary victimization]] in the form of [[victim-blaming]], being forced to mentally relive a victimization experience, or other negative responses from individuals or institutions from whom they seek help.&lt;ref name="PTSD"/&gt; Secondary victimization has been documented in victims of rape when they seek medical or psychological assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Rebecca|last2=Raja|first2=Sheela|title=THE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SECONDARY VICTIMIZATION OF FEMALE VETERANS: HELP-SEEKING EXPERIENCES WITH MILITARY AND CIVILIAN SOCIAL SYSTEMS|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|date=March 2005|volume=29|issue=1|pages=97–106|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00171.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been documented in individuals whose victimization results in criminal trials, particularly if the outcomes of those trials were not in the victims' favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orth|first1=Uli|title=Secondary Victimization of Crime Victims by Criminal Proceedings|journal=Social Justice Research|date=2002|volume=15|issue=4|pages=313–325|doi=10.1023/A:1021210323461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Moon is made of green cheese"'''  is a statement referring to a fanciful belief that the [[Moon]] is composed of [[cheese]]. In its original formulation as a [[proverb]] and [[metaphor]] for credulity with roots in fable, this refers to the perception of a [[Simpleton (folklore)|simpleton]] who sees a reflection of the Moon in water and mistakes it for a round cheese wheel. It is widespread as a [[Morphology (folkloristics)|folkloric motif]] among many of the world's cultures, and the notion has also found its way into children's [[folklore]] and modern popular culture.

The phrase "[[green cheese]]" in this proverb simply refers to a young cheese (sometimes "[[cream cheese]]" is used), though modern people may interpret the color reference literally.&lt;ref&gt; [[Merriam-Webster]] Green cheese definition. &lt;/ref&gt;

There was never an actual historical popular belief that the Moon is made of green cheese (''cf.'', [[Flat Earth]] and the [[myth of the Flat Earth]]).{{efn-ua|The '''myth of the flat Earth''' is the modern misconception that the prevailing cosmological view during the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe was that the Earth is [[flat Earth|flat]], instead of [[spherical Earth|spherical]].{{sfn|Russell|1991|p=3}}{{sfn|Russell|1997}}}} It was typically used as an example of extreme [[credulity]], a meaning that was clear and commonly understood as early as 1638.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Wilkins |authorlink1=John Wilkins |year=1638 |title=[[New World Book]] |volume=1 |quote="You may as soon persuade some Country Peasants that the Moon is made of Green Cheese (as we say) as that ’tis bigger than his Cart-wheel."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fable==
There exists a family of stories in [[comparative mythology]] in diverse countries that concern a [[Simpleton (folklore)|simpleton]] who sees a reflection of the Moon and mistakes it for a round cheese:

{{quote|... the [[Servian mythology|Servian tale]] where the fox leads the wolf to believe the moon reflection in the water is a cheese and the wolf bursts in the attempt to drink up the water to get at the cheese; the [[Zulu mythology|Zulu tale]] of the hyena that drops the bone to go after the moon reflection in the water; the [[Occitan literature|Gascon tale]] of the peasant watering his [[donkey|ass]] on a moonlight night. A cloud obscures the moon, and the peasant, thinking the ass has drunk the moon, kills the beast to recover the moon; the [[Turkish folklore|Turkish tale]] of the [[Nasreddin|Khoja Nasru-'d-Din]] who thinks the moon has fallen into the well and gets a rope and chain with which to pull it out. In his efforts the rope breaks, and he falls back, but seeing the moon in the sky, praises Allah that the moon is safe; the [[Scottish mythology|Scotch tale]] of the wolf fishing with his tail for the moon reflection;|G. H. McKnight&lt;ref name="McKnight"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKnight |first=George Harley |date=1908 |title=The Middle English Vox and Wolf |journal=[[Modern Language Association|Publications of the Modern Language Association of America]] |volume=XXIII |pages=497–509 |doi=10.2307/456797}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''The Wolf and the Fox'' story type===
This [[Morphology (folkloristics)|folkloric motif]] is first recorded in literature during the [[High Middle Ages]] by the French rabbi [[Rashi]] with a [[Mashal (allegory)|Rabbinic parable]] in his commentary weaving together three Biblical quotations given in the main text (including one on "[[The Fox and the Grapes|sour grapes]]") into a reconstruction of some of the Talmudic [[Rabbi Meir]]'s supposed three hundred [[Foxes in popular culture|fox fables]] ("משלות שועלים", in later works "משלי שועלים"), in the tractate ''[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]'':&lt;ref name="Hebrew"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sanhedrin 38b |publisher=Hebrew Books |edition=Ryzman |url=http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&amp;daf=38b&amp;format=text|language=Hebrew |accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |title=Sanhedrin 39a |publisher=Hebrew Books |edition=Ryzman |url=http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&amp;daf=39&amp;format=text|language=Hebrew |accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A fox once craftily induced a wolf to go and join the Jews in their [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] preparations and share in their festivities. On his appearing in their midst the Jews fell upon him with sticks and beat him. He therefore came back determined to kill the fox. But the latter pleaded: 'It is no fault of mine that you were beaten, but they have a grudge against your father who once helped them in preparing their banquet and then consumed all the choice bits.' 'And was I beaten for the wrong done by my father?' cried the indignant wolf. 'Yes,' replied the fox, &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge''. However,' he continued, 'come with me and I will supply you with abundant food. He led him to a well which had a beam across it from either end of which hung a rope with a bucket attached. The fox entered the upper bucket and descended into the well whilst the lower one was drawn up. 'Where are you going?' asked the wolf. The fox, pointing to the cheese-like reflection of the moon, replied: 'Here is plenty of meat and cheese; get into the other bucket and come down at once.' The wolf did so, and as he descended, the fox was drawn up. 'And how am I to get out?' demanded the wolf. 'Ah' said the fox &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''the righteous is delivered out of trouble and the wicked cometh in his stead''. Is it not written, ''Just balances, just weights''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;?|[[Rashi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Sanhedrin.pdf |title=Soncino translation of Sanhedrin |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource inline|Disciplina Clericalis/XVIII. The Plowman with His Oxen and the Wolf and the Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Rashi as the first literary reference may reflect the well-known [[beast fable]] tradition of [[French folklore]] or a more obscure such tradition in [[Jewish mythology|Jewish folklore]] (see also the tradition in [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]]); the near-contemporary Iraqi rabbi [[Hai Gaon]] also reconstructed this Rabbi Meir tale, sharing some elements of Rashi's story, but with a lion caught in a [[trapping pit]] rather than a wolf in a well — however, Rashi may have actively "adapted contemporary &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;French&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; folklore to the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;T&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;almudic passage", as was [[Homiletics|homiletically]] practiced in different Jewish communities.{{sfn|Teitelbaum|1999|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbZPv-2LO6YC&amp;pg=PA260 260–263]}} Though the tale itself is probably of non-Jewish European origin, Rashi's form and elements are likely closer to the original in oral folklore than the somewhat later variation recorded featuring [[Reynard]]. Rashi's version already includes the fox, the wolf, the [[water well|well]] and the Moon that are seen in later versions. [[Petrus Alphonsi]], a Spanish Jewish convert to Christianity, popularized this tale in Europe in his collection ''[[Disciplina Clericalis#The Oxen Which the Countryman had Promised to the Wolf, and the Judgment of the Fox|Disciplina Clericalis]]''.&lt;ref name="McKnight"/&gt;

[[File:Le loup et le renard Chauveau.jpg|thumb|The wolf is tempted by the Moon's reflection.]]
The variation featuring [[Reynard]] the Fox appeared soon after Petrus Alphonsi in the French classic ''Le Roman de Renart'' (as "Renart et Ysengrin dans le puits" in Branch IV); the Moon/cheese element is absent (it is replaced by a promise of Paradise at the bottom of the well), but such a version is alluded to in another part of the collection. This was the first Reynard tale to be adapted into English (as the Middle English "þe Vox and þe Wolf"), preceding Chaucer's "[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]" and the much later work of [[William Caxton]].&lt;ref name="McKnight"/&gt; Later still, the Middle Scots [[The Fox, the Wolf and the Husbandman]] does include the Moon/cheese element. La Fontaine includes the story in the French classic compilation ''[[La Fontaine's Fables|Fables]]'' ("Le Loup et le Renard" in Book XI).  The German tale of [[The Wolf and the Fox]] in Grimm replaces the well with a well-stocked cellar, where a newly satiated wolf is trapped and subject to the farmer's revenge, being now too overstuffed to escape through the exit.
{{wikisource|The Original Fables of La Fontaine/The Wolf and the Fox in the Well}}

One of the facets of this morphology is grouped as "The Wolf Dives into the Water for Reflected Cheese" (Type 34) of the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson classification]] of folktales, where the Moon's reflection is mistaken for cheese, in the section devoted to tales of [[Foxes in popular culture|The Clever Fox]]. It can also be grouped as "The Moon in the Well" (Type 1335A), in the section devoted to [[Simpleton (folklore)|Stories about a Fool]], referring to stories where the simpleton believes the Moon itself is a tangible object in the water.

The use of the words "The moon is made of green cheese" in a passive sentence creates a dilemma of syntax, depending upon whether it is considered to be a "phrase" and its larger context.{{sfn|Anderson|2006||pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=X1SVzsc8mbEC&amp;pg=PA206 206]}}

==Proverb==
"The Moon is made of green cheese" was one of the most popular proverbs in 16th and 17th-century English literature,{{sfn|Apperson|Manser|2003||page=392}} and it was also in use after this time. It likely originated in this formulation in 1546, when ''[[John Heywood|The Proverbs of John Heywood]]'' claimed "the moon is made of a greene cheese."&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;"Ye fetch circumquaques to make me believe, Or thinke, that the moone is made of greene cheese. And when ye have made me a lout in all these, It seemeth ye would make me goe to bed at noone." --John Heywood.  ''Greene'' may refer here not to the color, as many now think, but to being new or unaged. {{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1340/how-did-the-moon-green-cheese-myth-start |first1=Cecil |last1=Adams |title=How did the moon = green cheese myth start? |date=23 July 1999 |accessdate=10 June 2012 |publisher=[[The Straight Dope]]}} ''[[Cf.]]'', [[green wood]].&lt;/ref&gt; A common variation at that time was "to make one believe the Moon is made of green cheese" (''i.e.'', to hoax).{{fact|date=August 2018}}

In French, there is the proverb "''Il veut prendre la lune avec les dents''" ("He wants to take the moon with his teeth"), alluded to in [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]].{{fact|date=August 2018}}

The characterization is also common in stories of [[Simpleton (folklore)|gothamites]], including the [[Moonrakers]] of Wiltshire, who were said to have taken advantage of this trope, and the assumption of their own naivete, to hide their smuggling activities from government officials.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Childlore and popular culture==
A 1902 survey of [[childlore]] by psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]] in the United States found that though most young children were unsure of the Moon's composition, that it was made of cheese was the single most common explanation:

{{quote|Careful inquiry and reminiscence concerning the substance of the moon show that eighteen children &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;of 423&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, averaging five years, thought it made of cheese. Sometime the mice eat it horseshoe-shaped, or that it could be fed by throwing cheese up so clouds could catch it; or it was green because the man in the moon fed on green grass; its spots were mould; it was really green but looked yellow, because wrapped in yellow cheese cloth; it was cheese mixed with wax or with melted lava, which might be edible; there were many rats, mice and skippers there; it grew big from a starry speck of light by eating cheese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Slaughter |first=J. W. |date=1902 |title=The Moon in Childhood and Folklore |journal=[[American Journal of Psychology]] |volume=XIII |pages=294–318 |doi=10.2307/1412741}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before that time, and since, the idea of the Moon actually being made of cheese has appeared as a humorous conceit in much of children's popular culture with astronomical themes (cf. the [[Man in the Moon]]), and in adult references to it.

*In [[John Maynard Keynes]]'s principal work "[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]" one finds in Chapter XVII a section "Unemployment develops, that is to say, because people want the moon; [..] There is no remedy but to persuade the public that green cheese is practically the same thing and to have a green cheese factory (i.e. a central bank) under public control." 
*''[[The Milky Way (1940 film)|The Milky Way]]'' is an Academy Award-winning animated cartoon short subject. As "three little kittens who lost their mittens" explore a dreamland, space is made up entirely of dairy products (e.g. the [[Milky Way]] is made of milk and the Moon is made of cheese).
*At the end of the 1967 [[Tom and Jerry]] short, ''[[O-Solar Meow]]'', Jerry is blasted to the Moon, where he is seen stuffing himself with its large quantities of cheese.

* In the children's educational show, ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'', there is a sketch in which Fargo North is an astronaut in space who receives orders to proceed to the Moon.  He protests that is impossible since the Moon is made of green cheese and his exasperated partner reminds him that he was told otherwise in training. In another skit, a character forcefully states that the moon is not made of green cheese, but of ''cream'' cheese.
* In [[Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew]] #12, Chester Cheese eats some green "Lunar Longhorn" cheese, brought back from the moon, and thus gains the power to shrink at will and yet retain his normal strength, similar to the [[Atom]].

*At the [[Science writer|Science Writers']] conference, [[theoretical physicist]] [[Sean M. Carroll]] explained why there was no need to "sample the moon to know it's not made of cheese." He said the hypothesis is "[[Absurdity|absurd]]", failing against our knowledge of the universe and, "This is not a proof, there is no metaphysical proof, like you can proof a statement in logic or math that the moon is not made of green cheese. But science nevertheless passes judgments on claims based on how well they fit in with the rest of our theoretical understanding."&lt;ref name="Mirsky"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=moon-not-made-of-cheese-physicist-e-11-10-19 |title=Moon Not Made of Cheese, Physicist Explains |place=[[Flagstaff, Arizona]] |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |first1=Steve |last1=Mirsky |authorlink=Steve Mirsky|date=19 October 2011 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;This hypothetical debate{{mdash}}essentially a [[straw man proposal]] or [[Strawman|argument]] {{mdash}} ignores completely the personal observation and collection of 382&amp;nbsp;kg (842&amp;nbsp;lb) of [[moon rock]] by [[Apollo program]] astronauts. Compare [[Cromwell's rule]].&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding this uncontrovertible argument, the harmonic signature of moon rock{{mdash}}the [[seismic velocity]] at which [[shockwave]]s travel{{mdash}}is said to be closer to cheese than to any rock on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianslunarpages.org/cheese.html |title=Is the moon made of green cheese |date=1996–2005 |first1=Ian |last1=Sanders|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Dennis Lindley used the myth to help explain the necessity of [[Cromwell's rule]] in [[Bayesian probability]]: "In other words, if a decision-maker thinks something cannot be true and interprets this to mean it has zero probability, he will never be influenced by any data, which is surely absurd. So leave a little probability for the moon being made of green cheese; it can be as small as 1 in a million, but have it there since otherwise an army of astronauts returning with samples of the said cheese will leave you unmoved."{{sfn|Lindley|1991|page=104}}

'''Uppsala Monitoring Centre''' ('''UMC'''), located in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]], is the field name for the [[World Health Organization]] [[WHO Collaborating Centres|Collaborating Centre]] for International Drug Monitoring. UMC works by collecting, assessing and communicating information from member countries' national [[pharmacovigilance]] centres in regard to the benefits, harm, effectiveness and risks of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;''Drug Benefits and Risks – International Textbook of Clinical Pharmacology (2nd edition)''. Van Boxtel C, Santoso B and Edwards IR, eds. IOS Press, Amsterdam, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Since 1978, responsibility for managing the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring has been carried by UMC. In the early years the staff consisted of just three pharmacists based at the Swedish [[Medical Products Agency]] (Läkemedelsverket); currently over 100 staff work in central Uppsala. The founding chairman and acting Director was Professor Åke Liljestrand. From 1990 to 2009 the Director was Professor Ralph Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;Spross Å. Uppsala leder forskning om biverkningar. ''Uppsala Nya Tidning'', 28 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 2009 Dr. Marie Lindquist is the Director.  The Chief Medical Officer is Dr. Pia Caduff and the Head of Research is Dr. Niklas Norén.
 
The work of the UMC is:
*To co-ordinate the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring and its more than 100 member countries.
*To collect, assess and communicate information from member countries about the benefits, harms and risks of drugs and other substances used in medicine to improve patient therapy and public health worldwide
*To collaborate with member countries in the development and practice of the science of pharmacovigilance.

The main focus and source of data in [[pharmacovigilance]] are reports of ICSRs (individual case safety reports) from healthcare providers and patients in member countries of the WHO Programme. A WHO global individual case safety report database ([[VigiBase]]) is maintained and developed on behalf of the WHO by UMC.&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist M. Vigibase, the WHO Global ICSR Database System: Basic Facts. ''Drug Information Journal'', 2008, 42:409–419.&lt;/ref&gt; UMC develops and provides several tools and classifications for use by organisations involved in drug safety, including the [[WHO Drug Dictionary]], [[WHOART]] (adverse reaction terminology)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/sourcereleasedocs/current/WHO/ US National Library of Medicine, 2010 entry for UMC], retrieved 28 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; – with a bridge to the [[MedDRA]] terminology, tools for searching in the database, and a program for case report management, VigiFlow.&lt;ref name="GuptaEd"/&gt;

UMC's research covers mainly three areas: data-driven discovery (especially statistical techniques), dis-proportionality analyses, interaction detection, patterns and duplicate case detection), safety surveillance and signaling (among which drug dependence and pediatric use) and benefit—risk analysis.&lt;ref name="Coberttelerx"&gt;[http://www.telerx.com/blog/the-uppsala-monitoring-centre-umc/  Telerx website; description and critique of the Uppsala Monitoring Centre], retrieved 28 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre has been active in presenting research in the medical literature which has included some seminal works in the field.&lt;ref name="Coberttelerx"/&gt; The Uppsala centre has also published books in the field of drugs safety including a regular newsletter.&lt;ref name="GuptaEd"&gt;''Textbook of Pharmacovigilance (Chapter 11).'' Ed: SK Gupta. Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers, New Delhi, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the 2nd edition of a crisis management guide was published, entitled 'Expecting the Worst'.&lt;ref&gt;Clark D. Review: Expecting the Worst – a publication from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre. ''Drug Safety'' 2010; 33(12):1135–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

UMC's role in drug safety has not been without controversy for both medicines agencies and pharmaceutical companies, despite an open approach willing to engage with many parties in the pharmaceutical world. They are closely involved in outreach to developing countries and other areas where pharmacovigilance is not yet handled.&lt;ref name="Coberttelerx"/&gt;

Clift earned a [[bachelor's degree]] with honors in economics and government from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=Crossings /&gt; Clift then went on to earn a law degree at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1952, and practiced law at [[Baker, Botts, Andrews and Parish]] in [[Houston, Texas]], before attending [[seminary]].&lt;ref name=Crossings /&gt; He married another attorney at the firm, Jean Dalby, in 1954.&lt;ref name=ECD /&gt; In 1960, he earned an [[M.Div.]] from the [[Church Divinity School of the Pacific]].&lt;ref name=Crossings /&gt;  Ordained deacon in 1960 and priest in 1961, Clift served as vicar of Grace Church and the Church of the Resurrection in Houston until 1964.&lt;ref name=ECD /&gt;  While in Houston, Clift attended the major address by then-presidential candidate Senator John F. Kennedy to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960 regarding Kennedy's ability to make decisions independent of the Roman Catholic Church, and is viewable on the 1:38 mark in the recorded video of the address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/ALL6YEBJMEKYGMCntnSCvg.aspx#ooid=NzZzJ4MTqoXZCUpwn6QYqueiGyWPFKV0|title=Address of Senator John F. Kennedy|accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Clift received a Farish Foundation grant to study the psychology of [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref name=ECD /&gt; He studied from 1964 to 1966 at the [[C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich]], Switzerland, where he worked with analyst [[Jolande Jacobi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clift|first=Wallace|year=1982|title=Jung and Christianity: The Challenge of Reconciliation|publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company|pages=xi|isbn=0-8245-0409-7}} {{Cite book|last=Clift|first=Wallace|year=1990|title=Journey Into Love: Road Signs Along The Way|publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company|pages=11–12 |isbn=0-8245-1032-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] with his dissertation ''Psychological and Biblical-Theological Perspectives on Hope from the Viewpoints of C. G. Jung and John Knox''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychological and Biblical-Theological Perspectives on Hope from the Viewpoints of C.G. Jung and John Knox|first=Wallace|last=Clift|year=1970 | publisher=Unpublished Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Chicago| oclc=43671150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Clift taught psychology of religion at the [[University of Denver]] from 1969 to 1992, and in 1981 helped start its joint Ph.D. program in religious and theological studies with the [[Iliff School of Theology]].&lt;ref name=ECD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iliff and DU Joint Ph.D. Program.{{cite web|url=http://www.du.edu/duiliffjoint/ |title=The Joint Ph.D Program|accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xp11.2 duplication''' is a genomic variation marked by the [[Gene duplication|duplication]] of an [[X chromosome]] region on the short arm p at position 11.2, defined by standard karyotyping ([[G banding|G-banding]]). This gene-rich, rearrangement prone region can be further divided into three loci - Xp11.21, Xp11.22 and Xp11.23. The duplication could involve any combination of these three loci.  While the length of the duplication can vary from 0.5Mb to 55 Mb, most duplications measure about 4.5Mb and typically occur in the region of 11.22-11.23.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rarechromo.org|title=Unique The Rare Chromosome Disorder Support Group|website=www.rarechromo.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most affected females show preferential activation of the duplicated X chromosome.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/12766/microduplication-xp1122-p1123-syndrome|title=Microduplication Xp11.22-p11.23 syndrome {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features of affected individuals vary significantly, even among members of the same family. The Xp11.2 duplication can be 'silent' - presenting no obvious symptoms in carriers - which is known from the asymptomatic parents of affected children carrying the duplication.&lt;ref name="Giorda_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giorda R, Bonaglia MC, Beri S, Fichera M, Novara F, Magini P, Urquhart J, Sharkey FH, Zucca C, Grasso R, Marelli S, Castiglia L, Di Benedetto D, Musumeci SA, Vitello GA, Failla P, Reitano S, Avola E, Bisulli F, Tinuper P, Mastrangelo M, Fiocchi I, Spaccini L, Torniero C, Fontana E, Lynch SA, Clayton-Smith J, Black G, Jonveaux P, Leheup B, Seri M, Romano C, dalla Bernardina B, Zuffardi O | display-authors = 6 | title = Complex segmental duplications mediate a recurrent dup(X)(p11.22-p11.23) associated with mental retardation, speech delay, and EEG anomalies in males and females | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 394–400 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19716111 | pmc = 2771536 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Honda_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Honda S, Hayashi S, Imoto I, Toyama J, Okazawa H, Nakagawa E, Goto Y, Inazawa J | title = Copy-number variations on the X chromosome in Japanese patients with mental retardation detected by array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis | language = En | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 55 | issue = 9 | pages = 590–9 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20613765 | doi = 10.1038/jhg.2010.74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The common symptoms include [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]], [[speech delay]] and learning difficulties, while in rare cases, children have [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] and a recognizable brain wave pattern when assessed by EEG ([[electroencephalography]]).

== Etiology ==
Using array-based [[Comparative genomic hybridization|Comparative Genomic Hybridization]] (aCGH) to screen 2,400 individuals with isolated or syndromic mental retardation for copy number variation, Giorda et al. (2009) identified 8 (0.33%) unrelated individuals, 2 males and 6 females, with a microduplication at chromosome Xp11.23-p11.22. The rearrangement was familial in 3 patients. A female patient shared a 4.5-Mb duplication with her affected mother and sister, and an unrelated male patient shared a 4.5-Mb duplication with his affected mother and sister. A third unrelated male inherited a smaller 0.8-Mb duplication from his unaffected mother. Three additional individuals had ''de novo'' 4.5-Mb duplications, and 2 more had partially overlapping ''de novo'' 6.0- and 9.2-Mb duplications. Paternal origin of the duplication was demonstrated in all ''de novo'' female cases. Six affected females had selective inactivation of the normal X chromosome, whereas 3 had random X inactivation. Breakpoints could be identified in 8 individuals. The recurrent duplication was flanked distally by a segmental duplication (D-REP at 47.8-48.2 Mb) containing a cluster of genes and pseudogenes of the [[Synovial sarcoma, X breakpoint|synovial sarcoma X breakpoint]] (SSX) and proximally by a complex repeat (P-REP at 52.1-53.1 Mb) rich in SSX, melanoma antigen and X antigen (XAGE) genes. Sequence analysis of the junctions demonstrated that the recurrent 4.5-Mb duplications were mediated by [[non-allelic homologous recombination]] (NAHR) or [[Alu-mediated recombination]].The majority of these recombinations occurred between flanking complex segmental duplications.&lt;ref name="Giorda_2009" /&gt; Region of duplication and copy number variation can be further confirmed by [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization]] (FISH) and [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].

== Symptoms and clinical features ==
Information on the clinical symptoms and features is taken from the [[Human Phenotype Ontology]] database&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/|title=Home|website=Human Phenotype Ontology|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Unique'' database.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All affected individuals needn't show all the symptoms. Some of the most noted features are:
* [[Intellectual disability|Intellectual]] and [[Learning disability|Learning]] Disabilities
* [[Speech delay]]  
* [[Early puberty]]  
* Significant weight and height problems
* Lower-extremity anomalies (anomalies of the legs and/ or feet)
* [[Epileptic seizure|Epileptic Seizures]]
* Unusual pattern of EEG with centro-temporal focal spike waves in children
* Minor facial features

=== Intellectual and Learning Disabilities ===
Among people who need support with their learning, at least 3% are believed to carry the duplication.&lt;ref name="Giorda_2009" /&gt; It is noted that affected members of the same family with the same Xp11.2 microduplication generally have similar learning profiles. Children with small duplications of 0.5-1.3 Mb seem to have a mild learning difficulty, while others with the typical duplication of around 4.5 Mb generally have a borderline, mild or moderate learning disability. An extreme case with a very large duplication of 55 Mb has shown to have a severe intellectual disability.&lt;ref name="Giorda_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nizon M, Andrieux J, Rooryck C, de Blois MC, Bourel-Ponchel E, Bourgois B, Boute O, David A, Delobel B, Duban-Bedu B, Giuliano F, Goldenberg A, Grotto S, Héron D, Karmous-Benailly H, Keren B, Lacombe D, Lapierre JM, Le Caignec C, Le Galloudec E, Le Merrer M, Le Moing AG, Mathieu-Dramard M, Nusbaum S, Pichon O, Pinson L, Raoul O, Rio M, Romana S, Roubertie A, Colleaux L, Turleau C, Vekemans M, Nabbout R, Malan V | display-authors = 6 | title = Phenotype-genotype correlations in 17 new patients with an Xp11.23p11.22 microduplication and review of the literature | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics. Part A | volume = 167A | issue = 1 | pages = 111–22 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25425167 | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.a.36807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speech Delay ===
Speech is very commonly affected and usually the first sign. Both speech and comprehension seem to be affected, to various degrees of extent. Low facial muscle tone underlies difficulty in making certain sounds of speech. Nasal or hoarse voice are also observed. Babies are known to be unable to suck from breast in their infancy due to weak facial muscles.

=== Early Puberty ===
Early puberty occurs in 80% of the affected children or adults, with girls starting their menstrual cycles as early as age 9 and boys showing signs of puberty at age 8.5. One boy from ''Unique'' had completed puberty by age 13.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weight problems ===
Affected children show tendency to be overweight. This might indicate metabolism issues.

=== Lower-extremity Anomalies ===
Anomalies of lower limbs or feet are common in people with an Xp11.2 duplication, affecting about 71% cases. Features include [[flat feet]], arched feet ([[pes cavus]]), [[clubfoot]] (talipes), narrow feet, webbed or joined toes/fingers ([[syndactyly]]), 5th finger [[clinodactyly]], 5th toe [[hypoplasia]], and tapering fingers.&lt;ref name="Giorda_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Firth HV, Richards SM, Bevan AP, Clayton S, Corpas M, Rajan D, Van Vooren S, Moreau Y, Pettett RM, Carter NP | title = DECIPHER: Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 524–33 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19344873 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unusual EEG Pattern ===
A typical pattern of electrical activity in the brain of affected children, described as ‘[[subclinical seizure]]s’ has been noted. A peculiar electroencephalographic pattern characterized by rolandic-like spikes and/or continuous spike wave during slow sleep (CSWS), also called centro-temporal focal spike, exists in childhood.&lt;ref name="Giorda_2009" /&gt;

=== Minor Facial Features ===
The common unusual features include a short or flat groove between the nose and upper lip ([[philtrum]]), a large, high or deep nasal bridge, bushy eyebrows and/or uni-brow ([[Unibrow|synophrys]]), and thin lips.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giorda_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Genetics ==
The duplication at Xp11.2, especially the Xp11.22-11.23 region is syndromic and is implicated in [[X-Linked mental retardation|X-linked mental retardation.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|300705|Chromosome Xp11.22 Duplication Syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Honda_2010" /&gt; The chromosomal duplication can be ''de novo'' or familial. Familial carriers of small duplication (&lt;1 Mb) show X-linked recessive inheritance. All other affected individuals with larger duplication present dominant expression and comparable clinical phenotypes irrespective of sex, duplication size, and X-inactivation pattern.&lt;ref name="Giorda_2009" /&gt;

Xp11.22 comprises approximately 5 Mb of DNA (chrX:49,800,001–54,800,000, hg19). A number of pathogenic deletions and duplications involving Xp11.22 have been described in individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability and/or autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grau C, Starkovich M, Azamian MS, Xia F, Cheung SW, Evans P, Henderson A, Lalani SR, Scott DA | title = Xp11.22 deletions encompassing CENPVL1, CENPVL2, MAGED1 and GSPT2 as a cause of syndromic X-linked intellectual disability | journal = PLOS One | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = e0175962 | date = 2017-04-17 | pmid = 28414775 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0175962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These phenotypes have been attributed to changes in the copy number of several genes including ''[[HUWE1]]'', ''[[KDM5C]], [[IQSEC2]], [[TSPYL2]], SHROOM4,'' ''[[PHF8]]'' and ''[[FAM120C]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orivoli S, Pavlidis E, Cantalupo G, Pezzella M, Zara F, Garavelli L, Pisani F, Piccolo B | title = Xp11.22 Microduplications Including HUWE1: Case Report and Literature Review | journal = Neuropediatrics | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–6 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26587761 | doi = 10.1055/s-0035-1566233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moey_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moey C, Hinze SJ, Brueton L, Morton J, McMullan DJ, Kamien B, Barnett CP, Brunetti-Pierri N, Nicholl J, Gecz J, Shoubridge C | title = Xp11.2 microduplications including IQSEC2, TSPYL2 and KDM5C genes in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 373–80 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26059843 | pmc = 4757771 | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2015.123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''HUWE1'' ===

This suggests both increased and decreased ''HUWE1'' function could be associated with intellectual disability, but evidence from an ''in vivo'' model system supporting or refuting this possibility remains absent.

=== ''KDM5C'' ===
''[[KDM5C]]'' (Lysine-Specific Demethylase 5C) also known as jumonji, A/T-rich interactive domain 1C (''[[JARID1C]]'')  is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22-p11.21. The gene encodes a 1560 amino-acid protein that belongs to the JARID1 subfamily of Arid DNA-binding proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kortschak RD, Tucker PW, Saint R | title = ARID proteins come in from the desert | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 294–9 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10838570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein possesses H3K4me3-specific demethylase activity and is shown to function as a transcriptional repressor through the RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST) complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwase S, Lan F, Bayliss P, de la Torre-Ubieta L, Huarte M, Qi HH, Whetstine JR, Bonni A, Roberts TM, Shi Y | title = The X-linked mental retardation gene SMCX/JARID1C defines a family of histone H3 lysine 4 demethylases | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 6 | pages = 1077–88 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17320160 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''IQSEC2'' ===
IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 ''([[IQSEC2]]),'' also known as ''BRAG1'' or ''IQ-ARFGEF'', is located on the X chromosome at Xp11.22 and encodes [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] for the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins (ARFGEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagase T, Ishikawa K, Suyama M, Kikuno R, Hirosawa M, Miyajima N, Tanaka A, Kotani H, Nomura N, Ohara O | title = Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes.

A change of guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity may influence the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and neuronal development in the brain by reduced activation of the ''ARF6'' substrate or a defect in the GTP-binding activity.&lt;ref name="Shoubridge_2010" /&gt;

Two intragenic duplications predicted to cause termination mutations on the X-chromosome involving ''IQSEC2'' were identified in two ''de novo'' cases, and one nonsense mutation was described in three additional male patients presenting severe intellectual disability and additional clinical features including neonatal [[hypotonia]], delayed motor skills, seizures, [[strabismus]], autistic-like behavior, stereotypic midline hand movements, [[microcephaly]], little-to-no walking, little-to-no language skills, significant behavioral issues, and mildly abnormal facial features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tran Mau-Them F, Willems M, Albrecht B, Sanchez E, Puechberty J, Endele S, Schneider A, Ruiz Pallares N, Missirian C, Rivier F, Girard M, Holder M, Manouvrier S, Touitou I, Lefort G, Sarda P, Moncla A, Drunat S, Wieczorek D, Genevieve D | title = Expanding the phenotype of IQSEC2 mutations: truncating mutations in severe intellectual disability | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 289–92 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 23674175 | pmc = 3895633 | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2013.113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A novel ''de novo'' mutation in the ''IQSEC2'' gene identified through diagnostic exome sequencing showed significant developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, vision impairments, [[plagiocephaly]], autistic-like features, absent language skills, and abnormal MRI findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gandomi SK, Farwell Gonzalez KD, Parra M, Shahmirzadi L, Mancuso J, Pichurin P, Temme R, Dugan S, Zeng W, Tang S | title = Diagnostic exome sequencing identifies two novel IQSEC2 mutations associated with X-linked intellectual disability with seizures: implications for genetic counseling and clinical diagnosis | journal = Journal of Genetic Counseling | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–98 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24306141 | doi = 10.1007/s10897-013-9671-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''IQSEC2'' gene plays a larger role in the cause of X-linked cognitive impairment than previously thought. Additional consideration is warranted with regards to the syndromic nature of its phenotypic association.

'''Yoga nidra''' ({{lang-sa|योग निद्रा}}) or '''yogic sleep''') is a state of [[consciousness]] between waking and sleeping, like the "going-to-sleep" stage. It is a state in which the body is completely relaxed, and the practitioner becomes systematically and increasingly aware of the inner world by following a set of verbal instructions. This state of consciousness (yoga nidra) is different from meditation in which concentration on a single focus is required. In yoga nidra the practitioner remains in a state of light withdrawal of the 5 senses ([[pratyahara]]) with four of his or her senses internalised, that is, withdrawn, and only the hearing still connects to the instructions. The yogic goal of both paths, deep relaxation (yoga nidra) and meditation are the same, a state of meditative consciousness called [[samadhi]]. 

Yoga nidra is among the deepest possible states of relaxation while still maintaining full consciousness. In [[lucid dreaming]], one is only, or mainly, cognizant of the dream environment, and has little or no awareness of one's actual environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meditationmojo.com/meditation-articles/advanced-meditation/lucid-sleeping-yoga-nidra|title=Lucid Sleeping (Yoga Nidra) - Meditation Mojo|website=www.meditationmojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The practice of yoga relaxation{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} has been found to reduce tension and anxiety. The autonomic symptoms of high anxiety such as headache, giddiness, chest pain, palpitations, sweating and abdominal pain respond well. It has been used to help soldiers from war cope with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, Eileen. ''A Breath of Hope.'' [[Washington Post]] Tuesday, May 6, 2008; Page HE01. https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/02/AR2008050203426.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoga nidra refers to the conscious awareness of the deep sleep state, referred to as ''[[Prajna (Vedic)|prajna]]'' in [[Mandukya Upanishad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mandukya Upanishad: Enlightenment Without God |last=Rama |first=Swami |isbn=0-89389-084-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background ==
The concept of yoga nidra is very ancient in Indian traditions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Lord [[ Krishna]] is often associated with yoga nidra in the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. Similarly, many yogis and rishis are supposed to have experienced yoga nidra throughout their life.

In modern times, yoga nidra was experienced by [[Satyananda Saraswati]] {{Citation needed|reason=no reliable source|date=December 2011}} when he was living with his guru [[Sivananda Saraswati]] in [[Rishikesh]]. He began studying the tantric scriptures and, after practice, constructed a system of relaxation, which he began popularizing in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="(Swami)1974"&gt;{{cite book

|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained yoga nidra as a state of mind between wakefulness and sleep that opened deep phases of the mind, suggesting a connection with the ancient [[tantra|tantric]] practice called [[Nyasa (ritual)|nyasa]], whereby [[Sanskrit]] [[mantras]] are mentally placed within specific body parts, while meditating on each part (of the [[bodymind]]). The form of practice taught by Satyananda includes eight stages (internalisation, sankalpa, rotation of consciousness, breath awareness, manifestation of opposites, creative visualization, sankalpa and externalisation).

Satyananda used this technique, along with suggestion, on the child who was to become his successor, [[Niranjanananda Saraswati]], from the age of four. He claims to have taught him several languages by this method.
