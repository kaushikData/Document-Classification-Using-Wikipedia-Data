'''Archduke Wilhelm Franz of Austria''', later '''Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen''' (10 February 1895 &amp;ndash; 18 August 1948), also known as '''[[Basil (name)|Basil]] the Embroidered''' ({{lang-uk|Василь Вишиваний|Vasyl Vyshyvani}}), was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] [[archduke]], a [[colonel]] of the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]],{{cn|date=March 2016}} and a [[poet]].

==Background and early life==
Archduke Wilhelm was the youngest son of [[Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria|Archduke Karl Stephan]] and [[Archduchess Maria Theresia, Princess of Tuscany]]. He was born in a family estate on the [[Lošinj]] island, [[Austrian Littoral]] (present day [[Croatia]]).

Accommodating the 19th-century rise of [[nationalism]], [[Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria|Archduke Karl Stephan]] decided that his branch of the Habsburg family would adopt a Polish identity and would combine a loyalty to their Habsburg family with a loyalty to Poland. Accordingly, he had his children learn Polish from an early age and tried to instill in them a sense of Polish patriotism. His oldest son, [[Archduke Karl Albrecht of Austria|Karl-Albrecht]], would become a Polish officer who refused to renounce his Polish loyalty even under torture by the [[Gestapo]]. Karl Stefan's two younger daughters would marry into the Polish noble families of [[Radziwill]] and [[Czartoryski]]. Wilhelm, the youngest child, rebelled, and came to identify with the Poles' rivals, the Ukrainians. He developed a fascination with [[Ukrainian culture]], and as a youth escaped from his family's estate, travelling incognito to [[Hutsul]] villages in the nearby [[Carpathian mountains]] and [[Bukovyna]] (the Land of [[Cheremosh river|Cheremosh]] and [[Prut river|Prut]]). This interest in the relatively impoverished Ukrainian people earned him the nickname of the "Red Prince". Eventually the Habsburgs came to accept and encourage this interest, and he was groomed by them to take a leadership role amongst the Ukrainian people in a manner similar to the one in which his father and older brother were to take amongst the Habsburgs' Polish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder (2008). Red Prince: the Secret Lives of a Habsburg Archduke. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities in Ukrainian nation-building==
Eventually approved by his father, his as well as his father's ambition became for Wilhelm to become the king of Ukraine. Despite his youth, he played an important historical role. As a member of the [[Habsburg]] imperial house he came to work closely with Ukrainian deputies to the parliament of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in an effort to gain more rights for the Ukrainian minority, serving as a liaison between the Ukrainian community leaders and Austria's emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]]. During the [[First World War]] he commanded a detachment of Ukrainians from [[Halychyna]], serving as a [[lieutenant]] with the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen]].  During the [[Germany|German]] and Austrian occupation of [[Ukraine]] in 1918, he commanded a separate [[Sich Riflemen]] regiment that fought against [[Bolsheviks]] in [[Southern Ukraine]].

During the time of his stay in Southern Ukraine, Wilhelm became the focal point of a quiet struggle between the two allies, [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[German Empire]], for the future of Ukraine which they both occupied. The Habsburgs hoped for Ukraine to be a politically self-sufficient ally in order to counter German power.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). pg. 100 - In the words of Austria's military intelligence officer responsible for Ukraine - "We, as the creators of the first Ukrainian military unit, are called upon to enter Ukraine as leaders - against Germany!"&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, they planned for Wilhelm to eventually become Ukraine's king and supported his efforts to gain popularity among Ukraine's people as well as to promote Ukrainian patriotism.  The Germans, on the other hand, were primarily concerned with obtaining grain, and supported [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]]'s [[Ukrainian State|rule]].

Promoted to the rank of captain, Wilhelm was made commander of "Battle Group Archduke Wilhelm," created by the Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]], and provided with approximately 4,000 Ukrainian soldiers and officers under his command.  His troops occupied a small area near the site of the old Zaporozhian Sich, and were tasked with supporting the Ukrainian national cause in any way possible.  This was done by screening officials by ethnicity, creating a newspaper, and engaging in cultural work with local peasants.  Wilhelm mixed easily with the local peasants, who admired his ability to live simply like his soldiers.  Within Wilhelm's personal occupation zone, peasants were allowed to keep the lands that they had taken from the landlords in 1917, and Wilhelm prevented the Habsburg armed forces from requisitioning grain.  Ukrainians who had resisted requisitioning elsewhere - including those who had killed German or Austrian soldiers - were given refuge within Wilhelm's territory.  These actions outraged Germany and Austrian officials in Kiev, but increased his popularity among local Ukrainians, who referred to him as affectionately as "Prince Vasyl." The Germans feared that Wilhelm would create a coup and overthrow the [[Ukrainian_State|Hetmanate]].  Indeed, several attempts by Ukrainians were made to make Archduke Wilhelm a sovereign of Ukraine, transforming the country into a [[monarchy]].  Each time he deferred to the opinion of the Austrian Emperor, who at the time denied Wilhelm's requests for diplomatic reasons.   Nevertheless, Charles I resisted German pressure to have Wilhelm removed from Ukraine.  Wilhelm and his soldiers were finally ordered out of Ukraine in October 1918 due to the revolutionary conditions there, moving to [[Bukovina]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). pp.101-116&lt;/ref&gt; Through his intervention, in October 1918 two regiments of mostly Ukrainian troops were garrisoned in [[Lemberg]] (modern [[Lviv]]).&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt; This would set the stage for the declaration of the [[West Ukrainian National Republic]] on November 1.

[[File:Bolbochan&amp;Habsburg.jpg|thumb|200px|With Petr Bolbochan in the Ukraine (1918)]]

Following Austria's dissolution, Wilhelm ordered his men to travel from Bukovina to Lviv to fight for the Ukrainian cause.  He himself fled to that city after Romanian forces captured Bukovina, but was told by the president of the West Ukrainian National Republic that his services were not needed, and retired to a nearby monastery.  As a Habsburg, he had become a liability to the Ukrainian cause, which was being portrayed to the Allies by its Polish enemies as an Austrian plot.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  After pledging loyalty to the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], in 1919 he was made a [[colonel]] of its army and worked for the Ministry of Defense of the country. In protest at [[Symon Petlura|Petlura's]] [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|peace treaty with Poland in 1920]], which he considered to be a betrayal of Western Ukraine, he resigned and lived in exile in [[Vienna]] and [[Paris]].

==Later life==
In an interview in a Viennese newspaper in January 1921, Wilhelm publicly rebuked Poland, condemning the [[Lwów pogrom (1918)|pogroms in Lwow]] as something that would never happen in a civilized country, and referring to Poland and Poles as dishonorable. This caused a permanent, public estrangement between Wilhelm and his father [[Archduke Charles Stephen of Austria|Stephan]]. In 1921 Wilhelm published a book of poetry in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], ''Mynayut Dni'' (Минають дні - The days pass).

That same year, he became involved in various plots by monarchists and other wishing to overthrow the new order following the first world war. He founded a Ukrainian veterans' organization in Vienna, briefly reconciled with his one-time rival [[Pavlo Skoropadskyi]], and established contact with German counter-revolutionaries and monarchists such as [[Max Bauer]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]], who helped fund a Ukrainian paramilitary organization in Vienna known as the Free Cossacks (estimated by Austrian police as numbering 40,000). Wilhelm's uncompromising attitude towards Poland made him popular among Ukrainian exiles, and he spent much of 1921 recruiting an invasion army of Ukraine. At this time, he was viewed by French and Polish intelligence as the Ukrainians' unquestioned leader and a viable candidate for the Ukrainian throne, respectively. Such plans aroused the anger of the exiled [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], which had been discredited by its alliance with Poland (and continued to receive subsidies from the Polish government) and saw in Wilhelm a rival for Ukrainian allegiance. Seeking to upstage Wilhelm's planned invasion, the Ukrainian People's Republic invaded Soviet Ukraine on its own in November 1921 with several thousand soldiers. Its quick defeat discredited the idea of an invasion of Ukraine, and caused Wilhelm's German financial supporters to cease their subsidization of his project, which then collapsed. Under his Ukrainian name Vasyl Vyshyvani, he left Austria for Spain in 1922 from which he hoped in vain to obtain financial support for his Ukrainian adventure from his cousin, King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). pp.138-148&lt;/ref&gt;

When all of his attempts to gain power in Ukraine failed to produce results, Wilhelm moved to Paris where he led a [[bisexual]] and increasingly [[hedonistic]] lifestyle. He spent part of his time in salons among other aristocrats, but the remainder in gay bars - favouring black rent-boys and sailors. An informant for the French police claimed that Wilhelm  carried on a sexual relationship with two of his male assistants.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he became enmeshed in a legal situation caused by his lover Paulette Couyba, who had used Wilhelm without his knowledge to swindle investors of hundreds of thousands of Francs.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). pp. 173-181&lt;/ref&gt; During the sensationalistic and well-publicized trial, Wilhelm fled Paris for Vienna.

In the mid- to late 1930s, Wilhelm resumed his nationalistic Ukrainian activities. He established contact with old comrades-in-arms from the Galician Sich Rifles [[Yevhen Konovalets]] and [[Andriy Atanasovych Melnyk|Andriy Melnyk]], who now headed the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Although as a young man he had been pro-Jewish, Wilhelm began to espouse anti-Semitism and grew close to a circle within the Nazi party, led by [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who advocated an allied Ukrainian state.

When by 1941 it became clear to Wilhelm that the Nazis would not support Ukrainian independence, however, he turned against the Nazis, spying for the British during much of the [[Second World War]]. His last years were as a spy for the French against the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008).pp. 230, 233-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet imprisonment==
[[File:Bw5 4.jpg|thumb|125px|Wilhelm of Austria in Soviet captivity]]

In 1947 he was arrested by [[USSR|Soviet]] military counter-intelligence [[SMERSH]] in [[Vienna]] and brought to [[Lukyanivska Prison|Lukyanivka Prison]] in [[Kiev]]. During his imprisonment he insisted on speaking the [[Ukrainian language]] at interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 August 1948 the decision was made to transport him to the western Ukraine in order to serve a 25-year prison sentence. Before this could be carried out, on 18 August he died of untreated [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (2008). pg. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automated Lip Reading''' (ALR) is a software technology developed by [[speech recognition]] expert [[Frank Hubner]]. A video image of a person talking can be analysed by the software. The shapes made by the lips can be examined and then turned into sounds. The sounds are compared to a dictionary to create matches to the words being spoken.

The technology was used successfully to analyse silent home movie footage of [[Adolf Hitler]] taken by [[Eva Braun]] at their [[Bavaria]]n retreat [[Berghof (Hitler)|Berghof]].

The video, with words, was included in a documentary titled [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xlvimo_hitler-s-private-world-2006-revealed_shortfilms "Hitler's Private World", Revealed Studios, 2006]

'''BYOB''' or '''BYO''' is an [[Acronym#Nomenclature|initialism]] concerning [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] that is usually meant to stand for "bring your own bottle”, though it expanded to also stand for similar phrases such as “bring your own beverage”, "bring your own booze", or, when relevant, “bring your own beer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

BYOB is sometimes placed on an invitation to indicate that the host will not be providing [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] and that guests are welcome to bring their own. Some restaurants and business establishments (especially in areas where [[liquor license]]s are difficult to obtain) allow patrons to bring their own bottle, sometimes subject to fees or membership conditions, or because the establishment itself does not have license to sell alcohol.

==Etymology==
The term is cited by some online sources{{which|date=June 2017}} to have been used first in the early 1970s to mean "bring your own bottle (of wine)", although in present-day it is just as likely to mean "bring your own booze" or "bring your own beer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/BYOB | title=BYOB - Definitions from Dictionary.com | accessdate=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used by small restaurants that did not have liquor licenses, but which were responding to the new popularity of wine among Americans by advising customers that they could BYOB and drink it with their meal.

==Corkage==
Some establishments that sell alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption, such as [[bar]]s or [[restaurant]]s, may also allow patrons to bring their own alcohol purchased from elsewhere.  That alcohol is usually subject to an ''opening fee''.  Often the rule is limited to bottles of [[wine]], where the fee is known as ''corkage'' or a ''corking fee''.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 117 &amp; 200"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 117 &amp; 200 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/rise-bring-your-own-booze-surprisingly-high-end-restaurants/|title=The rise of bring-your-own-booze (in surprisingly high-end restaurants)|author=Madeleine Howell|date=24 May 2018|accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such policies are greatly regulated by local liquor control laws and [[liquor license|licensing]] restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sla.ny.gov/bring-your-own-bottle-byob|title=Bring Your Own Bottle (BYOB)|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottle club===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
As an alternative to the traditional full-service liquor license, some jurisdictions offer a similar license known as a ''bottle club'' license.  It allows the business establishment to serve alcohol on the premises, but only if patrons brought the alcohol from elsewhere.  The license generally prohibits the business from selling its own stock of alcoholic beverages.  The license may require that patrons be members of the establishment.  Such licenses may be preferred in situations where fees or zoning conditions imposed by a full-service liquor license are unwanted or impractical.  They may also be the only license available, as some jurisdictions impose full-service liquor license quotas or business class restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013|reason=This doesn't explain when or where (which country) this applied}}

===Regional variations===
In [[Australian wine|Australia]] and [[New Zealand wine|New Zealand]], the term "BYO" (Bring Your Own) emerged to describe business establishments that offered corkage. It is believed that restaurants in [[Melbourne]], in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], were advertising as "BYO" establishments by the 1960s with the concept becoming popular in New Zealand in the late 1970s.

Legally, using New Zealand as an example,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0063/latest/DLM165615.html#DLM165615|title=Sale of Liquor Act 1989 No 63 (as at 18 December 2013), Public Act 28 Special provisions relating to BYO restaurants – New Zealand Legislation|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; if your premises only holds an on-licence-endorsed (BYOB license), you as an owner and duty manager with a General Manager's Certificate are forbidden to have a wine list and sell alcohol on the premises.  You must have both On-License &amp; On-License-Endorsed to have a wine list and allow BYOB, thus calling your restaurant 'fully licensed'.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''Backus–Naur form''' or '''Backus normal form''' ('''BNF''') is a [[metasyntax|notation technique]] for [[context-free grammar]]s, often used to describe the [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of [[Formal language#Programming languages|languages]] used in computing, such as computer [[programming language]]s, [[document format]]s, [[instruction set]]s and [[communication protocol]]s. They are applied wherever exact descriptions of languages are needed: for instance, in official language specifications, in manuals, and in textbooks on programming language theory.

Many extensions and variants of the original Backus–Naur notation are used; some are exactly defined, including [[extended Backus–Naur form]] (EBNF) and [[augmented Backus–Naur form]] (ABNF).

==History==
The idea of describing the structure of language using rewriting rules can be traced back to at least the work of [[Pāṇini]] (ancient Indian Sanskrit grammarian and a revered scholar in Hinduism who lived sometime between the 7th and 4th century [[BCE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Panini.html |title=Panini biography |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ingerman |first=Peter Zilahy |date=March 1967 |title="Pāṇini-Backus Form" Suggested |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=363165 |journal=Communications of the ACM |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |volume=10 |issue=3 |page=137 |doi=10.1145/363162.363165 |accessdate=24 September 2014}} Ingerman suggests that the Backus Normal Form be renamed to the [[Pāṇini]]-Backus Form, to give due credit to Pāṇini as the earliest independent inventor.&lt;/ref&gt;
His notation to describe [[Sanskrit]] word structure notation is equivalent in power to that of Backus and has many similar properties.

In Western society, grammar was long regarded as a subject for teaching, rather than scientific study; descriptions were informal and targeted at practical usage.  In the first half of the 20th century, [[linguistics|linguists]] such as [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Zellig Harris]] started attempts to formalize the description of language, including phrase structure.

Meanwhile, string rewriting rules as [[mathematical formalism|formal, abstract system]]s were introduced and studied by mathematicians such as [[Axel Thue]] (in 1914), [[Emil Post]] (1920s–40s) and [[Alan Turing]] (1936).  [[Noam Chomsky]], teaching linguistics to students of [[information theory]] at [[MIT]], combined linguistics and mathematics by taking what is essentially Thue's formalism as the basis for the description of the syntax of [[natural language]]. He also introduced a clear distinction between generative rules (those of [[context-free grammar]]s) and transformation rules (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[John W. Backus|John Backus]], a programming language designer at [[IBM]], proposed a [[metalanguage]] of "metalinguistic formulas"&lt;ref name=class&gt;The meaning of syntactic formula may be further explained by saying that words enclosed in the brackets &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ab&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, denote classes whose members are sequences of basic symbols. Class designations of this kind are found in any description of a language. For describing ordinary natural languages designation like word, verb, noun, are used. Peter Naur (1961).{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1064049&amp;CFID=648579078&amp;CFTOKEN=25521706|title=A COURSE ON ALGOL PROGRAMMING|page=5, Note 1. |accessdate=26 March 2015}}

to describe the syntax of the new programming language IAL, known today as [[ALGOL 58]] (1959).  His notation was first used in the ALGOL 60 report.

BNF is a notation for Chomsky's context-free grammars. Apparently, Backus was familiar with Chomsky's work.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

As proposed by Backus, the formula defined "classes" whose names are enclosed in angle brackets.  For example, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ab&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Each of these names denotes a class of basic symbols.&lt;ref name=class/&gt;

Further development of [[ALGOL]] led to [[ALGOL 60]]. In the committee's 1963 report, [[Peter Naur]] called Backus's notation ''Backus normal form''. [[Donald Knuth]] argued that BNF should rather be read as ''Backus–Naur form'', as it is "not a [[normal form (term rewriting)|normal form]] in the conventional sense",&lt;ref&gt;

unlike, for instance, [[Chomsky normal form]].  The name ''Pāṇini Backus form'' was also once suggested in view of the fact that the expansion ''Backus normal form'' may not be accurate, and that [[Pāṇini]] had independently developed a similar notation earlier.

BNF, as described by Peter Naur in the ALGOL 60 report is ''metalinguistic formula''. "''Sequences of characters enclosed in the brackets &lt;&gt; represent metalinguistic variables whose values are sequences of symbols. The marks "::=" and "|" (the latter with the meaning of "or") are metalinguistic connectives. Any mark in a formula, which is not a variable or a connective, denotes itself. Juxtaposition of marks or variables in a formula signifies juxtaposition of the sequence denoted.''"&lt;ref name=ALGOL60RPT&gt;Revised ALGOL 60 report section. 1.1.{{cite web|url=http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm|title=ALGOL 60|accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example from the ALGOL 60 report illustrates a major difference between the BNF metalanguage and a Chomsky context-free grammar. Metalingustic variables do not require a rule defining their formation. Their formation may simply be described in natural language within the &lt;&gt; brackets. The following ALGOL 60 report section 2.3 comments specification, exemplifies how this works:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the purpose of including text among the symbols of a program the following "comment" conventions hold:

{|class="wikitable" 
| The sequence of basic symbols:
| is equivalent to
|----
| ''';''' '''comment''' &amp;lt;any sequence not containing ';'&amp;gt;;
| ''';'''
|----
| '''begin''' '''comment''' &amp;lt;any sequence not containing ';'&amp;gt;;
| '''begin'''
|----
| '''end''' &amp;lt;any sequence not containing 'end' or ';' or 'else'&amp;gt;
| '''end'''
|----
|}

By equivalence is here meant that any of the three structures shown in the left column may be replaced, in any occurrence outside of strings, by the symbol shown in the same line in the right column without any effect on the action of the program.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Naur changed two of Backus's symbols to commonly available characters. The "::=" symbol was originally a ":≡". The "|" symbol was originally the word "{{overline|or}}" (with a bar over it).&lt;ref name="Backus.1969"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Working for IBM, Backus would have had a non-disclosure agreement and couldn't have talked about his source if it came from an IBM proprietary project. BNF is very similar to [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|canonical-form]] [[boolean algebra]] equations that are, and were at the time, used in logic-circuit design. Backus was a mathematician and the designer of the FORTRAN programming language. Studies of boolean algebra is commonly part of a mathematics. What we do know is that neither Backus nor Naur described the names enclosed in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as non-terminals. Chomsky terminology was not originally used in describing BNF. Naur later described them as classes in ALGOL course materials.&lt;ref name=class/&gt; In the ALGOL 60 report they were called metalinguistic variables. Anything other than the metasymbols ::=, |, and class names enclosed in &lt;,&gt; are symbols of the language being defined. The metasymbols ::= is to be interpreted as "is defined as". The | is used to separate alternative definitions and is interpreted as "or". The metasymbols &lt;,&gt; are delimiters enclosing a class name. BNF is described as a [[metalanguage]] for talking about ALGOL by Peter Naur and [[Saul Rosen]].&lt;ref name=class/&gt; In 1947 [[Saul Rosen]] became involved in the activities of the fledgling [[Association for Computing Machinery]], first on the languages committee that became the IAL group and eventually led to ALGOL. He was the first managing editor of the Communications of the ACM.{{clarify|reason=The ACM was founded in 1947. ACM SIGPLAN wasn't founded earlier.|date=May 2015}} What we do know is that BNF was first used as a metalanguage to talk about the ALGOL language in the ALGOL 60 report. That is how it is explained in ALGOL programming course material developed by Peter Naur in 1962.&lt;ref name=class/&gt; Early ALGOL manuals by IBM, Honeywell, Burroughs and Digital Equipment Corporation followed the ALGOL 60 report using it as a metalanguage. Saul Rosen in his book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Saul Rosen | authorlink=Saul Rosen| title=Programming Systems and Languages | location=New York/NY | publisher=McGraw Hill | series=McGraw Hill Computer Science Series |date=Jan 1967 | isbn=0070537089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes BNF as a metalanguage for talking about ALGOL. An example of its use as a metalanguage would be in defining an arithmetic expression:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bnf"&gt;
&lt;expr&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt;|&lt;expr&gt;&lt;addop&gt;&lt;term&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The first symbol of an alternative may be the class being defined, the repetition, as explained by Naur, having the function of specifying that the alternative sequence can recursively begin with a previous alternative and can be repeated any number of times.&lt;ref name=class/&gt; For example, above &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is defined as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;term&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; followed by any number of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;addop&amp;gt; &amp;lt;term&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

In some later metalanguages such as Schorre's [[META II]] the BNF recursive repeat construct is replaced by a sequence operator and target language symbols defined using quoted strings. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; bracket removed. Mathematical grouping &lt;code&gt;( )&lt;/code&gt; were added. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; rule would appear in META II as

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
EXPR = TERM $('+' TERM .OUT('ADD') | '-' TERM .OUT('SUB'));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

These changes made that META II and its derivative programming languages able to define and extend their own metalanguage.  In so doing the ability to use a natural language description, metalinguistic variable, language construct description was lost. Many spin-off metalanguages were inspired by BNF. See [[META II]], [[TREE-META]], and [[Metacompiler]].

A BNF class describes a language construct formation, with formation defined as a pattern or the action of forming the pattern. The class name expr is described in a natural language as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;term&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; followed by a sequence &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;addop&amp;gt; &amp;lt;term&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. A class is an abstraction, we can talk about it independent of its formation. We can talk about term, independent of its definition, as being added or subtracted in expr. We can talk about a term being a specific data type and how an expr is to be evaluated having specific combinations of data types. Or even reordering an expression to group data types and evaluation results of mixed types. The natural-language supplement provided specific details of the language class semantics to be used by a compiler implementation and a programmer writing an ALGOL program. Natural-language description further supplemented the syntax as well. The integer rule is a good example of natural and metalanguage used to describe syntax:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bnf"&gt;
&lt;integer&gt; ::= &lt;digit&gt;|&lt;integer&gt;&lt;digit&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

There are no specifics on white space in the above. As far as the rule states, we could have space between the digits. In the natural language we complement the BNF metalanguage by explaining that the digit sequence can have no white space between the digits. English is only one of the possible natural languages. Translations of the ALGOL reports were available in many natural languages.

The origin of BNF is not as important as its impact on programming language development. During the period immediately following the publication of the ALGOL 60 report BNF was the basis of many [[compiler-compiler]] systems. Some directly used BNF like "A Syntax Directed Compiler for ALGOL 60" developed by [[Edgar T. Irons]] and "A Compiler Building System" Developed by Brooker and Morris. Others changed it to a programming language. The Schorre Metacompilers made it a programming language with only a few changes. &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;class name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; became symbol identifiers dropping the enclosing &lt;,&gt; and using quoted strings for symbols of the target language. Arithmetic like grouping provided simplification that removed using classes where grouping was its only value. The META II arithmetic expression rule shows grouping use. Output expressions placed in a META II rule are used to output code and labels in an assembly language. Rules in META II are equivalent to a class definitions in BNF. The Unix utility [[yacc]] is based on BNF with code production similar to META II. Though yacc is most commonly used as a parser generator, its roots are obviously BNF. BNF today is one of the oldest computer-related languages still in use.

==Introduction==
A BNF specification is a set of derivation rules, written as
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bnf"&gt;
 &lt;symbol&gt; ::= __expression__
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

where &lt;[[symbol]]&gt;&lt;ref name=class/&gt; is a ''[[nonterminal]]'', and the [[expression (mathematics)|__expression__]] consists of one or more sequences of symbols; more sequences are separated by the [[vertical bar]] "|", indicating a [[alternation (formal language theory)|choice]], the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left. Symbols that never appear on a left side are ''[[Terminal symbol|terminal]]s''. On the other hand, symbols that appear on a left side are ''[[nonterminal symbol|non-terminal]]s'' and are always enclosed between the pair &lt;&gt;.&lt;ref name=class/&gt;

The "::=" means that the symbol on the left must be replaced with the expression on the right.

==Example==
As an example, consider this possible BNF for a U.S. [[address (geography)|postal address]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bnf"&gt;
 &lt;postal-address&gt; ::= &lt;name-part&gt; &lt;street-address&gt; &lt;zip-part&gt;

      &lt;name-part&gt; ::= &lt;personal-part&gt; &lt;last-name&gt; &lt;opt-suffix-part&gt; &lt;EOL&gt; 
                    | &lt;personal-part&gt; &lt;name-part&gt;

  &lt;personal-part&gt; ::= &lt;initial&gt; "." | &lt;first-name&gt;

 &lt;street-address&gt; ::= &lt;house-num&gt; &lt;street-name&gt; &lt;opt-apt-num&gt; &lt;EOL&gt;

       &lt;zip-part&gt; ::= &lt;town-name&gt; "," &lt;state-code&gt; &lt;ZIP-code&gt; &lt;EOL&gt;

&lt;opt-suffix-part&gt; ::= "Sr." | "Jr." | &lt;roman-numeral&gt; | ""
    &lt;opt-apt-num&gt; ::= &lt;apt-num&gt; | ""
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt; 
This translates into English as: 
* A postal address consists of a name-part, followed by a [[street name|street-address]] part, followed by a [[ZIP Code|zip-code]] part.
* A name-part consists of either: a personal-part followed by a [[last name]] followed by an optional [[Suffix (name)|suffix]] (Jr., Sr., or dynastic number) and [[end-of-line]], or a personal part followed by a name part (this rule illustrates the use of [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] in BNFs, covering the case of people who use multiple first and middle names and initials).
* A personal-part consists of either a [[first name]] or an [[initial]] followed by a dot.
* A street address consists of a house number, followed by a street name, followed by an optional [[apartment]] specifier, followed by an end-of-line.
* A zip-part consists of a [[town]]-name, followed by a comma, followed by a [[U.S. postal abbreviations|state code]], followed by a ZIP-code followed by an end-of-line.
* An opt-suffix-part consists of a suffix, such as "Sr.", "Jr." or a [[Roman numerals|roman-numeral]], or an empty string (i.e. nothing).
* An opt-apt-num consists of an apartment number or an empty string (i.e. nothing).

Note that many things (such as the format of a first-name, apartment specifier, ZIP-code, and Roman numeral) are left unspecified here. If necessary, they may be described using additional BNF rules.

==Further examples==
BNF's syntax itself may be represented with a BNF like the following:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="bnf"&gt;
 &lt;syntax&gt;         ::= &lt;rule&gt; | &lt;rule&gt; &lt;syntax&gt;
 &lt;rule&gt;           ::= &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; "&lt;" &lt;rule-name&gt; "&gt;" &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; "::=" &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;line-end&gt;
 &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; ::= " " &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; | ""
 &lt;expression&gt;     ::= &lt;list&gt; | &lt;list&gt; &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; "|" &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; &lt;expression&gt;
 &lt;line-end&gt;       ::= &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; &lt;EOL&gt; | &lt;line-end&gt; &lt;line-end&gt;
 &lt;list&gt;           ::= &lt;term&gt; | &lt;term&gt; &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; &lt;list&gt;
 &lt;term&gt;           ::= &lt;literal&gt; | "&lt;" &lt;rule-name&gt; "&gt;"
 &lt;literal&gt;        ::= '"' &lt;text1&gt; '"' | "'" &lt;text2&gt; "'"
 &lt;text1&gt;          ::= "" | &lt;character1&gt; &lt;text1&gt;
 &lt;text2&gt;          ::= '' | &lt;character2&gt; &lt;text2&gt;
 &lt;character&gt;      ::= &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; | &lt;symbol&gt;
 &lt;letter&gt;         ::= "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
 &lt;digit&gt;          ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
 &lt;symbol&gt;         ::=  "|" | " " | "!" | "#" | "$" | "%" | "&amp;" | "(" | ")" | "*" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." | "/" | ":" | ";" | "&gt;" | "=" | "&lt;" | "?" | "@" | "[" | "\" | "]" | "^" | "_" | "`" | "{" | "}" | "~"
 &lt;character1&gt;     ::= &lt;character&gt; | "'"
 &lt;character2&gt;     ::= &lt;character&gt; | '"'
 &lt;rule-name&gt;      ::= &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;rule-name&gt; &lt;rule-char&gt;
 &lt;rule-char&gt;      ::= &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; | "-"
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Note that "" is the [[empty string]].

The original BNF did not use quotes as shown in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;literal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; rule. This assumes that no [[whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] is necessary for proper interpretation of the rule.

&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;EOL&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; represents the appropriate [[newline|line-end]] specifier (in [[ASCII]], carriage-return, line-feed or both depending on the [[operating system]]). &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;rule-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;text&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; are to be substituted with a declared rule's name/label or literal text, respectively.

In the U.S. postal address example above, the entire block-quote is a syntax.  Each line or unbroken grouping of lines is a rule; for example one rule begins with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;name-part&amp;gt; ::=&lt;/code&gt;. The other part of that rule (aside from a line-end) is an expression, which consists of two lists separated by a pipe &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;.  These two lists consists of some terms (three terms and two terms, respectively).  Each term in this particular rule is a rule-name.

==Variants==
There are many variants and extensions of BNF, generally either for the sake of simplicity and succinctness, or to adapt it to a specific application. One common feature of many variants is the use of [[regular expression]] repetition operators such as &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;. The [[extended Backus–Naur form]] (EBNF) is a common one.

Another common extension is the use of square brackets around optional items. Although not present in the original ALGOL 60 report (instead introduced a few years later in [[International Business Machines|IBM]]'s [[PL/I]] definition), the notation is now universally recognised.

[[Augmented Backus–Naur form]] (ABNF) and Routing Backus–Naur form (RBNF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5511 RBNF].&lt;/ref&gt; are extensions commonly used to describe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) [[protocol (computing)|protocol]]s.

[[Parsing expression grammar]]s build on the BNF and [[regular expression]] notations to form an alternative class of [[formal grammar]], which is essentially [[analytic grammar|analytic]] rather than [[generative grammar|generative]] in character.

Many BNF specifications found online today are intended to be human-readable and are non-formal.  These often include many of the following syntax rules and extensions:
* Optional items enclosed in square brackets: &lt;code&gt;[&amp;lt;item-x&amp;gt;]&lt;/code&gt;.
* Items existing 0 or more times are enclosed in curly brackets or suffixed with an asterisk (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;) such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;word&amp;gt; ::= &amp;lt;letter&amp;gt; {&amp;lt;letter&amp;gt;}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;word&amp;gt; ::= &amp;lt;letter&amp;gt; &amp;lt;letter&amp;gt;*&lt;/code&gt; respectively.
* Items existing 1 or more times are suffixed with an addition (plus) symbol, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;.
* Terminals may appear in bold rather than italics, and non-terminals in plain text rather than angle brackets.
* Where items are grouped, they are enclosed in simple parentheses.

In this variant, each production for a given non-terminal is given a label, which can be used as a constructor of an [[algebraic data type]] representing that nonterminal.

'''Bhubanmohan Baruah''' ({{lang-as|[[:as:ভূৱন মোহন বৰুৱা|ভূবনমোহন বৰুৱা]]}}; 1914 - 1998) was a novelist, short story writer from [[Assam]]. He wrote many novels under the pen-name of '''Kanchan Baruah''' (কাঞ্চন বৰুৱা).&lt;ref name="enajori1"&gt;{{cite web |author=enajori.com |url=http://enajori.com/literature/authors/ |title=Authors |publisher=enajori.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703062421/http://enajori.com/literature/authors/ |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and works==
Baruah served as a member of the Film Finance Board of Assam Government. He was also known  as a painter and artist. Moreover, he directed a number of plays.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;ASSAMESE WRITER KANCHAN BARUA DEAD, [[The Assam Tribune]], 11 May 1998, Retrieved 2013-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a bachelor and had two brothers and two sisters.&lt;ref name="AT"/&gt;

The [[Government of Assam]] offered him literary pension.&lt;ref name="AT"/&gt;

He died in [[Shillong]] on 10 May 1998.&lt;ref name="AT"/&gt;

==Literary works==
Baruah was author of more than twenty other novels and some short stories. Some of the novels are:&lt;ref name="enajori1"/&gt;

'''Biomusic''' is a form of [[experimental music]] which deals with [[Natural sounds|sounds created or performed by non-humans]]. The definition is also sometimes extended to include sounds made by humans in a directly biological way. For instance, music that is created by the brain waves of the composer can also be called biomusic as can music created by the human body without the use of tools or instruments that are not part of the body ([[singing]] or vocalizing is usually excluded from this definition).

Biomusic can be divided into two basic categories: music that is created solely by the animal (or in some cases plant), and music which is based upon animal noises but which is arranged by a human composer.  Some forms of music use recorded sounds of nature as part of the music, for example [[new-age music]] uses the nature sounds as backgrounds for various musical [[soundscape]]s, and [[ambient music]] sometimes uses nature sounds modified with reverbs and delay units to make spacey versions of the nature sounds as part of the ambience.

==Forms==

===Bird song and/or biophonies in music===

The incorporation of [[bird song]] in music is one of the most widely studied forms of biomusic. Notable in this regard is the French composer [[Olivier Messiaen]] who began incorporating accurately transcribed bird songs into his music in 1952. One obstacle facing the use of bird songs in music is their complexity and usually very high register. Nevertheless, Messiaen included a variety of bird songs in many of his mature works including his ''[[Catalogue d'oiseaux]]'' ("Birds catalogue"), piano (1956–58) which incorporated songs from thirteen different birds. Also, he incorporated the themes of many birds in his orchestral piece, "''Chronochromie''".

In Western music, recordings of bird songs have also been used in numerous works. The first one is ''[[Pines of Rome]]'' (1924) by [[Ottorino Respighi]] (the third movement includes the sound of a [[nightingale]] recorded onto a phonograph, played in the concert hall during the movement's ending. This was something that had never been done before, and created discussion). A famous one is ''[[Cantus Arcticus]]'' (1972) by the Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]]. Subtitled ''Concerto for Birds and Orchestra'' this piece incorporates tape recordings of birdsong recorded near the Arctic Circle and on the bogs of Liminka in northern Finland.

A nightingale can be heard on [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Cirrus Minor (song)|Cirrus Minor]]" (''[[More (soundtrack)|More]]'', 1969) or "[[Grantchester Meadows (song)|Grantchester Meadows]]" (''[[Ummagumma]]'', 1969), a sample of tweeting birds on [[Laurie Anderson]]'s  "[[O Superman]]" (1981), [[seagull]]s within [[concept album]] ''[[L'Opéra du pauvre]]'' (1983) by French singer-songwriter [[Léo Ferré]]. The entire [[biophony]] of a [[soundscape]] can be heard on the [[Beaver &amp; Krause]] 1968 Warner Brothers album (released in 1970), "''In a Wild Sanctuary''", the first album on the theme of [[ecology]] and the first album to incorporate entire natural soundscapes as components of the orchestration. This work anticipated by 44 years, the 2014 Cheltenham Music Festival (UK) premier of "''The Great Animal Orchestra Symphony for Orchestra and Wild Soundscapes''," composed by [[Bernie Krause]] and Oxford (Balliol College) former composer-in-residence, [[Richard Blackford]], performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. This, too, features the first symphony based on ecological themes and the first to perform, live, with whole natural soundscapes informing the orchestral form and themes, just as biophonies and geophonies inspired music (rhythm, melody, organization of sound, timbre, and dynamic) at the dawn of cultural time.

Commissioned by the [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]], an international corps based in San Francisco, the score for ''Biophony,'' composed by Bernie Krause and Richard Blackford, consists almost entirely of biophonies and geophonies and premiered in 2015. It has been performed worldwide, since.

It is important to note that of the more than 13,100 bird species, less than 100 have been accepted into Western classical or other music genres (or .007%). With the exception of entire biophonies, the abstract and deconstructed selection of particular birds (and the voices of a few other non-human animals such as certain cetaceans or canids) in these genres have been largely predicated on the convenient ways in which they happen to fit the models consistent with the then-current paradigms of the Academy – those considered to be "musical" at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World's Wild Places, by Bernie Krause (Little Brown, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whale song in music===

Recorded [[whale song]] also frequently inspired [[20th century experimental music]]. One example is in [[George Crumb|George Crumb’s]] ''[[Vox Balaenae]]'' (Voice of the Whale), a composition for electric flute, electric cello, and amplified piano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgecrumb.net/comp/voice-p.html Vox Balaenae (Voice of the Whale)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511212137/http://www.georgecrumb.net/comp/voice-p.html |date=May 11, 2008 }} The official George Crumb home page (Retrieved 10 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Vox Balaenae does not include actual recorded whale songs, it is not a pure biomusic composition. Another similar piece that could be considered true biomusic is ''[[And God Created Great Whales]]'', a piece written in 1970 by American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]]. This work for orchestra and whale songs brings the recorded sounds of [[humpback whale|humpback]], [[bowhead whale|bowhead]], and [[orca|killer]] [[whales]] directly into the concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,197507,00.html And God Created Great Whales (1970) for Orchestra and Whale Songs] Artist direct (Retrieved 10 October 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The song "[[Il n'y a plus rien]]", from French singer-songwriter [[Léo Ferré]]'s eponymous album (1973), begins and ends with recorded whale songs mixed with a symphonic orchestra. Another piece utilizing recorded whale song is the ''Earth Mass (Missa Gaia)'' by [[Paul Winter]] (1982) which is performed at the Episcopal Church of St. John the Divine each year to celebrate the Feast of St. Francis. One of the movements uses a four note motive derived from a recorded humpback whale song that opens and closes that segment of the work.

===Neurofeedback===

Music created by [[neurofeedback]] relies on the brainwaves of a human subject to create music. An [[Electroencephalophone]] (a musical instrument that converts brain waves to sound) was first designed by [[Erkki Kurenniemi]] in the 1960s. American composer [[David Rosenboom]] further pioneered work with [[neurofeedback]] music as has [[Brazil]]ian [[composer]] [[Eduardo Reck Miranda]]. Neurofeedback composition is still in development, and though it is widely experimented with, it is still very uncommon to see it performed.

===Cybernetic biomusic===

In 1975, [[Grateful Dead]] associate [[Ned Lagin]] released an album of experimental [[space music]] entitled ''Seastones'' on Round Records; he described the recording as ''"cybernetic biomusic"'', emphasizing the use of computers and synthesizers to create organic-impressionistic sounds and meditative feelings.  The album was one of the first commercially released recordings to feature digital computers and the [[Don Buchla|Buchla]] digital-polyphonic synthesizer.&lt;ref name="prendergast244"&gt;{{cite book |last=Prendrergast |first=Mark |year=2000|title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Trance - the Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|pages= 244 |isbn=1-58234-134-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2004 to 2007, [[Pete Townshend]] collaborated with composer [[Lawrence Ball]] and programmer Dave Snowdon to set up a project called [[The Lifehouse Method]], an Internet site where applicants could "sit" for an electronic musical portrait made up from data they entered into the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052567/townshends-method-finally-ready-for-unveiling|title=Townshend's Method|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 April 2007, Ball released a double album on [[iTunes]] called ''Method Music - Imaginary Sitters, Imaginary Galaxies'' which is part of Pete Townshend's Lifehouse Method music project.

===Other examples===

Biomusic can take many other forms. These can include the simple amplification of animal sounds, or the creation of music through the fluctuation of electric current in plants. More unusual still is the use of animal notation: [[Sheet music|music scores]] created by animals, often in the form of paw prints. Biomusic can also take the form of animals trained to perform specific behaviors as part of a musical performance (birds trained to sing for instance).

''[[Music from The Body]]'' is the biomusic [[soundtrack album]] to Roy Battersby's 1970 documentary film ''The Body'', about [[human biology]], narrated by [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Frank Finlay]]. The music was composed and performed in collaboration between [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]] and [[Ron Geesin]], and uses sounds made by the human body (slaps, breathing, laughing, whispering, farts, etc.) in addition to more traditional guitar, piano and stringed instruments.

The experimental ambient/noise group [[Tribes of Neurot]] released an album titled "Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project" in 2002; a multidirectional sound experiment in which all sounds were originally produced by insects and then manipulated and synthesized.

A collaboration album between [[Breakcore]] artists [[Venetian Snares]] and [[Hecate]] entitled [[Nymphomatriarch]] was composed entirely from sounds of the two performing various sexual activities together, which were distorted and time-stretched to resemble typical [[Breakcore]] samples.

[http://www.translatingnature.org/lake/ The Lake], by artist [[Julie Freeman]] tracked natural biological motion via electronic tagging systems, and transformed the data collected into musical composition and animation.

Musicians [[Caninus (band)|Caninus]], [[Hatebeak]] and [[Lil B]]&lt;ref&gt;http://pitchfork.com/news/48656-lil-bs-cat-keke-the-adopted-tabby-drops-track/&lt;/ref&gt; have used animals as [[Lead vocalist|lead]] or [[backing vocalist]]s.

'''Carrier's stamp''' is a type of [[postage stamp]] used by private mail carriers to deliver mail directly to an addressee from the [[post office]].

==History==
When the [[Mail|postal service]] was first organized and the delivery of mail was only from one post office to another post office and not directly to the addressee. This created the need for private mail carriers.

In the United States, this specialized category of stamps existed mainly from 1842 to 1860.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3364">'''Government financial statements''' are annual [[financial statements]] or reports for the year. The financial statements, in contrast to budget, present the revenue collected and amounts spent. The government financial statements usually include a statement of activities (similar to an income statement in the private sector), a balance sheet and often some type of reconciliation. [[Cash flow statement]]s are often included to show the sources of the revenue and the destination of the expenses.

==Specific countries and jurisdictions==

===India===
The Annual Financial Statement of India is tabled in the [[Indian Parliament]] by the [[Finance Minister]] on the Budget Day. 13-15 other documents are also released in the Parliament along with the actual Statement. Briefly divided into three parts, namely- [[Consolidated Fund]], [[Contingency Fund]] and [[Public Account]], the Statement comprises the receipts and expenditure incurred by the Government on each part.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Whole of Government Accounts}}
The [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[UK Government|Government]] publishes annual accounts for the whole of government.&lt;ref name=UKWoGA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/whole-of-government-accounts |format=web|title=Whole of Government Accounts |publisher=UK Government Date=2 August 2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims are to provide more complete data for fiscal planning by producing consolidated [[financial statements]]. The accounts are produced in accordance with the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] and [[Auditor independence|independently audited]] by the [[Comptroller and Auditor General (United Kingdom)|Comptroller and Auditor General]].&lt;ref name="guidance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/wga_200910_guidance.pdf |title=Guidance to the Whole of Government Accounts y/e 31/03/10 (''vid.'' p.4) |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, financial reporting in the [[United States federal government|federal government]] (national) must be in accordance with the [[CFO Act|Chief Financial Officer Act]]. The elements of financial reports are regulated by [[Office of Federal Financial Management]]. At the state and local level of the United States, the [[Government Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB) make the accounting and financial rules. A major change came in June 1999 when GASB introduced accrual and consolidated rules with fund accounting taking a secondary role.

'''Hajong''', originally a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]],&lt;ref&gt;Hajong, B. (2002). ''The Hajongs and their struggle.'' Assam, Janata Press. Foreword(2) by Satyendra Narayan Goswami 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; is now considered an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] with [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] roots. It is spoken by more than 175,000 ethnic [[Hajong people|Hajongs]] in the states of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]] in India and the [[History of Mymensingh|Mymensingh District]] in [[Bangladesh]].  It is written in the [[Eastern Nagari script]] and the [[Latin script]]. It has many [[Sanskrit]] [[loanwords]]. The Hajongs originally spoke a Tibeto-Burman language, but it was largely mixed with [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and other eastern [[Bengali-Assamese languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Danver (2015) ''Native Peoples of the World''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Hajong==
The language spoken by the Hajong people, now, may be considered an Indo-Aryan language, this is due to [[language shift]] from a Tibeto-Burman language. Old Hajong or '''Khati Hajong''' may have been related to [[Garo language|Garo]] or [[Bodo language|Bodo]] languages. Words in Hajong like Mao/A'ya'(mother), Bap/Baba (father), Abu (grandmother), Ajo (grandfather), dada (elder brother), ba'i (elder sister), nunu (younger siblings), bunu (brother-in-law), bhuji (sister-in-law), gang (river), gap (colour), dang'o (big), buwai (to plough), khar (soda), dyao (Spirit or deity), jiu (Spirit or life), bato (parrot), etc. are of Tibeto-Burman origin.
{{see|Wiktionary:Appendix:List of Proto-Bodo-Garo reconstructions}}

==Variations==
The Hajong Language varies within the clans because of regional variations. There are five notable clans of the Hajong people.
:* Doskine'
:* Korebari
:* Susung'ye'
:* Barohajarye'
:* Miespe'rye'

==Writing system==
The Hajong language is written using both the Latin and the Assamese scripts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&amp;item_id=language_detail&amp;uid=d9h6e99bbg Script Source]&lt;/ref&gt; Although both of these scripts are in use in India, the Hajongs in Bangladesh expect to use the Bengali script since most education is in Bengali medium.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, S., A. Kim, S. Kim, and M. Sangma. (2005). ''The Hajong of Bangladesh: A sociolinguistic survey.'' http://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/42943, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, for writing Hajong, the Assamese script is used. In each script, there is one added unique symbol for the close, back, unrounded vowel /ɯ/.  In Latin script, it is written with "â" or simply ''a' ''or ''e'''.  In Eastern Nagari script with "{{lang|as|অৗ}}" when it is syllable final.&lt;ref name="guts"&gt;Guts, Y. (2007). ''Phonological description of the Hajong language.'' Masters Thesis. Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Hajong has 23 consonant phonemes, 8 vowel phonemes, and 2 approximants which have some characteristics of consonants namely /w/ and /j/ which act as diphthongs. The vowel phonemes are /a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, /ɛ/, /o/, /ɔ/ and /ɯ/ (close, back, unrounded). Unlike other Indo-Aryan languages, Hajong language has only one 'i' and 'u'. It is somewhat t ambiguous whether the final vowel is a phoneme or an allophone of [a] in the environment of other close vowels.&lt;ref name="guts" /&gt; The extra vowel /ɯ/ is not present in other Indo-Aryan languages, but is typical for the Tibeto-Burman family.&lt;ref&gt;Guts, Y. (2007). ''Phonological description of the Hajong language.'' Masters Thesis. Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit; p 59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syllable#Coda|Codas]] ''j'' and ''ch'' in the final position of a syllable turns into an ''s'' sound. The phonology of Hajong includes some vowel harmony and the devoicing of final consonants.&lt;ref name="guts" /&gt;For separating syllables the apostrophe sign (') or hyphen (-) is used.

Vowels play an important role in changing the meaning of words and the grammatical structure of sentences. Unlike other Indo-Aryan languages like Assamese and Bengali, there is no distinction between longer and shorter /i/ and /u/. Assamese and Bengali distinguish between longer and shorter /i/ and /u/ in writing, but not in pronunciation. The Assamese script lacks some vowels unique to Hajong phonology, which is gradually leading to a [[vowel shift]]. And since vowels play an important role in the grammar of this language, the grammatical structure of the language is also changing.

===Diphthongs===
Hajong phonology has diphthongs which are iotized vowels with j(y) and w. Diphthongs are usually combinations of i or u with other vowel phonemes. Common examples of diphthongs are '''ya''', as in D'''ya'''o which is the combined form of i and a; '''wa''', as in kha'''wa''' which is the combination of u and a; '''yuh''', as in muh''''yuh''', combination of i and uh, and '''wuh''', as in tuh'''wuh'''i, combination of u and uh.

==Grammar==
Hajong language primarily has a canonical word order of [[Subject–object–verb]]. A subject–object–verb (SOV) language is one in which the subject, object, and verb of a sentence appear or usually appear in that order. Hajong language has a strong tendency to use [[postpositions]] rather than [[prepositions]], to place [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] verbs after the action verb, to place genitive noun phrases before the possessed noun and to have subordinators appear at the end of subordinate clauses. Hajong is an [[agglutinative language]]. Words are often combined and compressed, often  there is no pauses between words until the sentence ends. Even though it is considered an Eastern Indo-Aryan language, Hajong does not conjugate verbs in the same way Bengali or Asamiya do, but rather has a simplified system. The case endings in Hajong are also unique compared to other Indo-Aryan languages and may represent affinity with Tibeto Burman languages.&lt;ref name="Grierson"&gt;Grierson, G. A. (1903–28). ''Linguistic survey of India.'' Repr. Delhi 1967. Calcutta, Motilal Banarsidass, p 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;Phillips, V. C. (2011). "Case Marking in Hajong." In G. Hyslop, S. Morey and M. Post, Eds. ''North East Indian Linguistics: Volume 3.'' Delhi, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; The following table is taken from Phillips:&lt;ref name="phillips" /&gt;
{|class="wikitable" align="center" width="550"
!width="100"|Hajong || Hajong (in IPA) || width="200"|English || width="60"|Case
|-align="center"
| বুৰি-ৰৗ || ''buri-rɯ'' || the old woman || unmarked
|-align="center"
| বুৰি-ৰৗগে || ''buri-rɯge'' || to the old woman || dative
|-align="center"
| বুৰি-লৗ || ''buri-lɯ'' || of the old woman || genitive
|-align="center"
| বুৰি নি || ''buri ni'' || to/at the old woman || locative
|-align="center"
| বুৰি ভায় || ''buri bʰaʲ'' || to the old woman || allative
|-align="center"
| বুৰি থিকি || ''buri t̪ʰiki'' || from the old woman || ablative
|-align="center"
|-align="center"
| বুৰি দিঅৗ || ''buri diɯ'' || through/by the help of the old woman || instrumental
|-align="center"
|}
The genitive and unmarked or accusative cases have two forms; re'/ra and le'/la. For words ending with the vowels /a/, /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ it becomes ra and la and for /i/, /u/, /e/, /o/ and /ɯ/ it becomes re' and le'. The vowels /ɛ/(e) and /ɔ/(o) are used to end interogative sentences, like 'Bhat khase?'(have you taken your food?) and 'Bhat khabo?'(Do you want to eat?); and the vowels /e/(ei) and /o/(ou) are used at the end of declarative sentences, as in 'Bhat khasei.'([I] have taken my food.) and 'Bhat Khabou'([I] will eat.). Adding the suffix be' or ba to [[interrogative words]] turn them into [[indefinite pronouns]]; for example, kibe' means something, kei'be' means someone, kumaba means somewhere and also ke'ibe', kageba, kunde'be' and kalaba means 'I don't know who/whom/which/who's' respectively in english. Similarly adding the suffix ha and ga to [[verbs]] means 'come and (verb)' and 'go and (verd)' respectively; for example, khaha means come and eat, niha means come and take; khaga means go and eat and niga means go and take.

=== Honorifics===
A unique feature of Hajong language is the use of [[honorifics]]. When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Unlike Assamese, Bengali, Sylheti and other Indo-Aryan languages, there is no word like আপুনি/আপনি/ꠀꠙꠘꠦ(''apuni/apni/afne'') to substitute ''you''. Instead Hajong has a different way to indicate supremacy of the other person. For elders and other higher ranking people second person and third person pronouns are never used. One always has to refer an elder with their name or their honorary title. Ending words with 'ge' and 'ha' is also a form of showing respect to the other person.

'''Hendrick Conrad Joannes Heusken''' (January 20, 1832 – January 15, 1861) was a Dutch-American [[interpreter]] for the first [[United States|American]] [[consulate]] in [[Japan]], established at [[Gyokusen-ji]] in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka]] in the late [[Bakumatsu period]].&lt;ref name="Minato"&gt;[http://www.lib.city.minato.tokyo.jp/yukari/e/man-detail.cgi?id=79 Prominent People of Minato City: Henricus Conradus Joannes Heusken]. Minato City Local History Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; He played an important role in the negotiations for the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)|"Harris Treaty"]] which opened commercial relations between Japan and America, and his assassination caused a minor diplomatic crisis between Japan and the various Western powers. 
&lt;ref name="deGoey"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.ebha.org/ebha2008/papers/deGoey_ebha_2008.pdf|title=Western entrepreneurs and the opening of Japanese ports (c. 1858-1868)|last1=de Goey|first1=Ferry|publisher=European Business History Association|date=21 August 2008|location=Bergen, Norway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Heusken was born in [[Amsterdam]] to Joannes Franciscus Heusken, who worked for a soap manufacturer, and Johanna Smit. 
The death of his father jeopardized his chances of a successful career, so he immigrated to the United States and became a naturalized citizen, changing his name to Henry Conrad Joannes Heusken. However, he found that life in [[New York City]] was difficult as well, and was forced to move from job to job based on his contacts with the local Dutch community. In 1855, these same contacts introduced him to [[Townsend Harris]], who had been appointed for the first United States Consul General to Japan, and who was looking for a personal assistant and interpreter in the only European language the Japanese were familiar with.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hesselink|first=Reinier|date=1994|title=The Assassination of Henry Heusken|journal=Monumenta Nipponica|volume=49|issue=3|pages=331–351|doi=10.2307/2385453|jstor=2385453}}&lt;!--|access-date=3 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Heusken departed New York in October 1855 on the {{USS|San Jacinto|1850}}, and worked closely with Harris during the negotiations for the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858]]. Harris reported to Washington in his official reports that Heusken was kind and amiable in temper, never showing violence to the Japanese, and a universal favorite. However, in his personal diary, Harris complained that Heusken was lackadaisical, stating "I believe that Mr Heusken only remembers when to eat, drink and sleep – any other affairs rest lightly on his memory" &lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''Complete Journals'', Rutland, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions, Harris sought to warn Heusken about his late hours.

After the American consulate was relocated to [[Zenpuku-ji]] in Edo, Heusken quickly became one of the most publicly visible foreigners among the multiple western delegations in Edo. He frequently rode about the town and castle on horseback, a privilege that was traditionally reserved for the samurai caste.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt; Count [[Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg]], head of the [[Eulenburg Expedition]] which was the Japan for the purpose of negotiating a commercial treaty between [[Prussia]] and Japan similar to treaties secured by the other European powers, requested that Harris loan Heusken to serve as interpreter during the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415342481&amp;id=IijlCfMFUW8C&amp;pg=RA3-PA119&amp;lpg=RA3-PA119&amp;ots=0UTfaATTMf&amp;dq=Japanese-german+Relations,+1895-1945&amp;sig=7bUdkWBymn-HiJogPvXoOslcZRk#PRA3-PA1,M1 ''Japanese-German Relations, 1895-1945: war, diplomacy and public opinion''] By Christian W. Spang, Rolf-Harald. Wippich, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

After having dinner with Count Eulenburg on the night of 14 January 1861, Heusken was returning to his quarters at Zenpuku-ji accompanied by three mounted officers and four footmen bearing lanterns. The party was suddenly ambushed by seven [[Shishi (organization)|''shishi'']] from [[Satsuma Domain]], including [[:ja:伊牟田尚平|Shōuhei Imuta]]. Despite his escort, Heusken suffered mortal wounds to both sides of his body in the fight. He mounted a horse and galloped about 200 yards to the American Legation, where he was taken inside and treated. Early in the following morning, he died of his wounds.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt; Harris insisted on an ostentatiously large funeral procession, with the participation of all the foreign missions in Japan, and Heusken was buried at the cemetery at Korin-ji in Tokyo, Japan.&lt;ref name="Minato"/&gt;

Immediately after the funeral, most western diplomats retreated from Edo to [[Yokohama]] and brought ashore greater numbers of French and British soldiers for protection as trade dwindled.&lt;ref name="deGoey"/&gt; The "yet unpunished and unatoned homicide of Mr. Heusken" was cited by [[William H. Seward]] as a hindering factor in relations between the U.S. and Japan during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.archives.gov/id/6158603 William H. Seward to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Japan]. 1 August 1861. U.S. National Archives Identifier 6158603.&lt;/ref&gt; No one was ever convicted of the murder, and the only reparations made by the government of Japan was a $10,000 payment to Heusken's mother.&lt;ref name="Hesselink"/&gt;

Heusken wrote a detailed diary of his time in Japan, which was published in 1964 as "Japan Journal 1855-1861".&lt;ref&gt;Japan Journal, 1855–1861. By Henry Heusken. Trans, and edited by Jeannette C. Van Der Corput and Robert A. Wilson. New Brunswick, N. J.: Rutgers University Press, 1964. xviii, 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hiri Motu''', also known as '''Police Motu''', '''Pidgin Motu''', or just '''Hiri''', is an official [[language]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;Specific legislation proclaiming official languages in Papua New Guinea seems not to exist – but see Constitution of Papua New Guinea: Preamble – Section 2/11 (literacy) – where Hiri Motu is mentioned (with Tok Pisin and English) as languages in which universal literacy is sought – and also section 67 2(c) (and 68 2(h), where conversational ability in Hiri Motu is mentioned (with Tok Pisin or “a vernacular of the country”) as a requirement for citizenship by nationalisation (one of these languages required)&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is a simplified version of [[Motu language|Motu]], of the [[Austronesian language]] family. Although it is strictly neither a [[pidgin]] nor a [[creole language|creole]], it possesses some features of both language types. [[phonology|Phonological]] and [[grammar|grammatical]] differences mean that Hiri Motu is not [[mutually intelligible]] with Motu. The languages are lexically very similar, and retain a common, albeit simplified, Austronesian syntactical basis.

Even in the areas where it was once well established as a ''[[lingua franca]]'', the use of Hiri Motu has been declining in favour of [[Tok Pisin]] and English for many years.

== Origin of Hiri Motu ==
The term Hiri is the name for the traditional trade voyages created an important culture and style of living for the Motu people.

"Hiri Motu" became a common language for a police force known as "Police Motu".

The name Hiri Motu came to be during the early 1970s during a conference held by the Department of Information and Extension Services. During this conference, the committee recommended the name "Hiri Motu" for several reasons.

* The languages history is older than the name "Police Motu" implies. This was recommended because it was a simplified from the language of the Motu people, which was the language used when they traded goods with their customers.
* Police Motu, at the time was never used as a language of trade or social contact. In fact, since the unity of New Guinea Police Force in 1946, "Police Motu" had lost most of its functions in police work. Pidgin was adopted at that time and was used with majority of the police force.
* The committee thought that the new name should have some meaning behind it. Instead of having a language relating to police work, they thought the language should reflect the legacy of the language and how it's used in everyday life.

=== Motu People ===
Motu people are native inhabitants of Papua New Guinea. They live along the southern coastal line of their country. Motu people typically live in dry areas, on the [[leeward]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;side of the mountain. Where dry seasons are harsh on the people who live there. Traditional Hiri voyages carried prized treasures to the people of the [[Gulf of Papua]].

== Dialects ==
Hiri Motu has two dialects, called "[[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]" and "[[Papuan languages|Papuan]]". Both dialects are in fact Austronesian in both grammar and vocabulary, due to their derivation from Motu; the dialect names refer to the first languages spoken by users of this [[lingua franca]]. The "Papuan" dialect (also called "Non-central") was much more widely spoken in the language's heyday, and was, at least from about 1964, used as the standard for official publications. The "Austronesian" (or "Central") dialect is closer to Motu in grammar and phonology, and its vocabulary is both more extensive and closer to the original language. For these reasons, it was the [[prestige dialect]], regarded by speakers as more correct.

The distinction between Motu and its "Pidgin" dialects has been described as blurred – forming a continuum from the original "pure" language, through the established creoles, to what some writers have suggested constitutes a form of "Hiri Motu–based pidgin" used as a contact languages with people who had not fully acquired Hiri Motu.&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|hiri1235|Hiri Motu Trading Eleman}}&lt;br&gt;{{glottolog|hiri1236|Hiri Motu Trading Koriki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Hiri Motu language consists of now 19 letters in their alphabet: a, e, i, o, u, b, d, g, g, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v.

The letter "g" is meant for two different sounds. One of the sound is similar to the "g" in the word go. On the other hand, it is pronounced differently through [[Point of articulation]]. This point is located in the throat area and sounds like "ch".

There are 14 consonants in Hiri Motu: b, d, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w. You would pronounce these consonants as you would in English.

==== Vowels ====
The five vowels are: a, e, i, o, u. All of these are pronounced normally except "O" This is an exception to the regular pronunciation, but it's similar to the sound of ''hot'' and the sound of ou in ''fought.''

Double vowels: Also known as, [[Diphthong]]. Pronounce each vowel with little stress on each syllable, meaning; be smooth when pronouncing double vowels. If you listen to fluent Hiri Motu speakers, they will combine these vowels and it'll sound like one long vowel instead.

One thing to take note of is when double vowel ai is followed by another vowel, then you would get a small y sound in your pronunciation. For example, the word kaia (knife) is pronounced kai-ya. Another double vowel that can be tricky to pronounce when followed by another vowel is au. In this example, we will use the word maua, meaning box. Maua is pronounced mau-wa. You will hear a slight w when saying words with au, preceding another vowel.

== Syntax ==

===== Personal Pronouns =====
In Hiri Motu language, the distinction between "inclusive" and "exclusive" forms of "we" is very important.

To further explain this, think of a time when you and your friend were thirsty. You would go up to him and say "We have no water". When talking to your friend, you are including you and your friend. This "we" is inclusive, which is the person you are speaking to. In Hiri Motu this would be "Ita" (we, inclusive)

Now explaining "we" exclusive using the same example. Now say you and your friend approach a different person and tell him "we have no water" this excludes the person who is not thirsty. The word for this is Ai (we, exclusive)

====== Possessives ======

* Egu=my

* emu=your (singular)

* emui=your (plural)

* ena=his,her,it's

* edia=their

In the table above, the 'lau-egu' is placed before the noun, lau-egu boroma (my pig)

Take note that the first half of the word (lau, oi) may be taken out of the word. For example, 'lau-egu' can be shortened to 'egu boroma.

====== Postposition ======
Preposition is a word placed beofre a noun to create a phrase, this is similar to an adjective or adverb. But, in Hiri Motu, such words are placed after the noun, not before it, and can be called postposition.

Some standard postposition in hiri Motu is 'ai' which can meaan in, on, or at.

Maua ai - in the box

pata ai - on the table

Konedobu ai - at Konedobu (referring to a location)

Take note: 'maua ai' is merged to 'mauai' and 'pata ai' to 'patai', here are some examples:

* lalo-na-ai - changed to lalonai - in, inside
* lata-na-ai - chenged to latanai - on, on top of

==== Word Order ====
Word Order

In Hiri Motu, the [[word order]] can be interchangeable with [[Subject–object–verb]] (SOV) and [[Object-subject-verb]] (OSV). These sentence structure will start with a subject followed by an object, and then ending with a verb and vice versa, object, followed by a subject, and ending with a verb. Notice that the sentence will always end with a verb no matter the word order.

OSV is more common in Hiri Motu.

With the option of having a SOV and OSV word order, some ambiguity may come about in some cases.

For example, "Inai mero boroma badana ia alaia" can either mean, "This boy killed a big pig" or "A big pig killed this boy"

To solve this, a subject marker can be used. In Hiri Motu, the subject marker is "ese", and is placed right after the subject of the sentence.

Now it will look like this: "Inai '''mero''' ese boroma badana ia alaia" (Literally, This boy, a big pig killed him.) - "A big pig killed this boy"

However, don't over-use this subject marker. Use it only when the sentence would be ambiguous without it. You will never use subject marker in a sentence in which the verb is an [[Intransitive verb]].

==== Interrogatives ====

|-
|Daika?
|Who? Whom?
|-

|-
|Daika ena?

|How?
|-
|Hida?
|How many?
|-
|Edeseni?/ Edeseni ai?
|Where?
|-
|Edana negai?
|When?
|}
(Edana is sometimes spelt and pronounced Edena)

Take note that 'hida' always follows the noun it is referring to, while 'edana' always follows it.

Examples:

Unai mero daika? Who is that boy?

Inai gau dahaka? What is this thing?

Dahaka oi karaia? What are you doing?

Stay away from question in the negative form, some of the replies/answers you receive can be confusing.

For example, If you ask "la mai lasi?" (Hasn't he come?) and get a reply "Oibe" (yes), that can mean "Yes, he hasn't come yet". If the person has arrived, they will answer, "Lasi, ia mai" meaning (No, he has come). This can be a little tricky at times, so it's best to stray away from negative form questions.

==== Conjunction ====
eiava - or

bona - and

bema - if

bena, vadeani - then

a, to - but

badina - because

Examples:

* Oi raka naomonamo, oi keta garina. (Walk carefully, lest you fall.)
* Sinavai dekenai ia lao, haoda totona. (He went to the river (in order) to catch fish.)

==== "To Be and To Have" ====
When "to be" is used as a connecting word, the parts "na" and "be" can be used, but it is not needed for this case.

For example: 'Ia be mero namona' or 'la na mero namona (He is a good boy)

Note that there is no Hiri Motu verb form of "to have" in the sense of possession, like in the sentence 'I have a dog'

In true Hiri Motu, a local would say "Lau na mai egu sisia" for "I have a dog", (literally, 'I with my dog'.) There are no standards for these expression forms in Hiri Motu.

== Numbers ==
ta=one

rua=two

toi=three

hani=four

ima=five

The number system in Hiri Motu language goes all they way to 100,000. Many of the numbers in Hiri Motu are [[Polysyllabic]], meaning they have many syllables. Which means that larger numbers are long words.

For example, 99 in Hiri Motu is, taurahanita ahui taurahanita. Most [[Papuans]] know the English number system and can use that instead.

== History ==
The language has a history long pre-dating European contact; it developed among members of the [[Hiri trade cycle]] (mainly in [[sago]] and [[pottery|clay pots]]) between the [[Motuan people|Motu people]] and their neighbours on the southeast coast of the island of [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;This is disputed by Dutton.&lt;/ref&gt; In early European colonial days, the use of Hiri Motu was spread due to its adoption by the [[Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary|Royal Papuan Constabulary]] (hence the name "Police Motu"). By the early 1960s, Hiri Motu had probably reached its widest use, being the normal lingua franca of a large part of the country. It was the [[first language]] for many people whose parents came from different language groups (typically the children of policemen and other public servants).

Since the early 1970s, if not earlier, the use of Hiri Motu as a day-to-day lingua franca in its old "range" has been gradually declining in favour of English and Tok Pisin. Today its speakers tend to be elderly, and concentrated in [[Central Province (Papua New Guinea)|Central]] and [[Gulf Province|Gulf]] provinces. Reflecting this situation, younger speakers of the "parent language" (Motu proper) tend to be unfamiliar with Hiri Motu, and few of them understand or speak it well, which was certainly not the case a generation or two ago.

'''Internet Party Line''' (or simply '''iParty''') was one of the first [[Internet phone|Internet telephony and conference]] software for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It was made by [[Intel]] and released as an experimental [[prototype]] in 1995.  It featured a push-to-talk method of sending audio, in which each received audio clip was played in order without mixing, regardless of multiple people talking simultaneously.  In this way, it addressed the problem of how to have an understandable group conversation in the face of large Internet latencies or low bandwidth.

Similar applications like iParty include [[Microsoft NetMeeting]] and [[VocalTec|VocalTec Internet Phone]]. Today Most of these older conference applications have been replaced by [[VoIP|VoIP applications]] such as [[Skype]].

'''Jeri''' is a cover term for two [[Mande languages|Mande language]] of northwestern [[Ivory Coast]] and southwestern [[Burkina Faso]]. The two had been thought until recently to be dialects of a single language, but they are now known to be clearly distinct. The Burkina language is Jalkunan (Blé, Dyala, Dyalanu, Jalanu), and the Ivory Coast language is Jeri Kuo (Celle, Jeli Kuo). Jeri Kuo is spoken by people who traditionally constituted a caste-like minority within an otherwise mostly Senufo-speaking zone. The language is thought to be endangered, with 90% of ethnic Jeri having shifted to regionally dominant languages. The Jalkunan-speaking people of the Blédougou village cluster are not people of caste, although nearby villages of other ethnicities have entire sections populated by blacksmith and leatherworker castes. Jalkunan is being replaced by Jula (Dioula), but it is not immediately threatened by extinction.

'''Mathuram Bhoothalingam''' (pen name '''Krithika''') was a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] writer who wrote plays and short stories in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and English.&lt;ref name="India1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Authors Guild of India|title=Indian author|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBFZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 August 2012|year=1986|publisher=Authors Guild of India|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Krithika was born as Mathuram in a Tamil-speaking family in [[Bombay]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=gowri&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramnarayan|first=Gowri|title=Writers as friends in correspondence|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3704375.ece|accessdate=4 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age, she moved to [[Delhi]] where she spent a considerable part of her life.&lt;ref name=Muthiah&gt;{{cite news|last=S|first=Muthiah|title=A 40-year correspondence|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/05/25/stories/2009052550120400.htm|accessdate=4 August 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to [[Subrahmanya Bhoothalingam]], an [[Indian Civil Service|ICS]] officer from Delhi.&lt;ref name=Muthiah/&gt; The couple have a daughter, [[Mina Swaminathan]].&lt;ref name=Muthiah/&gt;

Krithika died in 2009 at the age of 93.&lt;ref name=gowri/&gt;

==Literary career==
Mathuram started writing under the pen name "Krithika" from an early age.&lt;ref name="India1986"/&gt; Making her debut with the Tamil-language novel ''Puhai Naduvil'', an acid look at the bureaucracy, she went on to write a number of children's stories, novels, and plays based on the ''[[puranas]]''.&lt;ref name=Muthiah/&gt;

Her play ''Manathile Oru Maru'' was directed by another famous writer of her time, Chitti ([[P. G. Sundararajan]]), with whom she shared a strong bond of friendship.&lt;ref name=gowri/&gt;&lt;ref name=Muthiah/&gt; Chitti even authored a book titled ''An Introduction: Krithika and Mathuram Bhoothalingam''.&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite news | author1=Adma Narayanan |author2=Prema Seetharam |url=http://www.hindu.com/lr/2004/08/01/stories/2004080100280500.htm | title=The truth as it is | work=The Hindu | date=1 August 2004 | accessdate=5 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through her career, Krithika also started to write in English.

As Krithika started to write children's books apart from adult-centric stories, she began using her given name.&lt;ref name=Muthiah/&gt; Krithika was one of the first Indian authors to regularly publish children's books in English.&lt;ref name=Muthiah/&gt; Some of her important works in English are ''Movement in Stone'', which looks at early [[Chola]] temples and the influence of [[Pallava]] art prior to the 9th and 10th centuries; and, ''Yoga for Living'' (1996), a contemporary look at the direction of India.&lt;ref name=Muthiah/&gt;

''Vasaveswaram'' is one of her works which focused on women and dealt with issues faced by them in the society.&lt;ref name="truth"/&gt; Krithika has also authored books on [[Hindu Epics]] such as [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref name="Relations1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=Modern Language Association of America.

Her written correspondence with Chitti which spanned over 30 years have been brought together and published in the form of a book titled ''Lettered Dialogue'' by [[K. R. A. Narasaiah]], a relative of Chitti.&lt;ref name="thehindu_20120720"&gt;{{cite news|title=Writers as friends in correspondence|first=Gowri|last=Ramnarayan|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3704375.ece|work=The Hindu|date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Maya civilization}}

The '''Mayan languages'''&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In [[linguistics]], it is conventional to use ''Mayan'' when referring to the languages, or an aspect of a language. In other academic fields, ''Maya'' is the preferred usage, serving as both a singular and plural [[noun]], and as the [[adjective|adjectival]] form.&lt;/ref&gt; form a [[language family]] spoken in [[Mesoamerica]] and northern [[Central America]]. Mayan languages are spoken by at least 6 million [[Maya peoples]], primarily in [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Belize]] and [[Honduras]]. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name,{{sfn|Spence|Dye|Worby|de Leon-Escribano|1998}} and Mexico [[Languages of Mexico|recognizes]] eight more within its territory.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Achi' is counted as a variant of K'iche' by the Guatemalan government. Counting Achi' there are 30 living Mayan languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayan language family is one of the best-documented and most studied in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name="Campbell 1997, p.165"&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell |1997|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Mayan languages descend from the [[Proto-Mayan language]], thought to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago; it has been partially [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]] using the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]]. The proto-Mayan language diversified into at least six different branches: the Huastecan, Quichean, Yucatecan, Qanjobalan, Mamean and Ch'olan-Tzeltalan branches.

Mayan languages form part of the [[Mesoamerican language area]], an [[sprachbund|area of linguistic convergence]] developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. All Mayan languages display the basic diagnostic traits of this linguistic area. For example, all use [[relational noun]]s instead of [[preposition]]s to indicate spatial relationships. They also possess [[grammar|grammatical]] and [[linguistic typology|typological]] features that set them apart from other languages of Mesoamerica, such as the use of [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergativity]] in the grammatical treatment of verbs and their subjects and objects, specific inflectional categories on verbs, and a special [[Lexical category|word class]] of "positionals" which is typical of all Mayan languages.

During the [[pre-Columbian era]] of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]], some Mayan languages were written in the [[Logogram|logo-syllabic]] [[Maya script]]. Its use was particularly widespread during the [[Maya civilization#Classic period (c. 250–900 AD)|Classic period]] of Maya civilization (c. 250–900). The surviving corpus of over 10,000 known individual Maya inscriptions on buildings, monuments, pottery and bark-paper [[Maya codices|codices]],{{sfn|Kettunen|Helmke|2005|p=6}} combined with the rich postcolonial [[Mesoamerican literature|literature in Mayan languages]] written in the [[Latin script]], provides a basis for the modern understanding of pre-Columbian history unparalleled in the Americas.

==History==

===Proto-Mayan===
[[File:Mayan Language Migration Map.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.63|Approximate migration routes and dates for various Mayan language families. The region shown as Proto-Mayan is now occupied by speakers of the Q'anjobalan branch (light blue in other figures).&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Based on Kaufman (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mayan languages are the descendants of a [[proto-language]] called Proto-Mayan or, in K'iche' Maya, ''Nab'ee Maya' Tzij'' ("the old Maya Language").{{sfn|England|1994}} The Proto-Mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the Cuchumatanes highlands of central Guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where Q'anjobalan is spoken today.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=165}} The earliest proposal was that of {{harvtxt|Sapper|1912}} which identified the Chiapas-Guatemalan highlands as the likely "cradle" of Mayan languages was published by the German antiquarian and scholar [[Karl Sapper]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;see attribution in {{harvtxt|Fernández de Miranda|1968|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terrence Kaufman]] and John Justeson have reconstructed more than 3000 lexical items for the proto-Mayan language.{{sfn|Kaufman| with Justeson|2003}}

According to the prevailing classification scheme by [[Lyle Campbell]] and Terrence Kaufman, the first division occurred around 2200 BCE, when Huastecan split away from Mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]].{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|1985}} Proto-Yucatecan and Proto-Ch'olan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. Speakers of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by Mamean and Quichean people. When speakers of proto-Tzeltalan later separated from the Ch'olan group and moved south into the [[Chiapas highlands]], they came into contact with speakers of [[Mixe–Zoque languages]].{{sfn|Kaufman|1976}} According to an alternative theory by Robertson and [[Stephen D. Houston|Houston]], Huastecan stayed in the Guatemalan highlands with speakers of Ch'olan-Tzeltalan, separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by Kaufman.{{sfn|Robertson|Houston|2002}}

In the Archaic period (before 2000 BCE), a number of [[loanword]]s from Mixe–Zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-Mayan language. This has led to hypotheses that the early Maya were dominated by speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages, possibly the [[Olmec]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;This theory was first proposed by {{harvcoltxt|Campbell|Kaufman|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Xincan language|Xincan]] and [[Lencan languages]], on the other hand, Mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords. Mayan language specialists such as Campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between Maya and the [[Lenca people|Lencan]] and [[Xinca people]], possibly during the Classic period (250–900).&lt;ref name="Campbell 1997, p.165" /&gt;

===Classic period===
[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.81|Classic period Maya glyphs in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], Mexico]]
During the Classic period the major branches began diversifying into separate languages. The split between Proto-Yucatecan (in the north, that is, the Yucatán Peninsula) and Proto-Ch'olan (in the south, that is, the Chiapas highlands and [[Petén Basin]]) had already occurred by the Classic period, when most extant [[#Glyphic writing|Maya inscriptions]] were written. Both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the [[List of Maya sites|Maya sites]] of the time, and both are commonly referred to as "[[Classic Maya language]]". Although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts, evidence for at least five different varieties of Mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus—an Eastern Ch'olan variety found in texts written in the southern Maya area and the highlands, a Western Ch'olan variety diffused from the Usumacinta region from the mid-7th century on,{{sfn|Hruby|Child|2004}} a Yukatekan variety found in the texts from the Yucatán Peninsula,&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2006 p. 12"&gt;{{harvtxt|Kettunen|Helmke|2005|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Tzeltalan variety found in the Western Lowlands (i.e. Toniná, Pomona), and possibly a highland Maya language belonging to K'ichean major within texts painted on Nebaj ceramics.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as [[prestige dialect]]s throughout the Maya region; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2006 p. 12" /&gt;

Stephen Houston, John Robertson and David Stuart have suggested that the specific variety of Ch'olan found in the majority of Southern Lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub "Classic Ch'olti'an", the ancestor language of the modern [[Ch’orti’ language|Ch'orti']] and [[Ch’olti’ language]]s. They propose that it originated in western and south-central Petén Basin, and that it was used in the inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests.{{sfn|Houston|Robertson|Stuart|2000}} However, Mora-Marín has argued that traits shared by Classic Lowland Maya and the Ch'olti'an languages are retentions rather than innovations, and that the diversification of Ch'olan in fact post-dates the classic period. The language of the classical lowland inscriptions then would have been proto-Ch'olan.{{sfn|Mora-Marín|2009}}

===Colonial period===
During the Spanish colonization of Central America, all [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous]] languages were eclipsed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which became the new prestige language.  The use of Mayan languages in many important domains of society, including administration, religion and literature, came to an end. Yet the Maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The last independent Maya kingdom ([[Tayasal]]) was not conquered until 1697, some 170 years after the first ''[[conquistador]]es'' arrived. During the Colonial and Postcolonial periods, Maya peoples periodically rebelled against the colonizers, such as the [[Caste War of Yucatán]], which extended into the 20th century.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps for this reason, many Maya communities still retain a high proportion of [[monolingual]] speakers.  The Maya area is now dominated by the Spanish language. While a number of Mayan languages are [[moribund language|moribund]] or are considered [[endangered language|endangered]], others remain quite viable, with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Grenoble &amp; Whaley (1998) characterized the situation this way: "Mayan languages typically have several hundreds of thousands of speakers, and a majority of Mayas speak a Mayan language as a first language. The driving concern of Maya communities is not to revitalize their language but to buttress it against the increasingly rapid spread of Spanish ... [rather than being] at the end of a process of language shift, [Mayan languages are] ... at the beginning."{{harvtxt|Grenoble|Whaley|1998|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
[[File:Idioma Chuj.JPG|right|thumb|Drawing with text written in the Chuj language from Ixcán, Guatemala.]]
As Maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and [[nationalist]] and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread, the Mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared [[ethnic]] identity as Maya, the heirs of the [[Maya civilization]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{harvtxt|Choi|2002}} writes: "In the recent Maya cultural activism, maintenance of Mayan languages has been promoted in an attempt to support 'unified Maya identity'. However, there is a complex array of perceptions about Mayan language and identity among Mayans who I researched in Momostenango, a highland Maya community in Guatemala. On the one hand, Mayans denigrate K'iche' and have doubts about its potential to continue as a viable language because the command of Spanish is an economic and political necessity. On the other hand, they do recognize the value of Mayan language when they wish to claim the 'authentic Mayan identity'. It is this conflation of conflicting and ambivalent ideologies that inform language choice..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Maya" was likely derived from the postclassical Yucatán city of [[Mayapan]]; its more restricted meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the Yucatán Peninsula. The broader meaning of "Maya" now current, while defined by linguistic relationships, is also used to refer to ethnic or cultural traits. Most Mayans identify first and foremost with a particular ethnic group, e.g. as "Yucatec" or "K'iche'"; but they also recognize a shared Maya kinship.{{sfn|Choi|2002}}  Language has been fundamental in defining the boundaries of that kinship. Fabri writes: "The term Maya is problematic because Maya peoples do not constitute a homogenous identity. Maya, rather, has become a strategy of self-representation for the Maya movements and its followers. The Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG) finds twenty-one distinct Mayan languages."{{sfn|Fabri|2003|page=61. n1}}  This pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different Mayan languages, some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as [[dialects]] of a single language. But, given that the term "dialect" has been used by some with [[Racism|racialist]] overtones in the past, as scholars made a spurious distinction between Amerindian "dialects" and European "languages", the preferred usage in Mesoamerica in recent years has been to designate the linguistic varieties spoken by different ethnic group as separate languages.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;See {{harvtxt|Suárez|1983}} chapter 2 for a thorough discussion of the usage and meanings of the words "dialect" and "language" in Mesoamerica.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Guatemala, matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the Mayan languages are governed by the [[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]] (ALMG; Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages), which was founded by Maya organisations in 1986. Following the 1996 [[Guatemalan Civil War|peace accords]], it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on Mayan languages both among Mayan scholars and the Maya peoples.&lt;ref name=French&gt;{{harvtxt|French|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=England2007&gt;{{harvtxt|England|2007|pages=14, 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogy and classification==
{{See also|List of Mayan languages}}

===Relations with other families===
The Mayan language family has no demonstrated [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into Mayan and not to common ancestry. Mesoamerica has been proven to be an area of substantial linguistic diffusion.{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|Smith-Stark|1986}}

A wide range of proposals have tried to link the Mayan family to other language families or [[language isolate|isolates]], but none is generally supported by linguists. Examples include linking Mayan with the [[Uru–Chipaya languages]],  [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]], the Lencan languages, [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] and [[Huave language|Huave]]. Mayan has also been included in various [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] and [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] hypotheses. The linguist [[Joseph Greenberg]] included Mayan in his highly controversial [[Amerind languages|Amerind hypothesis]], which is rejected by most [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] as unsupported by available evidence.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|pages=''passim''}}

Writing in 1997, [[Lyle Campbell]], an expert in Mayan languages and historical linguistics, argued that the most promising proposal is the "[[Macro-Mayan languages|Macro-Mayan]]" hypothesis, which posits links between Mayan, the Mixe–Zoque languages and the [[Totonacan languages]], but more research is needed to support or disprove this hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1997, p.165"/&gt; In 2015, Campbell noted that recent, yet unpublished, evidence uncovered by David Mora-Marin strengthened the case for a relationship between Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean languages, although he did not yet consider it conclusive.{{sfn|Campbell|2015}}

The Mayan family consists of thirty languages.  Typically, these languages are grouped into 5-6 major subgroups (Yucatean, Huastecan, Ch'olan-Tseltalan, Q'anjob'alan, Mamean, and K'ichean).{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|1985}}{{sfn|Campbell|2015}}{{sfn|Bennett|Coon|Henderson|2015}}
The Mayan language family is extremely well documented, and its internal genealogical classification scheme is widely accepted and established, except for some minor unresolved differences.{{sfn|Law|2013}}

One point still at issue is the position of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|1985}} (as in the diagram below). Other linguists do not support the positing of an especially close relationship between Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language.{{sfn|Robertson| 1977}} An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.{{sfn|Robertson|Houston|2002}}{{sfn|Houston|Robertson|Stuart|2000}}

Font sizes indicate relative sizes of speaker populations (Yucatec and K'iche' with 900,000 and 400,000 speakers respectively; 100,000–500,000 speakers; 10,000–100,000 speakers; and under 10,000 speakers.)]]

Studies estimate that Mayan languages are spoken by more than 6 million people. Most of them live in Guatemala where depending on estimates 40%-60% of the population speaks a Mayan language. In Mexico the Mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010, whereas the Belizean speaker population figures around 30,000.{{sfn|Bennett|Coon|Henderson|2015}}

===Western branch===
The Ch'olan languages were formerly widespread throughout the Maya area, but today the language with most speakers is [[Ch'ol language|Ch'ol]], spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), (2005). [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cti Ethnologue report on Ch'ol de Tila], [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ctu Ethnologue report on Ch'ol de Tumbalá], both accessed March 07, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Its closest relative, the [[Chontal Maya language]],&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Chontal Maya is not to be confused with the [[Tequistlatecan]] languages that are referred to as "Chontal of Oaxaca".&lt;/ref&gt; is spoken by 55,000&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), (2005). [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=chf Ethnologue report on Chontal de Tabasco], accessed March 07, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in the state of [[Tabasco]]. Another related language, now endangered, is [[Ch'orti' language|Ch'orti']], which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), (2005). [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=caa Ch'orti': A language of Guatemala.] Ethnologue.com, accessed March 07, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously also spoken in the extreme west of [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]], but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. [[Ch'olti' language|Ch'olti']], a sister language of Ch'orti', is also extinct.{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|1985}} Ch'olan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the [[Classic Maya language|language of the Classic-era inscriptions]] found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a plausible explanation for the geographical distance between the Ch'orti' zone and the areas where Ch'ol and Chontal are spoken.{{sfn|Kettunen|Helmke|2005|p=12}}

The closest relatives of the Ch'olan languages are the languages of the Tzeltalan branch, [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]] and [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]], both spoken in Chiapas by large and stable or growing populations (265,000 for Tzotzil and 215,000 for [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), (2005) [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=91318 Family Tree for Tzeltalan] accessed March 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Tzeltal has tens of thousands of monolingual speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M.

Dallas, Texas: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Q'anjob'al language|Q'anjob'al]] is spoken by 77,700 in Guatemala's [[Huehuetenango]] department,&lt;ref name="Gordon, Raymond G. 2005"/&gt; with small populations elsewhere. The region of Q'anjobalan speakers in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the [[Guatemalan Civil War|Civil War]] and its close proximity to the [[Guatemala–Mexico border|Mexican border]], was the source of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as [[Tuscarawas County, Ohio]]{{sfn|Solá|2011}} and Los Angeles, California{{sfn|Popkin|2005}}), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala.{{sfn|Rao|2015}} [[Jakaltek language|Jakaltek]] (also known as Popti'&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), (2005).

Another member of this branch is [[Akatek language|Akatek]], with over 50,000 speakers in [[San Miguel Acatán]] and [[San Rafael La Independencia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. Paul, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). "[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/knj/18 Akateko]" ''Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Eighteenth edition'', (2015). Dallas, Texas: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chuj language|Chuj]] is spoken by 40,000 people in Huehuetenango, and by 9,500 people, primarily refugees, over the border in Mexico, in the municipality of [[La Trinitaria, Mexico|La Trinitaria]], [[Chiapas]], and the villages of Tziscau and Cuauhtémoc. [[Tojolabal language|Tojolab'al]] is spoken in eastern Chiapas by 36,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), (2005) [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=toj Tojolabal: A language of Mexico.] and [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cnam Chuj: A language of Guatemala.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001200045/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cnam |date=2007-10-01 }} both accessed March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern branch===
The Quichean–Mamean languages and dialects, with two sub-branches and three subfamilies, are spoken in the [[Guatemalan Highlands|Guatemalan highlands]].

[[Q'eqchi' language|Q'eqchi']] (sometimes spelled Kekchi), which constitutes its own sub-branch within Quichean–Mamean, is spoken by about 800,000 people in the southern [[Petén (department)|Petén]], [[Izabal Department|Izabal]] and [[Alta Verapaz]] departments of Guatemala, and also in Belize by 9,000 speakers. In El Salvador it is spoken by 12,000 as a result of recent migrations.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), (2005). [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kek Ethnologue report on Q'eqchi], accessed March 07, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Uspantek language]], which also springs directly from the Quichean–Mamean node, is native only to the [[Uspantán]] ''[[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipio]]'' in the department of [[Quiché (department)|El Quiché]], and has 3,000 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), (2005) [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=usp Ethnologue report for Uspantec], accessed March 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Quichean sub-branch [[K'iche' language|K'iche' (Quiché)]], the Mayan language with the largest number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] in the [[Guatemala]]n highlands, around the towns of [[Chichicastenango]] and [[Quetzaltenango]] and in the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes|Cuchumatán mountains]], as well as by urban emigrants in [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref name="Gordon, Raymond G. 2005"/&gt; The famous Maya mythological document, ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', is written in an antiquated K'iche' often called [[Classical K'iche' language|Classical K'iche' (or Quiché)]]. The [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' culture]] was at its pinnacle at the time of the Spanish conquest. [[Q'umarkaj]], near the present-day city of [[Santa Cruz del Quiché]], was its economic and ceremonial center.{{sfn|Edmonson|1968|pages=250–251}} [[Achi language|Achi]] is spoken by 85,000 people in [[Cubulco]] and [[Rabinal]], two ''municipios'' of [[Baja Verapaz]]. In some classifications, e.g. the one by [[Lyle Campbell|Campbell]], Achi is counted as a form of K'iche'. However, owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as K'iche'.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The Ethnologue considers the dialects spoken in Cubulco and Rabinal to be distinct languages, two of the eight languages of a Quiché-Achi family.

The largest language in the Mamean sub-branch is [[Mam language|Mam]], spoken by 478,000 people in the departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango. [[Awakatek language|Awakatek]] is the language of 20,000 inhabitants of central [[Aguacatán]], another municipality of Huehuetenango.

[[File:Map-Maya in Mexico.svg|thumb|The area where Yucatec Maya is spoken in the peninsula of Yucatán]]
[[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] (known simply as "Maya" to its speakers) is the most commonly spoken Mayan language in [[Mexico]].

The other three Yucatecan languages are [[Mopan language|Mopan]], spoken by around 10,000 speakers primarily in [[Belize]]; [[Itza' language|Itza']], an extinct or moribund language from Guatemala's Petén Basin;&lt;ref&gt;There were only 12 remaining native speakers in 1986 according to Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.).

===Huastecan branch===
[[Wastek language|Wastek]] (also spelled Huastec and Huaxtec) is spoken in the Mexican states of [[Veracruz]] and [[San Luis Potosí]] by around 110,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.). Ethnologue (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most divergent of modern Mayan languages. [[Chicomuceltec]] was a language related to Wastek and spoken in [[Chiapas]] that became extinct some time before 1982.{{sfn|Campbell|Canger|1978}}

==Phonology==

===Proto-Mayan sound system===
[[Proto-Mayan]] (the common ancestor of the Mayan languages as reconstructed using the [[comparative method]]) has a predominant CVC syllable structure, only allowing consonant clusters across syllable boundaries. {{harvtxt|Campbell|Kaufman|1985}}{{sfn|Campbell|2015}}&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Proto-Mayan allowed roots of the shape {{IPA|CVC, CVVC, CVhC, CVʔC}}, an {{IPA|CVSC}} (where {{IPA|S}} is {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, or {{IPA|/x/}})); see {{harvtxt|England|1994|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Proto-Mayan roots were ''monosyllabic'' except for a few disyllabic nominal roots.
Due to subsequent vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at both ends of syllables. Following the reconstruction of [[Lyle Campbell]] and [[Terrence Kaufman]], the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds.{{sfn|Campbell|2015}} It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a ''tonal language'', based on the fact that four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|2015}} mistakenly writes Tzeltal for Tzotzil, {{harvtxt|Avelino|Shin|2011}} states that the reports of a fully developed tone contrast in San Bartolome Tzotzil are inaccurate&lt;/ref&gt; and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.{{sfn|Campbell|2015}}

===Phonological evolution of Proto-Mayan===
{{main|Proto-Mayan language}}
The classification of Mayan languages is based on changes shared between groups of languages. For example, languages of the western group (such as Huastecan, Yucatecan and Ch'olan) all changed the Proto-Mayan [[phoneme]] *{{IPA|/r/}} into {{IPA|[j]}}, some languages of the eastern branch retained {{IPA|[r]}} (K'ichean), and others changed it into {{IPA|[tʃ]}} or, word-finally, {{IPA|[t]}} (Mamean). The shared innovations between Huastecan, Yucatecan and Ch'olan show that they separated from the other Mayan languages before the changes found in other branches had taken place.&lt;ref name="England 1994, pp.30–31"&gt;{{harvtxt|England|1994|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palatalized [[plosive]]s {{IPA|[tʲʼ]}} and {{IPA|[tʲ]}} are not found in any of the modern families. Instead they are reflected differently in different branches, allowing a reconstruction of these phonemes as palatalized plosives. In the eastern branch (Chujean-Q'anjobalan and Ch'olan) they are reflected as {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[tʼ]}}. In Mamean they are reflected as {{IPA|[ts]}} and {{IPA|[tsʼ]}} and in Quichean as {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[tʃʼ]}}. Yucatec stands out from other western languages in that its palatalized plosives are sometimes changed into {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and sometimes {{IPA|[t]}}.{{sfn|England|1994|page=35}}

===Diphthongs===
Vowel quality is typically classified as having monophthongal vowels.  In traditionally diphthongized contexts, Mayan languages will realize the V-V sequence by inserting a hiatus-breaking glottal stop or glide insertion between the vowels.  Some K'ichean-branch languages have exhibited developed diphthongs from historical long vowels, by breaking /e:/ and /o:/.{{sfn|England|2001}}

==Grammar==
The [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Mayan languages is simpler than that of other Mesoamerican languages,&lt;ref group=notes&gt;{{harvtxt|Suárez|1983|p=65}} writes: "Neither Tarascan nor Mayan have words as complex as those found in Nahuatl, Totonac or Mixe–Zoque, but, in different ways both have a rich morphology."&lt;/ref&gt; yet its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is still considered [[Agglutinative language|agglutinating]] and [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]].{{sfn|Suárez|1983|p=65}} Verbs are marked for [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] or [[Grammatical tense|tense]], the [[Grammatical person|person]] of the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], the person of the [[object (grammar)|object]] (in the case of [[transitive verb]]s), and for [[Grammatical number|plurality]] of person. Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked. Inanimate nouns are not gendered, but, if necessary, the gender of animate nouns may be specified by the prefix.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Word order===
Proto-Mayan is thought to have had a basic [[verb–object–subject]] word order with possibilities of switching to [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] in certain circumstances, such as complex sentences, sentences where object and subject were of equal animacy and when the subject was definite.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Lyle Campbell (1997) refers to studies by Norman and Campbell ((1978) "Toward a proto-Mayan syntax: a comparative perspective on grammar", in ''Papers in Mayan Linguistics'', ed. Nora C. England, pp. 136–56. Columbia: Museum of Anthropology, University of Missouri) and by {{harvtxt|England|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolab'al have a basic fixed VOS word order. Mamean, Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Ch'orti' has a basic [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] word order. Other Mayan languages allow both VSO and VOS word orders.{{sfn|England|1991}}

===Numeral classifiers===
In many Mayan languages, counting requires the use of [[numeral classifiers]], which specify the class of items being counted; the numeral cannot appear without an accompanying classifier. Some Mayan languages, such as Kaqchikel, do not use numeral classifiers. Class is usually assigned according to whether the object is animate or inanimate or according to an object's general shape.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tozzer (1977 [1921]), pp. 103, 290–292.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus when counting "flat" objects, a different form of numeral classifier is used than when counting round things, oblong items or people. In some Mayan languages such as Chontal, classifiers take the form of affixes attached to the numeral; in others such as Tzeltal, they are free forms. Jakaltek has both numeral classifiers and noun classifiers, and the noun classifiers can also be used as pronouns.{{sfn|Craig|1977|p=141}}

The meaning denoted by a noun may be altered significantly by changing the accompanying classifier. In Chontal, for example, when the classifier ''-tek'' is used with names of plants it is understood that the objects being enumerated are whole trees. If in this expression a different classifier, ''-ts'it'' (for counting long, slender objects) is substituted for ''-tek'', this conveys the meaning that only sticks or branches of the tree are being counted:&lt;ref&gt;Example follows {{harvtxt|Suárez|1983|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Possession===
The morphology of Mayan nouns is fairly simple: they inflect for number (plural or singular), and, when possessed, for person and number of their possessor. Pronominal possession is expressed by a set of possessive prefixes attached to the noun, as in Kaqchikel ''ru-kej'' "his/her horse". Nouns may furthermore adopt a special form marking them as possessed. For nominal possessors, the possessed noun is inflected as possessed by a third-person possessor, and followed by the possessor noun, e.g. Kaqchikel ''ru-kej ri achin'' "the man's horse" (literally "his horse the man").&lt;ref name="Suaréz 1983, p. 85"&gt;{{harvtxt|Suárez|1983|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of formation is a main diagnostic trait of the [[Mesoamerican Linguistic Area]] and recurs throughout [[Mesoamerica]].{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|Smith-Stark|1986|pages=544–545}}

Mayan languages often contrast alienable and [[inalienable possession]] by varying the way the noun is (or is not) marked as possessed. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts inalienably possessed ''{{IPA|wetʃel}}'' "my photo (in which I am depicted)" with alienably possessed ''{{IPA|wetʃele}}'' "my photo (taken by me)". The prefix ''we-'' marks the first person singular possessor in both, but the absence of the ''-e'' possessive suffix in the first form marks inalienable possession.&lt;ref name="Suaréz 1983, p. 85"/&gt;

===Relational nouns===
Mayan languages which have [[preposition]]s at all normally have only one. To express location and other relations between entities, use is made of a special class of "[[relational noun]]s". This pattern is also recurrent throughout Mesoamerica and is another diagnostic trait of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In Mayan most relational nouns are metaphorically derived from body parts so that "on top of", for example, is expressed by the word for ''head''.{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|Smith-Stark|1986|pages=545–546}}

Relational nouns are possessed by the constituent that is the reference point of the relation, and the relational noun names the relation. Thus in Mayan one would say "the mountain's head" (literally "its head the mountain") to mean "on (top of) the mountain". Thus in the Classical Quiché of the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'' we read ''u-wach ulew'' "on the earth" (literally "its face the earth").{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Subjects and objects===
Mayan languages are [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] in their [[morphosyntactic alignment|alignment]]. This means that the subject of an intransitive verb is treated similarly to the object of a transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.{{sfn|Coon|2010|pages=47–52}}

Mayan languages have two sets of affixes that are attached to a verb to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set B) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They can also be used with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.{{sfn|Suárez|1983|page=77}}
{|class="wikitable"

|}

Another set (set A) is used to indicate the person of subjects of transitive verbs (and in some languages, such as Yucatec, also the subjects of intransitive verbs, but only in the incompletive aspects), and also the possessors of nouns (including relational nouns).&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Another view has been suggested by Carlos Lenkersdorf, an [[anthropologist]] who studied the [[Tojolab'al language]]. He argued that a native Tojolab'al speaker makes no cognitive distinctions between subject and object, or even between active and passive, animate and inanimate, seeing both subject and object as active participants in an action. For instance, in Tojolab'al rather than saying "I teach you", one says the equivalent of "I-teach you-learn". See {{harvtxt|Lenkersdorf|1996|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbs===
In addition to subject and object (agent and patient), the Mayan verb has affixes signalling aspect, tense, and mood as in the following example:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Mayan verb structure
|-
!Aspect/mood/tense
!Class A prefix

|colspan="7"|(K'iche') ''kinach'ayo'' "You are hitting me"
|}

[[Grammatical tense|Tense]] systems in Mayan languages are generally simple. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts only past and non-past, while Mam has only future and non-future. [[grammatical aspect|Aspect]] systems are normally more prominent. [[Grammatical mood|Mood]] does not normally form a separate system in Mayan, but is instead intertwined with the tense/aspect system.&lt;ref&gt;Suaréz (1983), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman has reconstructed a tense/aspect/mood system for proto-Mayan that includes seven aspects: incompletive, progressive, completive/punctual, imperative, potential/future, optative, and perfective.{{sfn|England|1994|page=126}}

Mayan languages tend to have a rich set of [[grammatical voice]]s. Proto-Mayan had at least one passive construction as well as an [[Antipassive voice|antipassive]] rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another that emphasizes the verbal action.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|1997|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: [[mediopassive voice|mediopassive]], incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of [[applicative voice|applicative]] promoting an indirect argument such as a [[benefactive]] or recipient to the object position).{{sfn|England|1994|page=97–103}}

===Statives and positionals===
In Mayan languages, words are usually viewed as belonging to one of four classes: verbs, statives, adjectives, and nouns.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Statives are a class of [[predicate (grammar)|predicative]] words expressing a quality or state, whose syntactic properties fall in between those of verbs and adjectives in Indo-European languages. Like verbs, statives can sometimes be inflected for person but normally lack inflections for tense, aspect and other purely verbal categories. Statives can be adjectives, positionals or numerals.{{sfn|Coon|Preminger|2009}}

Positionals, a class of [[root (linguistics)|root]]s characteristic of, if not unique to, the Mayan languages, form stative adjectives and verbs (usually with the help of suffixes) with meanings related to the position or shape of an object or person. Mayan languages have between 250 and 500 distinct positional roots:{{sfn|Coon|Preminger|2009}}

{{quotation|'''''Telan''' ay jun naq winaq yul b'e.''&lt;br/&gt;
::&lt;tt&gt;There is a man '''lying down fallen''' on the road.&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;'''''Woqan''' hin k'al ay max ek'k'u.''&lt;br/&gt;
::&lt;tt&gt;I spent the entire day '''sitting down'''.&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;''Yet ewi '''xoyan''' ay jun lob'aj stina.''&lt;br/&gt;
::&lt;tt&gt;Yesterday there was a snake '''lying curled up''' in the entrance of the house.&lt;/tt&gt;}}

In these three Q'anjob'al sentences,the positionals are ''telan'' ("something large or cylindrical lying down as if having fallen"), ''woqan'' ("person sitting on a chairlike object"), and ''xoyan'' ("curled up like a rope or snake").{{sfn|England|1994|p=87}}

===Word formation===
Compounding of noun roots to form new nouns is commonplace; there are also many morphological processes to derive nouns from verbs. Verbs also admit highly productive [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] affixes of several kinds, most of which specify transitivity or voice.{{sfn|Suárez|1983| page=65–67}}

Some Mayan languages allow incorporation of noun stems into verbs, either as direct objects or in other functions. However, there are few affixes with [[adverb]]ial or modal meanings.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

As in other Mesoamerican languages, there is widespread metaphorical use of roots denoting body parts, particularly to form locatives and relational nouns{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|Smith-Stark|1986|page=549}} such as Tzeltal/Tzotzil ''ti' na'' "door" (lit. "mouth of house"), or Kaqchikel ''chi ru-pam'' "inside" (lit. "mouth its-stomach").{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Mayan loanwords==
A number of [[loanword]]s of Mayan or potentially Mayan origins are found in other languages, principally [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], and some neighboring [[Mesoamerican languages]]. In addition, Mayan languages borrowed words, especially from Spanish.&lt;ref name=Hofling2011&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofling|first=Charles Andrew|title=Mopan Maya-Spanish-English Dictionary|year=2011|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|isbn=1607810298|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Mayan loanword is ''[[cigar]]''. {{lang|myn|sic}} is Mayan for "tobacco" and {{lang|myn|sicar}} means "to smoke tobacco leaves". This is the most likely origin for cigar and thus cigarette.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cigar Cigar], Online Etymology Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word "[[hurricane]]", which is a borrowing from the Spanish word {{lang|es|huracán}} is considered to be related to the name of Maya storm deity [[Huracan|Jun Raqan]]. However, it is probable that the word passed into European languages from a [[Cariban languages|Cariban language]] or [[Taíno language|Taíno]].&lt;ref&gt;Read &amp; González (2000), p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems==
[[File:Dresden codex, page 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya writing]] in the ''[[Dresden Codex]]'', ca. 11–12th century, [[Chichen Itza]]]]
[[File:Dresden Codex p09.jpg|thumb|upright=0.68|right|Page 9 of the [[Dresden Codex]] showing the classic Maya language written in [[Maya script|Mayan hieroglyphs]] (from the 1880 Förstermann edition)]] The complex script used to write Mayan languages in pre-Columbian times and known today from engravings at several Maya archaeological sites has been deciphered almost completely. The script is a mix between a logographic and a syllabic system.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2006, p. 6"&gt;{{harvtxt|Kettunen|Helmke|2005|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colonial times Mayan languages came to be written in a script derived from the Latin alphabet; orthographies were developed mostly by missionary grammarians.{{sfn|Suárez|1983|p=5}} Not all modern Mayan languages have standardized orthographies, but the Mayan languages of Guatemala use a standardized, Latin-based phonemic spelling system developed by the [[Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala]] (ALMG).&lt;ref name=French/&gt;&lt;ref name=England2007/&gt; Orthographies for the languages of Mexico are currently being developed by the [[Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas]] (INALI).{{sfn|Campbell|2015}}{{sfn|Maxwell|2011}}

===Glyphic writing===
{{Main|Maya script}}
{{double image|right|Balam_1.svg|100|Balam_2.svg|135|Two different ways of writing the word ''b'alam'' "jaguar" in the Maya script. First as logogram representing the entire word with the single glyph &lt;small&gt;B'ALAM&lt;/small&gt;, then phonetically using the three syllable signs ''b'a'', ''la'', and ''ma''. }}
{{triple image|right|Balam_3.svg|120|Balam_4.svg|100|Balam_5.svg|130|Three ways to write ''b'alam'' using combinations of the logogram with the syllabic signs as phonetic complements.}}
The pre-Columbian [[Maya civilization]] developed and used an intricate and fully functional [[writing system]], which is the only [[Mesoamerican writing systems|Mesoamerican script]] that can be said to be almost fully deciphered. Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Olmec]], and the [[Zoque languages|Zoque]]-speaking peoples of the southern [[Veracruz]] and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya writing system was adapted from one or more of these earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Olmec script]] as its most likely precursor.{{sfn|Schele|Freidel|1990}}{{sfn|Soustelle|1984}}

In the course of the deciphering of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as [[logosyllabary|logosyllabic]], in which symbols ([[glyph]]s or ''[[grapheme]]s'') can be used as either [[logogram]]s or [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2006, p. 6"/&gt; The script has a complete [[syllabary]] (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe would have been able to write anything [[phonetic]]ally, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2006, p. 6"/&gt;

At least two major Mayan languages have been confidently identified in hieroglyphic texts, with at least one other language probably identified. An archaic language variety known as [[Classic Maya language|Classic Maya]] predominates in these texts, particularly in the Classic-era inscriptions of the southern and central lowland areas. This language is most closely related to the Ch'olan branch of the language family, modern descendants of which include Ch'ol, Ch'orti' and Chontal. Inscriptions in an early Yucatecan language (the ancestor of the main surviving [[Yucatec language]]) have also been recognised or proposed, mainly in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] region and from a later period. Three of the four extant [[Maya codices]] are based on Yucatec. It has also been surmised that some inscriptions found in the [[Chiapas highlands]] region may be in a Tzeltalan language whose modern descendants are Tzeltal and Tzotzil.{{sfn|Kettunen|Helmke|2005|p=12}} Other regional varieties and dialects are also presumed to have been used, but have not yet been identified with certainty.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2006 p. 12"/&gt;

Use and knowledge of the Maya script continued until the 16th century [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish conquest]] at least. Bishop [[Diego de Landa Calderón]] of the [[Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán]] prohibited the use of the written language, effectively ending the Mesoamerican tradition of literacy in the native script. He worked with the Spanish colonizers to destroy the bulk of Mayan texts as part of his efforts to [[religious conversion|convert]] the locals to [[Christianity]] and away from what he perceived as [[pagan]] idolatry. Later he described the use of hieroglyphic writing in the religious practices of Yucatecan Maya in his ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]''.{{sfn|Kettunen|Helmke|2005|pages=7–8}}

===Colonial orthography===
{{anchor|Parra letter}}
Colonial orthography is marked by the use of ''c'' for /k/ (always hard, as in ''cic'' /kiik/), ''k'' for /q/ in Guatemala or for /k’/ in the Yucatán, ''h'' for /x/, and ''tz'' for /ts/; the absence of glottal stop or vowel length (apart sometimes for a double vowel letter for a long glottalized vowel, as in ''uuc'' /u’uk/), the use of ''u'' for /w/, as in ''uac'' /wak/, and the variable use of ''z, ç, s'' for /s/. The greatest difference from modern orthography, however, is in the various attempts to transcribe the ejective consonants.&lt;ref name=Missionary/&gt;

In ca. 1550, Francisco de la Parra invented distinctive letters for ejectives in the Mayan languages of Guatemala, the ''[[tresillo]]'' and ''[[cuatrillo]]'' (and derivatives). These were used in all subsequent Franciscan writing, and are occasionally seen even today. In 1605, Alonso Urbano doubled consonants for ejectives in [[Otomi language|Otomi]] (''pp, tt, ttz, cc / cqu''), and similar systems were adapted to Mayan. Another approach, in Yucatec, was to add a bar to the letter, or to double the stem.&lt;ref name=Missionary&gt;{{harvtxt|Arzápalo Marín|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the colonial period, practically all Maya writing has used a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]]. Formerly these were based largely on the [[Spanish alphabet]] and varied between authors, and it is only recently that standardized alphabets have been established. The first widely accepted alphabet was created for Yucatec Maya by the authors and contributors of the ''Diccionario Maya Cordemex'', a project directed by [[Alfredo Barrera Vásquez]] and first published in 1980.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The Cordemex contains a lengthy introduction on the history, importance, and key resources of written Yucatec Maya, including a summary of the orthography used by the project (pp. 39a-42a).&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages]] (known by its Spanish acronym ALMG), founded in 1986, adapted these standards to 22 Mayan languages (primarily in Guatemala).  The script is largely phonemic, but abandoned the distinction between the apostrophe for ejective consonants and the glottal stop, so that ejective {{IPA|/tʼ/}} and the non-ejective sequence {{IPA|/tʔ/}} (previously ''t' ''and ''t7'') are both written ''t'.''&lt;ref&gt;Josephe DeChicchis, [http://kgur.kwansei.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10236/7801/1/37-2.pdf "Revisiting an imperfection in Mayan orthography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103001201/http://kgur.kwansei.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10236/7801/1/37-2.pdf |date=2014-11-03 }}, ''Journal of Policy Studies'' 37 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Other major Maya languages, primarily in the Mexican state of Chiapas, such as Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Ch'ol, and Tojolab'al, are not generally included in this reformation, and are sometimes written with the conventions standardized by the Chiapan "State Center for Indigenous Language, Art, and Literature" (CELALI), which for instance writes "ts" rather than "tz" (thus Tseltal and Tsotsil). In Mexico, names of archaeological sites and other items of historical record retain the colonial spellings, rather than the revised orthography.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

One element of the revised orthographies that is not widely accepted, especially outside the Guatemalan context, is the conversion of proper nouns (such as names of archaeological sites, modern settlements, and cultures). Thus, the ''Cordemex'' continues to use the term "Yucatán" (rather than "Yukatan") in its preface, despite the fact that its orthography does not utilize a "c", and most scholarly archaeological texts continue to print the original spellings for archaeological sites and cultures that have been canonized in the literature over the centuries.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Literature==
{{main|Mesoamerican literature}}
From the classic language to the present day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as [[Mayan codices|codices]] made of [[amate|bark]], only four of which have survived the ravages of time and the campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.{{sfn|Coe|1987|p=161}}

Shortly after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]], the Mayan languages began to be written with Latin letters. Colonial-era literature in Mayan languages include the famous ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a mythico-historical narrative written in 17th century Classical Quiché but believed to be based on an earlier work written in the 1550s, now lost. The ''[[Título de Totonicapán]]'' and the 17th century theatrical work the ''[[Rabinal Achí]]'' are other notable early works in K'iche', the latter in the [[Achi language|Achí dialect]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;See {{harvtxt|Edmonson|1985}} for a thorough treatment of colonial Quiché literature.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Annals of the Cakchiquels]]'' from the late 16th century, which provides a historical narrative of the Kaqchikel, contains elements paralleling some of the accounts appearing in the ''Popol Vuh''. The historical and prophetical accounts in the several variations known collectively as the books of [[Chilam Balam]] are primary sources of early Yucatec Maya traditions.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Read {{harvtxt|Edmonson|Bricker|1985}} for a thorough treatment of colonial Yucatec literature.&lt;/ref&gt; The only surviving book of early lyric poetry, the [[Songs of Dzitbalche]] by Ah Bam, comes from this same period.{{sfn|Curl|2005}}

In addition to these singular works, many early grammars of indigenous languages, called "''artes''", were written by priests and friars. Languages covered by these early grammars include Kaqchikel, Classical Quiché, Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Yucatec. Some of these came with indigenous-language translations of the Catholic catechism.{{sfn|Suárez|1983|page=5}}

While Mayan peoples continued to produce a rich oral literature in the postcolonial period (after 1821), very little written literature was produced in this period.{{sfn|Suárez|1983|pages=163–168}}&lt;ref group=notes&gt;See {{harvtxt|Gossen|1985}} for examples of the Tzotzil tradition of oral literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because indigenous languages were excluded from the education systems of Mexico and Guatemala after independence, Mayan peoples remained largely illiterate in their native languages, learning to read and write in Spanish, if at all.{{sfn|Maxwell|2015}} However, since the establishment of the Cordemex {{sfn|Barrera Vásquez|Bastarrachea Manzano|Brito Sansores|1980}} and the Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages (1986), native language literacy has begun to spread and a number of indigenous writers have started a new tradition of writing in Mayan languages.{{sfn|Maxwell|2011}}{{sfn|Maxwell|2015}} Notable among this new generation is the K'iche' poet [[Humberto Ak'ab'al]], whose works are often published in dual-language Spanish/K'iche' editions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcd.gob.gt/MICUDE/directorios/directorio_cultural_deportivo/letras/inst15040512/ |title=Humberto Ak´abal |accessdate=2007-02-23 |date=March 26, 2007 |publisher=Guatemala Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214102223/http://www.mcd.gob.gt/MICUDE/directorios/directorio_cultural_deportivo/letras/inst15040512 |archivedate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as K'iche' scholar [[Luis Enrique Sam Colop]] (1955–2011) whose translations of the [[Popol Vuh]] into both Spanish and modern K'iche' achieved high acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ais.arizona.edu/news/luis-enrique-sam-colop-1955-2011 |title=Luis Enrique Sam Colop, 1955–2011 &amp;#124; American Indian Studies |publisher=Ais.arizona.edu |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Media Lengua Sample.ogg|thumb|This audio clip is a brief sample of the Media Lengua language spoken in Pijal, Imbabura, Ecuador. The recording was produced during an elicitation session where the speaker was asked for an oral translation of Spanish sentences.

'''Media Lengua''', also known as ''Chaupi-shimi'', ''Chaupi-lengua'', ''Chaupi-Quichua'', ''Quichuañol'', ''Chapu-shimi'' or ''llanga-shimi'',&lt;ref group=nb&gt;''Llanga-shimi'' is typically a derogatory term used by Kichwa-speakers to describe their language. However, it also appears to describe Media Lengua in the Imbabura Communities. It is believed that the term was introduced by [[Mestizo]] schoolteachers to discredit the indigenous populations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pallares"&gt;Pallares, A. (2002). From peasant struggles to Indian resistance: the Ecuadorian Andes in the late twentieth century. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (roughly translated to "''half language''" or "''in-between language''") is a [[mixed language]] with Spanish [[vocabulary]] and [[Kichwa language|Kichwa]] grammar, most conspicuously in its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. In terms of vocabulary, almost all [[lexeme]]s (89%&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"&gt;Muysken, Pieter (1997). "Media Lengua", in Thomason, Sarah G. ''Contact languages: a wider perspective'' Amsterdam: John Benjamins (pp. 365-426)&lt;/ref&gt;), including [[Swadesh list|core vocabulary]], are of Spanish origin and appear to conform to Kichwa [[phonotactics]]. Media Lengua is one of the few widely acknowledged examples of a "bilingual mixed language" in both the conventional and narrow [[Linguistics|linguistic]] sense because of its split between roots and suffixes.&lt;ref name="Backus"&gt;Backus Ad. 2003. Can a mixed language be conventionalised alternational codeswitching? in Matras &amp; Bakker (eds.) The Mixed Language Debate: theoretical and empirical advances Mouton de Gruyter Berlin: 237-/270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McConvell and Meakins"&gt;McConvell, Patrick, and Felicity Meakins. 2005. Gurindji Kriol: A Mixed Language Emerges from Code-switching. Quatro Fonologias Quechuas, 25(1), 9-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Such extreme and systematic borrowing is only rarely attested, and Media Lengua is not typically described as a variety of either Kichwa or Spanish. Arends et al., list two languages subsumed under the name ''Media Lengua'': Salcedo Media Lengua and Media Lengua of Saraguro.&lt;ref&gt;Arends, Muysken, &amp; Smith (1995), ''Pidgins and Creoles: An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; The northern variety of Media Lengua, found in the province of [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], is commonly referred to as Imbabura Media Lengua&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"/&gt; and more specifically, the dialect varieties within the province are known as Pijal Media Lengua and Angla Media Lengua.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
Media Lengua was first documented in [[Salcedo Canton|Salcedo]], [[Cotopaxi Province|Cotopaxi]] about 100&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Quito]], Ecuador, by Dutch linguist [[Pieter Muysken]] during [[fieldwork]] on Ecuadorian Kichwa.&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"/&gt; During Muysken's surveys of the language, he also described other highly relexified varieties of Kichwa, including Amazonian Pidgin, Kichwa-Spanish interlanguage, Saraguro Media Lengua, and Catalangu.&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"/&gt; A 2011 investigation of Salcedo Media Lengua, however, suggests that the language is no longer spoken by the locals in and around [[Salcedo Canton]].&lt;ref name="Shappeck"&gt;Shappeck, Marco (2011). [http://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/24334/Shappeck_Marco.pdf?sequence=1 ''Quichua–Spanish language contact in Salcedo, Ecuador: Revisiting Media Lengua syncretic language practices''] (dissertation)&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the current status of the other [[Relexification|relexified]] varieties of Kichwa described by Muysken. Several investigations from 2005, 2008, and 2011, however, show that a variety of Media Lengua is currently being spoken in the northern province of [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]].&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Stewart, Jesse (2011). [http://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/bitstream/1993/4882/1/Stewart_Jesse.pdf ''A Brief Descriptive Grammar of Pijal Media Lengua and an Acoustic Vowel Space Analysis of Pijal Media Lengua and Imbabura Quichua.'']. (thesis)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"&gt;Gómez-Rendón, J. (2005). La Media Lengua de Imbabura. Encuentros conflictos bilingüismo contacto de lenguas en el mundo andino (pp. 39-58). Madrid: Iberoamericana.&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations estimate that Imbabura Media Lengua is spoken by 2,600 people, 600 in the community of Pijal aged 35 and roughly 2,000 in and around the community of Angla, typically 25–45 years of age, making Media Lengua an endangered language and moribund in Pijal.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón2008"/&gt; The variety of Media Lengua that is spoken in Pijal appears to have emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and had its first generation of native speakers in the 1910s.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt; Pijal Media Lengua then spread to the nearby community of Angla in the 1950s and the 1960s through intercommunity marriages &lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt; and commerce.&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"/&gt; The current status of Media Lengua in Angla appears to be slightly healthier than in Pijal with the Angla variety having been passed on, to an extent, to the 2008 generation of schoolaged children.&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón2008"&gt;Gómez-Rendón, J. A. (2008). Mestizaje lingüístico en los Andes: génesis y estructura de una lengua mixta (1era. ed.). Quito, Ecuador: Abya-Yala.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

Several theories exist concerning the origins of Media Lengua. According to Muysken, Salcedo Media Lengua emerged through ethnic self-identification for indigenous populations, who no longer identified with either the rural Kichwa or the urban Spanish cultures.&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"/&gt; Gómez-Rendón claims Angla Media Lengua arose through prolonged contact between the Kichwa-speaking indigenous populations with the [[Mestizo]] Spanish speaking populations.&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"/&gt; Dikker believes Media Lengua was created by men who left their native communities to work in urban Spanish speaking areas. When the men returned to the communities, they had acquired a fluent level of Spanish and had been using Kichwa infrequently. Media Lengua then served as a link between the older monolingual Kichwa-speaking generation and younger monolingual Spanish speaking generations.&lt;ref name="Dikker"&gt;Dikker, S. (2008). Spanish prepositions in Media Lengua: Redefining relexification. Hispanisation: the impact of Spanish on the lexicon and grammar of the indigenous languages of Austronesia and the Americas (pp. 121-146). Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Stewart claims that Media Lengua was either brought to Pijal from Salcedo or vice versa. He bases these claims on the "striking resemblance" between the Pijal and Salcedo varieties at both the phonological and the morphological level. The claim also includes testimonies of a large migration from Cotopaxi to Pijal at the beginning of the 20th century, which can be seen in the many Cotopaxi surnames in community.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;
Most researchers agree, however, that Media Lengua developed linguistically through various processes of [[lexification]] ([[relexification]],&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"/&gt; [[adlexification]]&lt;ref name="Shappeck"/&gt; and [[translexification]]&lt;ref name="Muysken1981"&gt;Muysken, P. (1981). Halfway between Quechua and Spanish: The case for relexification. Historicity and variation in Creole studies (pp. 57-78). Ann Arbor: Karoma Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) in a relatively short period of time.

==Vitality==

Jarrín (2014) investigated sociolinguistic aspects of Media Lengua in the communities of Angla, Uscha, Casco-Valenzuela, and El Topo in the Province of Imbabura. With a series of surveys and interviews regarding language attitude and language usage, a complex linguistic environment emerged which changes from community to community. In the more urban communities of Angla and Casco-Valenzuela, Media Lengua is preferred and Quichua appears to be losing ground.&lt;ref name="Jarrin2014"&gt;Jarrín, G. (2014). Estereotipos Lingüísticos en Relación al Kichwa y a la Media Lengua en las Comunidades de Angla, Casco Valenzuela, El Topo y Ucsha de la Parroquia San Pablo del Lago. (Licenciatura), Pontificia Universidad Católica Del Ecuador, Quito.&lt;/ref&gt; In the more rural communities of Uscha and El Topo, Kichwa is still preferred and the usage of Media Lengua is frowned upon. Jarrín (2014) also reports that there are also cases of children acquiring Media Lengua from their parents and grandparents, which is not the case in Pijal. In Pijal speakers of Media Lengua are typically aged 35 and above, those aged 20–35 typically have a passive knowledge of the language, and speakers aged 20 and younger are often monolingual in Spanish. Estimates of the number of speakers vary widely. In Pijal, there is an estimated 300 to 500 speakers while in the communities of Angla, Uscha, Casco-Valenzuela, and El Topo, there may be as many 2000+ speakers.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Words of Spanish origin often appear to conform to [[Kichwa language|Kichwa]] phonotactics. However, voiced [[obstruent]]s, which exist phonologically only as [[stop consonant|stops]] in a post-[[sonorant]] environment in Kichwa,&lt;ref name="Darnell"&gt;Darnell, M. (1999). Functionalism and formalism in linguistics. Amsterdam: J. Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; appear phonemically as [[minimal pair]]s or near minimal pairs in Media Lengua through Spanish borrowings:

'''Kichwa [-sonorant] &lt;tt&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; [+voice]/[+sonorant]___'''

{| class="wikitable IPA"

Another phonological difference between Media Lengua and Kichwa is that Media Lengua often does not take into account the [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|voicing]] rule.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"/&gt;

===Vowels===
There are several competing views regarding the number and types of vowels in Media Lengua. One theory suggests Salcedo Media Lengua, like Kichwa, maintains three vowels [i], [u] and [a], with the occasional Spanish preservation of [e] and [o] in names, interjections and in stressed positions.&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"/&gt; Under that theory, all other Spanish borrowings assimilate to the Kichwa system. Another theory suggests that Imbabura Media Lengua passes through a three-step process of assimilation and words can maintain Spanish phonotactics [kabeza] ''cabeza'' 'head', undergo partial assimilation [kabisa] ''cabeza'' or (3) undergo complete assimilation [kabiza] ''cabeza''. This theory also suggests that high-frequency words also tend to undergo complete assimilation, but low-frequency do not.&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"/&gt; Finally, acoustic evidence supports the claim that Media Lengua could be dealing with as many as eight vowels: Spanish-derived [i, a, u], which exist as extreme mergers with Kichwa-derived [i, a, u], and Spanish-derived [e] and [o], which exist as partial mergers with Kichwa [i] and [u], respectively.&lt;ref name="Stewart2014"&gt;Stewart, J. (2014). A comparative analysis of Media Lengua and Quichua vowel production. Phonetica. 7(3):159-182 doi 10.1159/000369629.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish diphthongs also exist with various degrees of assimilation in both Media Lengua dialects. The diphthong /ue/ is sometimes pronounced as /u/, /wi/ or /i/; Spanish /ui/ is pronounced /u/; Spanish /ie/ is pronounced as /i/; and Spanish /ai/, is maintained from Kichwa.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muysken1997"/&gt;

There is also evidence of sonorant devoicing between voiceless obstruents, which affects the realization of pitch accents that fall on devoiced syllables (see the following section).

'''[+sonorant]&lt;tt&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;[-voice]/[-sonorant] ___ [-sonorant]'''&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''{{spaces|32}}[-voice]{{spaces|13}}[-voice]'''

(1) ''Vos'''tek'''a tuyu casa'''pik'''a''.&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|4}}[bos.'''te'''.ka tu.ju ka.za.'''pi'''ka]&lt;tt&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;[bos.'''te̥'''.ka tu.ju ka.za.'''pi̥'''ka]&lt;br&gt; 
"[What do] you [have planted] at your house?"

===Prosody===

According to Muysken (1997), like Kichwa, stress is penultimate in Media Lengua. Stewart (2015), referring to stress as ''pitch accent'' (PA), provides a similar analysis pointing towards the realization of a low-high pitch accent (L+H*) taking place at the prosodic word level on, leading up to, or just after the penultimate syllable of a word. In the majority of a cases, an L+H* pitch accent on the penultimate syllable describes word level prosody (see example 1).

(1)&lt;small&gt;{{spaces|10}}L+H*{{spaces|22}}L+H*{{spaces|18}}L+H*{{spaces|6}}L%&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}''Papa'''su'''ka wawakuna'''wan'''mi colera'''hur'''ka''.&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}"Father was angry with the children."

In certain cases, however, a simple high (H*) may appear when the PA follows the penultimate syllable of a disyllabic word or when a voiceless onset appears in the penultimate syllable (see example 2). In both cases, Stewart (2015) suggests that is caused since there is no material to bear the preaccental rise, which would otherwise be realized as a typical L+H* PA.

(2)&lt;small&gt;H*{{spaces|13}}L+H*{{spaces|6}}L%&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}'''''Be'''la que'''ma'''jun''.&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}"The candle is burning."

Media Lengua also appears to mark emphasis at the prosodic word level with a substantial increase in pitch frequency on one or more words in an utterance (L+^H*) (see example 3). Pitch accents may also appear in a stair step-like pattern in utterances containing reduplication where the low (L) on the second instance of the reduplicated pair is often undershot. In the first instance of the reduplicated pair, a standard L+H* appears while in the second instances an emphatic L+^H% PA takes place where the L may be undershot (see example 4).

(3)&lt;small&gt;{{spaces|7}}L+H*{{spaces|14}}L+^H*{{spaces|6}}L+H*{{spaces|6}}L+^H*{{spaces|8}}L+H*{{spaces|23}}L+H*{{spaces|38}}L+^H*{{spaces|28}}L%&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}''Y a'''lo'''tro diaka '''vuel'''ta '''o'''tro bas'''tan'''teta lle'''vash'''pa, escondi'''di'''to mio mamamanta lle'''vash'''pa inkarkachi''.&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}"And on the following day, we would go bringing another bunch [of beans] hidden from my mom."

(4)&lt;small&gt;{{spaces|9}}L+H*{{spaces|5}}L+H*{{spaces|6}}L+^H*{{spaces|10}}L+H*{{spaces|12}}L-{{spaces|5}}H*{{spaces|8}}H*{{spaces|4}}H%&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}''Diay'''man'''ta '''wa'''chu '''wa'''chu bus'''cash'''ka dezin '''u'''no ca'''ña'''ta''.&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}"So, they say she looked all over the plot of land, for a stick that is."

Stewart (2015) also describes instances of intermediate boundaries appearing as a single low tone (L-). These are often observed in standard content questions (wh-questions) following the utterance-initial question constituent or in some cases after words containing an emphatic PA (see example 5).&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt; There is also evidence of intermediate boundary tones in the form of pitch restart which take place in listing intonation just before the listing of items begins.

(5)&lt;small&gt;{{spaces|11}}L+H*{{spaces|5}}L-{{spaces|20}}L%&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}''Quien'''pa'''tak ese pelota?''&lt;br&gt;
{{spaces|3}}"Whose ball is that?"

The intonational phrase in Media Lengua (the highest level unit within the autosegmental-metrical framework &lt;ref name="Goldsmith"&gt;Goldsmith, John. 1979. The aim of autosegmental phonology. Linguistic Analysis, 2(1):23–68&lt;/ref&gt;) is marked by a low boundary tone (L%) at the end of nearly every utterance (see examples 1, 2, 3, and 5).&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"&gt;Stewart, J. (2015). Intonation patterns in Pijal Media Lengua. Journal of language contact 8(2):223-262. doi 10.1163/19552629-00802003&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to the configuration can be found in what Stewart (2015) refers to as ''clarifying'' utterances, which are marked with a high boundary tone (H%) (see example 4). Clarifying utterances in Media Lengua are used in three typical scenarios: (1) to clarify that a topic within a conversation is shared by those speaking, (2) to provide information which was accidentally left out of the main clause, and (3) provide the listener with additional information.&lt;ref name="Stewart2015"/&gt;

==Morphology==
Media Lengua, like Kichwa, is a highly [[agglutinative language]]. Its normal sentence order is SOV ([[subject–object–verb]]). There are a large number of [[suffix]] changes both in the overall significance of words and their meanings. Of the 63 particles in Kichwa, Imbabura Media Lengua makes use of 49;&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"/&gt; an estimated 80% of the original Kichwa morphemes. The derivation and infectional particles appear to be in complete functioning order in the same way they are found in Ecuadorian Kichwa.&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"/&gt;

:(1) '''y mientras trabaja-shpa-ndu primer año estudia-rka-ni'''&lt;ref name="Gómez-Rendón"/&gt;
::and while work-GER-GER     first year study-PRET-1s
::"And while I worked the first year, I studied."

|Para hilar lana comenzamos trasquilando una oveja, sigue el lavado y luego se tisa  la lana, se envuelve muy firme en un palo que se lo pone en nuestra cintura, entonces podemos seguir hilando alrededor. Con esta lana hacíamos un poncho para nuestro esposo y para nuestro suegro y un anaco para la suegra. 
Después, cansadas de hilar, también bordábamos como hoy en día las camisas a mano. Por lo general se borda una camisa en cualquier lugar, por ejemplo: durante las mingas o en las reuniones. Hoy en día ya no hilamos a mano las camisas, estas vienen bordadas.
|To spin wool, we begin by shearing the sheep, washing the wool and removing the pulling. We then make taut the wool by wrapping it around a stick that we keep in the sash around our waist. This way we can go about spinning, for example, a poncho for our husbands, an ''anaco''  for our mothers-in-law or a poncho for our fathers-in-law. 
After we get tired of spinning, we might switch to a shirt and sew by hand. Even today it's still common to sew by hand. We will sew basically anywhere. Often, during ''mingas'' or meetings, we will sit and work on a shirt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8139">'''Narcissistic elation''' or '''narcissistic coenaesthetic expansion''' were terms used by Hungarian psychoanalyst [[Béla Grunberger]] to highlight 'the narcissistic situation of the primal self in narcissistic union with the mother'.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Figlio, ''Psychoanalysis, Science and Masculinity'' (2001) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissistic elation has also been used more widely to describe a variety of conditions, including states of being in [[love]], of triumph,  and of obtaining self-understanding.

== Grunberger's definition==

The term was coined to describe the state of prenatal beatitude, which according to him characterizes the life of the fetus: a state of [[megalomania]]cal happiness amounting to a perfect homeostasis, devoid of needs or desires. The ideal here is bliss experienced in absolute withdrawal from the object and from the outside world. Narcissistic elation is at once the memory of this unique and privileged state of elation; a sense of well-being of completeness and omnipotence linked to that memory, and pride in having experienced this state, pride in its (illusory) oneness. Narcissistic elation is characteristic of an object relationship that is played out, in its negative version, as a state of splendid isolation, and, in its positive version, as a desperate quest for fusion with the other, for a mirror-image relationship. It involves a return to paradise lost and all that is attached to this idea: fusion, self-love, megalomania, omnipotence, immortality, and invulnerability. After birth, the infant continues to enjoy the protonarcissistic existence as before, and this is reinforced by the fact that people around it, in particular the mother, meet all its needs and wishes. This state of illusion is soon compromised, however, as inevitable frustrations begin to occur. The traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on the notions of harmony and omnipotence, nevertheless provide a source of psychic energy that will remain active throughout life. The child, and later the adult, will seek to preserve and return to this narcissistic mode of being, notably through music, passionate love, or mystical ecstasy. Perhaps, after all, what fascinated Narcissus was the sight—beyond his own reflection—of the amniotic water, and the deep, regressive promise of happiness that it held out. Following an initial period of elation known as the "honeymoon", psychoanalytic treatment must succeed in bringing together the narcissistic elements of the self by integrating them into interpretations of reality: ego-libido and object-libido must arrive at a satisfactory compromise.

==Oceanic origins==

[[Freud]] had used the term [[oceanic feeling]] to describe 'an early phase of ego-feeling...the oceanic feeling, which might seek something like the restoration of limitless [[narcissism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Grunberger and [[André Green (psychoanalyst)|André Green]] have subsequently 'traced narcissism to pre-natal states of elation, making it biological and drive-driven'.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Kilbourne, ''Disappearing Persons'' (2002) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Building on 'the state of prenatal beatitude, which according to him characterizes the life of the fetus', Grunberger therefore considered that 'narcissistic elation is at once the memory of this unique and privileged state of elation; a sense of well-being of completeness and omnipotence linked to that memory, and pride in having experienced this state, pride in its (illusory) oneness'.

==Ego ideal==
{{Main|Ego ideal}}
Freud also explored how 'in cases of [[mania]] the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and ego ideal have fused together...in a mood of triumph and self-satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Grunberger considered such states as reaching back to the primal narcissistic elation, and as drawing on 'traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on the notions of harmony and omnipotence'.

Building on his work, [[Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel]] claims that 'it is indeed therefore narcissistic elation, the meeting of ego and ideal, that dissolves the [[Id, ego and super-ego|superego]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, ''The Ego Ideal'' (1985) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; One may consider in general that 'the feeling of triumph...brings with it "oceanic" feelings, because it represents reunion with the omnipotent one'.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph R. Greenson, "On Gambling", in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toddling==
With respect to a slightly later phase of early development, [[Margaret Mahler]] 'describes the practising junior [[toddler|toddler's]] [[omnipotent]] exhilaration (excitement) and narcissistic elation (joy)'&lt;ref&gt;Allan N. Schore, ''Affect Regulation and the Origins of the Self'' (1999) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; at learning to walk—the 'tremendously exhilarating, truly dramatic effect that upright locomotion had'—noting however that 'it is precisely at the point where the child is at the peak of his delusion of omnipotence...that his narcissism is particularly vulnerable to deflation'.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret S. Mahler, ''The Psychological Birth of the Human Infant'' (London 1975) p. 74 and p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the toddler's new achievement, 'from dawn to dusk he marches around in an ecstatic, drunken dance...quite in love with himself for being so clever'.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1996) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-understanding==

Narcissistic elation may subsequently be reactivated within a therapeutic context. [[Edmund Bergler]] wrote of 'the narcissistic elation that comes from self-understanding';&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Lindesmith, ''Addiction and Opiates'' (2008) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] described what he called the re-emergence of '"narcissistic omnipotent object relations"...in the clinical situation'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Grotstein, "Foreword", in [[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat similarly, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] spoke of 'the megalomaniac ebriety which...[i]s the index of the termination of the analysis in present practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997( p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love==

In later life, the adult may seek to 'return to this narcissistic mode of being, notably through music, passionate love, or mystical ecstasy'. For some, the whole 'purpose of love...[is] equal exchange in an atmosphere of shared narcissistic elation'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Starobinski, ''Blessings in Disguise'' (1993) p. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others may consider as ultimately futile this 'search for a pure narcissistic exaltation, the elation procured by [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the imaginary]] contemplation of the object';&lt;ref&gt;Chasseguet-Smirgal, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and yet still recognise the power of 'the enchantment of love...as the exaltation of the other...this breathlessness which, with the other, has created the most false of demands, that of narcissistic satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1993) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

In ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', a 'cold intellectual arrogance and narcissistic elation' have been identified in 'the highly ambitious speculations attributed to [[Stephen Dedalus|Stephen]]—the central protagonist—with respect to aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;André Bleikasten, ''The Most Splendid Failure'' (1976) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Language Service''' promotes and facilitates communication across languages in [[South Africa]].

The NLS' core objective is to meet the language requirements of the [[Constitution of South Africa|constitution]]{{fact|date=May 2017}} by facilitating, promoting and providing a translation and editing service in all the official languages and by managing language diversity through [[language planning]] and terminology projects.

The NLS functions as the Government's professional language support system by translating official documents in all the official languages. Its terminology service assists with the development and modernisation of the technical vocabularies of the official languages. The language planning functions include advising the Government on the development of language policy and implementation strategies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3025">The '''noisy channel model''' is a framework used in [[spell checker]]s,
[[question answering]], [[speech recognition]], and [[machine translation]].
In this model, the goal is to find the intended word given a word where the
letters have been scrambled in some manner.

== Definition ==

Given an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; be the set
of all finite strings over &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Let the dictionary
&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of valid words be some subset of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
&lt;math&gt;D\subseteq\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''noisy channel''' is the matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{ws} = \Pr(s|w)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;w\in D&lt;/math&gt; is the intended word and &lt;math&gt;s\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;
is the scrambled word that was actually received.

== Example ==

Consider the English alphabet
&lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \{a, b, c, ..., y, z, A, B, ..., Z, ...\}&lt;/math&gt;. Some subset
&lt;math&gt;D\subseteq\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; makes up the dictionary of valid English
words.

There are several mistakes that may occur while typing, including:

# Missing letters, e.g., ''{{notatypo|leter}}'' instead of ''letter''
# Accidental letter additions, e.g., ''{{notatypo|misstake}}'' instead of ''mistake''
# Swapping letters, e.g., ''{{notatypo|recieved}}'' instead of ''received''
# Replacing letters, e.g., ''{{notatypo|fimite}}'' instead of ''finite''

To construct the noisy channel matrix &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, we must consider
the probability of each mistake, given the intended word
(&lt;math&gt;\Pr(s|w)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;w\in D&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;s\in\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;). These probabilities may be gathered, for
example, by considering the [[Levenshtein distance]] between &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; or by comparing the draft of an essay with one that has
been manually edited for spelling.

== Error-correction ==

The goal of the noisy channel model is to find the intended word given the
scrambled word that was received. The '''decision function'''
&lt;math&gt;\sigma : \Sigma^* \to D&lt;/math&gt; is a function that, given a scrambled word, returns
the intended word.

Methods of constructing a decision function include the
[[maximum likelihood|maximum likelihood rule]], the
[[maximum a posteriori|maximum a posteriori rule]], and the
[[minimum distance estimation|minimum distance rule]].

In some cases, it may be better to accept the scrambled word as the intended
word rather than attempt to find an intended word in the dictionary. For
example, the word ''[[schönfinkeling]]'' may not be in the dictionary, but might
in fact be the intended word.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7907">{{About|a law enforcement term||Person of Interest (disambiguation){{!}}Person of Interest}}
"'''Person of interest'''" is a term used by U.S. law enforcement when identifying someone involved in a [[criminal investigation]] who has not been [[arrest]]ed or formally accused of a crime. It has no legal meaning, but refers to someone in whom the police are "interested," either because the person is &lt;!-- not? --&gt; cooperating with the investigation, may have information that would assist the investigation, or possesses certain characteristics that merit further attention.

While terms such as ''[[suspect]]'', ''target'', and ''[[material witness]]'' have clear and sometimes formal definitions, ''person of interest'' remains undefined by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name="DilemaOfInterest" /&gt; ''Unsub'' is a similar term which is short for "unknown subject" (used often, for example, in the TV show ''[[Criminal Minds]]'').  ''Person of interest'' is sometimes used as a [[euphemism]] for ''[[suspect]]'', and its careless use may encourage [[trial by media|trials by media]].

With respect to terrorism investigations, [[Eric Lichtblau]] wrote in the ''New York Times'': "Law enforcement officials say that the term simply reflects the new tactics required to fight terrorism. But some legal scholars say officials are trying to create a more benign public image, even as their power expands."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[[Eric Lichtblau|Lichtblau, Eric]] (2003--09-14) [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/weekinreview/page-two-sept-7-13-words-as-tactics-in-war-on-terror.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Words as Tactics In War on Terror], ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This phrase was first utilized by law enforcement in 1986, during the investigation of the Green River Killer. It was coined by Fae Brooks, a member of the King County Sheriff’s Department at the time of the investigation. 


According to Eric Lichtbau in the ''[[New York Times]]'':

{{quote|The term has an ugly history; in the 1960s American law enforcement officials began creating secret dossiers on [[Vietnam War]] protesters, [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights]] leaders and other persons of interest...The vaguely sinister term has been applied to targets of [[terrorism]] investigations, the chief suspect in the murder of the [[Baylor University|Baylor]] basketball player [[Patrick Dennehy]] and [[Steven Hatfill|Steven J. Hatfill]], the scientist who has figured prominently in the investigation into the [[2001 anthrax attacks]]...[[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] is often credited with popularizing the person-of-interest label, having used it [in 2002] to describe Dr. Hatfill.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;}}

The term was used widely in mass media at least as early as the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing]] in reference to [[Richard A. Jewell]]. Its initial uses aroused controversy, but it has since seen increasingly regular use.&lt;ref name="DilemaOfInterest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4042 |title=Dilemma of Interest |publisher=[[American Journalism Review]] |author=Donna Shaw |date=February–March 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewell later remarked on the use of the term:

{{quote|Question: Do you believe that the public will formulate the same idea about that person's involvement in criminal activity upon hearing the term "person of interest"? Is this just a euphemism, just another way of saying "suspect"?

Jewell: I'd say so. The public knows what's going on. Because of what happened to me, things have changed. It has definitely changed the way the media in Atlanta refer to people that are arrested or are suspects. And I've seen it on some of the national channels like [[Fox News]], [[NBC]] and [[CNN]]. They've all changed. Go back before 1996, at a shooting or a murder and see how they refer to the person whom they're arresting in the incident. Compare that with something that's recent and look at the difference. What happened to me is a factor in that change.&lt;ref&gt;Clay Calvert and Robert D. Richards, ''[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mcglr35&amp;div=9&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals Journalism, Libel Law and a Reputation Tarnished: A Dialogue with Richard Jewell and His Attorney, L. Lin Wood]'', 35 McGeorge L. Rev. 1, 35 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Hatfill v. Ashcroft''===
The use of the term became widely critiqued when [[United States Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] used it in a [[press conference]] when asked if Dr. [[Steven Hatfill|Steven J. Hatfill]] was a [[suspect]] in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] case.  In 2002, Hatfill's attorney filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s [[Office of Professional Responsibility]], arguing that "the term is not recognized in law or criminal procedure and that Ashcroft did not have the right 'to preside over the public shredding of [Hatfill's] life. This is un-American. Mr. Ashcroft owes Dr. Hatfill an apology.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Jackman, Tom (2002-08-25) [http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/handlinginquiryquestioned.html Handling of Anthrax Inquiry Questioned; Scientist's Attorney Criticizes Ashcroft Statements, Accuses FBI of Leaks to Media], ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Hatfill sued the Department of Justice for violation of federal privacy law; the case was settled in 2008 for $5.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/15/93170200/timeline-how-the-anthrax-terror-unfolded|title=Timeline: How The Anthrax Terror Unfolded|date=February 15, 2011|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Normal Justice Department [[parlance]] for subjects of investigation includes "[[suspect]]," "subject" and "target." Each has specific meanings relevant to different levels of investigation. [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Grassley]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of [[Iowa]], wrote to the Attorney General for clarification of the unfamiliar phrase in September 2002. In December of that year, [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]'s Global Security Newswire summarized the response as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/2002/12/13/7s.html |title=Anthrax: FBI Searches Forest for Clues to 2001 Attacks |author= |date=13 December 2002 |work= |publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] |accessdate=29 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121092637/http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/2002/12/13/7s.html |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|… the U.S. Justice Department has said that it did not intend for Hatfill to come under such intense media scrutiny by describing him has a "person of interest" in the anthrax investigation, according to department letters sent to Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), which were released yesterday. … The department did not intend to cause any harm to Hatfill when it described him as a person of interest, Assistant Attorney General Daniel Bryant said in one of the letters.  Instead, the department meant "to deflect media scrutiny" and "explain that he (Hatfill) was just one of many scientists" who had cooperated with the FBI investigation, Bryant said.

Grassley said yesterday that he appreciates the department's replies to his inquiries. "I also appreciate the department's candidness that the action regarding Mr. Hatfill and his employment is unprecedented," Grassley said in a statement, and that "there is no … formal definition for the term 'person of interest.'}}

'''Prose &amp; Poetry''', or '''Prose-Poetry''', is a competitive speech event practiced by state high-school [[Public speaking|forensics/public speaking]] or debating associations such as the [[Ohio High School Speech League]] and the [[California High School Speech Association]], and the [[National Forensic League]] (NFL). The NFL does have consolation events in [[Prose Interpretation]] and [[Poetry Interpretation]] at the National Tournament, but these are only open to competitors who qualified in other events and were eliminated before the late elimination rounds.

Competitors in Prose &amp; Poetry (short form: P-P) read an ''unmemorized''  cut of prose or poetry, which is typically read from a small black binder.  A short memorized introduction precedes the prose or poetry reading.  The time limit for these events is typically five minutes, occasionally with a 30-second grace period, though in some areas the time limit is seven minutes. Competition rules are the same as for NFL interpretation events.

In [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[computer science]], a [[formal language]] is called '''recursively enumerable''' (also '''recognizable''', '''partially decidable''', '''semidecidable''', '''Turing-acceptable''' or '''Turing-recognizable''') if it is a [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable subset]] in the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible words over the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of the language, i.e., if there exists a [[Turing machine]] which will enumerate all valid strings of the language.

Recursively enumerable languages are known as '''type-0''' languages in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of formal languages. All [[regular language|regular]], [[context-free grammar|context-free]], [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]] and [[recursive language|recursive]] languages are recursively enumerable.

The class of all recursively enumerable languages is called '''[[RE (complexity)|RE]]'''.

==Definitions==
There are three equivalent definitions of a recursively enumerable language:

# A recursively enumerable language is a [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable]] [[subset]] in the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible words over the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of the [[formal language|language]].
# A recursively enumerable language is a formal language for which there exists a [[Turing machine]] (or other [[computable function]]) which will enumerate all valid strings of the language. Note that if the language is [[Infinity|infinite]], the enumerating algorithm provided can be chosen so that it avoids repetitions, since we can test whether the string produced for number ''n'' is "already" produced for a number which is less than ''n''. If it already is produced, use the output for input ''n+1'' instead (recursively), but again, test whether it is "new".
# A recursively enumerable language is a formal language for which there exists a Turing machine (or other computable function) that will halt and accept when presented with any [[literal string|string]] in the language as input but may either halt and reject or loop forever when presented with a string not in the language. Contrast this to [[recursive language]]s, which require that the Turing machine halts in all cases.

All [[regular language|regular]], [[context-free language|context-free]], [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]] and [[recursive language|recursive]] languages are recursively enumerable.

[[Post's theorem]] shows that '''[[RE (complexity)|RE]]''', together with its [[complement (complexity)|complement]] [[co-RE]], correspond to the first level of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

==Example==
The set of [[Halting Problem|halting turing machines]] is recursively enumerable but not recursive. Indeed one can run the Turing Machine and accept if the machine halts, hence it is recursively enumerable. On the other hand the problem is undecidable. 

Some other recursively enumerable languages that are not recursive include:

* [[Post correspondence problem]] 
* [[Mortality (computability theory)]]
* [[Entscheidungsproblem]]

==Closure properties==
Recursively enumerable languages (REL) are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are two recursively enumerable languages, then the following languages are recursively enumerable as well:

* the [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of ''L''
* the [[Concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L \circ P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''
* the [[Union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt;
* the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] &lt;math&gt;L \cap P&lt;/math&gt;.

Recursively enumerable languages are not closed under [[set difference]] or complementation. The set difference ''L&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;P'' may or may not be recursively enumerable.  If ''L'' is recursively enumerable, then the complement of ''L'' is recursively enumerable if and only if ''L'' is also recursive.

'''Ro''' is an [[A priori (languages)|a priori]] [[constructed language]] created by Rev. Edward Powell Foster beginning in 1904. 

==Creator==
Rev. Edward Powell Foster lived from 1853 through 1937;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120423022410/http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/ro.htm Article on Ro] by Rick Harrison at Langmaker.com&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Marietta, Ohio]]. He was buried along with his wife in Riverview Cemetery in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]].

==Characteristics==
In Ro, words are constructed using a [[A priori (languages)|category system]]. For example, all words starting with "bofo-" signify colors; the word for ''red'' is "bofoc", and ''yellow'' is "bofof".  Foster did not simply try to design a better language in general, but to optimize his language for one design criterion: recognizability of unknown words. Foster wrote about Ro:

{{Quote|Ro did not begin with attempting to rival or supplant any other language whatever, either natural or artificial, nor was it suggested by any of them.
Unexpectedly came the thought: "How strange it is that there is nothing in the appearance of a written or printed word that gives the slightest hint of its meaning. Why should a word not be a picture? A new word, never seen before would then, like a painting seen for the first time, convey at least some of the meaning to the eye."&lt;ref name="Dict"&gt;''Dictionary of Ro: The World Language'', page 3, Rev. Edward Powell Foster, ROIA, [[Waverly, West Virginia]], 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After working on the language for about two years, Foster published the first booklet about Ro in 1906.  The publication of Ro periodicals was supported by several American sponsors, especially from the [[Marietta, Ohio]] area, including [[Melvil Dewey]]&lt;!-- Foster spells it Melvil --&gt;,&lt;ref name="Dict 6"&gt;''Dictionary of Ro'', page 6&lt;/ref&gt; inventor of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (another attempt to categorize human knowledge), Vice President [[Charles G. Dawes]],&lt;ref name="Dict 6"/&gt; [[George White (Ohio politician)|George White]],&lt;ref name="Dict 6"/&gt; who mentioned Ro in the [[Congressional Record]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.conlang.org/about/Conlang_Exhibit_Master_File_Text_rev.pdf Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://conlang.org/resources/conlangers-calendar/?start=20180301&amp;months=1 A Conlanger's Calender | Language Creation Society (Month set to March)]&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]] of [[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]].&lt;ref name="Dict 6"/&gt;  Several more books about Ro by Foster and his wife appeared over the years, as late as 1932.

A common criticism of Ro is that it can be difficult to hear the difference between two words; usually one consonant makes the word different in meaning, but still similar enough that the intended meaning often cannot be guessed from context. This characteristic is common among [[philosophical languages]], which are characterized by vocabulary developed taxonomically, independently of natural languages. ''A posteriori'' languages, such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]], are more popular than the ''a priori'' type, perhaps partly because their familiar vocabulary makes them easy to learn and recognize. Conversely, a priori languages are seen as being more neutral because there are so many languages and root words used in different languages may be completely different. 

[[Solresol]] was an earlier classificatory language that by using a smaller symbol set achieved easier distinctness.  There have been a few more recent attempts to design a language along similar lines, such as Ygyde and the Japanese-made [[Babm]], but most subsequent constructed language makers have avoided this taxonomic or hierarchic design for the reasons mentioned above.

==Alphabet and pronunciation==
Ro's alphabet is (orthographically speaking) just like the [[English Alphabet]]. The pronunciation of the letters: [[C]], [[J]], [[Q]] and [[X]] are pronounced as: /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /ŋ/ and /χ/ respectively. The vowels ([[A]], [[E]], [[I]], [[O]] and [[U]]) are pronounced as they are in the [[Spanish language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC02613756 Dictionary of Ro, the World Language] on Google Book Search&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample text==
The following sample is from ''[http://library.conlang.org/about/Conlang_Exhibit_Master_File_Text_rev.pdf Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages]''. It is the last stanza of [[William Cullen Bryant]]'s "[[Thanatopsis]]" translated into Ro by Foster himself:

{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;Asi lib, ut avit ace vodas,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43265">'''Opinion mining''' (sometimes known as '''sentiment analysis''' or '''emotion AI''') refers to the use of [[natural language processing]], [[Text analytics|text analysis]], [[computational linguistics]], and [[biometrics]] to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to [[voice of the customer]] materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from [[marketing]] to [[Customer relationship management|customer service]] to clinical medicine.

Generally speaking, sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or other subject with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation (see [[appraisal theory]]), affective state (that is to say, the [[emotional state]] of the author or speaker), or the intended emotional communication (that is to say, the emotional effect intended by the author or interlocutor).

== Examples ==
The objective and challenges of sentiment analysis can be shown through some simple examples.

=== Simple cases ===

* Coronet has the best lines of all day cruisers.
* Bertram has a deep V hull and runs easily through seas.
* Pastel-colored 1980s day cruisers from Florida are ugly.
* I dislike old [[cabin cruiser]]s.

=== More challenging examples ===

* I do not dislike cabin cruisers. ([[Negation]] handling)
* Disliking watercraft is not really my thing. (Negation, inverted [[word order]])
* Sometimes I really hate RIBs. ([[Adverbial]] modifies the sentiment)
* I'd really truly love going out in this weather! (Possibly [[sarcastic]])
* Chris Craft is better looking than Limestone. (Two [[brand name]]s, identifying target of attitude is difficult).
* Chris Craft is better looking than Limestone, but Limestone projects seaworthiness and reliability. (Two attitudes, two brand names).
* The movie is surprising with plenty of unsettling plot twists. (Negative term used in a positive sense in certain domains).
* You should see their decadent dessert menu. (Attitudinal term has shifted polarity recently in certain domains)
* I love my mobile but would not recommend it to any of my colleagues. (Qualified positive sentiment, difficult to categorise)
* Next week's gig will be right koide9! ("Quoi de neuf?" Fr.: "what's new?". Newly minted terms can be highly attitudinal but volatile in polarity and often out of known vocabulary.)

== Tools ==
Datasets for sentiment analysis are available online.&lt;ref name="Stack Overflow 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Good dataset for sentiment analysis? | website=Stack Overflow | date=2017-07-24 | url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24605702/good-dataset-for-sentiment-analysis | access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/post/I_need_big_dataset_for_sentiment_analysis_Anyone_have_a_recommendation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the ''polarity'' of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level—whether the expressed opinion in a document, a sentence or an entity feature/aspect is positive, negative, or neutral. Advanced, "beyond polarity" sentiment classification looks, for instance, at emotional states such as "angry", "sad", and "[[happiness|happy]]".

Precursors to sentimental analysis include the General Inquirer,&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Philip J., Dexter C. Dunphy, and Marshall S. Smith. "The general inquirer: A computer approach to content analysis." MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; which provided hints toward quantifying patterns in text and, separately, psychological research that examined a person's [[psychological state]] based on analysis of their verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, Louis August, and Goldine C. Gleser. The measurement of psychological states through the content analysis of verbal behavior. Univ of California Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the method described in a patent by Volcani and Fogel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked specifically at sentiment and identified individual words and phrases in text with respect to different emotional scales. A current system based on their work, called EffectCheck, presents synonyms that can be used to increase or decrease the level of evoked emotion in each scale.

Many other subsequent efforts were less sophisticated, using a mere polar view of sentiment, from positive to negative, such as work by Turney,&lt;ref name = "Turney02" /&gt; and Pang&lt;ref name = "PangAl02"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; who applied different methods for detecting the polarity of [[product review]]s and movie reviews respectively. This work is at the document level. One can also classify a document's polarity on a multi-way scale, which was attempted by Pang&lt;ref name = "PangLee05"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; among others: Pang and Lee&lt;ref name = "PangLee05" /&gt; expanded the basic task of classifying a movie review as either positive or negative to predict star ratings on either a 3- or a 4-star scale, while Snyder&lt;ref name = "SnyderBarzilay07" /&gt; performed an in-depth analysis of restaurant reviews, predicting ratings for various aspects of the given restaurant, such as the food and atmosphere (on a five-star scale).

First steps to bringing together various approaches—learning, lexical, knowledge-based, etc.—were taken in the 2004 [[AAAI]] Spring Symposium where linguists, computer scientists, and other interested researchers first aligned interests and proposed shared tasks and benchmark data sets for the systematic computational research on affect, appeal, subjectivity, and sentiment in text.&lt;ref&gt;Qu, Yan, James Shanahan, and Janyce Wiebe. "Exploring attitude and affect in text: Theories and applications." In AAAI Spring Symposium) Technical report SS-04-07. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though in most statistical classification methods, the neutral class is ignored under the assumption that neutral texts lie near the boundary of the binary classifier, several researchers suggest that, as in every polarity problem, three categories must be identified. Moreover, it can be proven that specific classifiers such as the [[Maximum entropy probability distribution|Max Entropy]]&lt;ref name = "Vryniotis13"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; can benefit from the introduction of a neutral class and improve the overall accuracy of the classification. There are in principle two ways for operating with a neutral class. Either, the algorithm proceeds by first identifying the neutral language, filtering it out and then assessing the rest in terms of positive and negative sentiments, or it builds a three-way classification in one step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Filipe Nunes|last2=Araujo|first2=Matheus|date=2010|title=A Benchmark Comparison of State-of-the-Practice Sentiment Analysis Methods|url=|journal=Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems |volume=9 |issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second approach often involves estimating a probability distribution over all categories (e.g. [[Naive Bayes classifier|naive Bayes]] classifiers as implemented by the [[Nltk|NLTK]]). Whether and how to use a neutral class depends on the nature of the data: if the data is clearly clustered into neutral, negative and positive language, it makes sense to filter the neutral language out and focus on the polarity between positive and negative sentiments. If, in contrast, the data are mostly neutral with small deviations towards positive and negative affect, this strategy would make it harder to clearly distinguish between the two poles.

A different method for determining sentiment is the use of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a −10 to +10 scale (most negative up to most positive) or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as +4. This makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment (usually on the level of the sentence). When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using [[natural language processing]], each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taboada|first=Maite|last2=Brooke|first2=Julian|date=2011|title=Lexicon-based methods for sentiment analysis|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2000518|journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=272–274|doi=10.1162/coli_a_00049|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Augustyniak|first=Łukasz|last2=Szymański|first2=Piotr|last3=Kajdanowicz|first3=Tomasz|last4=Tuligłowicz|first4=Włodzimierz|date=2015-12-25|title=Comprehensive Study on Lexicon-based Ensemble Classification Sentiment Analysis|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/18/1/4|journal=Entropy|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.3390/e18010004|bibcode=2015Entrp..18....4A}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment, because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it. Words, for example, that intensify, relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score. Alternatively, texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score if the goal is to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text.&lt;ref name ="SentiStrength2010"&gt;

=== Subjectivity/objectivity identification ===
This task is commonly defined as classifying a given text (usually a sentence) into one of two classes: objective or subjective.&lt;ref name="PangLee08Subjectivity"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The subjectivity of words and phrases may depend on their context and an objective document may contain subjective sentences (e.g., a news article quoting people's opinions). Moreover, as mentioned by Su,&lt;ref name="SuMarkert08"&gt;{{cite conference

 | year = 2008
 | url = http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/markert/Papers/Coling2008.pdf
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; results are largely dependent on the definition of subjectivity used when annotating texts. However, Pang&lt;ref name="PangLee04"&gt;{{cite conference
 | first1 = Bo | last1 = Pang
 | first2 = Lillian | last2 = Lee

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; showed that removing objective sentences from a document before classifying its polarity helped improve performance.

=== Feature/aspect-based ===
It refers to determining the opinions or sentiments expressed on different features or aspects of entities, e.g., of a cell phone, a digital camera, or a bank.&lt;ref name="HuLiu04"&gt;{{cite conference

&lt;/ref&gt; A feature or aspect is an attribute or component of an entity, e.g., the screen of a cell phone, the service for a restaurant, or the picture quality of a camera. The advantage of feature-based sentiment analysis is the possibility to capture nuances about objects of interest. Different features can generate different sentiment responses, for example a hotel can have a convenient location, but mediocre food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Good location, terrible food: detecting feature sentiment in user-generated reviews|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-013-0119-7|journal = Social Network Analysis and Mining|date = 2013-06-22|issn = 1869-5450|pages = 1149–1163|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s13278-013-0119-7|first = Mario|last = Cataldi|first2 = Andrea|last2 = Ballatore|first3 = Ilaria|last3 = Tiddi|first4 = Marie-Aude|last4 = Aufaure}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem involves several sub-problems, e.g., identifying relevant entities, extracting their features/aspects, and determining whether an opinion expressed on each feature/aspect is positive, negative or neutral.&lt;ref name="LiuHuCheng04"&gt;{{cite conference

&lt;/ref&gt; To mine the opinion in [[Context (language use)|context]] and get the feature about which the speaker has opined, the grammatical relationships of words are used. Grammatical dependency relations are obtained by deep parsing of the text.&lt;ref name="DeyHaque08"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrid approaches leverage on both machine learning and elements from [[knowledge representation]] such as [[ontologies]] and [[semantic network]]s in order to detect semantics that are expressed in a subtle manner, e.g., through the analysis of concepts that do not explicitly convey relevant information, but which are implicitly linked to other concepts that do so.&lt;ref name ="“Hussain"&gt;

Open source software tools deploy [[machine learning]], statistics, and natural language processing techniques to automate sentiment analysis on large collections of texts, including web pages, online news, internet discussion groups, online reviews, web blogs, and social media.&lt;ref name="AkcoraBayirDemirbasFerhatosmanoglu2010"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge-based systems, on the other hand, make use of publicly available resources, to extract the semantic and affective information associated with natural language concepts. Sentiment analysis can also be performed on visual content, i.e., images and videos (see [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]). One of the first approaches in this direction is SentiBank&lt;ref name = "Borth13"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing an adjective noun pair representation of visual content. In addition, the vast majority of sentiment classification approaches rely on the bag-of-words model, which disregards context, [[grammar]] and even [[word order]]. Approaches that analyses the sentiment based on how words compose the meaning of longer phrases have shown better result,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Socher|first=Richard|last2=Perelygin|first2=Alex|last3=Wu|first3=Jean Y.|last4=Chuang|first4=Jason|last5=Manning|first5=Christopher D.|last6=Ng|first6=Andrew Y.|last7=Potts|first7=Christopher|date=2013|title=Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.593.7427|journal=In Proceedings of EMNLP|pages=1631–1642}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they incur an additional annotation overhead.

A human analysis component is required in sentiment analysis, as automated systems are not able to analyze historical tendencies of the individual commenter, or the platform and are often classified incorrectly in their expressed sentiment. Automation impacts approximately 23% of comments that are correctly classified by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Study: Advanced Sentiment Analysis|url=http://paragonpoll.com/sentiment-analysis-systems-case-study/|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, humans often disagree, and it is argued that the inter-human agreement provides an upper bound that automated sentiment classifiers can eventually reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozetič|first=Igor|last2=Grčar|first2=Miha|last3=Smailović|first3=Jasmina|date=2016-05-05|title=Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155036|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=5|pages=e0155036|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0155036|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4858191|pmid=27149621|access-date=|via=|arxiv=1602.07563|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1155036M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, the structure of sentiments and topics is fairly complex. Also, the problem of sentiment analysis is non-monotonic in respect to sentence extension and [[stop-word]] substitution (compare ''THEY would not let my dog stay in this hotel'' vs ''I would not let my dog stay in this hotel''). To address this issue a number of rule-based and reasoning-based approaches have been applied to sentiment analysis, including defeasible logic programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first1 = Boris | last1 = Galitsky | first2 = Eugene William | last2 = McKenna | title=Sentiment Extraction from Consumer Reviews for Providing Product Recommendations|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US20090282019|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is a number of tree traversal rules applied to syntactic parse tree to extract the topicality of sentiment in open domain setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1 = Boris | last1 = Galitsky | first2 = Gabor | last2 = Dobrocsi | first3 = Josep Lluís | last3 = de la Rosa | title=Inverting Semantic Structure Under Open Domain Opinion Mining| journal = FLAIRS Conference|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1 = Boris | last1 = Galitsky | first2 = Huanjin | last2 = Chen | first3 = Shaobin | last3 = Du | title= Inversion of Forum Content Based on Authors' Sentiments on Product Usability| journal= AAAI Spring Symposium: Social Semantic Web: Where Web 2.0 Meets Web 3.0 | year= 2009 |pages= 33–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==

The accuracy of a sentiment analysis system is, in principle, how well it agrees with human judgments. This is usually measured by variant measures based on [[precision and recall]] over the two target categories of negative and positive texts. However, according to research human raters typically only agree about 80%&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; of the time (see [[Inter-rater reliability]]). Thus, a program which achieves 70% accuracy in classifying sentiment is doing nearly as well as humans, even though such accuracy may not sound impressive. If a program were "right" 100% of the time, humans would still disagree with it about 20% of the time, since they disagree that much about ''any'' answer.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, computer systems will make very different errors than human assessors, and thus the figures are not entirely comparable. For instance, a computer system will have trouble with negations, exaggerations, [[joke]]s, or sarcasm, which typically are easy to handle for a human reader: some errors a computer system makes will seem overly naive to a human. In general, the utility for practical commercial tasks of sentiment analysis as it is defined in academic research has been called into question, mostly since the simple one-dimensional model of sentiment from negative to positive yields rather little actionable information for a client worrying about the effect of public discourse on e.g. brand or corporate reputation.&lt;ref&gt;

To better fit market needs, evaluation of sentiment analysis has moved to more task-based measures, formulated together with representatives from PR agencies and market research professionals. The focus in e.g. the RepLab evaluation data set is less on the content of the text under consideration and more on the effect of the text in question on [[brand image|brand reputation]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{See also|Reputation management|web 2.0|web mining}}
The rise of [[social media]] such as [[blogs]] and [[social network]]s has fueled interest in sentiment analysis.  With the proliferation of reviews, ratings, recommendations and other forms of online expression, online opinion has turned into a kind of virtual currency for businesses looking to market their products, identify new opportunities and manage their reputations.  As businesses look to automate the process of filtering out the noise, understanding the conversations, identifying the relevant content and actioning it appropriately, many are now looking to the field of sentiment analysis.&lt;ref name="Mining the Web for Feelings, Not Facts"&gt;Wright, Alex.

Retrieved on 2009-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Further complicating the matter, is the rise of anonymous social media platforms such as [[4chan]] and [[Reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentiment Analysis on Reddit|url=http://news.humanele.com/sentiment-analysis-reddit/|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If [[web 2.0]] was all about democratizing publishing, then the next stage of the web may well be based on democratizing [[data mining]] of all the content that is getting published.&lt;ref name="The Future of Social Media Monitoring"&gt;Kirkpatrick, Marshall.

One step towards this aim is accomplished in research. Several research teams in universities around the world currently focus on understanding the dynamics of sentiment in [[Virtual community|e-communities]] through sentiment analysis.&lt;ref name="Collective emotions in cyberspace"&gt;CORDIS. [http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP7_PROJ_EN&amp;ACTION=D&amp;DOC=1&amp;CAT=PROJ&amp;QUERY=011e4ea33ef2:358b:41dc0328&amp;RCN=89032 "Collective emotions in cyberspace (CYBEREMOTIONS)"], ''[[European Commission]]'', 2009-02-03.

The problem is that most sentiment analysis algorithms use simple terms to express sentiment about a product or service.  However, cultural factors, linguistic nuances and differing contexts make it extremely difficult to turn a string of written text into a simple pro or con sentiment.&lt;ref name="Mining the Web for Feelings, Not Facts"/&gt;  The fact that humans often disagree on the sentiment of text illustrates how big a task it is for computers to get this right.  The shorter the string of text, the harder it becomes.

Even though short text strings might be a problem, sentiment analysis within [[microblogging]] has shown that [[Twitter]] can be seen as a valid online indicator of political sentiment. Tweets' political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to parties' and politicians' political positions, indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Tumasjan, Andranik; O.Sprenger, Timm; G.Sandner, Philipp; M.Welpe, Isabell (2010).

== Application in recommender system ==
{{See also|Recommender system}}
For a [[recommender system]], sentiment analysis has been proven to be a valuable technique. A [[recommender system]] aims to predict the preference to an item of a target user. Mainstream recommender systems work on explicit data set. For example, [[collaborative filtering]] works on the rating matrix, and [[content-based filtering]] works on the [[Metadata|meta-data]] of the items.

In many [[social networking service]]s or [[e-commerce]] websites, users can provide text review, comment or feedback to the items. These user-generated text provide a rich source of user's sentiment opinions about numerous products and items. Potentially, for an item, such text can reveal both the related feature/aspects of the item and the users' sentiments on each feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8f1b/9b97183b8aa2caa0fb6c9563b14daabe8316.pdf|author=Tang, Huifeng, Songbo Tan, and Xueqi Cheng|title=A survey on sentiment detection of reviews|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=36.7|year=2009|pages=10760–10773|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2009.02.063}}&lt;/ref&gt; The item's feature/aspects described in the text play the same role with the meta-data in [[content-based filtering]], but the former are more valuable for the recommender system. Since these features are broadly mentioned by users in their reviews, they can be seen as the most crucial features that can significantly influence the user's experience on the item, while the meta-data of the item (usually provided by the producers instead of consumers) may ignore features that are concerned by the users. For different items with common features, a user may give different sentiments. Also, a feature of the same item may receive different sentiments from different users. Users' sentiments on the features can be regarded as a multi-dimensional rating score, reflecting their preference on the items.

Based on the feature/aspects and the sentiments extracted from the user-generated text, a hybrid recommender system can be constructed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jakob, Niklas, et al. "Beyond the stars: exploiting free-text user reviews to improve the accuracy of movie recommendations." ''Proceedings of the 1st international CIKM workshop on Topic-sentiment analysis for mass opinion''. ACM, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of motivation to recommend a candidate item to a user. The first motivation is the candidate item have numerous common features with the user's preferred items,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hu, Minqing, and Bing Liu|title=Mining opinion features in customer reviews|journal=AAAI|volume=4|issue=4|year=2004|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ee6c/726b55c66d4c222556cfae62a4eb69aa86b7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the second motivation is that the candidate item receives a high sentiment on its features. For a preferred item, it is reasonable to believe that items with the same features will have a similar function or utility. So, these items will also likely to be preferred by the user. On the other hand, for a shared feature of two candidate items, other users may give positive sentiment to one of them while give negative sentiment to another. Clearly, the high evaluated item should be recommended to the user. Based on these two motivations, a combination ranking score of similarity and sentiment rating can be constructed for each candidate item.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Except the difficulty of the sentiment analysis itself, applying sentiment analysis on reviews or feedback also face the challenge of spam and biased reviews. One direction of work is focused on evaluating the helpfulness of each review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liu, Yang, et al.|url=http://www.yorku.ca/xhyu/papers/ICDM2008.pdf|chapter=Modeling and predicting the helpfulness of online reviews|year=2008|title=ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE international conference on Data mining|publisher= IEEE|doi=10.1109/ICDM.2008.94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Review or feedback poorly written are hardly helpful for recommender system. Besides, a review can be designed to hinder sales of a target product, thus be harmful to the recommender system even it is well written.

Researchers also found that long and short form of user-generated text should be treated differently. An interesting result shows that short form reviews are sometimes more helpful than long form,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/1871437.1871741|author=Bermingham, Adam, and Alan F. Smeaton|title=Classifying sentiment in microblogs: is brevity an advantage?|journal=Proceedings of the 19th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is easier to filter out the noise in a short form text. For the long form text, the growing length of the text does not always bring a proportionate increase of the number of features or sentiments in the text.

'''Seán "Clárach" Mac Domhnaill''' (1691–1754) was an [[Irish language]] poet in the first half of the 18th century.

==Early life==
Seán "Clárach" Mac Domhnaill was born in 1691 in [[Churchtown, County Cork]] but lived out his life in Kiltoohig (''Cill Tuathaigh''), [[Charleville, County Cork]]. Little is known about his youth or his family. He did, however, receive a comprehensive education, despite the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]]. Either in the home or in a [[hedge school]], he learned [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and English as well as [[Irish language|Irish]], his native tongue. {{sfn|Moore|1893}}

==Career==
Mac Domhnaill was one of the Maigue Poets, a circle of 18th century Gaelic poets in [[County Limerick]]. Under his chairmanship, they met in the ancient [[ringfort]] Lios Ollium, in [[Bruree]]. His own house in Charleville was also sometimes a meeting place. Seán "Clárach" Mac Domhnaill soon won the admiration of the other [[Munster]] poets, who gave him the title '''Príomh-Éigeas na Mumhan''' or Chief Poet of Munster.&lt;ref&gt;Críostóir Ó Floinn, ''The Maigue Poets'', I. THE COURT OF POETRY, p. 15&lt;!-- publishing info, year of publication needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Croom, County Limerick]], he frequented the [[public house]] of Seán Ó Tuama, a good friend and another Maigue poet. He could not, however, make a living out of his poetry, as previous poets had done, but had to work as a farm labourer and teacher from time to time.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Death==
In 1754, Mac Domhnaill died and was laid to rest in Holy Cross Cemetery, Charleville. His grave is situated in the center of the graveyard, on the site of the medieval parish church.{{sfn|Cunningham|2004}}

==Works==
''[[Mo Ghile Mear]]'' is Mac Domhnaill's most famous poem.{{cn|date=December 2015}} It is a lament or ''caoineadh'' that was written after the defeat of the [[Bonnie Prince Charles]] at the [[Battle of Culloden]], Scotland, in 1746. The Irish poets had pinned their hopes on this revolutionary prince and his flight was a crushing blow to the long-suffering [[Gael]]s of both [[Éire]] and Scotland. Their exasperation and despair is vividly portrayed in this poem. Like all other Gaelic poems of the time, ''Mo Ghile Mear'' would have been sung rather than recited; indeed, the melody is well-known today. This is the chorus:
{| class="toccolours" style="float: center; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 30%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: center;" |
'''Sé mo laoch, mo ghile mear,''&lt;br&gt;
'''Sé mo Shaesar, gile mear;''&lt;br&gt;
''Ní bhfuaireas féin aon tsuan ar séan''&lt;br&gt;
''Ó chuaigh i gcéin mo ghile mear.''&lt;br&gt;
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | — ''[[Mo Ghile Mear]]'' by Seán "Clárach" Mac Dónaill
|}

In 1723, on the death of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], Mac Domhnaill wrote a poem reproaching him for his indifference towards Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1O55-MacDomhnaillSenClrach.html Seán "Clárach" Mac Domhnaill infosite], highbeam.com; accessed 1 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His other works include: ''De Bharr na gCnoc'' and ''Gráinne Mhaol''.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Poetic style==
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2015}}
While not a true bardic poet like [[Dáibhí Ó Bruadair]], Mac Domhnaill did keep to a complex rhyming scheme. His language can be ornate but it is certainly not the [[Classical Irish]] of the bards. By the 18th century this literary language had been abandoned in favour of the modern dialect – disused after the strict bardic schools closed down and a literary standard became impossible to maintain across the country.

[[Image:SyedMahmood.jpg|thumb|right|Justice Syed Mahmood]]
Justice '''Syed Mahmood''' (also spelled '''Sayyid Mahmud''') (24 May 1850 – 8 May 1903) was [[Puisne Justice|Puisne Judge]] of the [[Allahabad High Court|High Court]], [[North-Western Provinces]] from 1887 to 1893, after having served in the High Court in a temporary capacity as officiating judge on four previous periods since 1882. He was the first Indian jurist to be appointed to High Court at [[Allahabad]], and the first Muslim to serve as a High Court judge in the [[British Raj]]. Syed Mahmood also had a major role in assisting his father, Sir [[Syed Ahmed Khan]] in establishing the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College]], which later developed into [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. As a jurist, his judgments dominate the [[Law Report#India|Indian Law Reports]]: Allahabad Series for the years he was on the bench. He also participated actively in the formation of laws through writing lengthy notes on proposed laws to the legislative councils of both the [[Governor-General of India]] and the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of the North-Western Provinces and Chief Commissioners of Oudh|Lieutenant Governor of the North-Western Provinces]]. Syed Mahmood was appointed to the N.-W.P. and Oudh Legislative Council from 1896 to 1898.

== Education ==
Syed Mahmood was born in Delhi in 1850, the second son of Syed Ahmad Khan. He subsequently studied in [[Moradabad]], and [[Aligarh]], all cities to which his father had been posted as a member of the [[Indian Civil Service]]. He also studied at the Government College in Delhi and at Queen's College in Benares before passing his Matriculation Examination at the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1868. He then received a scholarship from the British government in India to study in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Guenther 2004, p. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, Mahmood was admitted to [[Lincoln's Inn]] and in April 1872 he was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]]. Around the same time, from 1870, he studied Latin, Greek and oriental languages for two years at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] but without graduating.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MHMT870SM|name=Mahmood, Syed Mohammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kozlowski"&gt;Kozlowski 2008, p. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal career ==
After returning to India, Mahmood enrolled as a barrister in the High Court in Allahabad in 1872, the first Indian to achieve that distinction in that court. He worked as a barrister in Allahabad until 1878. The following year he was appointed as a District and Sessions Judge in [[Oudh]] by the Viceroy of India, [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]]. This was his substantive appointment in the Indian Civil Service until 1887 when he was appointed Puisne Judge of the High Court at Allahabad, though this service was interrupted several times with temporary appointments as officiating judge at the High Court. He also was seconded briefly to the [[Nizam]] in [[Hyderabad State]], where he assisted with the judicial administration in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther 2004, p. 73-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, Syed Mahmood received his first officiating appointment as a judge to the High Court of the North-Western Provinces in Allahabad, with active lobbying on his behalf by the Viceroy who had replaced Lytton, [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]]. He served as an officiating judge three more times before he received his full appointment as Puisne Judge in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther 2004, p.80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporaries generally considered him to have an exceptional ability, assisted by a knowledge of the Arabic language that he had gained while studying in Cambridge and which was invaluable for assessing Muslim law. His judgements, says Kozlowski, were "written with a clarify and vivacity rare in a rather dense literary genre."&lt;ref name="Kozlowski" /&gt; Throughout his time on the bench, Mahmood was known for his lengthy, detailed written judgments, many of which were published in the Law Reports for those years. [[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]], Law Member of the Viceroy's [[Council of India|Legislative Council]] in India during the years 1877 to 1882, later praised Mahmood's judgments in his ''Anglo-Indian Codes''.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes 1887, p. xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in an obituary he wrote, [[Tej Bahadur Sapru]], a younger contemporary of Mahmood's, commented that his long and detailed judgments were necessary because of the spate of new legislation being enacted that needed to be clarified in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;Sapru 1903, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his opinions were very often rejected by the full bench, which mostly consisted of British judges; Kozlowski notes that "broad learning and clever argument based on Muslim sources were not ultimately decisive in the system of justice the British administered in India."&lt;ref name="Kozlowski" /&gt; His prolixity and frequent [[dissenting opinion]]s were a couple of the factors that led to conflicts with his fellow judges, and eventually to an early retirement in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther 2004, p. 160-162.&lt;/ref&gt; Kozlowski says that the retirement came about because of pressure being put on him due to his severe drunkenness. Mahmood denied that he was an [[alcoholic]] and blamed the jealousy of [[John Edge]], the [[Chief Justice]], but even his friends acknowledged it was a problem.&lt;ref name="Kozlowski" /&gt;

After his retirement from the judiciary, he returned to his legal practice as a barrister, working in [[Lucknow]] as well as serving on the North-Western Provinces and Oudh Legislative Council from 1896 to 1898.

== Educational work ==
Shortly after returning to India after his studies in England in 1872, Syed Mahmood wrote a proposal for the establishment of a self-supporting Muslim college in India based on the model he had experienced at Cambridge University.&lt;ref&gt;Husain, Yusuf 1967, p. 222-237.&lt;/ref&gt; He then assisted his father, Sir Syed, in founding the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, and continued to play a vital role in its administration even while working as a lawyer and judge in Allahabad. In 1883, he returned to England to recruit [[Theodore Beck]] to serve as the school's principal. He took an active part in teaching English classes and establishing a law program at the school, donating a major portion of his own collection of legal texts to form a legal library.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther 2004, p. 101-103.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, his father nominated Mahmood as Joint Secretary of the board of trustees for the school. After his father's death in 1898, he took up his responsibilities as Life Honorary Joint Secretary. The following year he was replaced in this position by Nawab [[Mohsin-ul-Mulk]], and was elevated to the post of Honorary President instead.

Syed Mahmood was active in educational ventures outside of the MAOC as well. During the Ripon administration, he was appointed as one of the commissioners of the 1882 Education Commission, investigating the state of education in India. He was also an active participant in the [[All India Muhammadan Educational Conference]], delivering a series of lectures on the history of English education in India during the annual meetings of 1893 and 1894.

== Family ==
In 1888, Syed Mahmood married Musharraf Jahan, the daughter of Nawab Khwajah Sharfuddin Ahmad, his father's maternal cousin. They had one son [[Ross Masood]]. Mahmood purchased a home in Allahabad which was subsequently sold to [[Motilal Nehru]] who was also serving as a barrister in the Allahabad court at that time, and which was eventually renamed [[Swaraj Bhavan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lelyveld 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.littlemag.com/ghosts/davidlelyveld.html|title = The Little Magazine - Ghosts - David Lelyveld - The mystery mansion|website = www.littlemag.com|access-date = 2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 1876, Syed Mahmood had established another residence in the city of Aligarh; this currently houses the Sir Syed Academy. In 1900, after becoming estranged from both his family and the college at Aligarh, Mahmood moved to [[Sitapur]] where he lived with his cousin, Syed Muhammad Ahmad, until his death in 1903.

== Writings ==
Syed Mahmood's first contribution to the legal literature of British India was an [[Urdu]] translation of the 1872 Law of Evidence and subsequent amendments, published in 1876. He revised his lectures to the Muhammadan Educational Conference and published them in English as ''A History of English Education in India'' in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed articles to the ''[[Aligarh Institute Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Calcutta Review]].'' But his major written contribution consisted of the approximately 300 legal judgments recorded in the ''Indian Law Reports: Allahabad Series'' between the years 1882 and 1892, a considerable number of which were over twenty pages in length. Contemporaries note that he was preparing a multi-volume work on Muslim law after his retirement from the bench, but this remained uncompleted at the time of his death.

'''Temne''' (also ''Themne, Timne''; {{IPA-xx|t̪emnɛ|IPA}}{{fix|date=February 2009|text=missing the tones}}) is a language of the [[Mel languages|Mel]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo language family]], spoken in [[Sierra Leone]] by about 2 million first-language speakers. One of the country's most widely spoken languages, it is spoken by 30% of the country’s population.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It also serves as a [[lingua franca]] for an additional 1,500,000 people living in areas near the [[Temne people]]. It is closely related to the neighboring [[Kissi language]].

It is related to the [[Baga languages]] spoken in [[Guinea]] and to [[Sherbro language|Sherbro]] spoken in Sierra Leone. Temne speakers live mostly in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Province]] and [[Western Area]] ([[Freetown, Sierra Leone|Freetown]] and its environs) of Sierra Leone. Temne speakers can also be found in all 12 districts of Sierra Leone. Temne people can be found in a number of other [[West Africa]]n countries as well, including [[Guinea]] and [[The Gambia]]. Some Temnes have also migrated beyond West Africa seeking educational and professional opportunities, especially in [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]], and [[Egypt]].

==Phonology==
Temne is a [[tonal language]], with four tones. Among consonants, Temne distinguishes [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[alveolar]], but, unusually, the dental consonants are [[apical consonant|apical]] and the alveolar consonants are [[laminal consonant|laminal]] (and slightly [[affricated]]), the opposite of the general pattern, though one found also in the nearby language [[Limba language|Limba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|23, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''''Tholkāppiyam''''' ({{lang-ta|தொல்காப்பியம்}}, literally ''Paleo-literature'') is a work on the [[grammar]] of the [[Tamil language]] and the earliest extant work of [[Tamil literature]]&lt;ref&gt;* Zvelebil, Kamil. 1973. The smile of Murugan on Tamil literature of South India. Leiden: Brill. - Zvelebil dates the ''Ur-Tholkappiyam'' to the 1st or 2nd century BCE&lt;/ref&gt; and [[linguistics]]. It is written in the form of ''noorpaa'' or short formulaic compositions and comprises three books – the ''Ezhuttadikaram'', the ''Solladikaram'' and the ''Poruladikaram''. Each of these books is further divided into nine chapters each. While the exact date of the work is not known, based on linguistic and other evidence, it has been [[#Date|dated variously]] between the 5th century BCE and the 2nd century CE. Some modern scholars prefer to date it not as a single entity but in parts or layers.&lt;ref name='strata'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women and Farm Work in Tamil Folk Songs|journal=Social Scientist|year=1993|first=Vijaya|last=Ramaswamy|volume=21|issue=9/11|pages=113–129|doi= 10.2307/3520429|format= |quote=As early as the Tholkappiyam (which has sections ranging from the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD) the eco-types in South India have been classified into ...|publisher=Social Scientist|jstor=3520429}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also no firm evidence to assign the authorship of this treatise to any one author.

''Tholkappiyam'' deals with [[orthography]], [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[semantics]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and the subject matter of literature. The Tholkāppiyam classifies the Tamil language into ''sentamil'' and ''koduntamil''. The former refers to the classical Tamil used almost exclusively in literary works and the latter refers to the dialectal Tamil, spoken by the people in the various regions of ancient [[Sangam period|Tamilagam]].&lt;ref&gt;According to latter commentators, there were twelve regions (''panniru nilam'') which were the sources of the dialectisms. Zvelebil, Smile of Murugan, p 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tholkappiyam categorises alphabet into consonants and vowels by analysing the syllables. It grammatises the use of words and syntaxes and moves into higher modes of language analysis. The Tholkāppiyam formulated thirty phonemes and three dependent sounds for Tamil.

== Etymology ==
''Tolkāppiyam'' derived from the combination of two words: ''Tonmai'' ("ancientness") and ''kāppiyam'' ("literature").

The derivation of ''Tolkāppiyam'' from the root words is as per the rules defined in ''[[Nannūl]]'' verse 136.&lt;ref name="Nannul"&gt;''[[Nannūl]]'' by Pavanandhi Munivar&lt;/ref&gt;

== Date ==
The dating of the Tolkappiyam has been debated much, and it is still imprecise and uncertain&lt;ref name="zvelebil"&gt;Zvelebil, Kamil (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Takanobu|title=Tamil Love Poetry &amp; Poetics|year=1995|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden; New York; Cologne|isbn=90-04-10042-3|pages=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgCHuVGyZoEC&amp;pg=PA16|chapter=2.

Annals of Oriental Research (Madras), Silver Jubilee Volume: 292–317&lt;/ref&gt; and has seen wide disagreements amongst scholars in the field.&lt;ref name="bgls2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="takahashi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="caldwell" /&gt;  The work has been dated variously between the 5th century BCE and the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name="zvelebil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bgls2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="takahashi" /&gt;

* [[Herman Tieken]], a Dutch scholar, who endeavours to trace the influence of the Sanskrit [[Kavya]] tradition on the entire ''Sangam'' corpus, argues that the Tolkappiyam dates from the 9th century CE at the earliest. He arrives at this conclusion by treating the Tolkappiyam and the anthologies of [[Sangam literature]] as part of a 9th-century [[Pandyan]] project to raise the prestige of Tamil as a [[classical language]] equal to Sanskrit, and assigning new dates to the traditionally accepted dates for a vast section of divergent literature ([[Sangam literature]], post-Sangam literature and Bhakti literature like [[Tevaram]]).&lt;ref name="tiekenbook"&gt;Tieken, Herman Joseph Hugo. 2001.

== Authorship ==
Tholkapiyam was written by [[Tholkappiyar]], a disciple of Vedic sage [[Agastya]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-lopamudras-consent/18637169|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Lopamudra's Consent}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since Agathiam, the grammar compiled by Agastya, went missing after a great deluge, Tholkappiyar was asked to compile Tamil grammar.&lt;ref&gt;book titled "Tholkappiyar Kaalam", written by Dr. Madhivanan,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zvelebil, Kamil. 1973.

== Commentaries ==
Starting in the 11th or 12th century CE, several commentaries came to light. Of these, the one by Ilampuranar dated to the 11th or 12th century CE is considered one of the best and most comprehensive. This was followed by a commentary dateable to 1275 CE by Senavaraiyar which, however, dealt only with the ''Sollathikaram''. A commentary by ''Perasiriyar'' which is heavily indebted to the ''[[Nannūl]]'' followed. This commentary which can be dated to the 12th or 13th century CE, if not later, frequently quotes from the ''Dandiyalankaram'' and ''Yapparunkalam'', the former being a standard medieval rhetorica and the latter being a detailed treatise on Tamil prosody. Naccinarkiniyar's commentary, which can be dated to the 14th if not the 15th or 16th century follows. Naccinarkiniyar, himself being a scholar of both Tamil and Sanskrit quotes from Parimelalakar's works. Teyvaccilaiyar's commentary follows in the 16th or 17th century. Finally, the latest available commentary, that of Kallatar comes to light. Of these commentaries, those of "Ilampooranar", "Deivachilaiyaaar" and "Natchinaarkiniyar" is regarded highly and the triumvarate are also called ''"Urai-asiriyargal"''.&lt;ref&gt;Zvelebil, Kamil, The Smile of Murugan, p134&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapters ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2007}}
{{cleanup|section|date=December 2009}}

The Tolkāppiyam consists of three books each of which is divided into 9 chapters. The books are called ''athikaarams''. The three books are

I.   Ezhuththathigaaram – Formation of words and combination of words.  
II.  Sollathigaaram – Syntax.  
III. Porulathigaaram – Conveying thoughts.

=== I. Ezhuththathigaaram ===
Ezhuththathigaaram is further subdivided into the following 9 sections – ''Nuul Marabu, Mozhi Marabu, PiRappiyal, PuNaRiyal, Thokai Marabu, Urupiyal, Uyir Mayangiyal, PuLLi Mayangiyal and the Kutriyalukara PunaRiyal.''

#''Nuul Marabu'' – ([[Tolkappiam chapter 1-1|the contents of the section]]) சொல்லதிகாரம்This
#''Mozhi Marabu'' – ([[Tolkappiyam chapter 1-2|the contents of the section]]) This section defines rules which specify where in a word can a letter not occur and which letter can not come after a particular letter. It also describes [[elision]], which is the reduction in the duration of sound of a [[phoneme]] when preceded by or followed by certain other sounds. The rules are well-defined and unambiguous. They are categorised into 5 classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision.
## Kutriyalugaram – the (lip unrounded) vowel sound ''u''
## Kutriyaligaram – the vowel sound ''i''(as the vowel in 'lip')
## Aiykaarakkurukkam – the [[diphthong]] ''ai''
## Oukaarakkurukkam – the diphthong ''au''
## Aaythakkurukkam – the special character (''aaytham'')
#''PiRappiyal'' [[Tolkappiyam chapter 1-3|(The content of the section)]] – This is a section on [[articulatory phonetics]]. It talks about pronunciation methods of the [[phoneme]]s at the level of [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]], [[larynx]], jaws, tongue position, teeth, lips and nose. The visual representation of the letters is also explained.
#''PuNaRiyal'' [[Tolkappiyam chapter 1-4|(The content of the section)]]  The structural combination of words. (This section talks about the changes to words due to the following word i.e. it specifies rules that govern the transformations on the last phonem of a word (''nilaimozhi iiRu'') because of the first phonem of the following word (''varumozhi muthal'') when used in a sentence.)
#''Thokai Marabu'' – Combination of words based on meaning.
#''Urubiyal'' – Combination of words with case-ending along with euphony particles. (This section talks about the word modifiers that are added at the end of nouns and pronouns when they are used as an object as opposed to when they are used as subjects.)
#''Uyir Mayangiyal'' – Combination of words with an initial vowel-phonetic upon vowel-ending.
#''Pulli Mayangiyal'' – Combination of words with an initial consonant-phonetic upon consonant-ending. (Pulli concept is one of the distinguishing feature among the Tamil characters. Although it is not unique and brahmi also has pulli. It is distinguished by placement. According to tolkappiam which talks about pulli and its position, that is on top of the alphabet instead of side as in Brahmi. This is also one of the characteristics of Tamil brahmi according to Mr. Mahadevan. The first inscription of this type of pulli is in Vallam by Pallvas dated to the 7th or 8th century CE by Mahendra Varman Pallava.)
#''Kutriyalukara PunaRiyal'' – Combination of words with an initial vowel-phonetic upon the shortened 'u' vowel-ending.

=== II. Sollathigaaram ===
Sollathigaaram deals with words and [[parts of speech]]. It classifies Tamil words into four categories – ''iyar chol'' (words in common usage), ''thiri chol'' (words used in Tamil literature), ''vada chol'' (words borrowed from Sanskrit), ''thisai chol'' (words borrowed from other languages. There are certain rules to be adhered to in borrowing words from Sanskrit. The borrowed words need to strictly conform to the Tamil phonetic system and be written in the Tamil script.

The chapter Sollathigaaram is subdivided into the following 9 sections – 

'', VEtRumaiyiyal, VEtrumaimayangial, ViLimaRabu, Peyariyal, Vinaiyiyal, Idaiyiyal, Uriyiyal and the Echchaviyal''.

''KiLaviyaakkam''– KiLaviyaakkam literally translates to ''word formation''. This section deals with syntax correlation between subject and predicate in [[gender]], [[number]], [[person]] etc.

# ''VEtRumaiyiyal'' – Role of case in syntax.
# ''VEtrumaimayangial'' – some case-suffix denote other case-meaning
# ''ViLimarabu'' – Formation of vocative case
# ''Peyariyal'' – This section deals with [[noun]]s
# ''Vinaiyiyal'' – This section deals with [[verb]]s
# ''Idaiyiyal'' – Partial words of prefix and suffix and their formation in syntax
# ''Uriyiyal'' – This literally translates to the nature
# ''Echchaviyal'' – Other points to be considered in syntax-formation.

=== III. Porulathigaaram ===
The Porulathigaaram gives the classification of land types, and seasons and defines modes of life for each of the combinations of land types and seasons for different kinds of people. This chapter is subdivided into the following 9 sections – ''AkaththiNaiyiyal, PuRaththiNaiyiyal, KaLaviyal, KaRpiyal, PoruLiyal, Meyppaattiyal, Uvamayiyal, SeyyuLiyal'' and the ''Marabiyal.''

# ''AkaththiNaiyiyal'' – This section defines the modes of personal life i.e. life of couples.
# ''PuRaththiNaiyiyal'' – This section defines the modes of one's public life.
# ''KaLaviyal'' – Who and how expose the secret love
# ''KaRpiyal'' – Behavior of the 'United couples'
# ''PoruLiyal'' – How the couples expose themselves and how the kin and kith correlate with them.
# ''Meyppaattiyal'' – Impact of feelings, a psychological views exposed in ancient literatures.
# ''Uvamayiyal'' – The name ''Uvamayiyal'' literally translates to ''the nature or science of [[metaphor]]s''.
# ''SeyyuLiyal'' – This section deals with a grammar for classical [[Tamil Poetry]] based on principles of [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]].
# ''Marabiyal'' – Hereditary Tamil language

== Other claims ==
There are two verses given in support of Tholkappiar's religious outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ckrishnamurti.tripod.com/chap2a.html|title=2. The Sangam Period|author=Dr.C.R.Krishnamurti|work=tripod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some made controversial and unconfirmed observation in Sangam poems that there is relatively meager reference given to religion in general. In the akam songs, Tholkappiar has made reference to deities in the different land divisions: Thirumal for mullai, Murugan for kurinji, Indhiran for marutham, Varunan, for neithal and Korravai for palai.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Alexander Dubyanskiy, veteran Tamil scholar from Moscow State University stated “I am sure that Tolkappiyam is a work which demanded not only vast knowledge and a lot of thinking but a considerable creative skill from its composer.” Dr. Dubyanskiy also said that the authority of the text was undeniable. “It is a literary and cultural monument of great importance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tolkappiyam-is-not-dependent-on-sanskrit-sources-tamil-scholar/article489121.ece|title=Tolkappiyam is not dependent on Sanskrit sources: Tamil scholar|author=Karthik Madhavan|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ĵ''' or '''ĵ''' (J [[circumflex]]) is a letter in [[Esperanto orthography]] representing the sound {{IPAblink|ʒ}}.

While Esperanto orthography uses a [[diacritic]] for its four postalveolar consonants, as do the Latin-based [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] alphabets, the base letters are Romano-Germanic. ''Ĵ'' is based on the [[French language|French]] pronunciation of the letter ''[[j]]'' to better preserve the shape of borrowings from that language (such as ''ĵurnalo'' from ''journal'') than Slavic ''[[ž]]'' would.
