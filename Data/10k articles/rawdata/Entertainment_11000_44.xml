'''1+1 Media Group''' is one of the largest media conglomerates in [[Ukraine]].  The [[General Director]] of the Group is [[Oleksandr Vladislavovich Tkachenko|Aleksandr Tkachenko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.linkedin.com/company/1-1-media|title = 1+1 Media on LinkedIn|date = |accessdate = 18 August 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
1+1 Media Group comprises eight Ukrainian TV channels, [[1+1 (channel)|1+1]], [[2+2 (TV channel)|2+2]], [[TET (TV channel)|TET]], [[PLUSPLUS]], [[Bigudi]], [[UNIAN TV]] and [[1+1 International]]. It also controls the online news platforms [[TSN.ua]], [[UNIAN]], Glavred.info, Telekritika and Dusia. It had controlled the English language satellite television channel [[Ukraine Today]] until it was shut down in 2016.

The structure of the group includes the production company '1+1 Production' which is responsible for the creation of in-house TV formats and the adaptation of international formats for broadcast on the several TV channels of the group, including reality and dating shows, talent shows, scripted realities, TV series, sitcoms, documentary and sports programs, original programs and information broadcasting. The production company not only covers in-house needs, but also works with external customers.

[[Ukrainian oligarch]] [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi]] has financial interests in the group.&lt;ref name=economist-20150328&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21647355-building-nation-means-putting-plutocrats-their-place-president-v-oligarch |title=President v oligarch |newspaper=The Economist |date=28 March 2015 |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csm-20140825/&gt;

==Expansion out of Ukraine==
After launching 1+1 International in 2006 (see section below), which is aimed at the [[Ukrainian diaspora]], the group started its first attempt at gaining part of the international TV market by launching the English language [[Ukraine Today]] in August 2014.&lt;ref name=csm-20140825&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0825/Ukraine-Today-jumps-into-the-Ukraine-Russia-media-war |title=Ukraine Today jumps into the Ukraine-Russia media war |author=Lydia Tomkiw |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=25 August 2014 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Room of One's Own''''' is an extended essay by [[Virginia Woolf]], first published in September 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woolf |first1=Virginia |title=A Room of One's Own |date=1935 |orig-year=1929|publisher=Hogarth Press |location=London |page=4 |url= |ref=harv}}{{pb}}

An important [[Feminism|feminist]] text, the essay is noted in its argument for both a literal and figurative space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by men.

==History==
The essay was based on two papers Woolf read on 20 and 26 October 1928 to two Cambridge student societies, the Newnham Arts Society at Newnham College and the ODTAA Society at Girton College, respectively. [[Elsie Duncan-Jones]], then known as Elsie Phare, was the president of the Newnham Arts Society at the time and wrote an account of the paper, "Women and Fiction", for the college magazine, ''Thersites''. Woolf stayed at Newnham at the invitation of [[Pernel Strachey]], the college principal, whose family were key members of the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. At Girton she was accompanied by [[Vita Sackville-West]].&lt;ref name=Rosenbaumpp113-115&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosenbaum |first1=S. P. |title=Aspects of Bloomsbury: Studies in Modern English Literary and Intellectual History |date=1998 |publisher=MacMillan Press Ltd. |location=Hounsmill |pages=113–115 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tullberg, Rita McWilliams (2004). [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48467 "Strachey, (Joan) Pernel (1876–1951)"]. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 1929 as a book with six chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/works/a-room-of-ones-own "''A Room of One's Own''"], British Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
===The Four Marys===
The title of the essay comes from Woolf's conception that "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction".{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=5}} The narrator of the work is referred to early on: "Here then was I (call me [[Mary Beaton|Mary Beton]], [[Mary Seton]], Mary Carmichael or by any name you please—it is not a matter of any importance)".{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=8}} The three Marys were [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]] to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]; they are also characters in a 16th-century Scottish ballad, [[Mary Hamilton]], about a lady-in-waiting who is facing execution for having had a child with the King, a child she killed.&lt;ref name=guineas&gt;Shiach, Morag (ed.) (2008). "Introduction", in Virginia Woolf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CoP1GxjoNnsC ''A Room of One's Own: And, Three Guineas'']. Oxford University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;5. {{isbn|9780192834843}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"Yestreen the Queen had four Maries / This nicht she'll hae but three, O / There was Mary Beaton, and Mary Seaton / And Mary Carmichael, and me, O."&lt;ref&gt;Bronson, Bertrand (ed.) (2015). ''The Singing Tradition of Child's Popular Ballads (Abridgement)''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;321.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In referencing the tale of a woman who rejected motherhood and lived outside marriage, a woman about to be hanged, the narrator identifies women writers such as herself as outsiders who exist in a potentially dangerous space. 

===Women's access to education===
[[File:Virginia Woolf 1927.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Woolf in 1927]]
Woolf notes that women have been kept from writing because of the constraints they face and their relative poverty: "In the first place, to have a room of her own, let alone a quiet room or a sound-proof room, was out of the question, unless her parents were exceptionally rich or very noble, even up to the beginning of the nineteenth century."{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=79}} The essay examines whether women were capable of producing, and in fact free to produce, work of the quality of [[William Shakespeare]], addressing the limitations that past and present women writers face.

Woolf's father, [[Leslie Stephen|Sir Leslie Stephen]], in line with the thinking of the era, believed that only the boys of the family should be sent to school. In delivering the lectures outlined in the essay, Woolf is speaking to women who have the opportunity to learn in a formal setting. She moves her audience to understand the importance of their education, while warning them of the precariousness of their position in society. She sums up the stark contrast between how women are idealised in fiction written by men, and how patriarchal society has treated them in real life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Women have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the beginning of time. Indeed if woman had no existence save in the fiction written by men, one would imagine her a person of the utmost importance; very various; heroic and mean; splendid and sordid; beautiful and hideous in the extreme; as great as a man, some would say greater. But this is woman in fiction. In fact, as Professor Trevelyan points out, she was locked up, beaten and flung about the room. A very queer, composite being thus emerges. Imaginatively she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant. She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history. She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger. Some of the most inspired words and profound thoughts in literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read; scarcely spell; and was the property of her husband.{{sfn|Woolf|1935|pp=64–66}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Judith Shakespeare====
{{about|section=yes|a fictional character|the real-life individual|Judith Quiney}}
[[File:Cmglee Cambridge University Newnham College dining hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|[[Newnham College, Cambridge]]]]
In one section Woolf invents a fictional character, Judith, Shakespeare's sister, to illustrate that a woman with Shakespeare's gifts would have been denied the opportunity to develop them. Like Woolf, who stayed at home while her brothers went off to school, Judith is trapped in the home: "She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as agog to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school."{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=71}}

While William learns, Judith is chastised by her parents should she happen to pick up a book, as she is inevitably abandoning some household chore to which she could be attending. Judith is betrothed, and when she does not want to marry, her father beats her, then shames her into the marriage. While William establishes himself, Judith is trapped by what is expected of women. She runs away from home to London, is harassed and laughed at when she tries to become an actor, and is finally made pregnant by an actor-manager who said he would help her. She kills herself and "lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses now stop outside the [[Elephant and Castle#Name|Elephant and Castle]]". William lives on and establishes his legacy.{{sfn|Woolf|1935|pp=71–73}}

===Building a history of women's writing===
[[File:Girton College, Cambridge, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Girton College, Cambridge]]]]
In the essay, Woolf constructs a critical and historical account of women writers thus far.  Woolf examines the careers of several female authors, including [[Aphra Behn]], [[Jane Austen]], the [[Brontë family|Brontë]] sisters, [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea]], and [[George Eliot]].
In addition to female authors, Woolf also discusses and draws inspiration from noted scholar and feminist [[Jane Ellen Harrison]]. Harrison is presented in the essay only by her initials separated by long dashes, and Woolf first introduces Harrison as "the famous scholar, could it be J---- H---- herself?"{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=26}}

Woolf also discusses [[Rebecca West]], questioning [[Desmond MacCarthy]]'s (referred to as "Z") uncompromising dismissal of West as an "'arrant feminist'".{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=26}} Among the men attacked for their views on women, [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead]] (referred to as "Lord Birkenhead") is mentioned, although Woolf further rebukes his ideas in stating she will not "trouble to copy out Lord Birkenhead's opinion upon the writing of women".{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=80}} Birkenhead was an opponent of suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-139/836-cover-story-the-friendship-between-churchill-and-fe-smith|title= The Friendship Between Churchill and F. E. Smith|publisher= The Churchill Center and Museum|deadurl= yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731104444/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-139/836-cover-story-the-friendship-between-churchill-and-fe-smith|archivedate=31 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay quotes [[Oscar Browning]], through the words of his (possibly inaccurate) biographer [[H. E. Wortham]],&lt;ref name=archiveshub&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/04022301.html |title=A list of The Papers of Oscar Browning, held by King's College Archive Centre, Cambridge |date=21 March 2003 |first=Rosalind |last=Moad|publisher=The Archives Hub|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223012818/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/04022301.html |archivedate=23 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "that the impression left on his mind, after looking over any set of examination papers, was that, irrespective of the marks he might give, the best woman was intellectually the inferior of the worst man".{{sfn|Woolf|1935|pp=80–81}} In addition to these mentions, Woolf subtly refers to several of the most prominent intellectuals of the time; her hybrid name for the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]—[[Oxbridge]]—has become a well-known term, although she was not the first to use it.

===Lesbianism===
[[File:Victoria-mary-sackville-west-vita.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|[[Vita Sackville-West]] accompanied Woolf to the Girton lecture.]]
Woolf wrote in her diary before ''A Room of One's Own'' was published that she thought when it was published she would be "attacked for a feminist &amp; hinted at for a sapphist" [sapphist means lesbian].&lt;ref name="BarrettCramer1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eileen Barrett|author2=Patricia Cramer|title=Virginia Woolf: Lesbian Readings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNQyMMwYVCwC&amp;pg=PA218|date=July 1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-1263-4|pages=218–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MajumdarMcLaurin2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robin Majumdar|author2=Allen McLaurin|title=Virginia Woolf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IznJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-72404-8|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one section of the book, describing the work of a fictional woman writer, Mary Carmichael, Woolf deliberately invokes lesbianism: "Then may I tell you that the very next words I read were these – 'Chloe liked Olivia&amp;nbsp;...' Do not start. Do not blush. Let us admit in the privacy of our own society that these things sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women."{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=123}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jane Harrison and Lesbian Plots: The Absent Lover in Virginia Woolf's ''The Waves''|first=Patricia|last=Cramer|work=Studies in the Novel|year=2005|jstor=29533720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woolf references the obscenity trial and public uproar resulting from the publishing of [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s lesbian-themed novel ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' (1928). Before she can discuss Chloe liking Olivia, the narrator has to be assured that Sir [[Chartres Biron]], the magistrate of Hall's obscenity trial, is not in the audience: "Are there no men present? Do you promise the figure of Sir Chartres Biron is not concealed? We are all women, you assure me? Then I may tell you&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Woolf|1935|p=123}}

Woolf scholar and feminist critic [[Jane Marcus]] believes Woolf was giving Radclyffe Hall and other writers a demonstration of how to discuss lesbianism discreetly enough to avoid obscenity trials; "Woolf was offering her besieged fellow writer a lesson in how to give a lesbian talk and write a lesbian work and get away with it."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Jane (1996). ''Virginia Woolf, Cambridge and A Room of One's Own: 'The Proper Upkeep of Names{{'}}''. London: Cecil Woolf Publishers, p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus describes the atmosphere of Woolf's arrival and presence at the women's college with her lover [[Vita Sackville-West]] as "sapphic". Woolf is comfortable discussing lesbianism in her talks with the women students because she feels a women's college is a safe and essential place for such discussions.

==Criticism==
[[Alice Walker]] responded to Woolf's observation that only women with 'a room of their own' are in a position to write. Woolf herself was making the point that not all women in her society had such a safe space, but Walker continues the conversation by discussing the further exclusions suffered by women of colour. ''[[In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose]]'', Walker writes:

{{quote|Virginia Woolf, in her book ''A Room of One's Own'', wrote that in order for a woman to write fiction she must have two things, certainly: a room of her own (with key and lock) and enough money to support herself.

What then are we to make of [[Phillis Wheatley]], a slave, who owned not even herself? This sickly, frail, Black girl who required a servant of her own at times—her health was so precarious—and who, had she been white, would have been easily considered the intellectual superior of all the women and most of the men in the society of her day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York||year=2004|isbn=9780156028646|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Walker recognises that Wheatley is in a position far different from the narrator of Woolf's essay, in that she does not own herself, much less "a room of her own". Wheatley and other women writers exist outside of this room, outside of this space Woolf sets asides for women writers. Although she calls attention to the limits of Woolf's essay, Walker, in uniting womanist prose (women's writing) with the physical and metaphorical space of "our mothers' gardens", pays homage to Woolf's similar endeavour of seeking space, "room", for women writers.

==Adaptations and cultural references==
The essay was adapted as a play by [[Patrick Garland]], who also directed [[Eileen Atkins]] in its stage performance. A television adaptation directed by Garland was broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' in 1991.

There is a [[feminist bookstore]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], named A Room of One's Own, and a Canadian [[literary journal]], ''[[Room (magazine)|Room of One's Own]]'', now ''Room'', showcasing the work of women writers and visual artists. [[The Smiths]]' song "[[Shakespeare's Sister (song)|Shakespeare's Sister]]" is named after a section of the essay. [[Shakespears Sister]] is an alternative pop group featuring Siobhan Fahey. The [[Two Nice Girls]]' third album, from 1991, was called ''[[Chloe Liked Olivia]]''. ''Chloe plus Olivia: an anthology of lesbian literature from the seventeenth century to the present'', was published in 1994 by [[Lillian Faderman]]. The women's [[co-working space]] in Singapore, "Woolf Works", was named after Virginia Woolf as a response to this essay. [[Patricia Ann Lamkin|Patricia Lamkin]]'s play ''Balancing the Moon'' (2011) was inspired by the essay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lamkin|first=Patricia|url=https://thisstage.la/2011/10/the-phases-of-balancing-the-moon/|title=The Phases of Balancing the Moon| work=@This Stage|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cohen was born to a Sephardic Jewish family from Turkey and Egypt and raised and educated in the coastal city of [[Ashdod]]. During his [[Military service#Israel|military service]] he was an actor for the [[Israel Defense Forces' theatre]], members of which are soldiers on active duty. Following his military service he worked as a [[Stand up comedy|stand up comic]] at the [[Domino Gross]] club in Tel Aviv, where he partnered with fellow comedian [[Guri Alfi]] to create the comedy duo of "Assi and Guri".&lt;ref name="rofl.co.il"&gt;[http://www.rofl.co.il/asi-cohen/ Assi Cohen on rofl.co.il] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918231617/http://www.rofl.co.il/asi-cohen/ |date=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1999 onward he worked as a comedian and joined the TV show ''[[Domino (Television show in Israel)|Domino]]'', which aired on the commercial [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] in Israel.&lt;ref name="rofl.co.il"/&gt; The show, a follow-up to the highly successful ''[[Platfus (Television show in Israel)|Platfus]]'', was a second television production from the Domino Gross. Participants (such as [[Adir Miller]], [[Rotem Aboav]], [[Roi Bar-Natan]] and Guri Alfi) were comedians who appeared regularly at the club. Assi Cohen and Guri Alfi continued to tour the country as "Assi and Guri". They created, among others, favourite characters such as David (Cohen) and Tikva (Alfi), a disgruntled married couple, and Coco (Cohen) and Steve (Alfi), a singer and keyboard player duo singing satirical songs inspired by [[Mizrahi]] music.

In 2001, alongside his duo performances, Assi played in the TV drama ''Star Shining above the Heart'' ({{lang-he-n|כוכב זורח מעל הלב}}) alongside [[Dana Ivgi]], [[Irit Sheleg]], and [[Ilana Berkowitz]].&lt;ref name="rofl.co.il"/&gt;

[[File:Asicohen.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cohen, July 2006]]
In 2002 he joined the show "Rak BeYsrael" (Channel 2) ({{lang-he-n|רק בישראל}}, lit. Only in Israel) alongside Guri Alfi as [[side-kick]]s to main characters "Limor" ([[Orna Banai]]) and "Shimon" ([[Erez Tal]]).&lt;ref name="Eonline.co.il"/&gt; That same year, he and Guri Alfi created a comedy show called "Shidurei Hamahapeha" (Channel 2) ({{lang-he-n|שידורי המהפכה}}, literally ''The revolution's broadcasts'') and participated in the controversial film ''[[Yossi &amp; Jagger]]'', which portrayed a homosexual relationship between a soldier (played by [[Yehuda Levi]]) and his commander ([[Ohad Knoller]]). He later participated in the comedy show "We Won't Stop Laughing" alongside Guri Alfi, Rotem Aboav, [[Eli Finish]], and [[Mariano Idelman]].&lt;ref name="rofl.co.il"/&gt;

In 2003 he acted in the film ''[[Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi]]'' (Also: Ha-Kochavim Shel Shlomi). The same year he and Alfi broke up their comedy duo and Cohen married Lian Friedman.&lt;ref name="Eonline.co.il"/&gt;

In 2004 Cohen returned to television in the comedy show ''Eifo Ata Chai?!'' ({{lang-he|איפה אתה חי?!}}, lit. Where have you been living?!) alongside Erez Tal, [[Shlomo Baraba]], and [[Hadar Levi]]. He played several characters such as Coco the Mizrahi singer, and Himri the healer.&lt;ref name="rofl.co.il"/&gt; That year he also starred in the film ''[[Colombian Love]]'' (with [[Mili Avital]], [[Menashe Noi]] and others) as a newly married husband whose father insists he divorce his bride. Also in 2004, Cohen played alongside [[Dana Modan]] in the [[Emmy Awards (Israel)|Israeli Emmy Award]]-winning television drama, ''Love Hurts'' ({{lang-he|אהבה זה כואב}}).

In 2005 he participated in the [[Steven Spielberg]] feature film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', dealing with the Israeli government's secret retaliation after the 1972 [[Munich massacre]] of Israeli Olympic athletes. The film featured  actors [[Eric Bana]], [[Daniel Craig]], and [[Geoffrey Rush]] as well as Israeli actors like [[Ayelet Zurer]] and [[Gila Almagor]]. That same year he started his participation in the Emmy Award and Golden Screen award-winning television show "Eretz Nehederet" ([[Hebrew Language|Hebrew:]] {{Hebrew|ארץ נהדרת}}, lit. Wonderful Country), a satirical comedy with references to current affairs and parodies of the people involved. Among his characters on the show, Cohen impersonated Illusionist [[Uri Geller]], Football player [[Avi Nimni]], Right-wing politician [[Avigdor Lieberman]], and Arab [[Knesset]] member and minister [[Raleb Majadele]].&lt;ref name="rofl.co.il"/&gt; Cohen also participated that year in a short film titled "Halev HaRaev" ({{lang-he|הלב הרעב}}, lit. The Hungry Heart) and hosted a show about ''What Makes an Israeli'' for [[Keshet Broadcasting|Keshet]]'s 57th Israeli Independence special, an 8-clip show portraying Israeli behaviors such as "wiping" [[humus]] to eat it, feeling a bread before purchasing it, drinking of "Mud" coffee, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrg.co.il/online/5/ART/931/939.html Happy Independence Day, Gever Gever], nrg.co.il&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 he participated in the entertainment television show "[[Mesudarim]]" (Channel 2) ({{lang-he|מסודרים}}, meaning "settled [for life]" in Israeli slang), where four childhood friends sell their gaming startup company for [[USD]]$217 million, and have to deal with their newfound wealth. Chapter 9 of the show contained the first [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] in Israeli television, with the drama "[[BeTipul]]" (lit. "[[Therapy|In Treatment]]"), which was later purchased by [[HBO]]; BeTipul's psychologist, played by [[Asi Dayan]], is asked to analyze the group.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The format of Mesudarim was purchased by [[Fox Entertainment Group]] and shown in the US as "Loaded".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3542631,00.html CBS greenlights Israeli-based series ‘Mythological X’], Meirav Crystal, [[Ynet]], May 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 he participated in a critically acclaimed television show "Hatufim" (Prisoners of War). The show went to be the most successful in Israel and soon after the original script of Gideon Raff was sold to Hollywood for remake which is known as "Homeland".

'''Billy Kersands''' (c. 1842–1915) was an [[African-American]] [[comedian]] and [[dancer]]. He was the most popular black comedian of his day, best known for his work in [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]]. In addition to his skillful acrobatics, dancing, singing, and instrument playing, Kersands was renowned for his comic routines involving his large mouth, which he could contort comically or fill with objects such as billiard balls or saucers. His stage [[persona]] was that of the dim-witted black man of the type that had been popularized in white minstrel shows. Modern commentators such as Mel Watkins cite him as one of the earliest black entertainers to have faced the dilemma of striking a balance between social [[satire]] and the reinforcement of negative [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Kersands began performing with traveling [[minstrel show|minstrel]] troupes in the early 1860s. As black minstrelsy gained popularity, Kersands became its biggest star. In 1879, he earned about $15 a week, but by 1882, he was reportedly earning $80, only slightly less than a featured white minstrel. He was a hit with both white and black audiences, particularly in the South. Tom Fletcher wrote that "In the South, a minstrel show without Billy Kersands is like a circus without elephants."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Tom (1954). ''One Hundred Years of the Negro in Show Business''. Quoted in Toll 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over his career, Kersands played with many of the major black minstrel troupes. He was a member of [[Sam Hague]]'s [[Georgia Minstrels]], along with [[Charles Hicks]] and [[Bob Height]]. When the company returned from an English tour in 1872, [[Charles Callender]] purchased the troupe and renamed it Callender's Georgia Minstrels. When Kersands and other popular troupe members demanded higher pay and more favorable treatment, Callender dismissed them. They quit to form their own ensemble, a move Callender characterized as theft. The company did poorly, and Kersands and most of the others returned to Callender. During his years with Callender's Georgia Minstrels, Kersands regularly featured in the military [[burlesque]]s that regularly ended the first act beginning in 1875 or 1876. These sketches earned him renown for his acrobatic feats of drumming.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Toll 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, Kersands began his own minstrel troupe, named Kersands' Minstrels. Charles Hicks was the manager, but he left to form his own group after little more than a year. Kersands' Minstrels was well known for its [[marching band]], and the group led a [[Mardi Gras]] parade in 1886. Kersands offered $1000 to any rival who could outmarch them. He also continued to play engagements with other companies, including Richard and Pringle's Georgia Minstrels in 1890 as one of "The Vestibule Car Porters and Drum Majors".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In 1904, Kersands performed in an urban, black-produced show in the East. He only stayed for a short time, instead preferring the blackface minstrelsy he knew best. He formed another troupe and took up touring primarily in the South. Kersands answered the inevitable question of why he had not made the move to [[vaudeville]] thus: "All of my money came from the people of the South, the white and the colored, while playing down there. Whether they meant it or not, the way I was treated by them, and still am, I feel at home. I also make a good living with no worries."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Tom (1954). ''One Hundred Years of the Negro in Show Business''. Quoted in Watkins 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
Kersands's comedy act centered on his enormous [[mouth]], which he exuberantly contorted into countless shapes. He peppered his songs with these movements and their accompanying noises. One observer remarked, "The slightest curl of his lip or opening of that yawning chasm termed his mouth was of itself sufficient to convulse the audience."&lt;ref&gt;8 October 1887. ''[[New York Clipper|The Clipper]]''. Quoted in Toll 256.&lt;/ref&gt; He could even fit several [[billiard ball]]s or a cup and saucer into his mouth and still perform a [[dance]] routine or fill the theater with boisterous laughter. Tom Fletcher wrote that while touring in England, Kersands told Queen Victoria that if his mouth was any bigger, his ears would have to be moved.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Tom (1954). ''One Hundred Years of the Negro in Show Business''. Quoted in Toll 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

This physical feature fit well into [[racism|racist]] white-created [[stereotype]]s of blacks having large lips and mouths. Kersands further embraced such disparaging [[caricature]]s by affecting the stage persona of a slow and ignorant [[Sambo (ethnic slur)|Sambo]]. He also sang songs that reinforced these racist views. In his "Mary's Gone with a Coon", he sang of a black man "lamenting" his daughter's impending marriage to a black man: "De chile dat I bore, should tink ob me no more / Den to run away wid a big black coon."&lt;ref&gt;Haverly, J. H. (1881) "Mary's Gone with a Coon". ''Haverly's Genuine Troupe of Blacks''. Quoted in Toll 256.&lt;/ref&gt; His "[[Old Aunt Jemima]]" lent its name to the stereotyped [[mammy archetype|mammy]] [[Aunt Jemima]] that later was developed into an iconic trademark for a brand of [[pancakes]].

Despite Kersands's reinforcement of negative black stereotypes, very few African Americans disdained his act. Part of his appeal for them lay in his mixing of elements of [[African American folklore]] into his show in a way that would appeal to his black audience but be ignored or derided by whites. "Old Aunt Jemima", one of his signature songs, serves as a good example. The song exists in three texts, two published 1875 and one in 1880, suggesting that Kersands made up verses as he sang. All three versions begin in a church, a locale that white minstrels tended to avoid. The 1875 texts describe charismatic black worship practices, but the 1880 edition begins with a black character fleeing a white church because they "prayed so long".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Toll 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Verses from the song soon entered the African American tradition and appeared in later collections of folklore. Other songs Kersands performed featured African American elements like [[talking animal]]s and weak-versus-strong match-ups. His popularity led many theatre owners to relax rules limiting black patrons to specific sections of the playhouse.

Despite weighing over 200 pounds, Kersands was also a talented [[dancer]] and [[Acrobatics|acrobat]]. His trademark dance was [[Essence of Old Virginia]] or [[Virginia Essence]], which he may have introduced. The dance later developed into the [[soft shoe]]. He was also known for the [[Buck and Wing]]. His dance routines helped cement such dance acts as fixtures in later vaudeville and Hollywood routines.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''BioShock 2: Minerva's Den''''' is a [[single-player]] [[downloadable content]] (DLC) campaign for the 2010 [[video game]] ''[[BioShock 2]]''.  The game is a [[Single-player video game|single player]] [[first-person shooter]] in which the player takes on the role of an Alpha Series [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddy]] with the alias Sigma, who must travel through Rapture's main security station, Minerva's Den, in order to download a copy of the city's main computer which is located within.

==Setting==
{{see also|BioShock 2#Setting}}
''Minerva's Den'' takes place in the fictional underwater city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]] in the year 1968, ten years after the events of ''[[BioShock|Bioshock]]''. The story does not reveal where Rapture is, nor the approximate size of the city, other than that it is enormous.

== Plot ==
''Minerva's Den'' follows a prototype Alpha Big Daddy referred to as Subject Sigma. Guided by [[Characters of the BioShock series#Brigid Tenenbaum|Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum]] and Charles Milton Porter, the founder of Rapture Central Computing, Sigma makes his way to the Thinker, a [[supercomputer]] that maintains every automated system in the city. While developing the Thinker, Porter tried to give it a personality modeled on that of his late wife Pearl. His partner, Reed Wahl, found this to be a waste of time; he instead became obsessed with what he believed was the Thinker's ability to predict the future. To take total control of the Thinker, Wahl framed Porter for treason against Rapture's leader, [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]], thus resulting in his arrest and disappearance. Through radio communication, Porter instructs Sigma to travel through Minerva's Den (where the Thinker is located) and retrieve its blueprints from Wahl so that he can rebuild it on the surface. As Sigma progresses, the environment becomes increasingly more threatening due to the Thinker's sophisticated defense system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/the-thinker/3055-4801/|title=The Thinker (Object) - Giant Bomb|website=Giant Bomb|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interference from Wahl and his private army of Splicers. Throughout all this, Sigma's real identity remains a mystery that is not touched upon until the final moments of the game. When Sigma reaches the Thinker and completes his mission, the Thinker recognizes Sigma as Charles Milton Porter, thus revealing his true identity. It is later explained by Dr. Tenenbaum that Milton's "instructions" throughout the duration of the game were actually from the Thinker that was imitating the voice of one of its creators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/bioshock/3025-654/characters/|title=BioShock Characters - Giant Bomb|website=Giant Bomb|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sigma kills Wahl, he and Tenenbaum return to the surface in a [[bathysphere]]; Tenenbaum is able to undo Sigma's programming and restore his original human body. Porter visits his wife's grave and leaves a letter in which he apologizes for trying to bring her back using the Thinker, and that he has finally decided to let her go.

== The Thinker ==
The Thinker is the main computer of the city of Rapture. Known originally as Rapture Operational Data Intraparietal Network (R.O.D.I.N), it was created by Charles Milton Porter and Reed Wahl under the orders of Andrew Ryan. When the Thinker became operational, it was used to run all of Rapture's critical infrastructure and provide a system to link the city's businesses together. Over time, Porter refined the Thinker, expanding its ability to calculate and make predictions. This made it something of a popular attraction, and public tours and services were built around it. Eventually, Porter began to explore the Thinker's capabilities for replicating human feelings and thoughts, with hopes of giving his creation the personality of his deceased wife, Pearl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-20-bioshock-2-minervas-den-retrospective|title=Bioshock 2 - Minerva's Den retrospective|last=Cameron|first=Phill|date=2013-01-20|website=Eurogamer|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wahl found this development to be a waste of time, having already exploited the Thinker to enrich himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giantbomb.com/reed-wahl/3005-16563/|title=Reed Wahl (Character) - Giant Bomb|website=Giant Bomb|language=en|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convinced that Porter was treating the Thinker as a toy and wasting its potential, Wahl framed Porter for treason and persuaded Ryan to give him full control over it. During the game, the Thinker is used against Sigma by Wahl, predicting his actions and responding to them by setting traps, deploying automated defenses, and sending both Splicers and Big Daddies to intercept him.

== Gameplay ==
True to other ''Bioshock'' titles, ''Minerva's Den'' is a first person shooter. All supplies have to be collected throughout the game, limiting the amount of ammo, health, and ADAM a player can have at one time. The player also has a limited carrying capacity, meaning that only a certain number of items can be carried at one time.

The player and NPCs have the ability to slightly change the environment around then. If a wall, ceiling, or floor is hit or shot, a hole will appear in that spot.

Many items and parts of the environment of the game are affected by physics. Smaller items can be kicked, thrown, and knocked over by the player and some of the NPCs (non-playable characters). Water dynamics also affects the player's movements, being that when underwater, the player will have longer steps and a slower fall time. Specific to ''Minerva's Den'' are the mechanics of the "Gravity Well" plasmid. It allows the player to throw an artificial [[black hole]] anywhere within a certain range, in which small items and NPCs will be sucked in until the black hole dies and expels the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://space-facts.com/black-holes/|title=Black Hole Facts - Interesting Facts about Black Holes|date=2015-04-06|work=Space Facts|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additions ==
In ''Minerva's Den'', there are additions that differentiate it from both ''Bioshock'' and ''BioShock 2''.

As said above, the new plasmid, "Gravity Well", was introduced. Gravity Well allows the player to throw a black hole anywhere within a certain range. Small items and NPCs then get pulled in until the black hole expels the matter. Gravity Well does not affect the player or larger objects in the area.

''Minerva's Den'' also introduces the player to a new weapon as well, the Ion Laser. The Ion Laser shoots a continuous beam of the selected ammunition, either laser cell, thermal cell, or burst cell. The mechanics of the Ion Laser are reminiscent of the Chemical Thrower from ''BioShock'', but with a longer range.

Electromagnetic locks were added to certain doors to act as a barrier for the player. The locks are impossible to open until the player obtains "Gravity Well", which they can use to remove the lock's power source.

== Characters ==
* The main protagonist of ''Minerva's Den'' is an Alpha Big Daddy who goes by his original designation, Subject Sigma. Sigma's goal is to reach the Thinker so he can copy its programs before it is destroyed by the inevitable collapse of Rapture.
* The main antagonist is Reed Wahl. A talented engineer and programmer, Wahl helped construct the Thinker before misusing it for personal gain. His goal is to protect the Thinker from Sigma and dispose of him through any means necessary. Audio tapes throughout the story reveal that Wahl gained full control over the Thinker by manipulating Ryan into believing that Porter was plotting against him. After the latter's arrest, Wahl became addicted to ADAM to keep himself alive and developed an unhealthy psychological attachment to the Thinker.
* Though most of the characters are new, ''Minerva's Den'' features the return of Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum from the previous two games. In addition to helping Sigma locate the Thinker, Tenenbaum also directs him to free several captive Little Sisters Wahl relies on to maintain his control over the Splicers.
* Charles Milton Porter was the scientist responsible for the creation of the Thinker, which he built using the work and theories of his mentor, [[Alan Turing]]. Haunted by his wife Pearl's death during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], Porter began to work on the Thinker's personality subroutines, hoping to "resurrect" his wife. Porter was later framed for treason against Andrew Ryan by his corrupt partner, Reed Wahl, and was subsequently arrested. In the events of ''Minerva's Den'', Porter guides Sigma to the Thinker through radio communications.

==Release==
''Minerva's Den'' was released on August 31, 2010 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/26/bioshock-2-minervas-den-dlc-hits-ps3-360-aug-31-for-10|title=BioShock 2 'Minerva's Den' DLC hits PS3, 360 Aug. 31 for $10|author=David Hinkle|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released on PC on May 31, 2011, and Mac on March 29, 2012.

A '''casino host''' is employed by a [[casino]] to deliver services to [[gamblers]] to help ensure that they become loyal [[Patrons#Commercial|patrons]].

==Nature of the work==

A casino host will usually try their best to please patrons of their casino and will do their best to fulfill any reasonable requests their clients might have. The casino host has the power to issue complimentary services (or "[[Comps (casino)|comps]]") to players. Comps can range from complimentary meals, beverages, and show ([[concert]] or [[theater]]) tickets right up to full accommodation in a [[hotel casino]]. A casino host will develop a relationship with every level of [[gambler]], from first-timers playing [[slot machine|quarter slots]] to high-profile multimillion-dollar gamblers (a [[high roller]]).

Comps issued by hosts vary greatly and can be anything from a free buffet coupon to luxurious villas and private charter flights to the casino.  The level and issuance of these comps by the host is done using mathematical formulas that calculate the theoretical loss of a player based on wager size, session length and the house edge of the game.  Based on this formula, the host will be authorized to re-invest a percentage of this theoretical win back into the player by issuing freebies with the aim to build a loyal relationship with the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vegasguy.com/casinos/casino-hosts/|title=Casino Hosts Las Vegas - Explanation &amp; Overview of Host Duties|website=www.vegasguy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position in a casino==

The casino host reports directly to the [[marketing]] managers in most casinos. The casino host is the member of [[management]] that has the most contact with players and patrons.  The job of a casino host can be very competitive as they are seeking the repeat patronage of players, a common goal that is shared with competing casinos and their own casino hosts.

==In fiction==
The TV series ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'' has a [[Las Vegas (TV series)#Main cast and characters|main character]], Samantha Jane "Sam" Marquez, who is a casino host.

'''''Defenders of Ardania''''' is a hybrid [[tower defense]] and [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[iOS]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. It was developed by [[Most Wanted Entertainment]] and published by [[Deep Silver]] and [[Paradox Interactive]].&lt;ref name=OXM&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Cameron|title=Defenders of Ardania review|date=27 March 2012|url=http://www.oxmonline.com/defenders-ardania-review|work=Official Xbox Magazine|publisher=[[Future US, Inc.]]|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released December 6, 2011 for iOS&lt;ref name=GR_iOS&gt;{{cite web|title=Defenders of Ardania for iPhone/iPod|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/iphone/620821-defenders-of-ardania/index.html|work=Game Rankings|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on March 14, 2012 on all other platforms.&lt;ref name=GR_PC&gt;{{cite web|title=Defenders of Ardania for PC|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/620818-defenders-of-ardania/index.html|work=Game Rankings|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GR_360&gt;{{cite web|title=Defenders of Ardania for Xbox 360|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox360/620820-defenders-of-ardania/index.html|work=Game Rankings|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's iOS release was well received by some critics and poorly received by others. A subsequent release on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 was significantly less well received.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Defenders of Ardania 3.jpeg|thumb|left|''Defenders of Ardania'' includes both land and air units.]]
''Defenders of Ardania'' is a [[tower defense]] game that also has offensive [[real-time strategy]] elements. As with all tower defense games, the player must defend their home base by building several types of static tower units that fire at weak offensive units [[Spawning (video gaming)|spawned]] by the opponent. In ''Defenders of Ardania'', however, players must also spawn soldiers themselves. Like the opponent's soldiers, the player's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player.

''Defenders of Ardania'' received a mix of positive and negative reviews for the iOS but mixed to poor reviews on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

For the iOS, [[148Apps]] gave the game four and a half out of five stars, praising the game's visuals and level of detail, and expressing dissatisfaction only with the game's tutorial.&lt;ref name=148Apps&gt;{{cite web|last=Halloran|first=Michael|title=Defenders of Ardania Review|date=9 December 2011|url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/defenders-ardania-review/|work=148Apps|publisher=Steel Media Ventures|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Ford of [[TouchArcade]], another iOS reviewer, gave ''Defenders of Ardania'' four out of five stars, praising the visuals as "beautiful" and "gorgeous" and saying that the game "is an excellent addition to the tower defense genre and is a must-try for any fan". Ford did, however, criticize the tutorial, expressing a desire for a tutorial mission rather than instructional screens.&lt;ref name=Touch&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford|first=Eric|title='Defenders of Ardania' Review – A Great New Twist In Tower Defense|date=9 December 2011|url=http://toucharcade.com/2011/12/09/defenders-of-ardania-review-%E2%80%93-a-great-new-twist-in-tower-defense/|work=TouchArcade|publisher=TouchArcade.com, LLC|accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mat Jones of [[The Average Gamer]] gave the game a highly negative review, saying that the game was not challenging and that concepts, such as the ability during one level to attack multiple bases and change which one player's units went towards, were never explained. Jones concluded his review by saying that "Defenders of Ardania isn’t a quality product and you probably shouldn’t spend money on it."&lt;ref name=Average_Gamer&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Mat|title=Defenders of Ardania Review (iOS)|date=7 December 2011|url=http://www.theaveragegamer.com/2011/12/07/defenders-of-ardania-review-ios/|work=The Average Gamer|publisher=Rock Base Projects Ltd|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Defenders of Ardania 2.jpeg|thumb|left|Critics disliked that units from opposing factions passed each other without fighting.]]
Reviews were universally less than positive on other systems. While critics praised the idea of the game, they found fault in the execution.&lt;ref name=EGM /&gt;&lt;ref name=PC_Gamer /&gt; Several critics disliked that the troops spawned by the player simply walk past the troops spawned by the opponent without the two groups fighting.&lt;ref name=OXM /&gt;&lt;ref name=PC_Gamer /&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN /&gt; The game's flow also attracted significant criticism, with Peter Eykemans of [[IGN]] saying "Even on double speed, the pace is painful. This makes a simple two-person battle turn into a lengthy saga of repeating the same actions over and over again."&lt;ref name=IGN /&gt; and Ray Carsillo of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' complaining of "long drawn out matches on even the easiest difficulty settings as you try to force your way past a virtual stalemate".&lt;ref name=EGM /&gt; While the visuals did receive praise, critics felt that they also got in the way of allowing the player to tell what was going on in the game.&lt;ref name=OXM /&gt;&lt;ref name=GamesRadar /&gt; Opinions about the narrator were mixed. Henry Winchester of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the voiceover, calling it "a pleasingly booze-obsessed voiceover, delivered by what sounds like a [[Dalek]] doing an impression of [[Sean Connery]]".&lt;ref name=PC_Gamer /&gt; Carsillo of ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' was less kind, stating that "your narrator and chief advisor sounds like an awful Sean Connery impersonator and he may be the ''best'' of the voice actors you come across".&lt;ref name=EGM /&gt; [[GamesRadar]] strikes a more neutral tone, stating that "Pre and post-battle dialog is fully voiced by what are only technically 'actors,' but it definitely beats silent text, and does add a bit of flavor to the world."&lt;ref name=GamesRadar /&gt; Multiplayer also received mixed reviews. Eykemans of IGN suggested that multiplayer exacerbates the length and flow issues already present in the single player game,&lt;ref name=IGN /&gt; while Matt Hughes of GamesRadar calls multiplayer the game's "biggest asset", stating that "Playing against real humans definitely ramps up the intensity and reduces the cheap exploitation found in the campaign.".&lt;ref name=GamesRadar /&gt;

'''''Divinity: Dragon Commander''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] developed by [[Larian Studios]] as part of the ''Divinity'' series of fantasy role-playing games.  The game features a hybrid of gameplay styles and has single-player, competitive multi-player, and co-operative multi-player modes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.divinitydragoncommander.com/featuresoverview.php#Single-player,%20multiplayer%20and%20co-op%20modes Divinity - Dragon Commander: Features: Single, multiplayer and co-op modes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay ==
The gameplay of ''Divinity:'' ''Dragon Commander'' is broken up into three phases which affect each other.  The first phase has elements of a [[Government simulation game|political simulation]], where the player has conversations with multiple [[non-player character]]s and makes political decisions which affect the gameplay in the other two phases.  In this phase, the player can research abilities, influence factions, and receive cards which can be traded in for special effects in the other two phases.

The second phase of the game is in the style of a [[turn-based strategy]] game, based on board games like [[Risk (board game)|Risk]], and designed first as a board game while the game was still in development.  In this mode, the player can use cards earned in the RPG phase to affect their own territories and units or those of their enemies.  The player can also construct one building per territory, and recruit and move units.  Once the units of two opposing sides meet, the player can play cards which take effect only for that battle, and can choose whether to automatically resolve the battle, or choose to fight themselves.  The player can only fight in one battle per 'round' (a full set of the three phases).

The third phase of the game takes place once a battle is joined and is in the style of a [[real-time strategy]] game.  The player constructs buildings and recruits units from the population pool of the region where the battle takes place.  All construction and recruitment is done through units of recruits, which increase at a slow rate until the area's population is depleted.  A player can increase the rate of recruitment by capturing and building more recruitment stations.  Aside from the traditional point-and-click based style of control, the player can also take the form of a dragon in battle and aid their units in both offense and defense, at the cost of sacrificing some control over their units while in dragon form.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the distant past of the previous ''Divinity'' games.  The player character is the bastard son of a recently deceased emperor.  While arguing over succession rights, the emperor's children make a deal with a demon which allows them to introduce new, [[Steampunk|steampunk-styled]] technology to the world.  Maxos, a powerful wizard who featured in ''Divinity 2'', comes to the player character as the only pure heir remaining, and asks him to enter the fight and win the war so that the demonic technology can be destroyed.&lt;ref name="rpgcodex"&gt;[http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=8925 RPG Codex: An Authentic Account of an Embassy from the RPG Codex to Larian Studios]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story in the game follows this overarching plot, while from turn to turn, the player is confronted with political and personal issues from their ambassadors and generals.  The ambassadors represent the non-human races, namely the Undead, the Elves, the Dwarves, the Lizardmen and the Imps.  Each roughly represents a political viewpoint, and many of the political decisions are taken from modern politics.  For instance, the player can decide whether or not to create a [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy in their army, and their decision will affect the relations between the player character and the various races.&lt;ref name="rpgcodex" /&gt;

==Development==
''Dragon Commander'' was announced on August 11, 2011.  Until that point, Larian had referred to ''Dragon Commander'' as "Project D", similar to the way in which ''[[Divinity: Original Sin]]'' was referred to as "Project E".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=448110#Post448110 Larian Forums: Project D = Dragon Commander]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Dragon Commander'' was presented at [[Gamescom]] in 2011 to journalists and gained attention through its novel premise often described as 'dragons with jetpacks'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/24/dragon-commander-preview/ Rock, Paper, Shotgun: Diviner Divinity: Dragon Commander Preview]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elvia Ardalani''' or '''Elvia García Ardalani''' (born June 4, 1963 in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Heroica Matamoros]] [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]), is a Mexican [[writer]], [[poet]], and [[storytelling|storyteller]].  She is an Assistant Professor in the Department of [[Modern language|Modern Languages]] and [[Literature]]s at the [[University of Texas–Pan American]], where she teaches [[Creative Writing]] and [[Spanish Literature]].

== Literary Work ==
Her first book, published in 1989, was titled ''Por recuerdos viejos, por esos recuerdos'' (For Memories of Old, for Those Memories).  The book was nominated for the [[José Fuentes Mares Prize for Literature]].

Her second book, ''De cruz y media luna'', was [[Publishing|published]] by Tierra de Libros in 1996.   The [[poetry]] in this collection approaches [[love]] as a theme through the lens of [[transculturation]]:  the [[Christian]] world and the [[Muslim world]]; the [[Hispanic]] world and the [[Persian people|Persian]] world.  The poems of this collection also visit the theme of [[maternity]] within the context of [[eroticism]], sensuality, and plenitude.  The poetic voice lays out a cartographic [[map]] of [[miscegenation]] for the child.  This collection underwent a second edition and resulted in a [[Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|bilingual]] edition, published by Claves Latinoamericanas in 2006, with the title:  ''De cruz y media luna/From Cross and Crescent Moon''.  The second edition contains some changes in relation to the first edition.

Her third book, ''Y comerás del pan sentado junto al fuego'' (And You Shall Eat from the Bread While Seated by the Fire), was published by Claves Latinoamericans in 2002 and is one of the most significant within her literary works.  The poems in this collection revisit the theme of love, although, this time, it appears to be within a semi-biblical context.  Critical studies of the work of Ardalani revolve, generally, on the process of transculturation, as well as on the analysis of the referential language in her poetry.

Her fourth book, ''Miércoles de ceniza'' (Ash Wednesday), was published by Editorial Miguel Ángel Porrúa in 2007.  According to the preface:  It is a long poem of 622 verses, a profound lament which gives way to pain.  It may be said that it is inspired by the [[Bible]] given its length and we are sent in this direction by the theme of the work, which is defined as:  the profound pain that the author feels at the sudden death of her father.  Feelings and emotions overflow before the figure of the dead father translated into four secondary themes:  reproach; reminiscence and ponderance; absence and delineation of the spiritual figure of the father, expressed in various stanzas, which tell of shock that the soul feels for the loss of a loved one.  In 2008, it was nominated for the [[Carlos Pellicer]] Iberoamerican Prize in Poetry ("Premio Iberoamericano de Poesía Carlos Pellicer, para obra publicada") for published works.

She also contributes in digital means, like the literary journal ''El Collar de la Paloma'' (The Neckring of the Dove), of which she is the editor.

Her work has been published in various journals and anthologies.

'''Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Honduras]].

The stadium has a capacity of 37,325.&lt;ref name="laciudaddeportiva-garcia-2013"&gt;{{cite web| title=El Estadio Olimpico Metropolitano, la caldera del futbol catracho| url=http://lcd.juanfutbol.com/el-estadio-olimpico-metropolitano-la-guarida-del-futbol-catracho | first=Vito| last=Garcia| publisher=La Ciudad Deportiva| date=2013-03-21| accessdate= 2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was built in 1997 for the [[1997 Central American Games|sixth edition]] of the [[Central American Games]] held there. This stadium was built by Jerónimo Sandoval, mostly known by "Chombo Sandoval", he was the organizer of the 1997 Central American Olympic Games in San Pedro Sula, which caused many controversies.
After its completion the stadium became the largest in the country dispatching [[Estadio Tiburcio Carias Andino|Estadio Nacional]]'s of that title. It has been the home for [[Honduras national football team]] since the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification]], with Estadio Nacional hosting some games on and off. Upon Sandoval building the stadium, he noticed that the front of the stadium displayed a large "H" by coincidence. When this was discovered, the figure was painted blue to represent the colours of the [[Honduras national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Honduras national football team]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before leaving office, [[San Pedro Sula]]'s former mayor, [[Oscar Kilgore]], attempted to change the name of the stadium to [[José de la Paz Herrera]], a prominent Honduran football coach and only coach at the time that had taken Honduras to a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. The move was heavily opposed by [[Club Deportivo Marathón]] and eventually abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadiumlist.com/stadium/135132629850741/Estadio+Ol%C3%ADmpico+Metropolitano Stadiumlist.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matches ==

The '''European Hot 100 Singles''' was compiled by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Music &amp; Media]]'' magazine from March 1984 until December 2010. The chart was based on national singles sales charts in '''16 European countries''': [[Austria]], [[Belgium]] (separately for [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]]), [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

{{As of|2010|18|9|alt=By the issue dated/week ending November 13, 2010}}, the European Hot 100 had accumulated 400 number one hits. The final chart was published on December 11, 2010, following the news of ''Billboard'' closing their London office and letting their UK-based staff go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Billboard closing London office|url=http://www.thecmuwebsite.com/article/billboard-closing-london-office/ |publisher=CMU |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final number one single on the chart was "[[Only Girl (in the World)]]" by [[Rihanna]]. Currently, [[Nielsen SoundScan|Nielsen SoundScan International]]-based [[Euro Digital Songs]] and Euro Digital Tracks are the only pan-European music charts that ''Billboard'' is publishing.

==History==

===Europarade Top 40===

The first attempt at a Europe-wide chart was the '''Europarade''', which was started in early 1976 by the Dutch [[TROS]] radio network. The chart initially consisted of only six countries: the Netherlands, UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain. In 1979 Italy and Denmark were added and during 1980, Austria and Switzerland were included. Ireland was added as the eleventh country in October 1983. The compilers collected the top 15 records from each country and then awarded corresponding points, depending which positions between 1 and 15 each record stood at. The "Europarade" was published in ''[[Music Week]]'' and the Dutch magazine ''Hitkrant''.

===Euro Hot 100===

In March 1984, ''[[Music &amp; Media]]'' magazine in [[Amsterdam]] started their own singles chart, "The Eurochart Hot 100", which they published as a Euro Tip sheet for the first two years. The chart was based on national singles sales charts in sixteen European countries: Austria, Belgium (separately for Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. This chart was accumulated by taking the chart positions in each country combined with the national sales percentage of records in that particular country.

In 1986–87, the official Eurochart also became a music TV show on [[Music Box (TV)|Music Box]] with Dutch presenter [[:en:Erik de Zwart|Erik de Zwart]]. A syndicated radio show, 'The Coca-Cola Eurochart Hot 100' was also introduced on UK commercial radio and was definitely being broadcast as of January to April 1991 however, its precise start and end dates are not known. Hosted by [[Pat Sharp]], it was broadcast on a number of stations including [[Radio Trent]], [[BRMB]], [[Viking FM]] and [[GWR FM]]. The Eurochart quickly gained momentum, as it started to include more countries. In January 1986, ''Music &amp; Media'' who published the chart became a ''Billboard'' publication. Since November 1986, the ''Music &amp; Media'''s Eurochart Top 100 was used as basis when ''Billboard'' itself started publishing the European Hot 100 Singles chart.

'''Film censorship in China''' involves the banning of films deemed unsuitable for release or the editing of such films to remove objected content by the governments in both [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC) and People's Republic of China (PRC). In Mainland China, films are reviewed by the '''National Film Administration''' (NFA) under the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China|Publicity Department]] ({{Lang-zh|c=国家电影局}}) which dictates whether, when, and how a movie gets released. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.people.com.cn/GB/n1/2018/0416/c40606-29929129.html|title=国家新闻出版署（国家版权局）、国家电影局揭牌|date=April 16, 2018|publisher=people.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFA is separate from the [[National Radio and Television Administration|NRTA]] under the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] ({{Lang-zh|c=广电总局}}).

The long history in ROC's film censorship is a prelude to that of the PRC, but the exhaustive list of films on this page is going to focus on PRC which is still a [[one-party state]] and took over the ROC in controlling [[mainland China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]].  ROC has attempted age-based rating system as early as November 1948, become a [[History of Taiwan#Democratic reforms|democracy since the 1980s]], and technically dropped censorship requirement in its film law in 2015{{cn|date=December 2018}}, despite it still may not issue the Restricted rating occasionally, if the film elicits feelings of shame or disgust in persons over the age of 18{{clarify|date=December 2018}}.

== History ==

=== Republic of China ===
==== 1912 to 1949 ====
In 1911, under the [[Qing dynasty]], the Shanghai Autonomous Bureau issued the first regulation on film content, disallowing "obscene content". Violations of the regulation were punishable by revocation of a theater's license to screen films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xiao|first1=Zhiwei|last2=Zhang|first2=Yingjin|title=Encyclopedia of Chinese Film|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134745548|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAeGAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the government banned foreign films for promoting Christianity, cited as negativity affecting Chinese society, and for including kidnapping and love stories with "carnal desire". [[Wuxia]] and [[shenguai]] films were banned for promoting "superstition and unscientific thinking", and wuxia was felt to be spreading anarchy and instilling rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Teo|2009|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1930, the [[Legislative Yuan]] promulgated a Film Censorship Law ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=電影檢查法-中華民國19年}}), requiring four types of motion picture contents be edited, removed or banned:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Film Censorship Law of 1930|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=E1151648|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hurts the pride of the Chinese race
* Violates [[Three Principles of the People]]
* Impedes good morality or violates public order
* Advocates superstition and heresy

In January 1931, the [[Executive Yuan]] formally established the Film Censorship Committee, putting the control of censorship in the hands of the central government for the first time. The committee was tasked with reviewing locally produced films and international films distributed in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teo|2009|pp=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1934, the government amended The Film Censorship Law, restructuring the Committee to include members from the film industry appointed by the Executive Yuan and renamed it to the Central Film Censorship Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teo|2009|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law got amended four more times before the KMT lost the civil war and fled to Taiwan in 1949. In November 1948 ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=電影檢查法-中華民國37年}}), the reference to the "Three Principles of the People" was dropped and "the interests of the ROC could not be offended" was added in an amendment. Article 10 of the 1948 law also gave birth to a very early-stage motion picture rating system, using age 12 as the cutoff line for content restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Film Censorship Law of 1948|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D4800299|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1949 to 1983 ====
The ROC regained its footing in Taiwan. In 1955 ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=電影檢查法-中華民國44年}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D5500008|title=Film Censorship Law of 1955|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|dead-url=|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1956 ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=電影檢查法-中華民國45年}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Film Censorship Law of January 1956|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D5600007|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Film Censorship Law of November 1956|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D5600117|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1958 ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=電影檢查法-中華民國47年}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Film Censorship Law of 1958|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D5800053|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; four more amendments to the law ensued without revising the main criteria. The law was renamed the Motion Picture Act ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=電影法-中華民國72年}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Film Censorship Law of 1983|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D8300213|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1983, and expanded the censorship criteria to include the following:
* Hurts national interests or racial pride
* Violates national policy or government ordinance
* Agitates others to commit crimes or disobey laws
* Jeopardizes teenager or children's health both physically or psychologically
* Disrupts public order or impedes good morality
* Advocates ridiculous heresy or misleads public opinion
* Defames persons of virtue from the past or distorts historical facts
Article 30 of the 1983 law lowered the age cutoff line from 12 to 6 to dictate whether the viewing should be restricted or not.

==== 1983 to the 2010s ====
KMT practiced [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] until July 1987. After lifting it, the Executive Yuan, or through its now dissolved [[Government Information Office]] (GIO), promulgated regulations to carry out the said revised law starting in 1987 ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=中華民國七十六年八月三十一日行政院臺七十六聞字第二○二○八號函核定}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Regulations Governing the Classification of Motion Pictures and Trailers and the Use of advertisements and promotional materials for a motion picture|url=http://www.bamid.gov.tw/files/15-1000-1044,c259-1.php|website=Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1988 ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=中華民國七十七年一月一日行政院新聞局（77）銘影二字第○○○○二號令發布}}).&lt;ref name="taiwanrating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D8800002|language=zh|title=1988 Regulations Governing the Classification of Motion Pictures|date=January 1, 1988|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|dead-url=|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then regulations revised the motion picture rating system, classifying films into three categories (General Audience/Parental Guidance/Restricted) based on age.&lt;ref name="taiwanrating" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=20,29,35,45&amp;post=25311|title=A Delicate Balance|date=February 1, 1988|website=Taiwan Today|dead-url=|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The categories were expanded into four (General Audience/Protected/Parental Guidance/Restricted) in 1994 ({{Lang-zh|c=|s=|t=中華民國八十三年四月一日行政院新聞局(83)強影二字第○四一五八號令發布修正第二條、第三條、第五條至第十一條條文}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D9401081|language=zh|title=1994 Regulations Governing the Classification of Motion Pictures|date=April 1, 1994|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|dead-url=|access-date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film law rephrased the censorship requirement in June 2015. To control the rating system requirement from a legislative perspective, article 9 of the new Motion Picture Act ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=電影法-中華民國104年}}), promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, maintains that motion pictures and their advertisements shall not be screened if not granted a rating by the central competent authority which shall convene a rating commission to rate films. Members of the commission shall be representatives of government agencies, and scholars and experts having academic or practical experience in related fields. The commission's conclusions shall be made public and clear rationales for ratings given be listed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Motion Picture Act|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawContent.aspx?pcode=P0040002|website=Laws and Regulations Database of The Republic of China|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Censorship Law of 2015|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=E1513290|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10 maintains if motion pictures and their advertisements violate restrictions or prohibitions laid out in law, the central competent authority shall not grant a rating. The [[Ministry of Culture (Taiwan)|Ministry of Culture]] established by the Executive Yuan further specifies that not more than one third of the committee members can come from the [[Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Important Points of Setting Up the Rating Commission|url=http://www.moc.gov.tw/information_319_58573.html|website=Ministry of Culture|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rating system was expanded into five categories on October 16, 2015 per regulations ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=中華民國104年10月16日文影字第10420350091號令修正發布}}) drawn up in accordance with the Motion Picture Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=P0040007|title=Regulations Governing the Classification of Motion Pictures and Trailers and the Use of advertisements and promotional materials for a motion picture|date=October 16, 2015|website=Laws &amp; Regulations Database of the Republic of China|dead-url=|access-date=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*18+: Restricted ({{Lang-zh|c=限制級|s=|t=}} or {{Lang-zh|c=限|s=|t=|labels=no}}) – Viewing is not permitted for those under 18.

Despite the rating system has been put in place, article 9 of the regulations specifically mentions the Restricted rating will not be issued, if the films elicit feelings of shame or disgust in persons over the age of 18. Article 235 of its Criminal Code also penalizes the distribution, broadcasts, sale, publicly displays of obscene video record.&lt;ref name="NCCUNews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Code of the Republic of China|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=C0000001|website=Laws and Regulations Database of the Republic of China|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People's Republic of China ===
==== 1949 to 1988 ====
The earliest predecessor to SAPPRFT was founded in June 1949.&lt;ref name="SARFT"&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=History of the Broadcasting Institution|url=http://www.sarft.gov.cn/art/2015/6/2/art_7_711.html|website=State Administration of Radio, Film and Television of the PRC|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) won the civil war and founded the new republic on [[1949#October|October 1, 1949]].

With the ten-year [[Cultural Revolution]], film industry was singled out as a target for public criticism. Mao's wife [[Jiang Qing]] blacklisted 54 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Xiao|first1=Zhiwei|last2=Zhang|first2=Yingjin|title=Encyclopedia of Chinese Film|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134745548|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAeGAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the [[Chinese economic reform]] (1978 onward), the PRC film industry has undertaken a series of decentralizing and privatizing reforms. In January 1986, SAPPRFT's predecessor is finally known as the Administrative Department of Radio, Film and Television (ADRFT) ({{Lang-zh|link=no|c=广播电影电视部}}).&lt;ref name="SARFT" /&gt;

==== 1988 to 2010s ====
The ADRFT published its departmental-level film censorship regulation one after another in 1988 ({{Lang-zh|c=电影审查条例（修改稿）|s=|t=}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=zh|url=https://www.sinoss.net/qikan/uploadfile/2010/1230/20101230032337128.pdf|title=中国大陆电影分级制度探讨——以中国大陆电影分级制度研究状况为引|last=Gu|first=Yanmei|website=中国高校人文社会科学信息网|dead-url=|access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993 ({{Lang-zh|c=电影审查暂行规定|s=|t=}}) and in 1997 ({{Lang-zh|c=电影审查规定|s=|t=}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=zh|url=http://www.hflib.gov.cn/law/law/falvfagui2/XZF/FLFG/WH%20TY/1073.htm|title=Film Censorship Regulation|date=January 16, 1997|website=Hefei Library|dead-url=|access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic principles of the 1993 document were reaffirmed in July 1996, when the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] promulgated Regulations on the Administration of Movies ({{Lang-zh|link=no|c=1996年电影管理条例}}) at a higher executive level. Its article 23 &amp; 24 gave executive authority in stipulating that the country shall adopt a film examination system: "films that have not (been) examined and approved by the film examination organ of the administrative department of radio, film and television of the State Council may not be distributed, projected, imported or exported."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1996 Regulations on the Administration of Movies|url=http://www.asianlii.org/cn/legis/cen/laws/roaof382|publisher=Asian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=Regulations on the Administration of Movies 1996年电影管理条例|url=http://www.people.com.cn/zixun/flfgk/item/dwjjf/falv/7/7-2-06.html|website=People's Daily|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1998, the ADRFT was renamed State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) ({{Lang-zh|link=no|c=国家广播电影电视总局}}).&lt;ref name="SARFT" /&gt;

In February 2002, the State Council replaced the 1996 regulations with new ones ({{Lang-zh|link=no|c=2002年电影管理条例}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2002 Regulations on the Administration of Movies|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=182159|website=The World Intellectual Property Organization|accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2002 Regulations on the Administration of Movies|url=http://www.lawinfochina.com/Display.aspx?lib=law&amp;ID=2253|publisher=Lawinfochina.com|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=zh|title=2002年电影管理条例|url=http://www.sarft.gov.cn/art/2007/2/16/art_1602_26266.html|website=State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, &amp; Television of PRC|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 24 &amp; 25 of the new regulations reiterates the censorship system and remains in effect despite what follows next.

|It ran afoul of Beijing censors for depicting a Chinese protagonist (Cecilia Cheung) reincarnated from a Japanese soldier. Such a premise, though overtly comedic, offends a Chinese government to whom Sino-Japanese relations remain fractious. According to the film's co-writer Au Kin-yee, SAPPRFT – ever vigilant against superstition – also objected to the male hero's preternatural ability to perceive the past lives of others. Consequently, the Milkyway Image creative team excised the male hero's extrasensory 'visions' from the mainland release, resulting in nonsensical stretches of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQgzDAAAQBAJ|title=Chinese Cinemas: International Perspectives|last=Chan|first=Felicia|last2=Willis|first2=Andy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317431480|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordon Lee''' (died January 13, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] [[comic book]] store owner from [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]], [[Georgia (U. S. state)|Georgia]], who is most famous for having been charged with distributing obscene material to a minor in connection with the [[Free Comic Book Day]] on [[Halloween]], 2004. The [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]] was heavily involved in Lee's defense. Lee was previously convicted on another obscenity charge.

==1994 obscenity conviction==
Gordon Lee was the owner of the comic book store Legends, which was based in Rome, Georgia.&lt;ref name="romenewsmistrial"&gt;[http://news.mywebpal.com/partners/680/public/news851528.html DA: Comic book case not over] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220112123/http://news.mywebpal.com/partners/680/public/news851528.html |date=2008-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was convicted on February 18, 1993 of "distributing obscene materials" for selling the pornographic comics ''[[Final Taboo]]'' and ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' to adult customers. He was fined $1,000 and sentenced to 12 months; both were suspended on payment of $250. Lee made appeals to the court, but they were denied by the [[Georgia Court of Appeals]] and [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] in 1994. The [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]] assisted with fees for the trial and the appeal.&lt;ref name="evidencereturned"&gt;[http://aaaanime.com/animenews/729.html Retailer Won Case over Evidence Return Gordon Lee's 90s Battle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=27331 PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE SPEAKS ON GORDON LEE CASE]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bentcorner.com/2007/11/06/gordon-lee-trial-quickly-ends-in-a-mistrial/ Gordon Lee trial quickly ends in a mistrial] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120707163952/http://bentcorner.com/2007/11/06/gordon-lee-trial-quickly-ends-in-a-mistrial/ |date=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 1993, Lee filed suit for the return of inventory seized in conjunction with the obscenity case. The comics seizure had occurred on November 1, 1991, the day the police received a complaint about comics that were purchased at Legends. Around 300 books were taken as evidence under a search warrant, but were not returned until July 29, 1994, when the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia issued a ruling ordering the district attorney to return the inventory within ten days.&lt;ref name="evidencereturned" /&gt;

==Charged with selling to a minor==
Lee entered the news again after the [[Halloween]] 2004 [[Free Comic Book Day]] giveaway at a street fair in Rome.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/13/AR2006071301108.html Book Notes]&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's shop gave away thousands of free comics on that day, but a copy of ''[[Alternative Comics (publisher)|Alternative Comics]]'' #2 was unintentionally included in the giveaway.&lt;ref name="roadtotrial"&gt;[http://www.cbldf.org/articles/archives/000318.shtml Gordon Lee: The Road To Trial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203542/http://www.cbldf.org/articles/archives/000318.shtml |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alternative Comics'' #2 is an anthology containing an excerpt from the story ''[[The Salon (comics)|The Salon]]'' by [[Nick Bertozzi]].&lt;ref name="comicbookbin"&gt;[http://comicbookbin.com/comicbooknews012.html Cbldf Takes Action in Ga Case -- Files Four Motions to Dismiss]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsaramamistrial"&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=135388 GORDON LEE: MISTRIAL DECLARED]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story portrays [[Pablo Picasso]]'s first meeting with the fellow cubist [[Georges Braque]], during which Picasso is depicted as nude in a non-sexual context. (The CBLDF has made statements that the comic is historically accurate in this depiction.)&lt;ref name="romenewsmistrial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roadtotrial" /&gt;

The copy of that comic that was unintentionally given away was handed to a minor, whose parent filed a complaint with the police. Upon learning of the error, Lee admitted that a mistake was made and offered to make a public apology for the first of many times. That apology was rejected, and days later, Lee was arrested.&lt;ref name="roadtotrial" /&gt; The minor in question was originally described as a nine-year-old boy, but various accounts by the District Attorney's office later stated that the comic was given either to the boy's six-year-old brother or to both boys.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

Lee later stated "Though I am willing to apologize for this particular art book getting in the hands that found it offensive, I will adamantly agree that the book is not 'harmful to children' or 'obscene.' In my opinion, this book is no more offensive then viewing the beautiful paintings of the Sistine Chapel or reading one of the best selling books with stories of sex, lust and nudity known as the Bible."&lt;ref name="caseinitiated"&gt;[http://www.cbldf.org/pr/archives/000248.shtml CBLDF Initiates Obscenity Defense in Georgia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219114919/http://www.cbldf.org/pr/archives/000248.shtml |date=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

District Attorney Leigh Patterson charged Lee with two felony counts and five misdemeanors. The two felony charges were brought under the Distribution of Material Depicting Nudity or Sexual Conduct law, which requires materials containing nudity to be distributed in a labelled envelope. Penalties for violating this law include one to three years in prison and/or fines of up to $10,000 US. The five misdemeanors were presented under the Distribution of Material Harmful to Minors law, which makes it a misdemeanor to supply minors any material containing nudity.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="comicbookbin" /&gt;

==CBLDF involvement==
Lee approached [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]] board member [[Peter David]] for help late in January 2005. The CBLDF Board of Directors voted unanimously to financially support Lee's defense, putting a defense team in place within days.&lt;ref name="roadtotrial" /&gt;&lt;ref name="caseinitiated" /&gt;

In May 2005, the CBLDF submitted four motions to dismiss the counts Lee faced, challenging the constitutionality of both laws. A hearing on those motions was held on December 1, 2005, during which all charges under the Distribution of Material Depicting Nudity or Sexual Conduct law were dropped. Two of the remaining misdemeanor charges were dropped as well, and the three remaining charges were consolidated into only two. The remaining charges were for "distributing a book, pamphlet, magazine, and printed matter containing pictures, drawings and visual representation and images of a person a portion of the human body which depict sexually explicit nudity, sexual conduct, and sadomasochistic abuse and which is harmful to minors;" and for knowingly furnishing and disseminating to a minor materials "containing explicit and detailed verbal descriptions and narrative accounts of sexual excitement, sexual conduct, and sadomasochistic abuse and which taken as a whole is harmful to minors." The Fund maintained  that the material did not meet the criteria as charged.&lt;ref name="roadtotrial" /&gt;

==Delays in the trial==
By November 2007, the CBLDF had spent over $80,000 on Lee's defense after taking the case in early 2005, and estimated costs reaching six figures by the end of the trial. The case has been ready for trial three times, but has been delayed each time.&lt;ref name="newsaramamistrial" /&gt;

===Re-filing of charges===
On April 2, 2006, 18 hours before Lee's jury trial, the District Attorney's team informed the defense team that all charges were being dropped against Lee based on a mistake: The recipient of the comic was not the nine-year-old originally referenced in the charges; it was his six-year-old brother. The same charges were immediately re-filed, but with the child listed. The defense team expressed shock at this statement, which meant the case (and defense preparations for it) had been proceeding for 18 months under faulty charges. Also, the prosecutor's admission meant that false testimony had been presented under oath at the pre-trial hearing. Lead counsel Alan Begner protested "How did a year and a half of statements based on one set of facts get changed at the last minute to another set of facts?"&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roadtotrial" /&gt;

===New arraignment and additional delays===
On May 19, 2006, a new arraignment was held, again charging the same two misdemeanors; this time both the six-year-old and nine-year-old boys were cited as victims. The CBLDF filed several procedural motions and motions to dismiss on May 30. The motions included allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in connection with what were now characterized as false allegations, as well as allegations of the District Attorney's office allowing untruthful testimony to be presented under oath, causing Lee and his defense counsel to incur unnecessary expense by requiring a change in trial date on too-short notice. Patterson said that her office had "been honest and above board throughout this case. We forwarded new information to the defense as quickly as we got it."&lt;ref name="roadtotrial" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mywebpal.com/partners/680/public/news722634.html Motion: Law ‘overbroad’]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2006, prosecutors filed yet another new indictment, modifying the second misdemeanor charge. This marked the third time Lee had been formally charged for this one incident. Although new indictments were issued, the first two sets of charges were never formally dropped. The CBLDF team again filed motions, this time in response to all three sets of accusations, but they were all dismissed, including those alleging prosecutorial misconduct.&lt;ref name="roadtotrial" /&gt;

The trial was postponed again on August 15, 2007, due to the illness of presiding Judge Larry Salmon.&lt;ref name="postponed"&gt;[http://news.mywebpal.com/partners/680/public/news829648.html Gordon Lee comic book trial postponed]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mistrial===
Opening statements in the new trial began on November 5, 2007, but quickly resulted in a mistrial. Prior to the opening statements, the defense requested that the judge bar prosecutors from commenting on Lee's previous conviction in 1994. However, the prosecution noted in opening statements that Lee told deputies during the 2004 incident he had "been through this before and beat it". The district attorney's office planned to bring the case back to Floyd Superior Court the following year.&lt;ref name="romenewsmistrial" /&gt;  At this point, the CBLDF had spent over $80,000 on Lee's defense.&lt;ref name="newsaramamistrial" /&gt;

===Case dismissed===
On Friday, 18 April 2008, it was announced in author [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[blog]] that the case had been dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of the case==
The charges against Lee have unnerved many shop owners who are concerned about distributing materials that could result in similar charges. One store owner in Georgia stated that "We are a smaller community, very similar to the community that Gordon is in. We will special order [''controversial comic [[Lost Girls]]''] for anybody, but we will not have it out on display."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

==Later life and death==
Lee entered the news for unrelated reasons when he chased two women who have since been charged with stealing two puzzles based on the movie ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' from his store. In an attempt to stop the women, Lee jumped on the hood of their car, and was thrown off, unhurt, after riding on the hood for a block. The women were later charged with shoplifting, and the driver was charged with aggravated assault.&lt;ref name="shoplifting"&gt;[http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=680&amp;show=archivedetails&amp;ArchiveID=1311914&amp;om=1 Comic book store owner chases 2 thieves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611173525/http://news.mywebpal.com/news_tool_v2.cfm?pnpid=680&amp;show=archivedetails&amp;ArchiveID=1311914&amp;om=1 |date=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee died on the afternoon of January 13, 2013, from complications stemming from a series of strokes. He was 54 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Brownstein, Charles (January 14, 2013). [http://cbldf.org/2013/01/rip-gordon-lee/ "RIP, Gordon Lee"]. [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hat manipulation''' is a form of [[juggling]] in which the manipulator performs feats of skill and dexterity using a brimmed hat such as a [[bowler hat]] or a [[top hat]] as a [[juggling prop|prop]]. Tricks can range from rolling a hat up and down the various parts of the [[Human body|body]] to throwing and catching the hat in amusing ways. Hat manipulation is often comedic in nature, and can be very entertaining. Part of the appeal of the art is in the necessary equipment; all that is needed is a good, heavy, brimmed hat, which can be found at many juggling stores. Famous manufacturers of manipulation specific hats are Nils Poll and Dubé. Hat manipulation is also frequently combined with traditional forms of juggling in order to create more varied acts.

Technically, hat manipulation is a form of [[object manipulation]] where the hat is the [[skill toy]].

==Types of tricks==
The types of tricks performed during hat manipulation fall into seven major categories. These are:
* '''Tumbles''': Tricks where the hat rotates end over end (possibly over the body).
* '''Twiddles''': Tricks in which a hat rotates quickly through the fingers.
* '''Spins''': Tricks where the hat spins around its central axis, much like showing off with a basketball.
* '''Rolls''': Tricks involving the hat spinning on its brim like a wheel.
* ''' Throws''': Tricks where a hat is thrown into the air.
* '''Comedy''': Gags with the hat intended to make the audience laugh.
* '''Multi-hat juggling''': Juggling 3 or more hats along the lines of normal juggling.

'''Interstitial art''' is any work of art whose basic nature falls between, rather than within, the familiar boundaries of accepted [[genres]] or media, thus making the work difficult to categorize or describe within a single artistic discipline.

==The concept of interstitiality==
The word ''interstitial'' means "between spaces", and is commonly used to denote "in-betweenness" in several different cultural contexts. Architects refer to the leftover gaps between building walls as "interstitial space", being neither inside any room nor outside the building. Medical doctors have used  the term for hundreds of years to refer to a space within the human body that lies in between blood vessels and organs, or in between individual cells. Television station programmers refer to any short piece of content that is neither a show nor a commercial, but is sandwiched between them, as "an interstitial".

==How art can be interstitial==
Take [[fiction]] as an example: If a librarian isn't sure where to shelve a book, that may be because the material is interstitial in some way, not fitting comfortably into a single, conventional literary category. For instance, when novelist [[Laurell K. Hamilton]] first began writing and publishing romances featuring [[vampires]] and [[fairies]], bookstores faced a dilemma: How do you file these stories when you're working in a system that clearly labels one shelf for romances, a second shelf for fantasies, and a third shelf for tales of horror? There's no single, obvious answer, because such a novel is interstitial fiction, its essence residing somewhere in between the boundaries of these genres.

Or consider the performance artist [[Laurie Anderson]]: She might go onstage and sing, tell a spoken-word story, project shadow puppets on a screen, and play a hacked violin whose bow is strung with audio tape. Is she a singer, a monologist, a puppeteer, or some kind of tinkering instrumentalist? Classifying such an act as interstitial [[performance art]] would be imprecise but efficient and accurate.

==The interstitial arts movement==
In the mid-1990s, [[Delia Sherman]], [[Ellen Kushner]], [[Terri Windling]], [[Heinz Insu Fenkl]], [[Midori Snyder]], [[Kelly Link]], [[Gavin Grant (editor)|Gavin Grant]], [[Gregory Frost]], [[Theodora Goss]], [[Veronica Schanoes]], Carolyn Dunn, Colson Whitehead, and other American writers interested in fantastic literature found themselves commiserating over the common perception that the genre-oriented [[publishing]] industry found it difficult to market truly innovative fiction involving unusual, fantastical, or cross-genre elements—because the mainstream [[literary fiction]] field demanded stories based in [[Realism (arts)|realism]], while the [[fantasy]] field demanded stories that mostly followed the standard conventions of [[sword and sorcery]] or [[high fantasy]]. Yet it seemed to the authors that some of the best literature was that which didn't quite fit tidily into either category but instead was being discussed in terms of more amorphous, "in-between" descriptors such as "[[magic realism]]", "[[mythic fiction]]", or "the [[New Weird]]". Further, the idea of interstitiality applied to other kinds of "in-between" fiction (unrelated to fantasy) and other "in-between" arts.

Over a period of several years, Kushner and Sherman prompted ongoing discussion about the importance of cultivating artistic "in-betweenness" led to the formulation of the broad concept of interstitial art. In 2002, literary scholar [[Heinz Insu Fenkl]] founded ISIS: The Interstitial Studies Institute at the [[State University of New York at New Paltz]], and in 2003–04, Sherman &amp; Kushner and some of their colleagues established the Interstitial Arts Foundation, a [[501(c)(3)|501c(3)]] nonprofit organization dedicated to developing community and support for artists, arts-industry professionals and audiences whose creative pursuits are interstitial in nature.

==Interstitial Arts Projects==
=== ''Interfictions'' ===
In 2007, the Interstitial Arts Foundation published an anthology of interstitial fiction through [[Small Beer Press]] titled ''Interfictions''.  It features 19 stories from new and established writers in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, and fiction translated from Spanish, Hungarian, and French.  The anthology strives to "change your mind about what stories can and should do as they explore the imaginative space between conventional genres".

The anthology raised several questions and started many debates on the nature of interstitiality as applied to fiction.  Reviewers raised the question of how important the definition, or lack thereof, was to understanding the anthology as a whole and the stories individually.  "The 19 stories contained within ''Interfictions'' serve as examples but not as points of an argument that could lead to a listing in a Funk and Wagnalls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.citypaper.com/arts/review.asp?rid=11820 |title=The Go-Betweens: Writers Dismantle And Recombine Genre In Seek Of Fresh Modes Of Storytelling |first=Adrienne |last=Martini |date= 30 May 2007 |work=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many of the stories are written by science fiction, fantasy, and horror writers and contain fantastic or supernatural elements, ''Interfictions'' is not a genre anthology.  "...interstitial fiction mixes and matches these precepts—ghost stories, science fiction, nursery rhymes, detective story, whatever may be handy—as part of a variegated prism to focus on the psychology of existence even while bending its collectively recognized state. ...each 'interfiction' shares this sense of disjointed narrative, but in very different ways that do not lend themselves to easy genre categorization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2007/07/interfictions_e.shtml |title=''Interfictions'', edited by Theodora Goss and Delia Sherman |first=David |last=Soyka |date=25 July 2007 |work=[[Strange Horizons]] |accessdate=9 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525074044/http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2007/07/interfictions_e.shtml |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Benny''' (born {{nowrap|'''Benjamin Kubelsky''';}} February 14, 1894 – December 26, 1974) was an American comedian, [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]], radio, television and film actor, and violinist. Recognized as a leading 20th-century American entertainer, Benny often portrayed his character as a miser, playing his violin badly, and claiming to be 39 years of age, regardless of his actual age.

Benny was known for his [[comic timing]] and the ability to cause laughter with a pregnant pause or a single expression, such as his signature exasperated "''Well!''" His radio and television programs, popular from 1932 until his death in 1974, were a major influence on the [[situation comedy|sitcom]] genre.

==Early life==
[[File:Life ad benny 1937.JPG|thumb|Jack Benny as part of the Waukegan High School band, 1909]]
Benny was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and grew up in nearby [[Waukegan, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benny |first1=Joan |authorlink1= |last2=Benny |first2=Jack |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Sunday Nights at Seven: The Jack Benny Story |trans-title=|url= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1990 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Warner Books |location= |language= |isbn=0-446-51546-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=There are a few things you should know in advance.

Meyer was a saloon owner and later a [[haberdasher]] who had emigrated to America from Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Benny appearance on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', episode 1025: "Academy Awards" (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, Jack. ''Tune in yesterday: the ultimate encyclopedia of old-time radio, 1925–1976''. p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benny, Mary Livingstone, Hilliard Marks, &amp; Marcia Borie. ''Jack Benny'' New York: Doubleday, 1978. pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Bennie Kubelsky 1900 Census.jpg|United States 1900 Census, starting at line 94]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Jack Benny Times'', September – December 2008, Volume XXIII Numbers 5–6, Page 9., The International Jack Benny Fan Club.&lt;/ref&gt; Emma had emigrated from Lithuania. Benny began studying [[violin]], an instrument that became his trademark, at the age of 6, his parents hoping for him to become a professional violinist. He loved the instrument, but hated practice. His music teacher was Otto Graham Sr., a neighbor and father of [[Otto Graham]] of NFL fame. At 14, Benny was playing in dance bands and his high school orchestra. He was a dreamer and poor at his studies, and was ultimately expelled from high school. He later did poorly in business school and at attempts to join his father's business. In 1911, he began playing the violin in local [[vaudeville]] theaters for $7.50 a week.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|11}} He was joined on the circuit by [[Nathan "Ned" Miller|Ned Miller]], a young composer and singer.&lt;ref&gt;Fein, Irving, ''Jack Benny: An Intimate Biography'', Putnam, {{ISBN|978-0-671-80917-1}}, {{oclc|3694842}}, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Benny was playing in the same theater as the young [[Marx Brothers]]. [[Minnie Marx|Minnie]], their mother, enjoyed Benny's violin playing and invited him to accompany her boys in their act. Benny's parents refused to let their son go on the road at 17, but it was the beginning of his long friendship with the Marx Brothers, especially [[Zeppo Marx]].

The next year, Benny formed a vaudeville musical duo with pianist [[Cora Folsom Salisbury]], a buxom 45-year-old divorcée who needed a partner for her act. This angered famous violinist [[Jan Kubelik]], who feared that the young vaudevillian with a similar name would damage his reputation. Under legal pressure, Benjamin Kubelsky agreed to change his name to Ben K. Benny, sometimes spelled Bennie. When Salisbury left the act, Benny found a new pianist, Lyman Woods, and renamed the act "From Grand Opera to Ragtime." They worked together for five years and slowly integrated comedy elements into the show. They reached the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theater]], the "Mecca of Vaudeville," and did not do well. Benny left show business briefly in 1917 to join the [[United States Navy]] during World War I, and often entertained the troops with his violin playing. One evening, his violin performance was booed by the troops, so with prompting from fellow sailor and actor [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]], he ad-libbed his way out of the jam and left them laughing. He received more comedy spots in the [[revues]] and did well, earning a reputation as a comedian and musician.

Shortly after the war, Benny developed a one-man act, "Ben K. Benny: Fiddle Funology".&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|17}} He then received legal pressure from [[Ben Bernie]], a "patter-and-fiddle" performer, regarding his name, so he adopted the sailor's nickname of Jack. By 1921, the fiddle was more of a prop, and the low-key comedy took over.

Benny had some romantic encounters, including one with dancer Mary Kelly,&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|23–24}} whose devoutly Catholic family forced her to turn down his proposal because he was Jewish. Benny was introduced to Kelly by [[Gracie Allen]]. Some years after their split, Kelly resurfaced as a dowdy fat girl and Jack gave her a part in an act of three girls: one homely, one fat, and one who couldn't sing.
[[File:Jack Benny and daughter Joan 1940.JPG|thumb|180px|Benny and daughter Joan in 1940]]
In 1921, Benny accompanied [[Zeppo Marx]] to a [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|seder]] in [[Vancouver]] at the residence where he met 14-year-old Sadie Marks. Their first meeting did not go well when he tried to leave during Sadie's violin performance.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|30–31}} They met again in 1926. Jack had not remembered their earlier meeting and instantly fell for her.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|31}} They married the following year. She was working in the hosiery section of the Hollywood Boulevard branch of the May Company,  where Benny courted her.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|32}} Called on to fill in for the "dumb girl" part in a Benny routine, Sadie proved to be a natural comedienne. Adopting the stage name [[Mary Livingstone]], Sadie collaborated with Benny throughout most of his career. They later adopted a daughter, Joan.

In 1929 Benny's agent, Sam Lyons, convinced [[Irving Thalberg]], American film producer at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], to watch Benny at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Los Angeles)|Orpheum Theatre]] in Los Angeles. Benny signed a five-year contract with MGM, where his first role was in ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]''. The next movie, ''[[Chasing Rainbows (1930 film)|Chasing Rainbows]]'', did not do well, and after several months Benny was released from his contract and returned to Broadway in [[Earl Carroll's Vanities|Earl Carroll's ''Vanities'']]. At first dubious about the viability of radio, Benny grew eager to break into the new medium. In 1932, after a four-week nightclub run, he was invited onto [[Ed Sullivan]]'s radio program, uttering his first radio ''[[wikt:spiel|spiel]]'' "This is Jack Benny talking. There will be a slight pause while you say, 'Who cares?'..."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|40}}

===History===
[[File:Jack benny 1933 publicity photo.JPG|thumb|180px|Benny in 1933, newly arrived at NBC and the host of ''The Chevrolet Program'']]

Benny had been a minor vaudeville performer before becoming a national figure with ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', a weekly radio show that ran from 1932 to 1948 on [[NBC]] and from 1949 to 1955 on [[CBS]]. It was among the most highly rated programs during its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garrett |first=Eddie |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=I Saw Stars in the 40's and 50's |year=2005 |publisher= |quote=In a short time, Benny became the [[List of most-listened-to radio programs|most popular radio show]] in America in the 1930s and 1940s | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TDbGVZj5qzgC&amp;pg=PA26 |isbn=1-4120-5838-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny's long radio career began on April 6, 1932, when the NBC Commercial Program Department auditioned him for the [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son]] agency and their client, [[Canada Dry]], after which [[Bertha Brainard]], head of the division, said, "We think Mr. Benny is excellent for radio and, while the audition was unassisted as far as orchestra was concerned, we believe he would make a great bet for an air program." Recalling the experience in 1956, Benny said Ed Sullivan had invited him to guest on his program (1932), and "the agency for Canada Dry [[ginger ale]] heard me and offered me a job."&lt;ref&gt;"Stars Shine Best When Polished: a B-T Interview with Jack Benny," Broadcasting-Telecasting, 15 October 1956, 122. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1956/1956-10-15-Quarter-Century-BC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With Canada Dry ginger ale as a sponsor, Benny came to radio on ''The Canada Dry Program'', on May 2, 1932, on the NBC [[Blue Network]] and continuing for six months until October 26, moving to [[CBS]] on October 30. With [[Ted Weems]] leading the band, Benny stayed on CBS until January 26, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Hilmes, M. (1997). Radio voices American broadcasting, 1922–1952. Minnesota Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arriving at [[NBC]] on March 17, Benny did ''The Chevrolet Program'' until April 1, 1934. He continued with sponsor [[General Tire]] through the end of the season. In October, 1934, [[General Foods]], the makers of [[Jell-O]] and [[Grape-Nuts]], became the sponsor strongly identified with Benny for 10 years. [[American Tobacco]]'s [[Lucky Strike]] was his longest-lasting radio sponsor, from October 1944 through to the end of his original radio series.

The show switched networks to CBS on January 2, 1949, as part of CBS president [[William S. Paley]]'s notorious "raid" of NBC talent in 1948–49. It stayed there for the remainder of its radio run, ending on May 22, 1955. CBS aired repeat episodes from 1956 to 1958 as ''The Best of Benny''.

===Benny===
Benny's [[comic persona]] changed over the course of his career. At some point he developed a miserly persona.&lt;ref name="Bergerp41"/&gt; This stage character was everything that Jack Benny was not: Cheap, petty, vain, and self-congratulatory. His comic rendering of these traits was the linchpin to the success of his show. Benny set himself up as [[comedic foil]], allowing his supporting characters to draw laughs at the expense of his own flaws. With his humanism and vulnerability in an era where few male characters were allowed such character traits, Benny made what could have been unlikable into an [[everyman]] character.

Benny said: "''I don't care who gets the laughs on my show, as long as the show is funny''." Benny felt he got the credit or blame either way, not the actor saying the lines, so there was emphasis on the comedic bottom line. This attitude reached its apogee in a broadcast structured as a Hollywood bus tour of the stars' homes. Each "stop" on the tour was at a house belonging to one of the show's supporting cast, who would then have a scene which included jokes about the absent Benny. Not until the final moments of the program did the bus arrive at Jack Benny's house, at which point the listening audience heard Benny's only line of the episode: "''Driver, here's where I get off''." Few stars possessed the combination of daring, humility and comic timing to commit to such an extended payoff.

===Rochester===
[[Eddie "Rochester" Anderson|Eddie Anderson]] played Benny's valet and chauffeur, Rochester van Jones.  Rochester's comic persona regularly got the better of his vain, skinflint boss. Rochester saw through the vanities of his boss, and knew how to jab him without going too far, often with his famous line: "Oh, Boss, come now!" With his mock-befuddled one-liners and sharp retorts, Rochester broke comedic racial barriers. Unlike many black supporting characters of the time, Rochester was a regular member of the fictional Benny household, and was functionally his equal.  Benny wrote the character as transcending the racial stereotype of the era, and the popularity of Rochester nearly rivaled his own. A [[New Year's Eve]] episode, in particular, shows their mutual love and respect as they quietly toast one another with champagne.

After the war, Benny made a conscious effort to remove stereotypical aspects from the Rochester character. In 1948, a 1941 script for the show was re-used, including several African-American stereotypes — for example, a reference to Rochester carrying a razor.  This prompted some listeners who were unaware the script was a repeat to send in angry letters protesting the stereotypes. Thereafter, Benny insisted that his writers avoid all negative racial jokes or references.

===Regular supporting characters===
[[Mary Livingstone]] (Benny's wife) was a supporting character, as his wisecracking and not-especially-deferential female friend and secretary. She was not quite his girlfriend, since Benny would often try to date movie stars, like [[Barbara Stanwyck]], and occasionally had stage girlfriends, such as "Gladys Zybisco".

[[File:Jack Benny group photo.jpg|thumb|240px|Group photograph of Eddie Anderson, Dennis Day, Phil Harris, Mary Livingstone, Jack Benny, Don Wilson, and Mel Blanc]]
[[Don Wilson (announcer)|Don Wilson]], the rotund announcer, also appeared on the show. He also announced for [[Fanny Brice]]'s hit ''[[Baby Snooks]]''.

Bandleader [[Phil Harris]] appeared as a jive talking, alcoholic philanderer whose repartee was profoundly risqué for its time.

Boy tenor [[Dennis Day]] appeared as a sheltered, naïve youth who often got the better of his boss. This character was originated by [[Kenny Baker (singer/actor)|Kenny Baker]] whom Day replaced. Singer Larry Stevens replaced Dennis Day from 5&amp;nbsp;November 1944 to 10&amp;nbsp;March 1946, while Day served in the Navy.

[[Mel Blanc]] supplied several characters' voices, including the railroad station announcer who said, "Train leaving on track five for [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Azusa, California|Azusa]] and [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Cu... camonga]]!" This gag became well known, and was used in several Bugs Bunny cartoons which Mel Blanc also voiced. It eventually led to a statue of Benny in Cucamonga. Blanc was also featured with Benny as a Mexican character in the classic ''Si-Sy'' routine, and on radio as the sound of Benny's Maxwell automobile. He also provided the growling voice of Carmichael, Benny's pet polar bear, and later the squawking voice of Polly, Benny's pet parrot. Blanc is perhaps best remembered as Professor LeBlanc, Benny's perpetually frustrated violin teacher, who was as likely to assault his student out of insane exasperation as he was to jump out the window before he got out the door.

===Other supporting characters===
In the early days of the program, supporting characters were often vaudevillian ethnic stereotypes whose humor was grounded in dialects. As the years went by, the humor of these figures became character-based.

The method Benny used to bring a character into a skit by announcing his name was a well-known Benny shtick: "''Oh, Dennis ...''" or "''Oh, Rochester ...''" typically answered by "''Yes, Mr. Benny (Boss)?''"

The cast included character actors and comedians:

* [[Sheldon Leonard]] – later a successful television producer and creator, as a tight-lipped racetrack tout
* [[Joseph Kearns]] – remembered as the cantankerous Mr. Wilson on the television version of ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', as Ed, the superannuated guard to Jack's money vault
* [[Andy Devine]] – was a regular on the show during the late 1930s, for "Buck Benny Rides Again" sketches, a weekly spoof of cowboy Westerns. Devine always greeted Benny with the expression, "''Hiya, Buck!''"
* [[Sam Hearn]] – appeared in the 1930s as "Schlepperman", a sarcastic Yiddish character who referred to Benny as "Boopsie". In the 1950s, Hearn returned to the show as a "Farmer" character, who greeted Benny with the expression, "Hi, Rube!", and treated him with cornball country humor.
* [[Verna Felton]] – portrayed Dennis Day's mother.
* [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]] – usually as an oily desk clerk or floorwalker, always greeting Benny with an eager ''Yeeeeeeesss?''  His character was eager to antagonize Benny.
* singer/bandleader [[Bob Crosby]] – succeeded Phil Harris in the early 1950s.
* [[Artie Auerbach]] – as the Yiddish-accented Mr.&amp;nbsp;Kitzel ("Hoo, hoo, ''hoo!''").
* [[Sara Berner]] and [[Bea Benaderet]] – as Mabel Flapsaddle and Gertrude Gearshift, two gossipy switchboard operators.

Musical contributions came in 1946 from the singing quartet the [[Sportsmen Quartet|Sportsmen]] (members: [[Bill Days]], Max Smith&lt;!-- not linked because it links to someone else--&gt;, [[Marty Sperzel]], and [[Gurney Bell]]) singing the middle Lucky Strike commercial.

===Situational comedy===
[[File:Bennystatue.jpg|right|thumb|300px|This statue of Jack Benny in [[Rancho Cucamonga]], located at the Lewis Family Playhouse, commemorates the program's famed running gag: "Train leaving on track five for [[Anaheim]], [[Azusa, California|Azusa]] and Cu-ca-monga!"]]

''The Jack Benny Program'' evolved from a variety show blending sketch comedy and musical interludes into the situation comedy form we now recognize, crafting particular situations and scenarios from the fictionalization of Benny the radio star. Common situations included hosting parties, income tax time, nights on the town, "backstage" interactions between Jack and his cast at the radio studio during show rehearsals, contract negotiations, or traveling by train or plane to and from Jack's many personal appearances throughout the country (hence the "Train leaving on track five" gag). The writers and star would insert musical interludes from Phil Harris and Dennis Day. With Day, invariably, a brief sketch  ended with Benny ordering Day to sing the song he planned for the show that week.

One popular scenario that became a tradition on ''The Jack Benny Program'' was the annual "Christmas Shopping" episode, in which Benny would go to a local department store to do his shopping. Each year, Benny would buy a ridiculously cheap Christmas gift for Don Wilson, from a harried store clerk played by Mel Blanc. Benny would then drive Blanc to insanity by exchanging the gift countless times throughout the episode.

In the 1946 Christmas episode, for example, Benny buys shoelaces for Don, and is unable to make up his mind whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or metal tips. After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, "Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can't stand it anymore!" A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, "I haven't run into anyone like you in 20 years! Oh, why did the governor have to give me that pardon!?" Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide. Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links, golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc's wife (played by [[Jean Vander Pyl]]) or the clerk's psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy as well.

In 1936, after a few years of broadcasting from New York, Benny moved the show to Los Angeles, allowing him to bring in guests from among his show business friends, including [[Frank Sinatra]], [[James Stewart]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Burns and Allen]] (George Burns was Benny's closest friend), and many others. Burns, Allen and [[Orson Welles]] guest hosted several episodes in March and April 1943 when Benny was ill with pneumonia, while [[Ronald Colman]] and his wife [[Benita Hume]] appeared often in the 1940s as Benny's long-suffering neighbors.

On the broadcast of January 8, 1950, journalist [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] was the subject of a joke gone wrong. Announcer Don Wilson was supposed to say he heard that Jack bought a new suit on Drew Pearson, but said the name wrong; Don said "Drear Pewson". Later in the show, comedic actor Frank Nelson was asked by Benny if he was the doorman. Changing his original response at the suggestion of the writers, Nelson said, "Well, who do you think I am, Drear Pewson?" The audience laughed for almost 30 seconds.

===Sponsors===
[[File:Comedian Jack Benny with advertising agent Frederick D Sulcer circa 1956.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two men in a black and white photo.|Benny worked with advertising agency copywriters such as [[Sandy Sulcer]] (right) to line up sponsors for his television shows.]]
In the early days of radio and in the early television era, airtime was owned by the sponsor, and Benny incorporated the commercials into the body of the show. Sometimes the sponsors were the butt of jokes, though Benny did not use this device as frequently as his friend and "rival" [[Fred Allen]] did then, or as cast member Phil Harris later did on his successful radio sitcom. Nevertheless, for years, Benny insisted in contract negotiations that his writers pen the sponsor's commercial in the middle of the program (leaving the sponsor to provide the opening and closing spots) and the resulting ads were cleverly and wittily worked into the storyline of the show. For example, on one program, Don Wilson accidentally misread Lucky Strike's slogan ("Be happy, go Lucky") as "Be Lucky, go happy", prompting a story arc over several weeks that had Wilson unable to appear on the show due to being traumatized by the error.

In fact, the radio show was generally not announced as ''The Jack Benny Program''. Instead, the primary name of the show tied to the sponsor. Benny's first sponsor was Canada Dry Ginger Ale from 1932 to 1933. Benny's sponsors included [[Chevrolet]] from 1933 to 1934, [[General Tire]] in 1934, and [[Jell-O]] from 1934 to 1942. ''The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny'' was so successful in selling Jell-O, in fact, that General Foods could not manufacture it quickly enough when sugar shortages arose in the early years of World War II, and the company stopped advertising the popular dessert mix. General Foods switched the Benny program from Jell-O to [[Grape-Nuts]] from 1942 to 1944, and it was, naturally, ''The Grape Nuts Program Starring Jack Benny''. Benny's longest-running sponsor, was the American Tobacco Company's [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes, from 1944 to 1955, when the show was usually announced as ''The Lucky Strike Program starring Jack Benny''.

===Writers===
Benny was notable for employing a small group of writers, most of whom stayed with him for many years. This was in contrast to successful radio or television comedians, such as [[Bob Hope]], who would change writers frequently. One of Benny's writers, George Balzer, noted: "One of the nice things about writing for Jack Benny was that he never denied your existence. On the contrary, he publicized it—not just in conversations, but in interviews and on the air."&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, George. ''They'll Break Your Heart'' (unpublished autobiography, undated), p.170.  Available in PDF form at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jackbenny.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Historical accounts (like those by longtime Benny writer [[Milt Josefsberg]]) indicate that Benny's role was essentially as head writer and director of his radio programs, though he was not credited in either capacity. In contrast to Fred Allen, who initially wrote his own radio scripts (and extensively rewrote scripts produced in later years by a writing staff), Jack Benny was often described by his writers as a consummate comedy editor rather than a writer per se. George Burns described Benny as "the greatest editor of material in the business. He's got the knack of cutting out all the weak slush and keeping in only the strong, punchy lines."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Zolotow, Maurice. "Jack Benny: the fine art of self-disparagement" in Zolotow, ''No People Like Show People'', Random House (New York: 1951); rpt Bantam Books (New York: 1952), p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Benny has a reputation as a master of timing. Since his days in radio, he often explored the limits of timing for comedic purposes, like pausing a disproportionate amount of time before answering a question.&lt;ref name="Bergerp41"&gt;Berger, Arthur Asa (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RlILAQAAMAAJ ''Jewish jesters: a study in American popular comedy''] p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman R. Shapiro – (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=boOrA_TRn7IC&amp;pg=PA475 ''Labiche &amp; co: fourteen one-acts by a French comic master''] p. 475&lt;/ref&gt; Balzer described writing material for Benny as similar to composing music, with one element being the rhythm of delivery as equivalent to musical tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, p.169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theme music===
During his early radio shows, there was no recurring theme, the program instead opening each week with a different then-current popular song. Throughout the Jello and Grapenuts years, announcer Don Wilson would announce the name of the show, some of the cast, then state "The orchestra opens the program with [name of song]." The orchestra number would continue softly as background for Don Wilson's opening commercial.

Starting in the Lucky Strike era, Benny adopted a medley of "[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]" and "[[Love in Bloom (song)|Love in Bloom]]" as his theme music, opening every show. "Love in Bloom" was later the theme of his television show. His radio shows often ended with the orchestra playing "[[Hooray for Hollywood]]". The TV show ended with one of two bouncy instrumentals written for the show by his musical arranger and conductor, [[Mahlon Merrick]].

Benny would sometimes joke about the propriety of "Love in Bloom" as his theme song. On a segment often played in ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' retrospectives, Benny talks with [[Johnny Carson]] about this. Benny says he has no objections to the song in and of itself, only as ''his theme.'' Proving his point, he begins reciting the lyrics slowly and deliberately: "Can it be the ''trees.'' That fill the ''breeze''. With rare and magic perfume. Now what the hell has that got to do with ''me?''"

==="Your money or your life"===
[[File:Harry Truman and Jack Benny.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Harry Truman]] and Jack Benny on September 3, 1959]]
In an episode broadcast March 28, 1948, Benny borrowed neighbor [[Ronald Colman]]'s [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], and was returning home when he was accosted by a mugger (voiced by comedian Eddie Marr). After asking for a match to light a cigarette, the mugger demands, "Don't make a move, this is a stickup. Now, come on. Your money or your life." Benny paused, and the studio audience—knowing his skinflint character—laughed. The robber then repeated his demand: "Look, bud! I said your money or your life!" Benny snapped back, without a break, "I'm thinking it over!" This time, the audience laughed louder and longer than they had during the pause.

The punchline came to Benny staff writers [[John Tackaberry]] and [[Milt Josefsberg]] almost by accident. Writer [[George Balzer]] described the scene to author Jordan R. Young, for ''The Laugh Crafters'', a 1999 book of interviews with veteran radio and television comedy writers:
:... they had come to a point where they had the line, "Your money or your life." And that stopped them ... Milt is pacing up and down, trying to get a follow... And he gets a little peeved at Tack, and he says, "For God's sakes, Tack, say something." Tack, maybe he was half asleep—in defense of himself, says, "I'm thinking it over." And Milt says, "Wait a minute. That's it." And that's the line that went in the script ... By the way, that was ''not'' the biggest laugh that Jack ever got. It has the reputation of getting the biggest laugh. But that's not true.

The actual length of the laugh the joke got was five seconds when originally delivered and seven seconds when the gag was reprised on a follow-up show. In fact, the joke is probably not so memorable for the length of the laugh it provoked, but because it became the definitive "Jack Benny joke"—the joke that best illustrated Benny's "stingy man" persona. The punchline—"I'm thinking it over!"—would not have worked with any other comedian than Benny.

The actual longest laugh known to collectors of ''The Jack Benny Program'' lasted in excess of 32 seconds. The [http://www.jackbenny.org International Jack Benny Fan Club]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackbenny.org/biography/other/longest_laugh.htm |title=The Longest Laugh |publisher=Jackbenny.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that, at the close of the program broadcast on December 13, 1936, sponsored by [[gelatin dessert|Jell-O]], guest [[Andy Devine]] says that it is the "last number of the eleventh program in the new Jelly series." The audience, who loved any sort of accidental flub in the live program, is still laughing after 32 seconds, at which point the network cut off the program to prevent it from running overtime.

According to Benny himself, Mary Livingstone got the biggest laugh he ever heard on the show, on the April 25, 1948, broadcast. The punchline was the result of the following exchange between Don Wilson and noted opera singer [[Dorothy Kirsten]]:

:'''Don Wilson:''' Oh, Miss Kirsten, I wanted to tell you that I saw you in "[[Madame Butterfly]]" Wednesday afternoon, and I thought your performance was simply magnificent.
:'''Dorothy Kirsten:''' Well, thanks, awfully. It's awfully nice and kind of you, Mr. Wilson. But, uh, who could help singing [[Puccini]]? It's so expressive. And particularly in the last act, starting with the ''allegro vivacissimo''.
:'''Don Wilson:''' Well, now, that's being very modest, Miss Kirsten. But not every singer has the necessary ''bel canto'' and flexibility or range to cope with the high ''tessitura'' of the first act.
:'''Dorothy Kirsten:''' Thank you, Mr. Wilson. And don't you think that in the aria, "''Un bel dì vedremo''", that the strings played the ''con molto passione'' exceptionally fine and with great ''sostenuto''?
:'''Jack Benny:''' Well, I thought—
:'''Mary Livingstone (to Jack):''' Oh, shut up!

According to Benny, the huge laugh resulted from the long buildup, and the audience's knowledge that Benny, with his pompous persona, would have to break into the conversation at some point.

A nearly identical exchange occurred over a year earlier, among renowned violinist [[Isaac Stern]], actor [[Ronald Colman]], Jack Benny, and Mary Livingstone. The quartet's back-and-forth, which centered on Stern's recent public performance of a Mendelssohn piece, was heard on an episode first broadcast on February 16, 1947. The resulting laughter lasted some 18 seconds, after which Benny retorted, "Mary, that's no way to talk to Mr. Stern."

Later in life, while performing as a stand-up comedian in Las Vegas, Benny had just begun to tell an old joke about the salesman, the farmer, and the farmer's daughter: "So the salesman and the farmer's daughter come to the front door, and the farmer opens the door." At this point, [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] walks onstage behind Jack, the audience screams, and Davis proceeds to speak and sing and dance for about 25 minutes while Benny continues to stand at center stage, quietly watching the spectacle. When Davis finally walks offstage and the audience's applause dies down, Benny continues to watch Davis offstage for a few moments, then, as the audience is finally quiet, continues: "... So the farmer said—" And that's as far as that joke got, because the audience laughed for minutes afterward.

===The Benny-Allen feud===
In 1937, Benny began his famous radio feud with rival [[Fred Allen]]. Allen kicked the feud off on his own show on his December 30, 1936 show, after child violinist Stuart Canin gave a performance of [[François Schubert]]'s ''The Bee''&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|131}} credibly enough that Allen wisecracked about "a certain alleged violinist" who should by comparison be ashamed of himself. Benny, who listened to the Allen show answered in kind at the end of his January 3, 1937 show. And the two comedians were off and running.

For a decade, the two went at it back and forth, so convincingly that fans of either show could have been forgiven for believing they had become blood enemies. In reality, the two men were close friends and mutual admirers. Benny and Allen often appeared on each other's show during the ongoing feud; numerous surviving episodes of both comedians' radio shows feature each other, in both acknowledged guest spots and occasional cameos. On one Christmas program Allen thanked Benny for sending him a Christmas tree, but then added that the tree had died. "Well, what do you expect," quipped Allen, "when the tree is in Brooklyn and the sap is in Hollywood."

Benny, in his eventual memoir (''Sunday Nights at Seven'') and Allen in his ''Treadmill to Oblivion'' later revealed that each comedian's writing staff often met together to plot future takes on the mock feud. If Allen zapped Benny with a satirization of Benny's show ("The Pinch Penny Program"), Benny shot back with a parody of Allen's ''[[Town Hall Tonight]]'' called "''Clown'' Hall Tonight." And their playful sniping ("Benny was born ignorant, and he's been losing ground ever since") was also advanced in the films ''[[Love Thy Neighbor (1940 film)|Love Thy Neighbor]]'' and ''[[It's in the Bag!]]''.

Perhaps the climax of the feud came during Fred Allen's parody of popular quiz-and-prize show ''[[Queen for a Day]]'', which was barely a year old when Allen decided to have a crack at it on ''[[The Fred Allen Show]]''—an episode that has survived for today's listeners to appreciate. Calling the sketch "King for a Day", Allen played the host and Benny a contestant who sneaked onto the show using the alias Myron Proudfoot. Benny answered the prize-winning question correctly and Allen crowned him "king" and showered him with a passel of almost meaningless prizes. Allen proudly announced, "Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, where you will be the judge in a chicken-cleaning contest," to which Benny joyously declared, "I'm ''king'' for a day!" At this point a professional pressing-iron was wheeled on stage, to press Benny's suit properly. It didn't matter that Benny was still ''in'' the suit. Allen instructed his aides to remove Benny's suit, one item at a time, ending with his trousers, each garment's removal provoking louder laughter from the studio audience. As his trousers began to come off, Benny howled, "Allen, you haven't seen the ''end'' of me!" At once Allen shot back, "It won't be long ''now!''"

The laughter was so loud and chaotic at the chain of events that the Allen show announcer, [[Kenny Delmar]], was cut off the air while trying to read a final commercial and the show's credits. (Allen was notorious for running overtime often enough, largely thanks to his ad-libbing talent, and he overran the clock again this time.)

Benny was profoundly shaken by Allen's sudden death from a heart attack in 1956. In a statement released on the day after Allen's death, Benny said, "People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. My answer is always the same: You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it." Allen himself wrote, "For years people have been asking me if Jack and I are friendly. I don't think that Jack Benny has an enemy in the world.&amp;nbsp;... He is my favourite comedian and I hope to be his friend until he is forty. That will be forever."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Fred. ''Treadmill to Oblivion.''

===The CBS talent raid===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
On the advice of MCA's [[Lew Wasserman]], Jack Benny formed a holding company, "Amusement Enterprises" (a tax break major entertainers usually enjoyed in those years), which allowed him to bundle his entire program and personnel into a single commodity. The company also gave Benny the opportunity to produce and package other radio programs (including his 1947 summer replacement series starring [[Jack Paar]]), and invest in other entertainment ventures, including the production of a 1949 feature film, ''The Lucky Stiff'', starring [[Dorothy Lamour]], and the 1948 Broadway version of [[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]], starring [[Henry Fonda]]. While Benny was top of the heap on NBC, [[CBS]] czar [[William S. Paley]] cast a hungry eye upon the comedian. Paley apparently had good reason to believe Benny could be had. In the summer of 1948, he successfully negotiated a deal with [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]], buying ''their'' holding company, which owned the [[Amos 'n' Andy]] radio show (and the rights to those characters), moving the entire "package" from NBC to CBS that fall: he then learned that NBC balked at buying a "Jack Benny" package deal when "Jack Benny" was not the star's real name. Paley reached out to Benny and offered him a deal that would allow that package-buy.

But Paley, according to CBS historian Robert Metz, also learned that Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, under the leadership of [[David Sarnoff]], seemed at the time to think that listeners were listening to NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, according to Metz, that was foolish thinking at best: Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley said as much to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably [[Burns and Allen]], [[Edgar Bergen]], [[Red Skelton]] and [[Kate Smith]]) to join him.

To sweeten the deal for a very nervous sponsor, Paley also agreed to make up the difference to American Tobacco if Benny's [[C. E. Hooper|Hooper rating]] (the radio version of today's [[Nielsen ratings]]) on CBS fell to a certain level below his best NBC Hooper rating. Benny's CBS debut on January 2, 1949 bested his top NBC rating by several points while also pumping up the ratings of the show that followed, ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''. NBC, with its smash Sunday night lineup now broken up, offered lucrative new deals to two of those Sunday night hits, ''The Fred Allen Show'' and ''[[The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show]]''. Benny's bandleader and his singing actress wife now starred in their own hit sitcom, meaning Harris was featured on shows for two different networks.

Benny and Sarnoff eventually met several years later and became good friends. Benny later observed that if he'd had this kind of relationship with Sarnoff earlier, when he was Sarnoff's number-one radio star, he never would have left NBC.

==Television==
{{Main|The Jack Benny Program}}
[[File:Benny and livingstone 1960 cbs.JPG|thumb|230px|Jack Benny and Mary Livingstone, 1960]]

After making his television debut in 1949 on local Los Angeles station [[KTTV]],&lt;ref&gt;April 4, 1949 Life Magazine article "Benny Tries TV", with photo and review&lt;/ref&gt; then a [[CBS]] affiliate, the network television version of ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' ran from October 28, 1950, to 1965, all but the last season on [[CBS]].  Initially scheduled as a series of five "specials" during the 1950–1951 season, the show appeared every six weeks for the 1951–1952 season, every four weeks for the 1952–1953 season and every three weeks in 1953–1954. For the 1953–1954 season, half the episodes were live and half were filmed during the summer, to allow Benny to continue doing his radio show. From the fall of 1954 to 1960, it appeared every other week, and from 1960 to 1965 it was seen weekly.

On March 28, 1954, Benny co-hosted ''[[General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'' with [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Mary Martin]]. In September 1954, CBS premiered Chrysler's ''[[Shower of Stars]]'' co-hosted by Jack Benny and [[William Lundigan]]. It enjoyed a successful run from 1954 until 1958. Both television shows often overlapped the radio show. In fact, the radio show alluded frequently to its television counterparts. Often as not, Benny would sign off the radio show in such circumstances with the line "Well, good night, folks. I'll see you on television."

When Benny moved to television, audiences learned that his verbal talent was matched by his controlled repertory of dead-pan facial expressions and gesture. The program was similar to the radio show (several of the radio scripts were recycled for television, as was somewhat common with other radio shows that moved to television), but with the addition of visual gags. [[Lucky Strike]] was the sponsor. Benny did his opening and closing monologues before a live audience, which he regarded as essential to timing of the material. As in other TV comedy shows, a [[laugh track]] was added to "sweeten" the soundtrack, as when the studio audience missed some close-up comedy because of cameras or microphones obstructing their view. Television viewers became accustomed to live without Mary Livingstone, who was afflicted by a striking case of stage fright. Livingstone appeared rarely if at all on the television show.  In fact, for the last few years of the radio show, she pre-recorded her lines and Jack and Mary's daughter, Joan, stood in for the live taping, with Mary's lines later edited into the tape replacing Joan's before broadcast.  Mary Livingstone finally retired from show business permanently in 1958, as her friend [[Gracie Allen]] had done.

Benny's television program relied more on guest stars and less on his regulars than his radio program. In fact, the only radio cast members who appeared regularly on the television program as well were Don Wilson and Eddie Anderson. Day appeared sporadically, and Harris had left the radio program in 1952, although he did make a guest appearance on the television show ([[Bob Crosby]], Phil's "replacement", frequently appeared on television through 1956). A frequent guest was the Canadian-born singer-violinist [[Gisele Mackenzie]].

As a gag, Benny made a 1957 appearance on the then-wildly popular ''[[The $64,000 Question|$64,000 Question]]''.  His category of choice was "Violins", but after answering the first question correctly Benny opted out of continuing, leaving the show with just $64; host [[Hal March]] gave Benny the prize money out of his own pocket.  March made an appearance on Benny's show the same year.

Benny was able to attract guests who rarely, if ever, appeared on television. In 1953, both [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]] made their television debuts on Benny's program.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Ed &amp; David Fisher. ''When Television Was Young: Live, Spontaneous, and In Living Black and White.'' Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 2007. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Christine. ''It's the Pictures That Got Small: Hollywood Film Stars in 1950s Television.'' Middletown, CT: Wesleyan UP, 2008. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Another guest star on the Jack Benny show was [[Rod Serling]] who starred in a spoof of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' in which Benny goes to his own house..and finds that no one knows who he is!

[[Canadians|Canadian]] singer [[Gisele MacKenzie]], who toured with Benny in the early 1950s, guest starred seven times on ''The Jack Benny Program''. Benny was so impressed with MacKenzie's talents that he served as co-[[executive producer]] and guest starred on her 1957–1958 NBC variety show, ''[[The Gisele MacKenzie Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tv.nytimes.com/show/155939/Gisele-MacKenzie-Show/overview |title=Gisele MacKenzie Show |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=May 15, 2009 | first=Alessandra | last=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[Walt Disney]] was a guest, primarily to promote his production of ''[[Mary Poppins]]''. Benny persuaded Disney to give him over 110 free admission tickets to [[Disneyland]] for his friends and one for his wife, but later in the show Disney apparently sent his pet tiger after Benny as revenge, at which point Benny opened his umbrella and soared above the stage like Mary Poppins.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{YouTube|XLdcUNTCmq8}} Jack ends TV episode as Mary Poppins&lt;/ref&gt;

In due course the ratings game finally got to Benny, too. [[CBS]] dropped the show in 1964, citing Benny's lack of appeal to the younger demographic the network began courting, and he went to [[NBC]], his original network, in the fall, only to be out-rated by CBS's ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' The network dropped Benny at the end of the season. He continued to make occasional specials into the 1970s, the last one airing in January 1974.

In his unpublished autobiography, ''I Always Had Shoes'' (portions of which were later incorporated by Jack's daughter, Joan Benny, into her memoir of her parents, ''Sunday Nights at Seven''), Benny said that he, not NBC, made the decision to end his TV series in 1965. He said that while the ratings were still very good (he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week, although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing, no matter what they promised), advertisers were complaining that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much as what they paid for most other shows, and he had grown tired of what was called the "rate race". Thus, after some three decades on radio and television in a weekly program, Jack Benny went out on top. In fairness, Benny himself shared Fred Allen's ambivalence about television, though not quite to Allen's extent. "By my second year in television, I saw that the camera was a man-eating monster&amp;nbsp;... It gave a performer close-up exposure that, week after week, threatened his existence as an interesting entertainer."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|279}}

In a joint appearance with [[Phil Silvers]] on [[Dick Cavett]]'s show, Benny recalled that he had advised Silvers not to appear on television. However, Silvers ignored Benny's advice and proceeded to win several [[Emmy]] awards as [[Sergeant Bilko]] on the popular series ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', while Benny claimed he never won any of the television honors.

==Films==
[[File:Jack and Joan Benny Jack Benny Show 1954.jpg|thumb|Jack Benny and daughter Joan on the set of his TV show, 1954]]
Benny also acted in films, including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'', ''[[Broadway Melody of 1936]]'' (as a benign nemesis for [[Eleanor Powell]] and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]), ''[[George Washington Slept Here]]'' (1942), and notably, ''[[Charley's Aunt (1941 film)|Charley's Aunt]]'' (1941) and ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' (1942). He and Livingstone also appeared in [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''[[Mr. Broadway (1933 film)|Mr. Broadway]]'' (1933) as themselves. Benny often parodied contemporary movies and movie genres on the radio program, and the 1940 film ''[[Buck Benny Rides Again]]'' features all the main radio characters in a funny Western parody adapted from program skits. The failure of one Benny vehicle, ''[[The Horn Blows at Midnight]]'', became a running gag on his radio and television programs, although contemporary viewers may not find the film as disappointing as the jokes suggest.

Benny may have had an unbilled cameo role in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', claimed by a contemporary newspaper article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jack Benny Sneaked into 'Casablanca' Scene|work=Milwaukee Sentinel|date=28 January 1943|author=Herzog, Buck|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19430128&amp;id=Z1NQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Nw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6943%2C1287647|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advertisement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Special Contest / Find Jack Benny in "Casablanca" |author= |newspaper=The Evening Independent |date=February 4, 1943 |url=http://media.sdreader.com/img/photos/2014/10/19/92953_original_t670.jpg?b3f6a5d7692ccc373d56e40cf708e3fa67d9af9d|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reportedly in the ''Casablanca'' press book. When asked in his column "Movie Answer Man", movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] first replied, "It looks something like him. That's all I can say."&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/was-the-pres-crushed-and-drowned-before-or-after-the-arks |title=Movie Answer Man |author=Roger Ebert |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 28, 2014}} [[RogerEbert.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in a later column, "I think you're right."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/what-color-were-zuzus-petals-in-its-a-wonderful-life-easy |title=Movie Answer Man |author=Roger Ebert |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 28, 2014}} RogerEbert.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Benny also was caricatured in several [[Warner Brothers]] cartoons including ''[[Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur]]'' (1939, as Casper the Caveman), ''[[I Love to Singa]]'', ''Slap Happy Pappy'', and ''Goofy Groceries'' (1936, 1940, and 1941 respectively, as Jack Bunny&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=I Love to Singa
| publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2010-12-20
| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akAEIW3rmvQ#t=04m24s}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''Malibu Beach Party'' (1940, as himself),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| title=Malibu Beach Party |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH6AWh64lOc | date=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Mouse that Jack Built]]'' (1959). The last of these is probably the most memorable: [[Robert McKimson]] engaged Benny and his actual cast (Mary Livingstone, Eddie Anderson, and Don Wilson) to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters, with Mel Blanc—the usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeister—reprising his old vocal turn as the always-aging Maxwell, always a ''phat''-phat-''bang!'' away from collapse. In the cartoon, Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit-Kat Club, which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat. Before the cat can devour the mice, Benny himself awakens from his dream, then shakes his head, smiles wryly, and mutters, "Imagine, me and Mary as little mice." Then, he glances toward the cat lying on a throw rug in a corner and sees his and Livingstone's cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat's mouth. The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement. It was rumored that Benny requested that, in lieu of monetary compensation, he receive a copy of the finished film.

Benny made a cameo appearance in ''[[It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''.  When some of the characters are arguing at the side of the road, Benny pulls up in his car and considerately asks, "Trouble?  Having any trouble?", to which the character played by Ethel Merman yells, "Yes, and we don't need any help from you!"  Benny does a take with his smile slowly fading and mutters, "Well!", and drives off.

==Running gags==
[[File:Jack Benny rehearsal.jpg|thumb|'''Jack Benny''' rehearses with members of the California Junior Symphony Orchestra, 1959.]]
Benny teamed with Fred Allen for the best-remembered running gag in classic radio history, in terms of character dialogue. But Benny alone sustained a classic repertoire of running gags in his own right, including his skinflint radio and television persona; regular cast members' and guest stars' reference to his "baby blue" eyes, always sure to elicit a self-satisfied smirk or patently false attempt at modesty from Benny; perpetually giving his age as 39; and ineptitude at violin playing, most frequently demonstrated by futile attempts to perform [[Rodolphe Kreutzer]]'s   [[42 études ou caprices|Étude No. 2 in C major]]. In fact, Benny was a fairly good violinist who achieved the illusion of a bad one, not by deliberately playing poorly, but by striving to play pieces that were too difficult for his skill level. In one of his show's skits, Benny is a USO performer in the Pacific when playing his violin when he comes under fire; Benny still plays his violin when two Japanese surrender to him–all the other enemy soldiers committed suicide rather than endure listening to Benny's terrible music!

A skit heard numerous times on radio, and seen many times on television, had Mel Blanc as a Mexican in a [[sombrero]] and [[serape]] sitting on a bench. Jack Benny sits down and begins a conversation. To each question asked by Benny, Blanc replies '''Sí'''. When Benny asks his name, Blanc replies '''Sy''', which would prompt the exchange, '''Sy?''', '''Sí.''' And when Benny asks where Blanc is going, Blanc replies, "to see his sister", '''Sue''' ('''Sue?''', '''Sí.'''), who of course '''sews''' for a living ('''Sew?''', '''Sí.''').

A running gag in Benny's private life concerned [[George Burns]]. To Benny's eternal frustration, he could never get Burns to laugh. Burns, on the other hand, could crack Benny up with the least effort. An example of this occurred at a party when Benny pulled out a match to light a cigar. Burns announced to all, "Jack Benny will now perform the famous match trick!" Benny had no idea what Burns was talking about, so he proceeded to light up. Burns observed, "Oh, a new ending!" and Benny collapsed in helpless laughter.

Benny even had a sound-based running gag of his own: his famous basement vault alarm, allegedly installed by [[Spike Jones]], ringing off with a shattering cacophony of whistles, sirens, bells, and blasts, before ending invariably with the sound of a foghorn. The alarm rang off even when Benny opened his safe with the correct combination. The vault also featured a guard named Ed (voiced by [[Joseph Kearns]]) who had been on post down below before, apparently, the end of the Civil War, the end of the Revolutionary War, the founding of Los Angeles, on Jack's 38th birthday, and even the beginning of humanity. In one appearance, Ed asked Benny, "By the way, Mr. Benny ... what's it like on the outside?" Benny responded, "... winter is nearly here, and the leaves are falling." Ed responded, "Hey, that must be exciting," to which Benny replied (in a stunningly risqué joke for the period), "Oh, no—people are wearing clothes now." In one episode of the Benny radio show, Ed the Guard actually agreed when Jack invited him to take a break and come back to the surface world, only to discover that modern conveniences and transportation, which hadn't been around the last time he'd been to the surface, terrorized and confused him. (Poor Ed thought a crosstown bus was "a red and yellow dragon".) Finally, Ed decides to return to his post fathoms below and stay there. The basement vault gag was also used in the cartoon ''[[The Mouse that Jack Built]]'' and an episode&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0637413/ Lucy Gets Jack Benny's Account (1967)]&lt;/ref&gt; of ''[[The Lucy Show]]''.

A separate sound gag involved a song Benny had written, "When You Say I Beg Your Pardon, Then I'll Come Back to You". Its inane lyrics and insipid melody guaranteed that it would never be published or recorded, but Benny continued to try to con, extort, or otherwise inveigle some of his musical guests (including [[The Smothers Brothers]] and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]) to perform it. None ever made it all the way through.

In keeping with his "stingy" [[schtick]], on one of his television specials he remarked that, to his way of looking at things, a "special" is when the price of coffee is marked down.

Another popular running gag concerned the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently portrayed as a bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by [[Phil Harris]] and later by [[Bob Crosby]], the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being too drunk to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that the sight of a glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4&amp;nbsp;am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.

One Christmas program had Crosby agonizing over what to get Remley:

Benny: "Well, why don't you get him a cordial; like a bottle of Drambuie?"
Crosby: "That's a nice thought, Jack, but Drambuie's an after-dinner drink."
Benny: "So?"
Crosby: "So Remley never quite makes it 'til after dinner."

Crosby also got consistent laughs by frequently joking about his more famous brother [[Bing Crosby]]'s vast wealth.

===The Maxwell===
[[File:TrumanBennyMaxwell.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Jack Benny shakes hands with [[Harry S. Truman]] from the seat of a c. 1908 Maxwell Roadster]]Starting with the October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly announced the purchase of his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old [[Maxwell automobile]], a brand that went out of business in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few more miles out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car's clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Mott |title=Radio Sound Effects: Who Did It, and How, in the Era of Live Broadcasting |year=1993 |isbn=0-7864-2266-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0N6rmCG6WIC&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;f=false |page=122 |accessdate=2016-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, [[Mel Blanc]] quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.

The ongoing saga of the Maxwell was initially interrupted after just five years, when on the October 18, 1942 broadcast Jack took his car to a local junkyard and contributed it to the [[World War II]] junk salvage drive, receiving $7.50 in [[war bond#United States|war stamps]] in exchange. However much of the radio audience may have remained unaware that the Maxwell was ever gone, because before long Jack was heard traveling around in a decrepit old car again, and by the end of the 1940s his car would once more be specifically identified as a Maxwell.

When the ''Jack Benny Program'' began appearing on television in 1950, a 1916 Maxwell Model 25 [[Touring car|Tourer]] became one of the production's standard props. Benny's Maxwell later became a 1923 Tourer. In addition to its being on the program, Benny would often make public appearances in Maxwells. He drove a Maxwell onto the stage in one of his last television specials.

By 1941, Jack Benny's Maxwell had become such a well-known aspect of popular culture that it was referenced in the Billy Mills song "I'm in Love with the Sound Effects Man" as heard on the June 17, 1941 ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' radio show (and later performed on a 1943 recording by [[Spike Jones]]). The automobile was also featured in the 1943 Benny film ''[[The Meanest Man in the World]]''. Benny and his archaic auto were featured in a series of television and print ads for [[Texaco]] from the 1950s through the 1970s. A series of gags were built around the premise that Benny appreciated the value of Sky Chief brand gasoline in keeping his car running smoothly, but was too cheap to buy more than one gallon at a time. In the classic cartoon "[[The Mouse that Jack Built]]", Jack has himself and Mary driven by Rochester in a sputtering Maxwell car.

Many people believe that Benny appears behind the wheel of his Maxwell in the 1963 film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', but in fact it was a 1932 Cadillac.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imcdb.org/vehicle_61025-Cadillac-4535-1931.html 1931 Cadillac Fleetwood Convertible Coupe [4535&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The long shots for the scene were shot months before Benny was cast—with a stunt driver at the wheel—and the role was intended for [[Stan Laurel]] (which is why the character wears a derby, which Jack almost never did). When Laurel ultimately passed on appearing, Jack agreed to play it. According to the commentary on the Criterion edition of the film, his close-ups were filmed on a rear-projection stage at the Paramount studio.

==Final years==
[[File:Jack benny special january 1974.JPG|thumb|150px|A mod Benny from his January 1974 special.]]

After his broadcasting career ended, Benny performed live as a stand up comedian and returned to films in 1963 with a cameo appearance in ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''.

Benny made one of his final television appearances July 20, 1973 on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]].''&lt;ref&gt;"Johnny Carson Show," 20 July 1973, broadcast on Antenna TV.&lt;/ref&gt;
Benny was preparing to star in the film version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1975 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' when his health failed in 1974. In fact, he prevailed upon his longtime best friend, [[George Burns]], to take his place on a nightclub tour while preparing for the film.  Burns ultimately had to replace Benny in the film as well and went on to win an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his performance.

Despite his failing health, Benny made several appearances on ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' in his final eighteen months, roasting [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Johnny Carson]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Lucille Ball]], in addition to himself being roasted in February 1974. His roasting of Lucille Ball was his last public performance, and aired on February 7, 1975, several weeks after his death.

==Death==
[[File:Jack Benny Grave.JPG|thumb|200px|Tomb of Jack Benny, at Hillside Memorial Park]]

In October 1974, Benny cancelled a performance in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] after suffering a dizzy spell, coupled with numbness in his arms. Despite a battery of tests, Benny's ailment could not be determined. When he complained of stomach pains in early December, a first test showed nothing, but a subsequent one showed he had inoperable [[pancreatic cancer]]. Benny went into a coma at home on December 22, 1974.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|293–294}} While in a coma, he was visited by close friends including [[George Burns]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Johnny Carson]] and [[John Rowles]]. He died on December 26, 1974 at age 80. At the funeral George Burns, Benny's best friend for more than fifty years, attempted to deliver a eulogy but broke down shortly after he began and was unable to continue. Bob Hope also delivered a eulogy in which he stated, "For a man who was the undisputed master of comedy timing, you would have to say this is the only time when Jack Benny's timing was all wrong. He left us much too soon."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNRptoRrpBk Jack Benny's Funeral at Hillside Memorial Park] YouTube. Retrieved 1 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in a crypt at [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=OPRKEpwjfLQC&amp;pg=PA362&amp;dq=jack+benny+hillside+memorial&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifzKSQ1__dAhXgHDQIHW-9AngQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=jack%20benny%20hillside%20memorial&amp;f=false ''Hollywood: The Movie Lover's Guide'']&lt;/ref&gt; Benny's will arranged for a single long-stemmed red [[rose]], to be delivered to his widow, Mary Livingstone, every day for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/glurge/jackbenny.asp Posthumous Roses] snopes.com. Retrieved 1 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Livingstone died nine years later on June 30, 1983.

In trying to explain his successful life, Benny summed it up by stating: "Everything good that happened to me happened by accident. I was not filled with ambition nor fired by a drive toward a clear-cut goal. I never knew exactly where I was going."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|301}}

Upon his death, his family donated to [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|UCLA]] his personal, professional, and business papers, as well as a collection of his television shows. The university established the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television#Jack Benny Award for Comedy|Jack Benny Award]] in his honor in 1977 to recognize outstanding people in the field of comedy. [[Johnny Carson]] was the first award recipient.&lt;ref&gt;Brent Lang, [http://www.thewrap.com/article/apatow-recieves-jack-benny-award-17560 Apatow to Receive Jack Benny Award], ''TheWrap.com'', Map 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Benny also donated a [[Stradivarius]] violin (purchased in 1957) to the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qKwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pPoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5498,7923419&amp;dq=benny+stradivarius+philharmonic&amp;hl=en|title=Benny's Violins Given to Philharmonic|work=Lakeland Ledger|date=29 October 1975|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watkins|first=Nancy|title=Now cut that out!|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 13, 2005|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-02-13/features/0502130456_1_jack-benny-vendetta-benny-kubelsky|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benny had commented, "If it isn't a $30,000 Strad, I'm out $120."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7chOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kEkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4277,2931739&amp;dq=benny+stradivarius&amp;hl=en|title=Sour Note -- Before He Plays|work=The Deseret News|date=13 November 1964|author=Lundstrom, Harold|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In 1960, Benny was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] with three stars.

==Posthumous tributes==
When the price of a standard first-class U.S. postal stamp was increased to 39 cents in 2006, fans petitioned for a Jack Benny stamp to honor his stage persona's perpetual age. The U.S. Postal Service had issued a stamp depicting Jack Benny in 1991, as part of a booklet of stamps honoring comedians; however, the stamp was issued at the then-current rate of 29 cents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usapostagestamps.com/2019/29c+Jack+Benny.+Comedians+Issue+1991/ Jack Benny Postage Stamp] Stamp Title:

'''Rose Joan Blondell''' (August 30, 1906 – December 25, 1979) was an American actress&lt;ref&gt;Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', December 26, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; who performed in movies and on television for half a century. She began her career in [[vaudeville]].

After winning a beauty pageant, Blondell embarked upon a film career. Establishing herself as a sexy, wisecracking blonde, she was a [[Pre-Code Hollywood|pre-Code]] staple of [[Warner Bros.]] pictures, and appeared in more than 100 movies and television productions. She was most active in films during the 1930s, and during this time, she co-starred with [[Glenda Farrell]] in nine films, in which the duo portrayed [[wikt:gold digger|gold diggers]]. Blondell continued acting in major film roles for the rest of her life, often in small character roles or supporting television roles. She was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her work in ''[[The Blue Veil (1951 film)|The Blue Veil]]'' (1951).

Near the end of her life, Blondell was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in [[John Cassavetes]]'s ''[[Opening Night (1977 film)|Opening Night]]'' (1977). She featured in roles in two more films — ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Champ (1979 film)|The Champ]]'' (1979) — released shortly before her death from [[leukemia]].

Around 1927, she returned to New York, worked as a fashion [[Model (person)|model]], a circus hand, a clerk in a store, joined a stock company to become an actress, and performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. In 1930, she starred with [[James Cagney]] in ''Penny Arcade'' on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB name|32322}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Penny Arcade'' lasted only three weeks, but [[Al Jolson]] saw it and bought the rights to the play for $20,000. He then sold the rights to [[Warner Bros.]] with the proviso that Blondell and Cagney be cast in the film version. Placed under contract by Warner Bros., she moved to Hollywood, where studio boss [[Jack L. Warner]] wanted her to change her name to "Inez Holmes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy|first=Matthew|date= 2007|title=Joan Blondell, a life between takes|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Blondell refused. She began to appear in short subjects, and was named as one of the [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]] in 1931.

Blondell was paired with James Cagney in such films as ''[[Sinners' Holiday]]'' (1930) – the film version of ''Penny Arcade'' – and ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (1931), and was one-half of a gold-digging duo with Glenda Farrell in nine films. During the [[Great Depression]], Blondell was one of the highest-paid individuals in the United States. Her stirring rendition of "Remember My Forgotten Man" in the [[Busby Berkeley]] production of ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'', in which she co-starred with [[Dick Powell]] and [[Ruby Keeler]], became an anthem for the frustrations of the unemployed and the government's failed economic policies. In 1937, she starred opposite [[Errol Flynn]] in ''[[The Perfect Specimen]]''. By the end of the decade, she had made nearly 50 films. She left Warner Bros. in 1939.

In 1943, Blondell returned to Broadway as the star of Mike Todd's short-lived production of ''The Naked Genius'', a comedy written by [[Gypsy Rose Lee]].&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt; She was well received in her later films, despite being relegated to character and supporting roles after 1945, when she was billed below the title for the first time in 14 years in ''[[Adventure (1945 film)|Adventure]]'', which starred [[Clark Gable]] and [[Greer Garson]]. She was also featured prominently in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945) and ''[[Nightmare Alley (1947 film)|Nightmare Alley]]'' (1947). In 1948, she left the screen for three years and concentrated on theatre, performing in summer stock and touring with [[Cole Porter]]'s musical, ''[[Something for the Boys]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt; She later reprised her role of Aunt Sissy in the musical version of ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' for the national tour, starred opposite [[Tallulah Bankhead]] in the play ''[[Crazy October]]'' (which closed on the road) and played the nagging mother, Mae Peterson, in the national tour of ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''.

Blondell returned to Hollywood in 1950. Her performance in her next film, ''[[The Blue Veil (1951 film)|The Blue Veil]]'' (1951), earned her an [[24th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]].&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt; She played supporting roles in ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'' (1956), ''[[Desk Set]]'' (1957), and ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' (1957). She received considerable acclaim for her performance as Lady Fingers in [[Norman Jewison]]'s ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' (1965), garnering a [[Golden Globe]] nomination and [[National Board of Review]] win for Best Supporting Actress. [[John Cassavetes]] cast her as a cynical, aging playwright in his film ''[[Opening Night (1977 film)|Opening Night]]'' (1977). Blondell was widely seen in two films released not long before her death, ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) and the remake of ''[[The Champ (1979 film)|The Champ]]'' (1979) with [[Jon Voight]] and [[Rick Schroder]].  She also appeared in two films released after her death, ''[[The Glove (film)|The Glove]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Woman Inside]]'' (1981).

Blondell also guest-starred in various television programs, including three 1963 episodes as the character Aunt Win in the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', starring [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Richard Crenna]].  She appeared in a 1964 episode ("What's in the Box?") of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''. She guest-starred in the episode "You're All Right, Ivy" of [[Jack Palance]]'s circus drama, ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the 1963–64 television season. Her co-stars in the segment were [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] and [[Buster Keaton]]. In 1965, she was in the running to replace [[Vivian Vance]] as Lucille Ball's sidekick on the hit CBS television comedy series ''[[The Lucy Show]]''. Unfortunately, after filming her second guest appearance as Joan Brenner (Lucy's new friend from California), Blondell walked off the set right after the episode had completed filming when Ball humiliated her by harshly criticizing her performance in front of the studio audience and technicians.

Blondell continued working on television. In 1968, she guest-starred on the CBS sitcom ''[[Family Affair]]'', starring [[Brian Keith]]. She also replaced [[Bea Benaderet]], who was ill, for one episode on the CBS  series ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''. In that installment, Blondell played FloraBelle Campbell, a lady visitor to [[Hooterville]], who had once dated Uncle Joe ([[Edgar Buchanan]]) and Sam Drucker ([[Frank Cady]]). That same year, Blondell co-starred in all 52 episodes of the ABC [[Western (genre)|Western]] series ''[[Here Come the Brides]]'', set in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the 19th century. Her co-stars included singer [[Bobby Sherman]] and actor-singer [[David Soul]]. Blondell received two consecutive Emmy nominations for outstanding continued performance by an actress in a dramatic series for her role as Lottie Hatfield.

In 1971, she followed [[Sada Thompson]] in the off-Broadway hit ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]'', with a young [[Swoosie Kurtz]] playing one of daughters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lortel.org/Archives/CreditableEntity/23741&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Wayne - Joan Blondell - 1942.jpg|thumb|[[John Wayne]] and Blondell, in ''[[Lady for a Night]]'' (1942)]]
In 1972, she had an ongoing supporting role in the NBC series ''[[Banyon]]'' as Peggy Revere, who operated a secretarial school in the same building as Banyon's detective agency. This was a 1930s period action drama starring [[Robert Forster]] in the titular role. Her students worked in Banyon's office, providing fresh faces for the show weekly. The series was replaced midseason.

In 1974, Blondell played the wife of [[Tom D'Andrea]]'s character in the television film, ''Bobby Parker and Company'', with [[Ted Bessell]] in the starring role as the son of Blondell and D'Andrea. Coincidentally, D'Andrea had earlier played Jim Gillis, the television husband of Blondell's younger sister, [[Gloria Blondell]], in the NBC sitcom ''[[The Life of Riley]]''.

Blondell has a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for her contributions to the film industry. Her star is located at 6311 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/joan-blondell |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame - Joan Blondell |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |accessdate=November 21, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201050654/http://www.walkoffame.com/joan-blondell |archivedate=December 1, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City mounted a retrospective of Blondell's films in connection with a new biography by film professor [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] and theatrical revival houses such as [[Film Forum]] in [[Manhattan]] have also projected many of her films recently.

She wrote a novel titled ''Center Door Fancy'' (New York: [[Delacorte Press]], 1972), which was a thinly disguised autobiography with veiled references to June Allyson and Dick Powell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy|first=Matthew|date= 2007|title=Joan Blondell, a life between takes|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Joan-Blondell-Children-1944.jpg|left|thumb|Joan Blondell, with daughter Ellen Powell and son [[Norman Powell (television executive)|Norman S. Powell]] (1944)]]
Blondell was married three times, first to [[cinematographer]] [[George Barnes (cinematographer)|George Barnes]] in a private wedding ceremony on January 4, 1933, at the First Presbyterian Church in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. They had one child — [[Norman Powell (television executive)|Norman Scott Barnes]], who became an accomplished producer, director, and television executive — and divorced in 1936.

On September 19, 1936, she married her second husband, actor, [[film director|director]], and singer [[Dick Powell]]. They had a daughter, Ellen Powell, who became a studio hair stylist, and Powell adopted her son by her previous marriage under the name Norman Scott Powell. Blondell and Powell were divorced on July 14, 1944. Blondell was less than friendly with Powell's next wife, [[June Allyson]], although the two women would later appear together in ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'' (1956).

[[File:Joan Blondell Grave.JPG|thumb|Niche of Joan Blondell at Forest Lawn Glendale.]]
On July 5, 1947, Blondell married her third husband, [[Film producer|producer]] [[Mike Todd]], whom she divorced in 1950. Her marriage to Todd was an emotional and financial disaster. She once accused him of holding her outside a hotel window by her ankles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Matthew | last=Kennedy | title=Joan Blondell: A Life Between Takes | publisher=University Press of Mississippi | year=1993| isbn=9781628461817}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a heavy spender who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars gambling (high-stakes [[contract bridge|bridge]] was one of his weaknesses) and went through a controversial [[bankruptcy]] during their marriage. An often-repeated myth is that Mike Todd "dumped" Joan Blondell for [[Elizabeth Taylor]], when in fact, Blondell left Todd of her own accord years before he met Taylor.

Blondell was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfHXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q=Joan+Blondell | title=When Hollywood Was Right: How Movie Stars, Studio Moguls, and Big Business Remade American Politics | first=Donald T. | last=Critchlow | date=21 October 2013 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | accessdate=5 May 2018 | via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Blondell died of [[leukemia]] in [[Santa Monica, California]], on Christmas Day, 1979, with her children and her sister at her bedside.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"/&gt; She is interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOHgDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Joan%20Blondell%20burial%20site%20scott%20wilson | title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons | first=Scott | last=Wilson | edition=3rd | publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. | location=Jefferson, North Carolina | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-7864-7992-4 | page=69 | accessdate=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katz Broadcasting, LLC''', is an [[United States|American]] specialized [[digital subchannel|digital multicasting]] network [[media company]] and a subsidiary of [[E. W. Scripps Company]]. The company owns (as of 2017) four [[television network]]s that each carry programming with specified formats targeted at individual demographics. 

Originally, Katz sold the network to affiliated TV stations via ad split, but by October 2015, had moved to carriage fees in exchange for the network getting the ad inventory due to greater inventory with stations adding a third or fourth subchannel.&lt;ref name=tnc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jessell|first1=Harry A.|title=OTA The Bedrock of Katz's Growing Diginets |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/89135/ota-the-bedrock-of-katzs-growing-diginets/page/1|accessdate=October 15, 2015|work=TVNewsCheck|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:1&lt;/sup&gt; Their networks used direct response advertising as a meter of viewers before switching to [[Nielsen ratings#Commercial ratings|Neilsen rating C-3]].&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:3&lt;/sup&gt;

==History==

Katz Broadcasting, LLC was founded on February 3, 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Katz Broadcasting, LLC Control Number: 14012024|url=https://cgov.sos.state.ga.us/Account.aspx/ViewEntityData?entityId=4828497|website=state.ga.us|publisher=Georgia Secretary of State|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Jonathan Katz, who serves as [[chief operating officer]] of [[Bounce TV]] and formerly served as an executive at the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]. The company was announced concurrently with the announced launches of its first two networks, [[Escape (TV network)|Escape]] and [[Grit (TV network)|Grit]], which were both launched that April with [[Univision]] and [[UniMás]] [[owned-and-operated station]]s run by [[Univision Communications]] serving as its charter station group; both of Katz's initial networks are targeted at individual [[gender]]s (with Grit aimed at men and Escape aimed at women).&lt;ref name=bc/&gt; Besides Jonathan Katz, some of the initial investors included some Bounce investors notably [[Raycom Media]] and Al Haymon.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt; At some point, [[E. W. Scripps Company]] also becomes an owner purchasing 5% of the company.&lt;ref name=bc1/&gt;

Katz and [[Bounce TV|Bounce Media]] share staff from the former company's launch, including Jonathan Katz (who serves as president and [[chief executive officer]] of Katz, while continuing to serve as [[chief operating officer]]) and Jeffrey Wolf (Katz's chief distribution officer and Bounce's [[executive vice president]] of network distribution).&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Bounce TV Exec Plans Two New Channels |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/exclusive-bounce-tv-exec-plans-two-new-channels/130235|author=Jon Lafayette |periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=April 3, 2014|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|title=Longtime PR Executive Joins Katz Broadcasting, Bounce Network|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/longtime-pr-executive-joins-katz-724020|author=Kaitlyn Durocher|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Guggenheim Digital Media]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katz and Bounce continued to share executive staff with the hiring announcement of Jim Weiss (a former executive at sports marketing agency CSE) as the former's senior vice president of corporate communications in August.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

On January 18, 2015, Katz Broadcasting announced the launch of its third specialty network, [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]], a comedy-focused network that was tapped for an April 15 debut with [[ABC Owned Television Stations]] and the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] serving as its core charter affiliate groups.&lt;ref name=bc0&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Comedy Multicast Net Launching on ABC, Scripps|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/exclusive-comedy-multicast-net-launching-abc-scripps/137199|author=Jon Lafayette|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=January 18, 2015|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 24, 2015, Katz signed a multi-network agreement with the [[Meredith Corporation]] that would add all three Katz-owned networks to Meredith-owned stations in five markets, boosting Laff's national coverage to 50%, Escape's to 58%, and Grit's to 78% of all U.S. television markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meredith To Carry Grit, Escape, LAFF Networks|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/meredith-carry-grit-escape-laff-networks/138986|author=Jon Lafayette|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=March 20, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Escape and Grit switched from direct response advertising as a meter of viewers  to [[Nielsen ratings#Commercial ratings|Neilsen rating C-3]] late 2015 with Laff expected to follow suit.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:3&lt;/sup&gt;

On June 15, 2016, Katz Broadcasting signed a multi-network agreement with [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]] and operated affiliated TV station companies that would bring all three Katz-owned networks (as well as Bounce TV) to stations owned and/or operated by Nexstar in 54 markets, jumping national coverage of both Escape and Laff to 85% and Grit's coverage to 93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bounce TV, Grit, Escape, Laff Multicast Deal Covers 81 Stations, 54 Markets|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/bounce-tv-grit-escape-laff-multicast-deal-covers-81-stations-54-markets/157330|author=Jon Lafayette|periodical=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=June 15, 2016|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Knock on Wood''''' is a 1954 comedy starring [[Danny Kaye]] and [[Mai Zetterling]].  Other actors in the film include [[Torin Thatcher]], [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], and [[Leon Askin]].  The film was written and directed by [[Melvin Frank]] and [[Norman Panama]], with songs by Kaye's wife, [[Sylvia Fine]].

==Plot==
Jerry Morgan (Kaye) is a [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] who is having trouble with love:  just when his relationship with a woman gets around to marriage, his dummy turns jealous and spoils everything. Jerry's manager Marty threatens to quit unless Jerry sees a psychiatrist, Ilse Nordstrom (Zetterling), who tries to discover the source of his problem. The two of them eventually fall in love.

At the same time, Jerry becomes unwittingly intertwined with spies and has to run from the police. In his escape, he finds himself impersonating a British car salesman, trying to demonstrate a new convertible with loads of bells and whistles. Later on, he finds himself on stage in the middle of the performance of an exotic ballet.

==Cast==
* [[Danny Kaye]] as Jerry Morgan/Jerry's father
* [[Mai Zetterling]] as Doctor Ilse Nordstrom
* [[Torin Thatcher]] as Godfrey Langston, the film's villain
* [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]] as Marty Brown, Jerry's manager
* [[Leon Askin]] as Lazlo Gromek, a spy
* [[Abner Biberman]] as Maurice Papinek, a spy
* Otto Waldis as Brodnik, a spy
* [[Gavin Gordon (actor)|Gavin Gordon]] as Car Salesman
* [[Steven Geray]] as Doctor Krüger
* [[Diana Adams]] as Princess Maya
* Patricia Denise as Jerry's Mother
* [[Virginia Huston]] as Audrey Greene
* Paul England as Chief Inspector Wilton
* Johnstone White as Langstons Secretary
* [[Henry Brandon (actor)|Henry Brandon]] as Man with a Trenchcoat
* [[Lewis Martin (Actor)|Lewis Martin]] as Inspector Crawford

==Production notes==
The film features dialogue with linguistic play (particularly the names of the dummies "Clarence" and "Terrence" and the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] names of the spies) which would also be a feature of Kaye's later film ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (likewise written and directed by Frank and Panama).

The title song "Knock on Wood" should not be confused with "Everybody Thinks I'm Crazy" from the 1941 cartoon entitled ''Woody Woodpecker'', starring [[Woody Woodpecker|the character of the same name]]; or the song "Knock on Wood" from the 1942 film, ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (with music by M.K. Jerome and lyrics by Jack Scholl). Kaye performed renditions of both the title song from ''Knock on Wood'' and "The Woody Woodpecker Song," which are found on the album ''The Best of Danny Kaye'' [Spectrum, 2000].

==DVD release==
''Knock on Wood'' was issued as a region 2 DVD in March 2009.

'''La Trastienda Club''' is a prominent ''[[café-concert]]'' style venue in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="nosotros"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latrastienda.com/acerca-de/ |title=Sobre nosotros|language=Spanish|publisher=La Trastienda Club|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was established in 1993 in a late 19th-century building originally housing a corner grocery in the [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]] section of Buenos Aires. Seating 400 with standing-room capacity for another 1,000, its proximity to both downtown and the bohemian chic [[San Telmo]] section of the city has since helped make it one of the city's best known ''café-concerts'' and a leading local venue for artists in the [[world music]], [[funk]], [[jazz]] and other genres, featuring performers and bands from both Argentina and abroad.&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/buenos-aires/music/venue/8236/la-trastienda ''Time Out: Buenos Aires'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30524">[[Drive-in theater|Drive-in theatres]] (also known as ''drive-in cinemas'' or ''drive-ins'') were once very popular in [[Australia]]. Although considered{{By whom|date=December 2015}} an American invention there is evidence of outdoor cinemas in Western Australia where some patrons attended in their cars as far back as 1938, and it is possible that these facilities may even predate the first American-style drive-in theatre.&lt;ref name="Drive-in WA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/19/drive-ins-WA.html |title=Bringing family life into the theatres |publisher=[[La Trobe University]]|last=Bertrand|first=Ina|date=13 March 2006 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first American-style drive-in theatre to open in Australia was the Skyline in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Burwood, Victoria|Burwood]] on 18 February 1954.&lt;ref name="Burwood"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/vic_burwood.htm |title=Burwood Skyline (Hoyts) |publisher=Drive-ins downunder |year=1999 |accessdate=14 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721194502/http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/vic_burwood.htm |archivedate=21 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drive-in History"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatres.com.au/drive-in-theatres/ |title=Drive-in Theatres |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|work=Australian Theatres Directory|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of 330 drive-in theatres that would open across Australia.&lt;ref name="Drive-in History"/&gt;

Many have since closed with the large amounts of land taken up by drive-ins being sold off to build houses or shopping centres, although in recent years a number of drive-in theatres have reopened or expanded the number of screens available.

In the 1990s, the [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]] Drive-in Theatre in Melbourne was expanded to three screens,&lt;ref name="Coburg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/vic_coburg.htm|title=Coburg Triple Drive-in|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[Dromana, Victoria|Dromana]] Drive-in Theatre.&lt;ref name="Dromana"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/vic_dromana.htm|title=Dromana Twin/Peninsula|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times the former [[Dandenong]] Panoramic Drive-in, in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], has been reopened as the Lunar Drive-in Theatre&lt;ref name="Dandenong"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/vic_dandenong.htm|title=Dandenong Lunar (Panoramic)|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now has four screens making it Australia's largest drive-in theatre with the most screen choice.

In 2002 the Rodeo Drive-in at [[Mareeba, Queensland|Mareeba]], near [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]], re-opened, with the Tivoli Drive-in near [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] re-opening in 2008.

[[File:Drive-in theatre.jpg|thumb|250px|Mainline Drive-in Theatre Gepps Cross South Australia 16 April 2006]]The longest running Drive In Theatres in Western Australia that is still open today is located in [[Dongara, Western Australia|Dongara]]. This opened in 1967 and still operates every summer, the projector has been upgraded to digital to show the latest movies.[[Image:Dandenongpic30.JPG|thumb|250px|Lunar Drive-in Theatre Dandenong Victoria Australia]]
[[Image:Bass Hill Drive-in Cinema.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Bass Hill, New South Wales|Bass Hill]] Drive-In Cinema]]

Along with a few metropolitan operations, there are a number of drive-in theatres serving remote communities such as [[Jericho, Queensland|Jericho]] in Queensland.

==By state==
The remaining drive-ins provide a glimpse of what was a very popular pastime in the 1950s and 1960s. The following is a listing of Australia's remaining open drive-in theatres. It includes portable operations in which patrons can either drive or sit down to see a movie outdoors.

===Victoria===
Following a visit to the [[United States]] in the early 1950s, [[Hoyts]]' southern division manager, George Griffith Jnr, believed that drive-in theatres would be successful in Australia.&lt;ref name="Burwood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VHDb"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/search/nattrust_result_detail/71756 |title=Burwood Drive-In Site|publisher=[[Heritage Council of Victoria]]|work=Victorian Heritage Database|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.babyboomercentral.com.au/icons_driveins.htm|title=Icons: Drive-In Theatres|work=Baby Boomer Central|publisher=Australia On CD|last=Yarrow|first=Stephen|year=2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223234709/http://www.babyboomercentral.com.au/icons_driveins.htm|archivedate=23 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoyts and Fox however did not share Griffith's enthusiasm for the establishment of a drive-in theatre, so Griffith subsequently formed a syndicate, Auto Theatres Pty Ltd,&lt;ref name="Burwood"/&gt; which decided on a site in the Melbourne suburb of Burwood for Australia's first drive-in theatre. Construction proceeded through the latter half of 1953 from plans drawn up by AC Leith Bartlett &amp; Partners in conjunction with RCA Australia.&lt;ref name="VHDb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB"/&gt; The Skyline Burwood officially opened on 18 February 1954&lt;ref name="Drive-in History"/&gt; and proved extremely popular, with traffic jams in both directions along the Burwood Highway.&lt;ref name="BB"/&gt; Hoyts subsequently bought out Griffith and his partners.&lt;ref name="Burwood"/&gt;

Following the success of the first drive-in theatre, the Skyline (Burwood), Hoyts quickly opened Skyline drive-in theatres at [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]] in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/vic_prestonhoyts.htm|title=Preston Skyline/Hoyts|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Oakleigh, Victoria|Oakleigh]] in March 1955.&lt;ref name="Oakleigh"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/vic_oakleigh.htm|title=Oakleigh Skyline/Hoyts|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next Hoyts drive-in was constructed in Broadmeadows (1958),&lt;ref name="Broadmeadows"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/vic_broadmeadows.htm|title=Broadmeadows Skyline (Hoyts)|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then there was a break of almost 10 years until Hoyts acquired drive-ins at [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]] and Oakleigh and constructed new drive-ins in [[Bulleen, Victoria|Bulleen]] (1965), [[Wantirna, Victoria|Wantirna]] (1968) and [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]]. In 1972 the Broadmeadows Skyline was the first of the Melbourne suburban drive-ins to close,&lt;ref name="Broadmeadows"/&gt; whilst the Oakleigh site was the last drive-in operated by Hoyts in the world, when it closed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Oakleigh"/&gt;

Sandringham drive-in theatre (now closed) was located between Tulip and Talinga Roads in Sandringham Victoria. With the entrance being on Tulip St.

Today Melburnians have 10 screens in their immediate vicinity to choose from (counting Dromana as being basically suburban Melbourne). Rural Victorians however have no drive-in theatres currently in operation.
* Lunar Drive-in Theatre (four screens), [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]]
:The Lunar Dandenong is now Australia's largest and oldest (still in operation) drive-in theatre.&lt;ref name="Dandenong"/&gt; It was first opened 4 May 1956 and was constructed by J and K Houlahan from plans drawn up by Baily and Tilley.&lt;ref name="Dandenong"/&gt; The original capacity was to be for 400 cars however this was redesigned to accommodate 600 cars, with the final capacity being 634 cars. The drive-in closed on 18 April 1984 and was subsequently purchased by Trash and Treasure Australia Pty Ltd, who operated a Sunday market on the site in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Dandenong"/&gt; On 19 September 2002 it reopened as a two-screen drive-in, with a third screen added in September 2003 with a 950-car capacity.&lt;ref name="Dandenong"/&gt;
* [[Village Cinemas|Village]] Coburg Drive-in (3 Screens), [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]]
:Coburg opened in November 1965, under the ownership of Sillman and Sharp.&lt;ref name="Coburg"/&gt; It was acquired by [[Hoyts]] in 1967 until it closed in 1984.&lt;ref name="Coburg"/&gt; Hoyts were unable to sell the site despite numerous attempts and in 1987 [[Village Cinemas|Village]] joined with [[Hoyts]] and re-opened Coburg as a twin screen in 1987.&lt;ref name="Coburg"/&gt; A third screen was added in 1995. Coburg was Australia's largest drive-in theatre with an 850 car capacity,&lt;ref name="Coburg"/&gt; until the expansion at Dandenong in 2003.
* Dromana 3 Drive-in (3 Screens), [[Dromana, Victoria|Dromana]]
:The Dromana was opened in 1961 with a capacity of 485 cars.&lt;ref name="Dromana"/&gt; It has since been expanded to a three screen operation and has a Sunday market operating from the site. It is only one of three that have never closed (since the 1960s), operating continuously since its inception (1961) to the present.&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.nattrust.com.au/trust_register/search_the_register/dromana_drive_in&lt;/ref&gt;

===New South Wales===
The Skyline Drive-ins at Frenchs Forest and Dundas were Sydney's first. They opened simultaneously on Wednesday 24 October 1956, with Frenchs Forest screening [[3 Ring Circus]] and Dundas screening [[The Racers]]. &lt;!--- Note: Recent false allegations of the historical existence of a Drive-in theatre in Quakers Hill have been raised by a passionate local with no evidence to back up the claim. There has never been a Drive-in within the vicinity of Quakers Hill....ever.---&gt;

The Skyline in [[Bass Hill, New South Wales|Bass Hill]] opened in November 1956, with a 724 car capacity and until its closure in September 2007 was Australia's oldest continually operating drive-in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw-act/rescue-bid-for-oldest-drive-in/story-e6freuzi-1111114734830|title=Rescue bid for oldest drive-in |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|last=Williams|first=Lauren|date=27 October 2007|accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bass Hill"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/nsw_basshill.htm|title=Bass Hill Skyline|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a Skyline in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in December 1956 at a cost of $200,000, with a capacity for 722 cars and a holding area for a further 420.&lt;ref name="Newcastle Herald"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.driveintheatres.com.au/drive-in-theatres-articles/1999/9/28/first-place-in-nsw-to-open-a-drivein/|title=First place in NSW to open a Drive-in|publisher=[[Newcastle Herald]]|date=28 September 1999|accessdate=18 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706103542/http://www.driveintheatres.com.au/drive-in-theatres-articles/1999/9/28/first-place-in-nsw-to-open-a-drivein/|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newcastle Skyline closed in June 1985.&lt;ref name="Newcastle Herald"/&gt;  The North Ryde Skyline, on Lane Cove Road, accommodated 620 cars and operated for 30 years from 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hogben|first1=Paul|title=Leisure Space:  The Transformation of Sydney 1945-1970|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=9781742246802|pages=152–155}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Ryde Skyline|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/nsw_northryde.htm|website=Australian Drive-Ins|publisher=Drive-ins Downunder|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Until recently the Greater Union [[Blacktown, New South Wales|Blacktown]] Drive In was one of Sydney's last remaining drive-ins,&lt;ref name="Blacktown"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/nsw_blacktown.htm|title=Blacktown Skyline|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a new seasonal facility with a blow up screen has recently started at Randwick Racecourse. Caringbah drive-in is now a shopping mall. A few small community drive-ins remain in rural NSW.
* Greater Union Blacktown Drive-In (2 Screens), [[Blacktown, New South Wales|Blacktown]]
:Blacktown Skyline was opened in the 1960s. It was the first of the Consolidated circuit to add a second screen in 1984 and has a capacity of 700 cars.&lt;ref name="Blacktown"/&gt; It is currently operated by [[Greater Union]].
* Heddon Greta Skyline (1 Screen), Heddon Greta The Drive in was opened in the 1960's but between 1984 - 1996 the theatre was closed, however it has been reopened.

===Queensland===

Queensland had at one stage over fifty drive-ins. Now all of the suburban Brisbane drive-in theatres have closed leaving the Tivoli Drive-In in Ipswich, and the Gold Coast's Yatala as the closest drive-in theatres to Brisbane. In rural Queensland however, there are still a number of drive-in theatres operating.
[[File:Qap768-43-1958-Cropped.Inc-Cont..jpg|thumb|Boondall Drive-In, May 1958]]
Brisbane's first drive-in was the Capalaba which opened in 1955. The Boondall Drive-in opened on 8 February 1956, at the time it had the largest  screen in Australia. Kids were well catered for with a Merry-Go-Round, miniature Cobb &amp; Co coach and Shetland Ponies to ride (Brisbane Telegraph, 6 Feb 1956).  The site of the Boondall Drive-In has now been developed into housing.

The [[Burleigh Heads, Queensland|Burleigh Heads]] Drive-in was one of Queensland's first drive-ins when it opened in 1957 with a 500 car capacity. It was followed by the Starlight drive-in at [[Aspley, Queensland|Aspley]], which was opened in January 1957 (at a cost of £100,000). Fourth to open, in April 1957, was Hoyts Skyline Drive-in located at [[Coopers Plains, Queensland|Coopers Plains]] at a cost of £200,000. It could hold 650 cars on its 17 acres and also had a children's railway line, [[Miniature golf|putt putt]], [[badminton]] facilities and a dance floor.

The Starline Drive-In opened near Ipswich in the early 1960s. Other drive-ins opened in and around Brisbane in the late 1960s, early 1970s. These included the Keperra, the Western at Oxley, the Galaxy at Cannon Hill and the Redcliffe Drive-In on the city's northern outskirts.

In 2002 a small boutique drive-in was opened in Wonga (north of [[Gympie]]), with a second screen added in 2004, increasing it to a 250 car capacity. A third screen was subsequently added; however in January 2010 the drive-in closed, when its owner went into receivership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gympietimes.com.au/story/2010/01/28/drive-ins-gates-close//|title=Wonga Drive-in's gates close|publisher=[[The Gympie Times]]|date=28 January 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.gympietimes.com.au/story/2010/02/03/wonga-drive-in-a-going-concern/|title=Wonga drive-in a going concern|publisher=[[The Gympie Times]]|date=3 February 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010 a new owner took over the operation of the drive-in reopening in December that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gympietimes.com.au/story/2010/09/25/back-to-the-drive-in-future-movies-roll-at-wonga//|title=Back to the drive-in future|publisher=[[The Gympie Times]]|last=Morrissey|first=Carly|date=25 September 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drive-in has recently closed.
* Ayr Stardust Drive In, [[Ayr, Queensland|Ayr]]
:The Stardust drive-in was opened in September 1964, with a capacity of 360 cars.&lt;ref name="Mareeba"/&gt; Built within the grounds is a hardtop cinema, so patrons can choose between outdoor and indoor movies.
[[File:Yatala Drive-In 2013.JPG|thumb|250px|Yatala Drive-In during a themed event in 2013]]
* Yatala 3 Drive-In (3 screens), [[Yatala, Queensland|Yatala]]
:The Yatala Drive-In is the [[City of Gold Coast|Gold Coast]]'s last open-air drive-in theatre (in an area which formerly had over 20 drive-in theatres), formerly Beenleigh Drive-In, it opened on 27 October 1974, and in 2000 the theatre was renamed Yatala Twin Drive-In when a second screen was added. A third screen was added in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://quest.newspaperdirect.com/epaper/viewer.aspx | title = Triple treat at drive-in}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charters Towers Tors Drive-In, [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]]

* Jericho Drive in, [[Jericho, Queensland|Jericho]]
:The Jericho drive-in is the smallest public drive-in located in Australia, and possibly the world, with a capacity for 36 cars. It was opened in 1969. Movies are screened once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/qld_jericho.htm|title=Jericho|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rodeo Drive In Mareeba,  [[Mareeba, Queensland|Mareeba]]
:The Mareeba Rodeo drive-in was built by Far Northern Theatres in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Mareeba"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-insdownunder.com.au/australian/qld_ayr.htm|title=Ayr Stardust|publisher=Drive-ins downunder|year=1999|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far Northern Theatres had a circuit that extended right through far northern Queensland and into [[Papua New Guinea]]. The circuit was sold to [[Greater Union|Birch Carrol &amp; Coyle]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Mareeba"/&gt; In the mid-1980s, Birch Carrol &amp; Coyle pulled out and the Rodeo was sold to Norm Janke. Janke operated the drive-in until 1998 when it closed.&lt;ref name="Mareeba"/&gt; It subsequently re-opened in 2002, with a 300 car capacity.

===Western Australia===
The first conventional drive-in located in Western Australia was the Highway, opened in the Perth suburb of [[Bentley, Western Australia|Bentley]] in October 1955.&lt;ref name="Drive-in WA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banks, Ron.(1987) ''Brief history of drive-in theatres'' Western mail, 19 Sept 1987, p. 38,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowley, Michelle(1988) ''Drive-in theatres in WA''.Media information - Australia, Feb 1988, p. 12-16,&lt;/ref&gt; With a 642 car capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/image/Honniball.html|title=Cinemas 1896-1985 |publisher=[[Murdoch University]]|last=Honniball|first=Jack|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; this started a boom in suburban drive-ins which saw a further eight operating by the end of the decade (the Skyline in [[Floreat, Western Australia|Floreat]] in November 1955, Mott's in [[Gosnells, Western Australia|Gosnells]] in January 1956, the Panorama in [[Roleystone, Western Australia|Roleystone]] in March 1956, the Metro in [[Innaloo, Western Australia|Innaloo]], the Lakeway in [[Swanbourne, Western Australia|Swanbourne]] in April 1957, the Melway in [[Melville, Western Australia|Melville]], the Wirrina in [[Morley, Western Australia|Morley]] in March 1959 and the Eastway in [[Belmont, Western Australia|Belmont]] in July 1959), with another nine sites opening in the 1960s (including the Starline in [[Hilton, Western Australia|Hilton]]). The growth of Perth's suburban drive-ins then slowed to only five more built during the 1970s with the last drive-in theatre, Aceway, in the suburb of [[Morley, Western Australia|Morley]], constructed in 1980.&lt;ref name="Drive-in WA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yelland, R. A. (1976) Drive-ins collection, 1933-1976 [manuscript].[[Battye Library]], MN 1941, Papers of R.A. Yelland, ACC 5531A. Sound engineer and theatre circuit manager. Records from Consolidated Theatres Pty Ltd and related organisations in the film exhibition industry, especially drive-in cinemas in Western Australia. The records include items from Consolidated Theatres, Greater X-Tone Amusements, National Theatre Supply Company, Metropolitan Cinemas, West Australian Motion Pictures Exhibitors Association, Great Northern, City, Twin City, Carnarvon, Pingelly, Carnamah and Laverton Drive-ins.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the country areas, the first to open was the Oasis in [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] in 1957, and there were only three more built in the 1950s; the Mayfair in [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]], the Avonway in [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]] and the Morcady in [[Wongan Hills, Western Australia|Wongan Hills]]. The boom years in the country were the sixties, which saw 61 drive-ins opened, with growth then slowing to only six more built in the seventies and one in the eighties.&lt;ref name="Drive-in WA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Perth's drive-in theatres closing due to competition from videos'' [[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily news]], 15 July 1988, p. 14,&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s there were only three suburban drive-ins that remained, but then the Metro (a twin screen site as of 1984) in Innaloo closed in 1993 followed by the Highway (a twin screen site as of 1986) in Bentley which closed in 1994; only the Galaxy (established 1973) in [[Kingsley, Western Australia|Kingsley]] remains open within the Perth surrounds.&lt;ref name="Drive-in WA"/&gt; There are however a few drive-in theatres and car-friendly outdoor cinemas still operating in rural [[Western Australia]]. The [[Dongara, Western Australia|Dongara]] Drive-in, built in 1966 and opened in January 1967, has been in continual operation since this time. After a storm in 2008 the screen was replaced and the original projector upgraded. In 2015 the projector was upgraded to digital. The drive-in can accommodate 200 cars, whilst it only operates in summer it is the longest continually running drive-in in Western Australia. The [[Koorda, Western Australia|Koorda]] Community Drive-in opened in October 1965; it closed in 1983 but reopened in 1987. It has a capacity of 110 cars, has been updated to digital, and screens monthly.

'''''Marabou Stork Nightmares''''' is an experimental novel by [[Irvine Welsh]], and his second novel. 

The book's narrative is split into two styles: a conventional [[first person narrative|first person]] account of the past and a more [[Surrealism|surreal]], [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] account of an otherworldly present. Like many of Welsh's novels, it is written in [[Edinburgh]] [[Scots Language|Scots]] [[dialect]]. The plot consists of the memories and hallucinations of the protagonist, Roy Strang, making him an extreme example of an [[unreliable narrator]].

==Plot summary==

Roy Strang narrates the book from an (at first) unexplained coma, which he has been in for the previous two years. His life in this state is a miserable affair, surrounded by uncaring doctors and his extremely dysfunctional family. In his fantasy life, he is an adventurer in the wilds of South Africa, where he and his loyal guide, Sandy Jamieson, hunt for the [[marabou stork]].

When not hallucinating, Strang tells his life story, beginning in a "scheme" ([[Council house|local authority housing]]) in [[Muirhouse]], Scotland, with his violent, delusional parents, two half-brothers (one a womanizer, the other flamboyantly gay), and his promiscuous sister, all of whom he despises. The family relocates to apartheid-era South Africa when he is an adolescent, where he is repeatedly molested by his uncle. When his father is jailed for the violent assault of a taxi driver, the Strangs are forced to return to Scotland, a mere 18 months after they left.

Strang grows into a violent, misogynistic thug. He maintains a full-time job in as a systems analyst for the fictional investment group, 'Scottish Spinsters' (a reference to [[Scottish Widows]]). He joins a gang of [[football hooliganism|football hooligans]] who are attached to [[Hibernian F.C.]], the [[Capital City Service]], and led by the fearsome Lexo. Strang enjoys his life as a "top boy," feared by the entire town, until the gang kidnaps a young woman who rejected their advances and gang rapes her; Strang informs the reader that he is horrified, but too intimidated to try and stop them, and he even joins in.

The gang evades prison, but Strang is stricken with guilt and withdraws completely into depression. He briefly revives a few months later when he meets a woman and genuinely feels love for the first time. Around the same time he begins to take [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], and even befriends his gay half-brother. The memory of what he has done continues to haunt him, and his depression soon completely engulfs him, taking him away from his lover and his drug-driven escapism. He attempts suicide but survives, putting him in a coma.

One day, the gang's rape victim visits him in the hospital. She tells him that she has been murdering her rapists one by one, and now she has come for him, revealing that he was by far the most brutal and that he has been trying to convince himself and the audience (the reader) of his moral cleanliness compared that of those around him. She then penectomises him and stabs him to death. In his final moments, Strang realizes that the only person he has ever really hated is himself, and makes peace with everyone he has wronged and who has wronged him.

The novel's other, more stream-of-consciousness narrative, intertwined with the story of Strang's past, takes place in the fantasy world he creates for himself in the coma. At first a bizarre but rousing adventure, it gradually becomes darker as Strang reveals the uglier parts of his life and personality, involving surreal images of brutality and sexual violence.

==Reception==
Boyd Tonkin at ''[[The Observer]]'' praises Welsh for the power of his fiction and writes: "Here was a voice, out of Edinburgh by way of Hades, that would never have a problem with energy, wit or compassion. Finding the right form for all this incendiary talent might prove trickier." Tonkin suggests that Welsh does not know what to do with his fatalism, but that the story "gives a shockingly funny shape to that impasse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 23 April 1995  | author = Boyd Tonkin | title = A wee Hades | url = https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1995/apr/23/featuresreview.review | work = [[The Observer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
As in many of Welsh's novels, there are many allusions to music and underground youth culture, especially [[rave culture]], [[punk rock]], comic books, and football hooliganism.

There is a strong message against violence towards women from men in the book, one passage is in fact set out in a capital 'Z' which is the symbol for Zero Tolerance, a women's rights group based in Scotland.

The South African narrative is written in a ''[[Boy's Own Paper|Boys' Own]]'' style.

The [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]ic Francis Begbie, one of the main characters in ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', makes a [[cameo role|cameo]] appearance.

[[File:Reinhardtseminar071011.jpg|thumb|right|Reinhardt Seminar in Palais Cumberland]]
The '''Max Reinhardt Seminar (Reinhardt Seminar)''' is the School of Drama at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|University of Music and Performing Arts]] in [[Vienna, Austria]].  It is located in the Palais Cumberland, Penzingerstraße 9, in Vienna's 14th district  (&lt;small&gt;{{coord|48|11|21|N|16|18|44|E|type:landmark_region:AT|display=inline,title}}&lt;/small&gt;)

== History ==
A ''Lehrgang für Declamation und Mimik'' (Course in Declamation and Mimics) had been in existence in Vienna since 1852, when [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] received a call to the University of Music and Performing Arts in 1929 to create a drama seminar.  Initially, this Seminar was taught at the [[Schlosstheater Schönbrunn]], the imperial theatre in the [[Schönbrunn Palace]].  After Reinhardt's emigration in 1937, the seminar moved to the nearby Palais Cumberland in 1940.  From 1948 until 1954, [[Helene Thimig]] (Max Reinhardt's widow) directed the Seminar.

== Curriculum ==
The Seminar offers a four-year course taught by some 40 professors, many of whom are themselves notable actors and directors, e.g. [[Karlheinz Hackl]], [[Heiner Müller]], [[Oleg Tabakov]], [[Giorgio Strehler]], [[István Szabó]], [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]). After the second semester, the students specialize into various branches of acting and directing.  Student performances are staged at the ''Schlosstheater''.

'''Meo''' is a mobile and fixed [[telecommunications]] service and brand from [[Altice Portugal]], managed by Meo - Serviços de Comunicações e Multimédia. The service was piloted in [[Lisbon]] in 2006 and was later extended to [[Porto]] and [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]].

== History ==
The commercial launch of the [[ADSL]]2+ service took place in June 2007. The satellite service began in April 2008, using the [[Hispasat]] satellite, soon followed by the FTTH service. The ADSL2+ and FTTH offers reached across Portugal and included broadband Internet services (at up to 400Mbit/s) as well as a telephone service.

MEO was officially founded after the separation of [[PT Comunicações]] and [[PT Multimédia]] (later [[ZON Multimédia]]). While PT Multimédia employed [[coaxial cable]]s, after separation, MEO started making use of [[Copper wire and cable|copper]] cables. The television service supplied by MEO within the copper cable network is served on the [[ADSL]] line.

In May 2009 PT Comunicações announced, after Terrestrial Digital Television (TDT) transmissions had started, that the triple play service was also available with [[fiber optic]] speeds can achieve 400 Mbit/s.

Another service relies on TDT, MEO TDT, which is included in the 3G plates service that is captured through the mobile internet signals from TDT. This service included one High Definition (HD) channel and the five main Portuguese channels: [[RTP 1]], [[RTP 2]], [[Sociedade Independente de Comunicação|SIC]], [[Televisão Independente|TVI]] e [[ARTV]]. MEO TDT service also allows some of the advantages found on the ADSL and Fiber Optic service (pause, record...).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmn.pt/portal/site/tmn/menuitem.0143d3546741f79ae8f48210751056a0/?vgnextoid=cbd42c3475de0210VgnVCM1000005401650aRCRD|title=MEO|author=MEO|work=MEO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 [[Portugal Telecom]] informed that MEO had surpassed 700 thousand clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jn.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Media/Interior.aspx?content_id=1613672 |title=Operador MEO supera os 700 mil clientes |author= |date= |publisher= |accessdate=9 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100710014948/http%3A//jn%2Esapo%2Ept/PaginaInicial/Media/Interior%2Easpx?content_id%3D1613672 |archivedate=10 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, MEO achieved one million subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Tecnologia/Interior.aspx?content_id=2121541|title=MEO alcançou 1 milhão de subscritores|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 MEO and [[Telecomunicações Móveis Nacionais, SA|TMN]] became a single brand, MEO Serviços de Comunicações e Multimédia S.A..

In 2013 MEO launched a quadruple play service called '''M4O''' that in addition to the functionalities already referred has added the mobile phone, in a converged strategic logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economico.sapo.pt/noticias/nova-oferta-da-pt-traz-vantagens-competitivas_160182.html|title=Nova oferta da PT traz vantagens competitivas|work=Económico}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014 MEO launched a bundle which also includes the offering of mobile internet, called M5O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinheirovivo.pt/Empresas/Telecom/interior.aspx?content_id=4050570|title=Meo arranca com pacotão M5O para novos clientes|work=Dinheiro Vivo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology ==
1991
*Created on 22 March to take on the only existing mobile service in Portugal, based on an analogue network launched in 1989 by [[Telefones de Lisboa e Porto|TLP]] (Lisbon and Oporto's phone service) and [[Correios de Portugal|CTT]] (Portuguese Postal Service/national phone service), both State companies. The network prefix was ''0676''.
*In December, [[Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi|Marconi]] (Portuguese international phone service, also a State company) bought into the company; ownership became equally split among the three partners.
1992
* In March, regulatory agency ICP-''Instituto das Comunicações de Portugal'' (Communications Institute of Portugal) announced the winners of the public bids for two licenses for mobile services through [[GSM]].

* In May, the first GSM call was placed. Prefix was ''0936''.
* On 8 October the GSM service was commercially launched.
1993
* In May, the first [[roaming]] call was made.

== Marketing ==
The communication campaign invested in a strong advertising effort, protagonized by Portuguese humoristic characters, the ''[[Gato Fedorento]]''.

== Service ==
MEO's technology transmits over fiber optic and ADSL - either television ([[IPTV]]), telephone ([[VOIP]]) and internet. MEO ADSL integrates a [[router (computing)|router]] with a switch, connected to the telephone plug to decode and distribute the signal, and another for the television called MEOBox. The two MEOBox models are built by [[Motorola]] and [[Scientific Atlanta]], with a processor, optional hard drive, [[HDMI]] slot, two [[SCART]] slots, a digital sound slot and an [[Ethernet]] slot.

The MEO Fiber Optic service uses an Optical Network Terminal, that decodes the fiber optic signal and passes it to the [[router (computing)|router]].

=== Television ===
MEO offers television content transmission through four platforms: the ADSL network (IPTV), fiber optic (IPTV), satellite (DTH) and the 3G/4G network inherited from mobile communications carrier TMN, added to MEO in January 2014.

MEO ADSL television service includes a basic slate of 120 TV channels. Subscribers can access more than 170 channels if purchasing the “MEO Total” bundle, which included HD channels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meo.pt/Meo/QuantoCusta/Pages/ServicosPacotes.aspx Pacotes MEO ADSL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827112736/http://www.meo.pt/Meo/QuantoCusta/Pages/ServicosPacotes.aspx |date=2010-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FTTH MEO offers bundles distinguished by the speed of data transmission. Just like MEO ADSL, the basic package includes 120 channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meofibra.pt/pacotes/Pages/Servicoeequipamento.aspx?mainZone=20&amp;subZone=21&amp;zona=21|title=MEO|author=MEO|work=MEO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With IPTV channels can be purchased through the MEObox remote control, unlike the satellite and coax services. Another advantage is its speed of 200 milliseconds.

The IPTV network also enables the customer to play games in the MEOBox and to explore content from the internet and dozens of interactive apps. The programming schedule is available along with a “PIP” (Picture In Picture) showing other channels onscreen alongside the current selection. It is also possible to record and pause the show being live transmitted or even watching what was transmitted on the last 7 days (automatic recordings.
In geographies where fiber optic or ADSL networks are not available, MEO offers a television service by satellite. 
The anywhere MEO’s TV solution is called '''MEO Go'''.

=== MEO VideoClube ===

In 2014, the services was refreshed with an improved image, faster navigation and new features with  additional content and information, and a more accessible user experience.

'''Pietro Andolfati''' ([[Milan]]. c. 1750 - [[Padua]], c. 1830)&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblioteca.accademiadeifilodrammatici.it/biblio/autore/68286  Biblioteca academia dei filodrammatici entry]&lt;/ref&gt; was an actor and troupe director, active mainly in Northern Italy, mainly of comedies. He is also known as Pietro Attore Andolfatti.

He was born in a family of actors and actresses. His father, [[Bartolomeo Andolfati]], was a [[Commedia dell'arte]] actor known for playing the role of ''[[Pantalone]]''. His mother, and sisters were actresses, among the latter, [[Gaetana Goldóni Andolfati]] became also a well-known actress.&lt;ref&gt;Treccani entry.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Giovanni Andolfati]] also became an actor.

Pietro played the commedia dell'arte role of the ''amoroso'' or [[innamorati]] for the theater company of P. Rossi, later became lead comic figure and director by 1792 in the theater in the via del Cocomero in Florence, then director of the  Accademia dei Filodrammatici a Milano. He also was an  independent author of drams and translator of French and Spanish works to  Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Treccani entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Accademia Filodrammatica di Milano'' was in fact a theater company, but its theater building, designed by Polak and Canonica, promoted republican ideas, which by then were ascendant. It favored a natural equality for an audience, substituting private boxes with galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Regli, Francesco&lt;/ref&gt; His colleagues in the theater circuit were [[Vincènzo Monti]], [[Carlo Porta]], and others. He also helped foster the careers of [[Francesco Righetti]] and [[Giuditta Pasta]]. The theater employed [[Andrea Appiani]] as a scenographer.

'''Public Broadcasting of Latvia''' ({{lang-lv|Latvijas sabiedriskais medijs}} – '''LSM''') is a publicly funded radio and television organization operated by both of Latvia's public broadcasters – [[Latvijas Televīzija|Latvian Television]] and [[Latvijas Radio|Radio Latvia]]. LSM provides news, analysis, culture, entertainment and new experimental content, produced mainly by [[Latvijas Televīzija|Latvian Television]] and [[Latvijas Radio|Radio Latvia]], and by the portal’s editorial personnel. The site was launched on 3 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsm.lv/lv/par-mums/|title=Par mums / LSM.LV|website=www.lsm.lv|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; LSM content is also available in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsm.lv/ru/|title=LSM.LV|website=www.lsm.lv|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsm.lv/en/|title=LSM.LV|website=www.lsm.lv|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; News content in English was made available from 1 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsm.lv/en/article/societ/society/lsm-launches-english-language-service.a90048/|title=LSM launches English-language service|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unified news portal was one of the steps planned in a much wider convergence of both public broadcasters. In 2012 Latvia’s National Electronic Media Council (NEMC) approved the concept of creating a new Latvian public service media organization.&lt;ref&gt;http://neplpadome.lv/en/home/news/may-2012.html&lt;/ref&gt;

NEMC members had to decide from 3 different scenarios: 
* partial convergence (institutional independence, but both media to engage in joint projects);
* full convergence with a single board and management;
* new single, minimal media (new structure itself would only produce news and current affairs programmes).

NEMC chose the second proposal, and approved its realization, including a unified internet platform as a new Latvian public service media, on 7 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://neplpadome.lv/en/home/news/country-report-latvia-april-2013.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
LSM.lv in its first year showed rapid growth. According to “[[Google Analytics]]”, the news portal reached 200 000 – 250 000 page views per month, at the end of 2013 page view statistics doubled.&lt;ref name="lsm.lv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsm.lv/lv/raksts/lr-un-ltv-nakotne/analize/lsm.lv-pirmais-gads-latvijas-interneta-vide.a76431/|title=LSM.LV pirmais gads Latvijas interneta vidē|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year of activity LSM has explored the role and importance of social media in order to reach audiences and bring them to the news portal. 

According to an article, published on 3 February 2014, during first month 60% of all links to the site were from social networks such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[draugiem.lv]]. In fact, statistics shows decrease in audience numbers brought by social media after first month of increased interest. And as well a lack of activities on social media platforms such as Facebook.&lt;ref name="lsm.lv"/&gt; The peak of page views in November 2013 is objective possibly due to the increased interest in the site following the [[Zolitūde shopping centre roof collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Zolitūde shopping centre roof collapse]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its second year of activity the portal was ranked among the 10 most popular sites in Latvia by Reach. By February 2015 lsm.lv reached 16.92% of the audience according to “Gemius” data. That placed the unified news portal 10th&lt;ref&gt;http://www.audience.gemius.lv/pages/display/reach&lt;/ref&gt; – its highest ranking so far. The increase in ranking can be explained by a lessening of fragmentation of the public broadcasters presence online. 

Until the end of 2014 Latvian Television and Radio Latvia operated separate domains – ltv.lv and latvijasradio.lv. In order to strengthen the position of public broadcasting of Latvia (lsm.lv) among other internet resources in Latvia, they both became sub-domains under lsm.lv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gemius.lv/all-reader-news/cinoties-par-ietekmi-tirgu-arvien-vairak-interneta-portalu-apvienojas-zem-viena-domena.html|title=Cīnoties par ietekmi tirgū, arvien vairāk interneta portālu apvienojas zem viena domēna|publisher=|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39651">'''Russian political jokes''' (or, rather, [[Russophone]] political jokes) are a part of [[Russian humour]] and can be naturally grouped into the major time periods: [[Imperial Russia]], [[Soviet Union]] and finally [[post-Soviet]] [[Russia]]. Quite a few political themes can be found among other standard categories of [[Russian joke]], most notably [[Russian joke#Rabinovich|Rabinovich jokes]] and [[Radio Yerevan jokes|Radio Yerevan]].

==Imperial Russia==

In Imperial Russia, most political jokes were of the polite variety that circulated in educated society. Few of the political jokes of the time are recorded, but some were printed in a 1904 German anthology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ir.spb.ru/naum-218.htm |title= |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=ir.spb.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A man was reported to have said: "[[Nicholas II of Russia|Nikolay]] is a moron!" and was arrested by a policeman. "No, sir, I meant not our respected Emperor, but another Nikolay!" - "Don't try to trick me: if you say "moron", you are obviously referring to our tsar!"
* A respected merchant, Sevenassov (''Semizhopov'' in the original Russian), wants to change his surname, and asks the Tsar for permission. The Tsar gives his decision in writing: "Permitted to subtract two asses".

There were also numerous politically themed [[Chastushki]] (Russian traditional song) in Imperial Russia.

In ''[[Pale Fire]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]] the [[unreliable narrator|fictional author of the "Foreword"]] [[Charles Kinbote]] cites the following Russian joke:

*A newspaper account of a Russian tsar’s coronation had, instead of "korona" (crown), the misprint "vorona" (crow), and when next day this was apologetically ‘corrected,’ it got misprinted a second time as "korova" (cow).

He comments on the uncanny linguistic parallelism between the English-language  "crown-crow-cow" and the Russian "korona–vorona–korova".&lt;ref&gt;''Brodsky Translating Brodsky: Poetry in Self-Translation'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=0fSzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 p. 120]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Union==
Every nation enjoys political jokes, but in the Soviet Union telling political jokes could be regarded as type of [[extreme sport]]: according to [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], "[[anti-Soviet propaganda]]" was a potentially [[Capital punishment|capital]] offense.
*A judge walks out of his chambers laughing his head off. A colleague approaches him and asks why he is laughing. "I just heard the funniest joke in the world!" "Well, go ahead, tell me!" says the other judge. "I can't&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; I just gave someone ten years for it!"
*"Who built the [[White Sea Canal]]?" &amp;ndash; “The left bank was built by those who told the jokes, and the right bank by those who listened.”&lt;ref name=lewis-book/&gt;
Ben Lewis claims that the political conditions in the Soviet Union were responsible for the unique humour produced there;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/communist-jokes/ "Hammer &amp; tickle"], ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect Magazine]]'', May 2006, essay by [[Ben Lewis (filmmaker)|Ben Lewis]] on jokes in Communist countries,
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis-book&gt;Ben Lewis (2008) "Hammer and Tickle", {{ISBN|0-297-85354-6}} ([http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11662223 a review online])&lt;/ref&gt; according to him, "[[Communism]] was a humour-producing machine. Its economic theories and system of repression created inherently amusing situations. There were jokes under [[fascism]] and the [[Nazi]]s too, but those systems did not create an absurd, laugh-a-minute reality like communism."

===Early Soviet times===
Jokes from these times have a certain historical value, depicting the character of the epoch almost as well as long novels might.

*Midnight [[Petrograd]]... A [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] night watch spots a shadow trying to sneak by. "Stop! Who goes there? Documents!" The frightened person chaotically rummages through his pockets and drops a paper. The Guards chief picks it up and reads slowly, with difficulty: "U.ri.ne A.na.ly.sis"... "Hmm... a foreigner, sounds like ..." "A spy, looks like.... Let's shoot him on the spot!" Then he reads further: "'Proteins: none, Sugars: none, Fats: none...' You are free to go, [[Proletariat|proletarian]] [[comrade]]! Long live the [[World revolution]]!"

===Communism===
According to [[Marxist–Leninist]] theory, [[communism]] in the strict sense is the final stage of evolution of a society after it has passed through the [[socialism]] stage. The Soviet Union thus cast itself as a socialist country trying to build communism, which was supposed to be a [[classless society]].

* The principle of the [[socialist economy|state capitalism]] of the period of transition to communism: the authorities pretend they are paying wages, workers pretend they are working. Alternatively, "So long as the bosses pretend to pay us, we will pretend to work." This joke persisted essentially unchanged through the 1980s.

Satirical verses and parodies made fun of official Soviet propaganda slogans.

* "Lenin has died, but his cause lives on!" (An actual slogan.)
:Punchline variant #1: Rabinovich notes: "I would prefer it the other way round."
:Variant #2: "What a coincidence: Brezhnev has died, but his body lives on". (An allusion to Brezhnev's mental feebleness coupled with the medically assisted staving off of his death. Additional comedic effect in the second variant is produced by the fact that the words 'cause' (''delo'') and 'body' (''telo'') rhyme in Russian.)

* Lenin coined a slogan about how communism would be achieved thanks to Communist Party rule and the modernization of the Russian industry and agriculture: "Communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country!" The slogan was subjected to mathematical scrutiny by the people: "Consequently, Soviet power is communism minus electrification, and electrification is communism minus Soviet power."
* A ''[[chastushka]]'' ridiculing the tendency to praise the Party left and right:
: The winter's passed,
: The summer's here.
: For this we thank
: Our party dear!
Russian:
: ''Прошла зима,''
: ''настало лето.''
: ''Спасибо партии''
: ''за это!''
(Proshla zima, nastalo leto / Spasibo partii za eto!)

* One old ''[[bolshevik]]'' says to another: "No, my friend, we will not live long enough to see communism, but our children... our poor children!" (An allusion to the slogan, "Our children will live in Communism!")

Some jokes allude to notions long forgotten. These relics are still funny, but may look strange.

* Q: Will there be [[KGB]] in communism?
:A: As you know, under communism, the state will be abolished, together with its means of suppression. People will know how to self-arrest themselves.

:The original version was about the [[Cheka]]. To fully appreciate this joke, a person must know that during the Cheka times, in addition to the standard taxation to which the peasants were subjected, the latter were often forced to perform ''samooblozhenie'' ("[[self-taxation]]")&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; after delivering a normal amount of agricultural products, prosperous peasants, especially those declared to be [[kulak]]s were expected to "voluntarily" deliver the same amount again; sometimes even "double ''samooblozhenie''" was applied.

* [[Collective farm]]
:Q: How do you deal with mice in the [[Kremlin]]?
:A: Put up a sign saying "collective farm". Then half the mice will starve, and the rest will run away.&lt;ref name=lewis-rev&gt;[http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11662223 A review of the Ben Lewis book]&lt;/ref&gt;

This joke is an allusion to the consequences of the [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] policy pursued by [[Joseph Stalin]] between 1928 and 1933.

===Gulag===
* Three men are sitting in a cell in the (KGB headquarters) [[Dzerzhinsky Square]]. The first asks the second why he has been imprisoned, who replies, "Because I criticized [[Karl Radek]]." The first man responds, "But I am here because I spoke out in favor of Radek!" They turn to the third man who has been sitting quietly in the back, and ask him why he is in jail. He answers, "I'm Karl Radek." 
* "Lubyanka (KGB headquarters) is the tallest building in Moscow. You can see Siberia from its basement."
* [[#Armenian Radio|Armenian Radio]] was asked: "Is it true that conditions in our [[gulag|labor camp]]s are excellent?" Armenian Radio answers: "It is true. Five years ago a listener of ours raised the same question and was sent to one, reportedly to investigate the issue. He hasn't returned yet; we are told that he liked it there."
* "Comrade Brezhnev, is it true that you collect political jokes?"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; "Yes"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; "And how many have you collected so far?"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; "Three and a half labor camps." (Compare with a similar [[East Germany jokes#Stasi|East German joke]] about ''[[Stasi]]''.)
*A new arrival to Gulag is asked: "What you were given 10 years for?" &amp;ndash;  "For nothing!" &amp;ndash; "Don't lie to us here, now! Everybody knows 'for nothing' is 3 years." (This joke was reported from the pre-[[Great Purge]] times. Later 'for nothing' was elevated to 5 and even 10 years.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazines.russ.ru/vestnik/2010/28/po30-pr.html "Становление личности сквозь террор и войну"], by [[Grigory Pomerants]], ''Вестник Европы'', 2010, no. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;
====Gulag Archipelago====
[[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[Gulag Archipelago]]'' has a chapter entitled "[[Zek (inmate)|Zek]]s as a Nation", which is a mock ethnographic essay intended to "prove" that the inhabitants of the Gulag Archipelago constitute a separate [[nation]] according to "the [[Marxism and the National Question|only scientific definition of nation]] given by comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]". As part of this research, Solzhenitsyn analyzes the humor of zeks ([[gulag]] inmates). Some examples:&lt;ref name=ga&gt;[[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]], ''[[Gulag Archipelago]]'', Ch. 19, "Zeks as a Nation"&lt;/ref&gt;

* "He was sentenced to three years, served five, and then he got lucky and was released ahead of time." (The joke alludes to the common practice described by Solzhenitsyn of arbitrarily extending the term of a sentence or adding new charges.) In a similar vein, when someone asked for more of something, e.g. more boiled water in a cup, the typical retort was, "''The prosecutor'' will give you more!" (In Russian: "Прокурор добавит!")
* "Is it hard to be in the gulag?"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; "Only for the first 10 years."
* When the quarter-century term had become the standard sentence for contravening [[Article 58]], the standard joke comment to a freshly sentenced was: "OK, now 25 years of life are guaranteed for you!"

===Armenian Radio===
{{main article|Radio Yerevan jokes}}

[[Public Radio of Armenia|The Armenian Radio]] or "Radio Yerevan" jokes have the format, "ask us whatever you want, we will answer you whatever we want". They supply snappy or ambiguous answers to questions on politics, commodities, the economy or other subjects that were taboo during the Communist era. Questions and answers from this fictitious radio station are known even outside Russia.

* Q: What's the difference between a capitalist fairy tale and a Marxist fairy tale?
:A: A capitalist fairy tale begins, "Once upon a time, there was....". A Marxist fairy tale begins, "Some day, there will be...."

* Q: Is it true that there is [[freedom of speech]] in the [[Soviet Union]], just like in the USA?
:A: In principle, yes. In the USA, you can stand in front of the [[White House]] in [[Washington, DC]], and yell, "Down with [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]!", and you will not be punished. Equally, you can also stand in [[Red Square]] in [[Moscow]] and yell, "Down with Reagan!", and you will not be punished. 

* Q: What is the difference between the Constitutions of the USA and USSR? Both of them guarantee freedom of speech.
:A: Yes, but the Constitution of the USA also guarantees freedom after the speech.&lt;ref name="johndclare.net"&gt;http://www.johndclare.net/Russ12_Jokes.htm One Hundred Russian Jokes&lt;/ref&gt;

* Q: Is it true that the Soviet Union is the most progressive country in the world?
:A: Of course! Life was already better yesterday than it's going to be tomorrow!

===Political figures===
* [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] are all travelling together in a railway carriage. Unexpectedly, the train stops. Lenin suggests: "Perhaps we should announce a [[subbotnik]], so that workers and peasants will fix the problem." Stalin puts his head out of the window and shouts, "If the train does not start moving, the driver will be shot!" (An allusion to the [[Great Purge]].) But the train doesn't start moving. Khrushchev then shouts, "Let's take the rails from behind the train and use them to lay the tracks in front". (An allusion to Khrushchev's various reorganizations.) But still the train doesn't move. Then Brezhnev says, "Comrades, Comrades, let's draw the curtains, turn on the gramophone and pretend we're moving!" (An allusion to the [[Brezhnev stagnation]] period.) A later continuation to this has [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] saying, "We were going the wrong way anyways!" and changing the train's direction (alluding to his policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]''), and [[Boris Yeltsin]] driving the train off the rails and through a field (allusion to [[Dissolution of the USSR|the breakup of the Soviet Union]]). 

====Lenin====
Jokes about [[Vladimir Lenin]], the leader of the Russian Revolution of 1917, typically made fun of characteristics popularized by propaganda: his supposed kindness, his love of children (Lenin never had children of his own), his sharing nature, his kind eyes, etc. Accordingly, in jokes Lenin is often depicted as sneaky and hypocritical. A popular joke set-up is Lenin interacting with the head of the secret police, [[Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky]], in the [[Smolny]] Institute, the seat of the revolutionary communist government in [[Petrograd]], or with ''khodoki'', peasants who came to see Lenin.

* During the famine of the civil war, a delegation of starving peasants comes to the Smolny, wanting to file a petition. "We have even started eating grass like horses," says one peasant. "Soon we will start neighing like horses!" "Come now! Don't worry!" says Lenin reassuringly. "We are drinking tea with honey here, and we're not buzzing like bees, are we?"
* (Concerning the omnipresent Lenin propaganda) A kindergarten group is on a walk in a park, and they see a baby hare. These are city kids who have never seen a hare. "Do you know who this is?" asks the teacher. No one knows. "Come on, kids", says the teacher, "He's a character in many of the stories, songs and poems we are always reading." Finally one kid works out the answer, pats the hare and says reverently, "So ''that's'' what you're like, Grandpa Lenin!"
* An artist is commissioned to create a painting celebrating Soviet–Polish friendship, to be called "Lenin in Poland." When the painting is unveiled at the Kremlin, there is a gasp from the invited guests; the painting depicts [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] (Lenin's wife) naked in bed with [[Leon Trotsky]].  One guest asks, "But this is a travesty! Where is Lenin?" To which the painter replies, "Lenin is in Poland." (The joke capitalizes on the title of the real film, ''[[Lenin in Poland]]''.)

====Stalin====
[[File:Stalin Image.jpg|right|100px]]
Jokes about Stalin usually refer to his paranoia and contempt for human life. Stalin's words are typically pronounced with a heavy Georgian accent.

* Stalin attends the premiere of a Soviet comedy movie. He laughs and grins throughout the film, but after it ends he says, "Well, I liked the comedy. But  that clown had a moustache just like mine. Shoot him." Everyone is speechless, until someone sheepishly suggests, "Comrade Stalin, maybe the actor shaves off his moustache?" Stalin replies, "Good idea! First shave, then shoot!"
* Stalin reads his report to the Party Congress. Suddenly someone sneezes. "Who sneezed?" Silence. "First row! On your feet! Shoot them!" They are shot, and he asks again, "Who sneezed, Comrades?" No answer. "Second row! On your feet! Shoot them!" They are shot too. "Well, who sneezed?" At last a sobbing cry resounds in the Congress Hall, "It was me! Me!" Stalin says, "Bless you, Comrade!" and resumes his speech. &lt;ref name=graham&gt;[http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/9560/1/grahamsethb_etd2003.pdf Graham, Seth (2004) A Cultural Analysis of the Russo-Soviet Anekdot. Doctoral Dissertation, University of Pittsburgh.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A secretary is standing outside the Kremlin as [[Marshal Zhukov]] leaves a meeting with Stalin, and she hears him muttering under his breath, "Murderous moustache!". She runs in to see Stalin and breathlessly reports, "I just heard Zhukov say 'Murderous moustache'!" Stalin dismisses the secretary and sends for Zhukov, who comes back in. "Who did you have in mind with 'Murderous moustache'?" asks Stalin. "Why, Iosef Vissarionovich, Hitler, of course!" Stalin thanks him, dismisses him, and calls the secretary back. "And who did ''you'' think he was talking about?"
* An old crone had to wait for two hours to get on a bus. Bus after bus arrived filled with passengers, and she was unable to squeeze herself in as well. When she finally did manage to clamber aboard one of them, she wiped her forehead and exclaimed, "Finally, glory to God!" The driver said, "Mother, you must not say that. You must say 'Glory to comrade Stalin!'." "Excuse me, comrade," the woman replied. "I'm just a backward old woman. From now on I'll say what you told me to." After a while, she continued: "Excuse me, comrade, I am old and stupid. What shall I say if, God forbid, Stalin dies?" "Well, then you ''may'' say, 'Glory to God!'"&lt;ref name="johndclare.net"/&gt;
* At a May Day parade, a very old Jew carries a placard which reads, "Thank you, comrade Stalin, for my happy childhood!" A Party representative approaches the old man. "What's that? Are you mocking our Party? Everyone can see that when you were a child, comrade Stalin hadn't yet been born!" The old man replies, "That's precisely why I'm grateful to him!"&lt;ref name="johndclare.net"/&gt;
* Stalin loses his favourite pipe. In a few days, [[Lavrentiy Beria|Lavrenti]] calls Stalin: "Have you found your pipe?" "Yes," replies Stalin. "I found it under the sofa." "This is impossible!" exclaims Beria. "Three people have already confessed to this crime!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Montefiore |first=Simon Sebag |authorlink=Simon Sebag Montefiore |date=2003 |title=Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar |isbn=978-1780228358|title-link=Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Khrushchev====
[[File:CDU Wahlkampfplakat - kaspl021.JPG|thumb|right|100px|"Khrushchev demands: overthrow [[Adenauer]]; now more than ever [[Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany|CDU]]"]]
Jokes about [[Nikita Khrushchev]] often relate to his attempts to reform the economy, especially to introduce [[maize]]. He was even called ''[[kukuruznik (disambiguation)|kukuruznik]]'' ('maizeman'). Other jokes target the crop failures resulting from his mismanagement of agriculture, his innovations in urban architecture, his confrontation with the US while importing US consumer goods, his promises to build [[communism in 20 years]], or simply his baldness and crude manners. Unlike other Soviet leaders, in jokes Khrushchev is always harmless.

* Khrushchev visited a pig farm and was photographed there. In the newspaper office, a discussion is underway about how to caption the picture. "Comrade Khrushchev among pigs," "Comrade Khrushchev and pigs," and "Pigs surround comrade Khrushchev" are all rejected as politically offensive. Finally, the editor announces his decision: "Third from left&amp;nbsp;– comrade Khrushchev."&lt;ref name="johndclare.net"/&gt;
* Why was Khrushchev defeated? Because of the Seven "C"s: Cult of personality, Communism, China, Cuban Crisis, Corn, and Cuzka's mother (In Russian, this is the seven "K"s. To "show somebody [[Kuzka's mother]]" is a Russian idiom meaning "to give somebody a hard time". Khrushchev had used this phrase during a speech at the [[United Nations General Assembly]], allegedly referring to the [[Tsar Bomba]] test over [[Novaya Zemlya]].)
* Khrushchev, surrounded by his aides and bodyguards, surveys an art exhibition. "What the hell is this green circle with yellow spots all over?" he asked. His aide answered, "This painting, comrade Khrushchev, depicts our heroic peasants fighting for the fulfillment of the plan to produce two hundred million ton of grain.". "Ah-h… And what is this black triangle with red strips?". "This painting shows our heroic industrial workers in a factory.". "And what is this fat ass with ears?". "Comrade Khrushchev, this is not a painting, this is a mirror." (The joke alludes at the [[Manege Affair]], Khrushchev's thunderous denouncing of modern art at an exhibition at the [[Moscow Manege]].)

====Brezhnev====
[[File:Brezhnev cut.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Leonid Brezhnev]]
[[Leonid Brezhnev]] was depicted as dim-witted, suffering from [[dementia]], always reading his speeches from paper, and prone to [[delusions of grandeur]].
* "Leonid Ilyich is in surgery." / "His heart again?" / "No, chest expansion surgery, to make room for one more [[Hero of the Soviet Union#Four times awarded|Gold Star]] medal." This makes reference to Brezhnev's elaborate collection of awards and medals.
* At the 1980 Olympics, Brezhnev begins his speech. "O!"—applause. "O!"—an ovation. "O!!!"—the whole audience stands up and applauds. An aide comes running to the podium and whispers, "Leonid Ilyich, those are the [[Olympic symbols|Olympic logo rings]], you don't need to read all of them!"
* After a speech, Brezhnev confronts his speechwriter. "I asked for a 15-minute speech, but the one you gave me lasted 45 minutes!" The speechwriter replies: "I gave you three copies..."
* Somebody knocks at the door of Brezhnev's office. Brezhnev walks to the door, sets glasses on his nose, fetches a piece of paper from his pocket and reads, "Who's there?"
* "Leonid Ilyich!..." / "Come on, no formalities among comrades. Just call me 'Ilyich' ". (Note: In Soviet parlance, by itself "Ilyich" refers by default to [[Vladimir Lenin]], and "Just call me 'Ilyich'" was a line from a [[Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (poem)|well-known poem about Lenin]], written by [[Mayakovsky]].)
* Brezhnev makes a speech: "Everyone in the Politburo has dementia. Comrade [[Arvīds Pelše|Pelshe]] doesn't recognize himself: I say "Hello, comrade Pelshe", and he responds "Hello, Leonid Ilyich, but I'm not Pelshe." Comrade [[Andrei Gromyko|Gromyko]] is like a child&amp;nbsp;– he's taken my rubber donkey from my desk. And during comrade [[Andrei Grechko|Grechko's]] funeral&amp;nbsp;– by the way, why is he absent? – nobody but me invited a lady for a dance when the music started playing."

Quite a few jokes capitalized on the cliché used in Soviet speeches of the time: "Dear Leonid Ilyich".
* The phone rings, Brezhnev picks up the receiver: "Hello, this is dear Leonid Ilyich...".

====Geriatric interlude====
During Brezhnev's time, the leadership of Communist Party became increasingly geriatric. By the time of his death in 1982, the median age of the [[Politburo]] was 70. Brezhnev's successor, [[Yuri Andropov]], died in 1984. His successor, [[Konstantin Chernenko]], died in 1985.  [[Russian jokes#Rabinovich|Rabinovich]] said he did not have to buy tickets to the funerals, as he had a subscription to these events. As Andropov's bad health became common knowledge (he was eventually attached to a [[dialysis machine]]), several jokes made the rounds:

* "Comrade Andropov is the most turned-on man in Moscow!"
* "Why did Brezhnev go abroad, while Andropov did not? Because Brezhnev ran on batteries, but Andropov needed an outlet." (A reference to Brezhnev's pacemaker and Andropov's dialysis machine.)
* "What is the main difference between succession under the [[tsarist regime]] and under socialism?" "Under the tsarist regime, power was transferred from father to son, and under socialism&amp;nbsp;– from grandfather to grandfather." (A play on words: in Russian, 'grandfather' is traditionally used in the sense of 'old man'.)
* [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] announcement: "Today, due to bad health and without regaining consciousness, Konstantin Ustinovich Chernenko took up the duties of Secretary General". (The first element in the sentence is the customary form of words at the beginning of state leaders' obituaries.)
* Another TASS announcement: "Dear comrades, of course you're going to laugh, but the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the entire Soviet nation, has ''again'' suffered a great loss." The phrase "of course you're going to laugh" (вы, конечно, будете смеяться) is a staple of the [[Culture of Odessa|Odessa humor and way of speech]], and the joke itself is a remake of a hundred-year-old one.&lt;ref&gt;Валерий Смирнов, "Умер-шмумер, лишь бы был здоров!: как говорят в Одессе" , 2008, {{ISBN|9668788613}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ytsuMo6swsIC&amp;pg=PA47 p. 147]&lt;/ref&gt;
* What are the new requirements for joining the Politburo? You must now be able to walk six steps without the assistance of a cane, and say three words without the assistance of paper.

====Gorbachev====
Mikhail Gorbachev was occasionally mocked for his poor grammar, but perestroika-era jokes usually made fun of his slogans and ineffective actions, his [[Port-wine stain|birth mark]] ("Satan's mark"), [[Raisa Gorbachev]]'s poking her nose everywhere, and Soviet-American relations.

* In a restaurant:
:― Why are the [[meatball]]s cube-shaped?
:― ''[[Perestroika]]!'' (restructuring)
:― Why are they undercooked?
:― ''[[Uskoreniye]]!'' (acceleration)
:― Why have they got a bite out of them?
:― ''[[Gospriyomka]]''! (state approval)
:― Why are you telling me all this so brazenly?
:― ''[[Glasnost]]!'' (openness)

* A Soviet man is waiting in line to purchase vodka from a liquor store, but due to restrictions imposed by Gorbachev, the line is very long. The man loses his composure and screams, "I can't take this waiting in line anymore, I HATE Gorbachev, I am going to the Kremlin right now, and I am going to kill him!" After 40 minutes the man returns and  elbows his way back to his place in line. The crowd  begin to ask if he has succeeded in killing Gorbachev. "No, I got to the Kremlin all right, but the line to kill Gorbachev was even longer than here!".
*[[Baba Yaga]] and [[Koschei]] the Immortal are sitting by the window in the [[cabin on chicken legs]] and see [[Zmey Gorynych]] flying low, cawing "Perestroika! Uskoreniye!" Baba Yaga: "This old stupid worm! Told him not to eat communists already!"

* Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife were on the train returning to Russia following a state visit to East Germany. After they'd been travelling a short while, his wife asked him: "Where are we now, Mikhail dear?" He put his hand out of the window and said: "We're still in Germany, dear." Several hours later, his wife asked him again: "Where are we now?" He put his hand out of the window and replied: "In Poland." Some time later, his wife asked again: "Where are we now?" Gorbachev put his hand out of the window and said: "We're back in Russia." His wife was curious; she asked: "How do you know where we are just by putting your hand out of the window?" He replied: "When I put my hand out in Germany, the people kissed it. When I put my hand out in Poland, they spat on it. And when I put my hand out in Russia, they stole my watch."

===KGB===
[[Image:KGB Symbol.png|thumb|right|Symbol of the [[KGB]]]]
Telling jokes about the KGB was considered to be like pulling the tail of a tiger.

* A hotel. A room for four with four strangers. Three of them soon open a bottle of [[vodka]] and proceed to get acquainted, then drunk, then noisy, singing, and telling political jokes. The fourth man desperately tries to get some sleep; finally, in frustration he surreptitiously leaves the room, goes downstairs, and asks the lady concierge to bring tea to Room 67 in ten minutes. Then he returns and joins the party. Five minutes later, he bends to a power outlet: "Comrade Major, some tea to Room 67, please." In a few minutes, there's a knock at the door, and in comes the lady concierge with a tea tray. The room falls silent; the party dies a sudden death, and the prankster finally gets to sleep. The next morning he wakes up alone in the room. Surprised, he runs downstairs and asks the concierge what happened to his companions. "You don't need to know!" she answers. "B-but...but what about me?" asks the terrified fellow. 'Oh, you...well...Comrade Major liked your tea gag a lot."
* The KGB, the [[GIGN]] (or in some versions of the joke, the [[FBI]]) and the [[CIA]] are all trying to prove they are the best at catching criminals. The Secretary General of the UN decides to set them a test. He releases a rabbit into a forest, and each of them has to catch it. The CIA people go in. They place animal informants throughout the forest. They question all plant and mineral witnesses. After three months of extensive investigations, they conclude that the rabbit does not exist. The GIGN (or FBI) goes in. After two weeks with no leads they burn the forest, killing everything in it, including the rabbit, and make no apologies: the rabbit had it coming. The KGB goes in. They come out two hours later with a badly beaten bear. The bear is yelling: "Okay! Okay! I'm a rabbit! I'm a rabbit!"
* In a prison, two inmates are comparing notes. "What did they arrest you for?" asks the first. "Was it a political or common crime?" "Of course it was political. I'm a plumber. They summoned me to the district Party committee to fix the sewage pipes. I looked and said, 'Hey, the entire system needs to be replaced.' So they gave me seven years."&lt;ref name="johndclare.net"/&gt;
* A frightened man came to the KGB. "My talking parrot has disappeared." "That's not the kind of case we handle. Go to the criminal police." 'Excuse me, of course I know that I must go to them. I am here just to tell you officially that I disagree with the parrot."&lt;ref name="johndclare.net"/&gt;


Quite a few jokes and other humour capitalized on the fact that Soviet citizens were under KGB surveillance even when abroad:

* A quartet of violinists returns from an international competition. One of them was honored with the opportunity to play a [[Stradivarius]] violin, and cannot stop bragging about it. The violinist who came in last grunts: "What's so special about that?" The first one thinks for a minute: "Let me put it to you this way: just imagine that you were given the chance to fire a couple of shots from [[Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky|Dzerzhinsky]]'s [[Mauser C96|Mauser]]...”
* An English athlete, a French athlete and a Russian athlete are all on the medal podium at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] chatting before the medal ceremony. "Don't get me wrong" says the Englishman, "winning a medal is very nice, but I still feel the greatest pleasure in life is getting home after a long day, putting one's feet up and having a nice cup of tea". "You Englishman" snorts the Frenchman, "you have no sense of romance. The greatest pleasure in life is going on holiday without your wife, and meeting a beautiful girl with whom you have a passionate love affair with before returning home back to work". "You are both wrong" scoffs the Russian. "The greatest pleasure in life is when you are sleeping at home and the KGB breaks your door down at 3 AM, bursts into your room and says 'Ivan Ivanovitch, you are under arrest' and you can reply 'Sorry comrade, Ivan Ivanovitch lives next door'".

===Daily Soviet life===
* Q: Which is more useful&amp;nbsp;– newspapers or television? A: Newspapers, of course. You can't wrap [[herring]] in a TV. (Variation: "You can't wipe your ass with a TV"&amp;nbsp;– a reference to the shortage of toilet paper in USSR, which forced people to use newspapers instead.)
* "We pretend to work, and they pretend to pay."  (The joke hints at low productivity and subsistence-level wages within the Soviet economy.)
* Five precepts of the Soviet ''[[intelligentsia]]'' (intellectuals):
**Don't think.
**If you think, then don't speak.
**If you think and speak, then don't write.
**If you think, speak and write, then don't sign.
**If you think, speak, write and sign, then don't be surprised.
* An old woman asks her granddaughter: "Granddaughter, please explain Communism to me. How will people live under it? They probably teach you all about it in school." "Of course they do, Granny. When we reach Communism, the shops will be full&amp;nbsp;– there'll be butter, and meat, and sausage … you'll be able to go and buy anything you want..." "Ah!" exclaimed the old woman joyfully. "Just like it was under [[Imperial Russia|the Tsar]]!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russian-jokes.com/political_jokes/communism_explained.shtml Communism Explained&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every morning a man would come up to the newspaper stand, and buy a copy of ''[[Pravda]]'', look at the front page and then toss it angrily into the nearby bin. The newspaper-seller was intrigued. "Excuse me," he said to the man, "Every morning you buy a copy of ''Pravda'' from me and chuck it in the bin without even unfolding it. What do you buy it for?" "I'm only interested in the front page,' replied the man. "I'm looking out for an obituary." – "But you don't get obituaries on the front page!" – "I assure you, this one will be on the front page."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russian-jokes.com/political_jokes/why_do_you_buy_pravda.shtml Why do you buy Pravda?&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A regional Communist Party meeting is held to celebrate the anniversary of the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]. The Chairman gives a speech: "Dear comrades! Let's look at the amazing achievements of our Party after the revolution. For example, Maria here, who was she before the revolution? An illiterate peasant; she had but one dress and no shoes. And now? She is an exemplary milkmaid known throughout the entire region. Or look at Ivan Andreev, he was the poorest man in this village; he had no horse, no cow, and not even an ax. And now? He is a tractor driver with two pairs of shoes! Or Trofim Semenovich Alekseev&amp;nbsp;– he was a nasty hooligan, a drunk, and a dirty gadabout. Nobody would trust him with as much as a snowdrift in wintertime, as he would steal anything he could get his hands on. And now he's Secretary of the [[Raikom]]!"&lt;ref name="johndclare.net" /&gt;

Some jokes ridiculed the level of political [[indoctrination]] in the Soviet Union's education system:
* "My wife has been going to cooking school for three years." / "She must really cook well by now!" / "No, so far they've only got as far as the bit about the [[20th CPSU Congress|Twentieth]] [[CPSU Congress]]."

Quite a few jokes poke fun at the permanent shortages in various shops.
* A man walks into a shop and asks,  "You wouldn't happen to have fish, would you?". The shop assistant replies, "You've got it wrong – ours is a butcher's shop: we wouldn't happen to have meat. You're looking for the fish shop across the road. ''There'' they wouldn't happen to have fish!"
* An American man and a Soviet man died on the same day and went to Hell together. The Devil told them: "You may choose to enter two different types of Hell: the first is the American-style one, where you can do anything you like, but only on condition of eating a bucketful of manure every day; the second is the Soviet-style hell, where you can ALSO do anything you like, but only on condition of eating TWO bucketfuls of manure a day." The American chose the American-style Hell, and the Soviet man chose the Soviet-style one. A few months later, they met again. The Soviet man asked the American: "Hi, how are you getting on?" The American said: "I'm fine, but I can't stand the bucketful of manure every day. How about you?" The Soviet man replied: "Well, I'm fine, too, except that I don't know whether we had a shortage of manure, or if somebody stole all the buckets."
* "What happens if Soviet socialism comes to Saudi Arabia?  First five years, nothing; then a shortage of oil." (Variation: "...; then a shortage of sand.")

A subgenre of the above-mentioned type of joke targets long sign-up queues for certain [[consumer goods in the Soviet Union|commodities]], with wait times that could be counted in years rather than weeks or months.

* "Dad, can I have the car keys?" / "OK, but don't lose them. We will get the car in only seven years!"
* "I want to sign up for the waiting list for a car. How long is it?" / "Precisely ten years from today." / "Morning or evening?" / "Why, what difference does it make?" / "The plumber's due in the morning".

== Modern Russia ==
=== Vladimir Putin===
Many draw parallels between [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]: his opponents do it accusingly, while [[neo-Stalinist]]s proudly. Many jokes about past Soviet leaders are retold about  Putin:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2008/07/03/funny-bones "Communist jokes - Funny bones"], ''[[The Economist]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stalin appears to Putin in a dream and says: “I have two bits of advice for you: kill off all your opponents and paint the Kremlin blue.” Putin asks, “Why blue?” Stalin: "I knew you will not object to the first one."

'''Sock wrestling''' is a game that can be played by [[children]], [[teenagers]] and [[Young adult (psychology)|young adults]], with at least 2 people, and consists of taking one or both of your opponent's [[sock]] off their foot to win.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.perfect-partygames.com/champion-sock-wrestling.html|title=Champion Sock Wrestling|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be an unlimited amount of players, who can or cannot be organized in cooperating teams.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youthgroupgames.com.au/games/77/sock-wrestling/|title=Sock Wrestling {{!}} Youth Group Games {{!}} Games, ideas, icebreakers, activities for youth groups, youth ministry and churches.|website=youthgroupgames.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sock wrestling is often mentioned as a good choice for recreational activity for [[primary education]] teachers or [[physical education]] classes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Rules ==
It is recommended that the players are above 8 years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.games4youthgroups.com/contest-games/Sock-Wrestling.html|title=Sock Wrestling|website=www.games4youthgroups.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mrfunology.com/2017/02/28/sock-wrestling/|title=Sock Wrestling|date=2017-02-28|work=Mr Funology - Games For Engaging Teachers|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two players must be sitting down or on their knees on the ground before the match starts, without footwear and wearing two socks. It's better to play on top of gym mats or carpeted room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=xQKlgR1BbMgC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=sock+wrestling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ftf87mpYCr&amp;sig=Pkx-F1cA-p7rTn_9jP1W8z-LENM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiwj7HbvOPaAhUDGZAKHSiWA7Y4HhDoATACegQIABAu#v=onepage&amp;q=sock%20wrestling&amp;f=false|title=The Ultimate Indoor Games Book: The 200 Best Boredom Busters Ever!|last=Gunter|first=Veronika Alice|date=2005|publisher=Lark Books|isbn=9781579906252|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When the referee gives a signal to start (such as shouting "go" after a countdown of three, etc.), the match starts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is recommended to use old socks, since there is the risk of them being damaged and tore during the game.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Excessive force is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Sock-Wrestling|title=How to Play Sock Wrestling|work=wikiHow|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The players then must struggle to reach the opponent's feet and remove their socks, and be careful to not have their socks removed. The first one to take one or both socks off or the one with most socks (in case of multiple players) wins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Superman Returns''''' is a 2006 American [[superhero film]] directed and produced by [[Bryan Singer]]. It is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]] and serves as a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] [[sequel]] to the motion pictures ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980),&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/movies/reviews/2006/supermanreturns.html|title=Superman Returns|last=Chattaway|first=Peter |work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=June 28, 2006|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/movies/27supe.html|title='Superman Returns' to Save Mankind From Its Sins|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 27, 2006|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ignoring the events of ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983) and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' (1987), including its spin-off ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' (1984).&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The film stars [[Brandon Routh]] as Clark Kent/Superman, [[Kate Bosworth]] as [[Lois Lane]], [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[Lex Luthor]], with [[James Marsden]], [[Frank Langella]], and [[Parker Posey]]. The film tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five-year absence. He finds that his [[Romance (love)|love interest]] [[Lois Lane]] has moved on with her life, and that his archenemy [[Lex Luthor]] is plotting a scheme that will destroy Superman and the world.

After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect ''Superman'' on screen following the critical failure and [[box office bomb|box office disappointment]] of ''Superman IV: The Quest for Peace'', [[Warner Bros.]] hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop ''Superman Returns'' in July 2004. The majority of [[principal photography]] took place at [[Fox Studios Australia]], Sydney, while the visual effects sequences were created by a number of studios, including [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], [[Rhythm &amp; Hues]], [[Framestore]], [[Rising Sun Pictures]], and [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=498&amp;Itemid=68|title=Superman Returns - Side Effects Software Inc.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130616003140/http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=498&amp;Itemid=68|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; filming ended in November 2005.

Upon release, ''Superman Returns'' received generally positive reviews, with critics praising its visual effects, story, musical score, the performances and style. However, it received criticism focusing on its runtime and lack of action sequences. While it was a box office success, Warner Bros. was disappointed with the worldwide box office return. A sequel was planned for a summer 2009 release, but the project was later canceled. The [[Superman in film|''Superman'' film series]] was completely rebooted in 2013 with the film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', directed by [[Zack Snyder]] and starring [[Henry Cavill]] as Superman.

== Plot ==
For the previous five years, Superman has mysteriously abandoned his adopted home of Earth while on a journey into outer space to investigate what astronomers believed to be an intact [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. In his absence, journalist and past love Lois Lane wrote a scathing article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman", winning her the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Lois is engaged to Richard White, the nephew of ''[[Daily Planet]]'' editor-in-chief Perry White, and with whom she shares a young asthmatic son, Jason. Notorious criminal mastermind Lex Luthor secured an early release from prison due to Superman not appearing as a prosecution witness during Luthor's fifth appeal trial. By seducing an old heiress, Luthor is able to inherit her fortune, giving him resources for his next scheme.

Superman returns to Earth, crash landing at the Kent farm, just as he did as a child. He reveals to his adoptive mother Martha Kent that he left hoping to find his homeworld, and expresses his dismay at being the only one of his kind remaining. Upon returning to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] in his human identity of Clark Kent, he is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance.

When a mysterious nationwide power outage causes catastrophic failures during a space shuttle launch, Clark realizes he must reemerge as Superman. Saving the shuttle and its ferry jet in highly public fashion causes a resurgence of media attention regarding Superman's return. Unbeknownst to anyone, the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the [[Fortress of Solitude]].

Luthor sends his [[Gun moll|moll]], Kitty, to distract Superman, allowing him to steal a sample of [[kryptonite]] from a museum. Still investigating the earlier power outage, Lois tracks the [[hypocenter]] to the mansion Luthor recently inherited and, along with her son, explores the yacht docked there. Discovering Luthor, she is held captive as the yacht heads out into the Atlantic. Luthor plans to use the Kryptonian crystal technology Superman used to create his Fortress of Solitude to create a massive new continent which would swallow some of the current landmasses bordering the Atlantic. The world will then be forced to use his new land. Placing a crystal inside a shell of refined kryptonite, Luthor triggers the new land growth by launching it into the sea.

[[File:Design fortress1.jpg|thumb|right|The Fortress of Solitude as depicted in the film.]]
Lois manages to use a fax machine on board the yacht to send their location to the Daily Planet headquarters, where it catches the attention of Clark and Richard. Upon discovering her attempt at subversion, one of Luthor's henchmen attacks Lois, causing Jason's powers to emerge as he crushes the henchman with a piano &amp;ndash; revealing that the (no longer asthmatic) Jason is Superman's son. Realizing this fact, Luthor and his thugs escape by helicopter as the earthquake effects from the growing landmass span back to Metropolis. While Superman works to contain the damage in the city, Richard reaches the yacht by way of a [[floatplane]] and releases Lois and Jason from their locked room. The three become trapped when the yacht is split in two by the growing rock formations, knocking Lois unconscious and sinking the yacht. Superman rescues them and gets them to the safety of Richard's plane.

Superman pursues Luthor, who has made his way to the growing land mass. The kryptonite shell surrounding the crystal has caused the new rock formations to be infused with kryptonite, making the land itself toxic to Superman. Luthor's thugs brutalize Superman into submission as he is unable to fight back. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite shard and allows him to fall into the ocean, presumably to die.

Regaining consciousness in the escaping floatplane, Lois learns that Superman has gone to confront Luthor. Knowing of the kryptonite danger, Lois convinces Richard to double back to help him. Jason spots the Man of Steel in the water and Lois and Richard get him into the plane, where Lois removes the shard. Recovering, Superman flies high into the atmosphere to regain his strength by exposure to sunlight. Using his [[Heat vision (fiction)|heat vision]], he then tunnels deep under the new land mass and, using the last of his strength, is able to fly it off into space before it absorbs more land.

Escaping with Luthor in the helicopter, a disillusioned Kitty discards the remaining crystals and the two eventually end up on a deserted island when they run out of fuel. Complications from kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma, and while doctors are able to remove more fragments from his skin, they cannot revive him. Lois visits him in the hospital and whispers into his ear while glancing at Jason. Soon after, hospital staff discovers his room empty. No longer feeling alone in the universe, Superman visits his newly revealed son in the boy's room and repeats to Jason the words of his [[Jor-El|own father]] as he sleeps. Lois starts writing another article, titled "Why the World Needs Superman". Superman reassures her that he is now back to stay, and flies off into space, where he gazes down at the world.

== Cast ==
* [[Brandon Routh]] as [[Clark Kent]] / [[Superman]]: The Kryptonian superhero who disguises himself as a journalist.

* [[Kate Bosworth]] as [[Lois Lane]]: A reporter who works with Clark Kent at the ''Daily Planet'', and former lover of Superman. Spacey recommended Singer to cast Bosworth in the role because she co-starred with Spacey in ''[[Beyond the Sea (film)|Beyond the Sea]]'' (2004) as [[Sandra Dee]].&lt;ref name="film" /&gt; [[Claire Danes]] and [[Keri Russell]] were reportedly considered for the role.&lt;ref name="five things"/&gt; [[Amy Adams]], who would later be cast as Lois Lane in the 2013 reboot ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', confirmed in an interview that she had also auditioned for Lois in 2005.

* [[James Marsden]] as Richard White: The nephew of the ''Daily Planet'' editor-in-chief Perry White and fiancé to Lois Lane. Marsden said Richard acts as an emotional challenge for Superman, since the hero comes back to find that "Lois Lane picks somebody who's very Supermanesque".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/heights/a/heightsjm060905_2.htm|title=Interview with James Mardsen: Marsden on "Heights," "Superman Returns," and "X-Men 3"|first=Rebecca|last=Murray|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2009-09-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006033119/http://movies.about.com/od/heights/a/heightsjm060905_2.htm|archivedate=2010-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Kal Penn]] as Stanford: One of Luthor's [[henchman|henchmen]].
* [[Sam Huntington]] as [[Jimmy Olsen]]: a photographer at the ''Daily Planet'' and a friend of Clark. 
* [[Kevin Spacey]] as [[Lex Luthor]]: An evil [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] armed with vast resources and an extensive knowledge of science who is Superman's nemesis. Because of his [[Academy Award]]-winning performance in Singer's film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995), and friendship with the director, Spacey was the only actor considered for Lex Luthor. The writers specifically had Spacey in mind for the part when writing the script.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite news | author = Cathy Dunkley | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117915886 | title = WB finds super nemesis | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2005-01-06 | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spacey's version of Luthor has the same comically exaggerated [[vanity]] and pompous arrogance of the earlier [[Gene Hackman]] version as well as the same strong interest in [[real estate]], but Spacey's version is far less [[camp (style)|campy]] and more serious. Spacey later said that director Singer told him to play the character as "darker and more bitter" compared to Hackman and not to use the earlier portrayal as an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinoreview.com/news/spacey-talks-superman-returns-662 |title=News: Spacey Talks Superman Returns! |publisher=Latino Review |date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marlon Brando]] appears posthumously as [[Jor-El]], Superman's biological father. Brando, who died in 2004, reprises his role from the 1978 film through the use of previous footage combined with [[computer-generated imagery]]. This required negotiations with Brando's [[estate (law)|estate]] for permission to have his footage used. Singer explained, "We had access to all of the Brando footage that was shot. There was unused footage that had Brando reciting poems, trailing off subject and [[profanity|swearing]] like a sailor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Scott Chitwood | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/supermannews.php?id=4197 | title = Superman Returns Set Visit - Part 5 | work = Superhero Hype! | date = 2006-05-05 | accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tristan Lake Leabu]] stars as Jason White, the son of Lois Lane and Superman. The question of whether Superman or Richard is Jason's father is initially unclear. He suffers from asthma and other ailments, but it is later revealed that he is the son of Superman, when he displays superhuman strength and discomfort around Kryptonite.

[[Peta Wilson]] appears as NASA spokeswoman Bobbie-Faye. [[Jack Larson]], who portrayed Jimmy Olsen in the 1950s television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', makes a [[cameo appearance]] as a [[bartender]]. [[Noel Neill]]—who portrayed Lois Lane in the television series and the [[serial film|film serials]] ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948) and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950)—appears as Luthor's elderly wife Gertrude Vanderworth. [[Richard Branson]] cameos as the engineer aboard the space shuttle. Another of Luthor's henchmen (Riley) is played by former Australian Rugby League player [[Ian Roberts (rugby league)|Ian Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348150/|title=Superman Returns (2006)|author=Mel J|date=28 June 2006|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
{{Further|Superman in film#Abandoned projects}}
Director and producer [[Bryan Singer]] conceived the storyline of "Superman returning to Earth after a five-year absence" during the filming of ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003). He presented the idea to [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] and her husband [[Richard Donner]], director of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978). Donner greeted Singer's idea with positive feedback.&lt;ref name=feed&gt;{{cite news | author = Scott Chitwood | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=4196 | title = Superman Returns Set Visit - Part 4 | work = Superhero Hype! | date = 2006-05-05 | accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, Warner Bros. was commencing [[pre-production]] on ''Superman: Flyby'', which had a target theatrical release date of June 2006. [[McG]] was signed to direct with a script by [[J. J. Abrams]], but dropped out in June 2004. That same month, Singer was approached by Warner Bros. to [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] his idea for ''Superman Returns'', as he was preparing to leave for Hawaii on a short vacation with his ''X2'' writers [[Michael Dougherty]] and [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]]. While in Hawaii, Singer, Dougherty and Harris began to outline the [[film treatment]].&lt;ref name="Posey" /&gt; In July 2004, Singer signed on to direct and develop ''Superman Returns''.&lt;ref name="cite" /&gt;

Although he was not a comic book fan, Singer was most impressed with Donner's 1978 film, citing it as an influence of his, Dougherty and Harris's writing.&lt;ref name="cite" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Harry Knowles]] | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=18653 | title = Bryan Singer on Superman! | date = 2004-10-20 | work = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Singer's hiring, he dropped out of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) and also had the ''Logan's Run'' remake pushed back.&lt;ref name="cite"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Michael Fleming |author2=Cathy Dunkley | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117907948 | title = Supe's on with 'X' man | date = 2004-07-18 | work = Variety | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Superman Returns'' was financed 50/50 between Warner Bros. and [[Legendary Entertainment|Legendary Pictures]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Pamela McClintock | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117931953 | title = Legendary soups up pic presence | work = Variety | date = 2005-10-30 | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pre-production began in November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Cathy Dunkley | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117912211 | title = Singer's Superman ready to don cape | work = Variety | date = 2004-10-19 | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2005, Dougherty and Harris had written six drafts of the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Ghostboy | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=19526 | title = Ghostboy Interviews Dan Harris!! | date = 2005-03-01 | work = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | accessdate = 2008-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of the script contained references to the [[September 11 attacks]] before they were removed.&lt;ref name="Posey" /&gt;

Warner Bros. considered shooting ''Superman Returns'' at [[Warner Roadshow Studios]] in the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], Australia. After filming, this could have been used as an attraction for the adjoining [[Warner Bros.

=== Budget ===
Originally budgeted at $184.5 million, Warner Bros. placed the final production cost at $223 million, coming down to $204 million after factoring in tax rebates and incentives.

The estimated cost of marketing ''Superman Returns'' in the United States was $45.5 million{{fact|date=May 2018}}, the second-highest of the year behind [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s $53.5 million campaign for ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/30/1|title=Fade to red|first=David|last=Teather|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2007-11-30|accessdate=2009-09-30|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. made [[tie-in]] deals with [[General Mills]], [[Burger King]], [[Duracell]], [[Pepsi]], [[Doritos]], [[Papa John's Pizza]], [[7-Eleven]] and [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]].&lt;ref name="promo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://promomagazine.com/mag/marketing_superman_soars_mm/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028162338/http://promomagazine.com/mag/marketing_superman_soars_mm/ | archivedate = 2007-10-28 | title = Superman Soars With Over $280 MM in Tie-Ins | work = Promo Magazine | date = 2006-06-01 | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was also advertised with [[Red Bull Racing]] [[Formula One]] cars at the [[2006 Monaco Grand Prix]].

=== Box office ===
Bryan Singer convinced Warner Bros. not to experiment with [[test screening]]s. In addition, Singer removed 15 minutes of footage from ''Superman Returns'' after showing it to some of his "trusted associates". The final theatrical time length ran at 154 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Pamela McClintock | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946871 | title = Filmmakers resist putting pix to the test | work = Variety | date = 2006-07-16 | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. originally slated the movie for release on Friday, June 30, but moved it up to Wednesday, June 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Stax | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/710/710606p1.html | title = Superman's New Date | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2006-05-30 | accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Superman Returns'' was released on June 28, 2006 in the United States and Canada in 4,065 theaters. The film ranked at the top in its opening weekend, grossing $52.5 million.&lt;ref name="box" /&gt;

''Superman Returns: An IMAX 3D Experience'' was released simultaneously in 111 [[IMAX]]-format theatres worldwide, which included 20 minutes of converted [[3D film]] material. It was the first Hollywood full-length live-action film to be released in this combined format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Pamela McClintock | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940662 | title = Super project for Imax | work = Variety | date = 2006-03-30 | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key scenes Singer took out was "the Return to Krypton sequence". Ten million dollars was spent on this sequence alone, but it was deleted. Singer noted that it could not be released as part of a DVD featurette because it was converted to IMAX 3D. He hoped it could have appeared in an IMAX [[reissue]].&lt;ref name="market" /&gt; The film's second-week gross rapidly declined from the first week, due to the presence of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]''.&lt;ref name="dead"&gt;{{cite news | author = Scott Bowles |url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-07-02-box-office-analysis_x.htm | title = High-altitude takeoff for ''Superman'' | date = 2006-07-03 | work = [[USA Today]] | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Superman Returns'' went on to gross $200,081,192 in North America and $191 million internationally, earning $391,081,192 worldwide.&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=superman06.htm |title=Superman Returns (2006) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically, the film was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2006&amp;p=.htm | title = 2006 Domestic Grosses | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In worldwide totals, ''Superman Returns'' was ninth-highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2006&amp;p=.htm | title = 2006 Worldwide Grosses | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Superman Returns'' has an approval rating of 75% based on 260 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Bryan Singer's reverent and visually decadent adaptation gives the Man of Steel welcome emotional complexity. The result: a satisfying stick-to-your-ribs adaptation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_returns | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title = Superman Returns (2006) | accessdate = March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 72 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/superman-returns | work = [[Metacritic]] | title = Superman Returns reviews | accessdate = 2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150405021357/http://m.cinemascore.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-05 |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' praised ''Superman Returns'', calling it one of the best [[superhero film]]s. He was mostly impressed with Singer's direction and the storyline.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1205367,00.html | title = The Gospel of Superman | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 2006-06-18 | accessdate = 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Morgenstern]] from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' also gave a positive review, but observed Routh's and Bosworth's acting was "somewhat dead or super average. Nothing special." Morgenstern believed Lex Luthor's characterization was "well written by the writers and well played by Kevin Spacey". He also praised Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography and Guy Hendrix Dyas's production design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Joe Morgenstern]] | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115144171019392218?mod=weekend_leisure_banner_left | title = Saving the Day | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 2006-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]], writing in ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', felt the film "perfectly updates Superman for the modern audience".&lt;ref name="adopt"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Peter Travers]] | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/7222783/review/10638508/superman_returns | title = Superman Returns | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | date = 2006-06-22 | accessdate = 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called it "surprisingly well made. It's a summer [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] filled with [[mythology]] and sensitivity."&lt;ref name="J"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[J. Hoberman]] | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-06-20/film/myths-american/ | title = Myths American | work = [[The Village Voice]] | date = 2006-06-20 | accessdate = 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] reacted positively to the movie, comparing it favorably with Richard Donner's 1978 film. He felt Spacey was better than Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, describing him as "more cruel and less flippant" than Hackman. "There are no miscasts to be found in the supporting cast, either," Berardinelli said. "''Superman Returns'' is near the top, if not at the top of the superhero movie pile. It offers nearly everything: romance, action, humor, and plenty of [[goose bumps]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[James Berardinelli]] | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/superman_returns.html | title = Superman Returns | work = ReelViews.net | accessdate = 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Roger Ebert]] argued the film was a "glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects sequences seem dutiful instead of exhilarating." He also felt that "Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman", surmising that he "may have been cast because he looks a little like Reeve".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060626/REVIEWS/60606009/1023 | title = Superman Returns | date = 2006-06-27 | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' felt that Warner Bros. should have [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] the series along the lines of ''[[Batman Begins]]''. He also felt Bosworth, at 22 years old, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] did not "match the potential of the tiring 154-minute-long film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Mick LaSalle]] | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/27/DDGTSJJOPK1.DTL&amp;type=movies | title = He's Back | work = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = 2006-06-27 | accessdate = 2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other commentary===

On May 3, 2009, almost three years after the debut of ''Superman Returns'', the [[Academy Award]]-winning filmmaker and screenwriter [[Quentin Tarantino]] declared his appreciation for Bryan Singer's directorial work on ''Superman Returns'' and that he would write a 20-page review about ''Superman Returns''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/style/tmagazine/03taranw.html | title = The Call Back | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date= 2009-05-03 |accessdate=2009-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2012, more than five years after the movie was released, the independent film community daily news site [[IndieWire]] released a two-part video essay that probes the [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]] nature of ''Superman Returns''. Produced by Matt Zoller Seitz and Ken Cancelosi, the critique was inspired by a review that Seitz wrote for the ''[[New York Press]]'' in 2006, in which he stated that "From the moment its hero returns to the sky to rescue Lois Lane from a plummeting jet, ''Superman Returns'' flirts with greatness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/video-essay | title = Deep Focus: Superman Returns | publisher = ''[[indieWire]]'' |date= 2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Singer stated that ''Superman Returns'' was made for "Perhaps more of a female audience. It wasn't what it needed to be, I guess." Singer stated that he would have cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with "the jet disaster sequence or something. I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly. I don't know what would have helped. Probably nothing. If I could go again, I would do an origin. I would reboot it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/bryan-singer-says-superman-returns-was-made-for-more-of-a-female-audience-sequel-wouldve-featured-darkseid-20140204|work=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=February 5, 2014|author=Brock, Ben|title=Bryan Singer Says 'Superman Returns' Was Made For "More Of A Female Audience," Sequel Would've Featured Darkseid|date=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' ranked the movie 496 on its "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/71.asp |title=Empire Features |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating, "It may have been a slighter return than some people had hoped for, but Singer's vision of the ''Man of Steel'' is an heroic effort. Plenty of spectacle and a lot of heart helps Kal-El soar."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/500/1.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accolades ===
''Superman Returns'' was nominated for both the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects]], but lost to ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1226171983819 | title = Superman Returns | work = [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] | accessdate = 2008-11-08 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?sq=Superman+Returns | title = Superman Returns | work = [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] | accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was successful at the [[33rd Saturn Awards]], winning [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]], and categories for [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Direction]] (Bryan Singer), [[Saturn Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Brandon Routh), [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Writing]] (Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) and [[Saturn Award for Best Music|Music]] (John Ottman).

In August 2008, Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected, "''Superman Returns'' didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had ''Superman'' worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Lauren A.

A reboot of the ''[[Superman in film|Superman film series]]'' titled ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' was ultimately released on June 14, 2013, directed by [[Zack Snyder]] and with [[Henry Cavill]] starring as Superman. This would become the first film in the [[DC Extended Universe]].

Switchboard has earned exposure on many news outlets in Miami including television stations such as [[WFOR-TV|WFOR 4]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neighbors4neighbors.org/index.php?social "List of Human Services"], ''WFOR 4''. 24 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[WTVJ|WTVJ 6]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bamnbc6.wordpress.com/12/ "You Never Know Who You Might Meet Or What You Might Learn"], ''WTVJ 6''. 24 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[WPLG|WPLG 10]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justnews.com/news/4919920/detail.html "How You Can Help Hurricane Katrina Victims"], ''WPLG 10'', September 16, 2005. 24 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as printed media such as [[The Miami Herald]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/22/1743293/switchboard-of-miami-a-lifeline.html "Switchboard of Miami a lifeline for many needs"], ''Miami Herald'', July 23, 2010. 27 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Miami New Times]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1994-08-24/news/reach-out-and-help-someone "Reach Out and Help Someone"], ''Miami New Times'', August 24, 1994. 27 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This press coverage often leads to stronger partnerships, such as the [http://www.justnews.com/news/16684385/detail.html Care Force] initiative created by WPLG 10, which connected philanthropic individuals in the community to stories they would see in a segment during WPLG's news broadcasts. The partnership allowed viewers to access a helpline answered by Switchboard, providing help in order to fill the needs of those featured in the segment.

==Company information==

===History===
In 1968, Switchboard of Miami began as a hotline created by three volunteers to help connect college students to resources that would assist them in finding affordable housing options in Miami-Dade County. Soon after, as the [[Republican National Convention]] was taking place in Miami during the time, city officials reached out to the volunteers to ask for their help in maintaining order. The [[Vietnam War]] was part of the public agenda, and millions of residents were furious about how it affected their lives. The volunteers agreed to help, and were soon inundated with calls regarding issues far more complex than housing troubles.

Shortly thereafter, the volunteers incorporated to become Switchboard of Miami, Inc. and expanded their hotline services, clinical services and assistance to the community. A full company timeline can be found below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.switchboardmiami.org/Pages/OurVisionMissionValues/tabid/58/Default.aspx "Switchboard of Miami Vision, Mission &amp; Values"], ''Switchboard of Miami''. 25 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1968:''' Three volunteers meet in a church basement and create a loosely organized housing hotline to connect Miami Dade Community College (now [[Miami Dade College]]) students with potential roommates and landlords. City officials contact the volunteers for help with the anticipated Vietnam War protestors who would likely create havoc as the Republican National Convention convened here. They agree and the "housing hotline" begins to receive calls from visiting dissenters that go beyond housing needs to a myriad of issues such as hunger, drug and alcohol abuse, violence and so on. Because many of the callers were young, the housing hotline was nicknamed the "hippie hotline."
* '''1970:''' The organization officially incorporates as Switchboard of Miami, Inc. and continues to offer HELPline services.
* '''1980:''' Direct, face-to-face prevention and clinical services for youth and their families are offered in schools and the community to help strengthen and maintain local family units.
* '''1980-81:''' Over 125,000 Cubans arrive in South Florida as part of the [[Mariel Boatlift]]. About 10% of the refugees were from mental institutions and prisons and are in need of crisis services. The HELPline expands to offer a special hotline specifically for the immigrants. Services are offered in English and Spanish. Several years later, Creole is added.
* '''Mid 1980s:''' The use of [[crack cocaine]] explodes in Miami-Dade County. To provide [[substance abuse]] services, Switchboard becomes licensed by the Florida Department of Children and Families (then HRS). The HELPline employs updated phone counseling methods, case management and referrals for people with drug and alcohol problems. Telephone services now include comprehensive follow-up.
* '''1990:''' Teen Link, 24-hour hotline for younger residents, is added. Using prerecorded messages, teens are able to easily access a variety of factual information over the phone. If needed, they can speak with a counselor. The line still exists today and has received over 2.5 million calls since its inception.
* '''1992:''' The HELPages become the first comprehensive printed social services in the county. A critical resource tool for service providers and other organizations, the directory is in great demand. Today, the HELPages are available on-line.
* '''1993:''' [[Hurricane Andrew]] devastates South Florida and the HELPline receives more than 1,500 calls each day. Switchboard works with other organizations like the [[American Red Cross]], the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]], and the United Way to coordinate post-disaster information. In [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] and [[Cutler Ridge, Florida|Cutler Ridge]], Switchboard staff are deployed to offer crisis counseling and referrals. Switchboard is a co-founder of the county's [http://www.flvoad.org/ Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (DC-VOAD)]. Years later, Switchboard still participates in annual disaster preparedness planning and works closely with the local [[Office of Emergency Management]]. When a disaster is pending, Switchboard sends a team of crisis counselors to the center for the [http://www.floridadisaster.org/ Florida Division of Emergency Operations] and the HELPline remains open during the worst of conditions.
* '''1997:''' Concerned about violence directed at the [[gay community]], Switchboard creates an Anti-Violence hotline to serve as a resource to help victims of violence and to build awareness and acceptance about gay/lesbian issues.
* '''Late 1990s:''' Switchboard begins to offer specialty lines such as: [http://www.miamirivermarinegroup.com/qat99/enforcement2.html Miami River Hotline] (environmental concerns); [http://www.floridajobs.org/workforce/wel_trans.html WAGES] Hotline (for those transitioning out of the [[welfare]] system); [http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/programs/access/ ACCESS] Hotline (for people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and their families); and, United Way Careline (donors). As community needs change, lines are added and discontinued.
* '''2000:''' New direct service programs are added to deal with a variety of issues related to youth: substance abuse; [[truancy]]; [[domestic violence]]; and [[pregnancy prevention]].  Switchboard also launched direct services sponsored by federal funding to replicate research related to best-practices, and evidenced based curriculum.
* '''2003:''' Switchboard becomes the local certified 2-1-1 Provider; later, The Children's Trust funds the 2-1-1 line.
* '''2006:''' Seniors Never Alone, an in- and out- bound program to ensure the well-being of [[senior citizens]] is established.
* '''2008:''' Switchboard begins to answer 2-1-1 for wireless phone callers in [[Collier County, Florida|Collier]] and [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe]] Counties. In total, Switchboard answers 183,000 phone calls in 2008.
* '''2009:''' Named as an official back-up for Lifeline, Switchboard begins to receive suicide-related calls from Spanish callers nationwide and English-speakers from the Southeastern United States, while remaining the Lifeline Center for Miami-Dade callers. Today, Switchboard averages about 1700 suicide-related calls. Also, a special two-year funded project from the Dade Foundation creates BrAIve, a helpline for veterans and active personnel of the [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] military arenas and their families.

===Vision===
Switchboard of Miami's vision is "to be the premier organization that provides and connects people with the human services they need."

===Mission statement===
The mission statement reads "Switchboard of Miami connects all people in need with community resources, provides counseling and empowers individuals [[24/7]] with just one call."

==Criticism==

=== Visibility ===
Although Switchboard has been in business for over 40 years, there are people in Miami who are not aware of the organization's existence. They lack the visibility that an organization with such a long history might be expected to have. Many believe the 2-1-1 hotline is answered by The Children's Trust and associate the line with the company, even though Switchboard answers the line and provides the services for it. While thousands of people rely on Switchboard's services and may even have been helped by the organization in the past, they are sometimes unable to associate the organization's brand with its services.

===Technology===
As the means by which people seek out and gather information changes, it is possible that telephone hotlines such as the HELPline managed by Switchboard will need to change quickly and adapt to meet people's needs in the coming years. People are becoming less reliant on personal communication for information and instead turn to new forms of information search such as the [[Internet]], [[database]] systems and [[social networking sites]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9846">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Da Vinci Code'' in the Philippines}}
[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|''The Da Vinci Code'']] is a 2006 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[mystery film|mystery]]-[[thriller film|thriller]] [[Motion picture|film]] [[Film director|directed]] by [[Ron Howard]].  The screenplay was written by [[Akiva Goldsman]] and based on [[Dan Brown]]'s worldwide bestselling 2003 novel, ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.  It was produced by Howard with [[John Calley]] and [[Brian Grazer]] and released by [[Columbia Pictures]] in the [[United States]] on May 19, 2006.

Due to [[Inaccuracies in The Da Vinci Code|controversial and inaccurate historical interpretations]] and perceived [[anti-Catholic]] elements, the film proved highly controversial in the [[Philippines]], a [[Religion in the Philippines|highly religious]] country in [[Southeast Asia]] in which [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] is [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|widely practised]]. Many organisations protested and organised [[boycott]]s against the showing of ''The Da Vinci Code'' in the Philippines, and the film was banned from being shown in the Philippine capital of [[Manila]].

==Initial reactions==

The Philippine Alliance Against Pornography (PAAP) appealed to [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to stop the showing of ''The Da Vinci Code'' in the [[Philippines]]. They branded the film as "the most [[pornography|pornographic]] and blasphemous film in history" and also requested the help of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and other religious groups to stop the showing of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl104011.htm| publisher= newsflash.org| title= Anti-pornography group asked GMA to Ban 'The Da Vinci Code'| location= Philippines| date= April 19, 2006| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060421153237/http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl104011.htm| archivedate= April 21, 2006| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they compared [[Dan Brown]] to [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Da Vinci Code round-up {{!}} MediaWatchWatch|url=http://www.mediawatchwatch.org.uk/2006/04/28/da-vinci-code-round-up/|website=www.mediawatchwatch.org.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Cecille Guidote Alvarez, Philippine Presidential Adviser on Culture and the Arts, said [[Malacañang]] will not interfere in controversy about the film and leaves the decision to the Movie and Television Classification Board's (MTRCB) rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/may/10/yehey/top_stories/20060510top2.html| publisher=The Manila Times| title=Palace sidesteps ‘Da Vinci’ storm| location=Philippines| date=April 19, 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515213659/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/may/10/yehey/top_stories/20060510top2.html| archivedate=May 15, 2006| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, MTRCB decided to give ''The Da Vinci Code'' an R-18 rating (restricted to those under 18 years of age) despite PAAP's opposition for showing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.inq7.net/entertainment/index.php?index=1&amp;story_id=76039 | publisher= inq7.net| title= ‘Da Vinci Code’ for adults only, says film review body  | location=Philippines| date=May 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippine Catholic Bishops reactions==

[[Jaro, Iloilo|Jaro]] Archbishop Angel Lagdameo, president of the [[Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines]] (CBCP), expressed through a pastoral letter that even though ''The Da Vinci Code'' is a work of fiction, it "shapes the imagination, stirs emotions and forms mental associations" and added that "Brown has created the impression that his fiction is historical fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= 
http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&amp;story_id=75610 | publisher= inq7.net| title= 
Bishops break silence on 'Da Vinci Code' | location=Philippines| date=May 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the pastoral letter was written, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lipa|Lipa Archdiocese]] Archbishop Ramon Arguelles, CBCP senior member, wrote Consoliza Laguardia, chairperson of the Movie and Television Classification Board (MTRCB), and requested her to prohibit the film's showing in the Philippines, where the majority are Christians, because of its "[[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]]" and "[[Blasphemy|blasphemous]]" nature. 

[[Gaudencio Rosales|Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales]], archbishop of Manila, said that the film is a "vicious attack on the divinity of Jesus Christ". He also added that "not since the time of the [[Presbyter]] [[Arius]] was there an attack on the divinity of Jesus Christ, which was as vicious and as momentarily profitable as this venture of Dan Brown and Sony Film Productions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2006/05/13/news/rp.catholic.bishops.slam.da.vinci.code..html | publisher= Sun Star Manila| title=
RP Catholic bishops slam 'Da Vinci Code' | location=Philippines| date=May 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the CBCP and Cardinal Rosales didn't categorically demand for a ban of the film, they have issued guidelines for Filipino Catholics on watching the film. 

Just like MTRCB's rating, Fr. Mario Sobrejuanite, vice chairman of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines-Catholic Initiative for Enlightened Movie Appreciation (CBCP-Cinema), rated ''The Da Vinci Code'' as R-18 and stated that the film is something that [[Roman Catholicism in The Philippines|Catholics]] should not be afraid of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbcponline.net/html/news1-may18.html | publisher= CBCP News Online| title= CINEMA gives Da Vinci Code Adult Rating | location=Philippines| date=May 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the CBCP-Cinema rated the [[morality|moral]] assessment on the film as "disturbing."

==Sentiment of a Filipino Muslim==
The [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] Deputy Chairman Khaled Musa appealed to the MTRCB to ban the film, arguing that the film is blasphemous not only to Catholics but also to [[Muslim]]s because Jesus Christ is considered one of the [[Prophets of Islam]].  Musa recalled [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] with regards to this film and further explained that freedom of expression should not "invade" [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2006/05/12/news/moro.militants.want.da.vinci.code.banned.html | publisher= Sun Star Davao| title=
Moro militants want 'Da Vinci Code' banned | location=Philippines| date=May 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banning in Manila==
The [[Cities of the Philippines|City]] Councilors of [[Manila]] passed a resolution to ban the film, labeling it as "offensive and contrary to established religious beliefs which cannot take precedence over the right of the persons involved in the film to [[freedom of expression]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= 
http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&amp;story_id=76260 | publisher= inq7.net| title= 
City of Manila bans ‘Da Vinci Code’  | location=Philippines| date=May 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Councilors who concur to the resolution cited the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]] stating that showing a film which offends a [[religion]] is a [[crime]], while Councilors who opposed the resolution stated that the film is only [[fiction]] and for [[entertainment]].  It was stated that cinema owners not heeding to the ban would face a one-year jail term and a [[Philippine Peso|Php]] 5,000 fine and those persons selling [[DVD]] or [[VCD]] copies of the film could be fined Php 3,000 and jailed for up to six months. It was not banned in any of the other cities in [[Metro Manila]], making the film easily accessible to citizens living in the capital.

==Banning in SM Malls==
The [[SM Supermalls]], the largest chain of [[shopping mall]]s in the Philippines, prohibited the showing of ''The Da Vinci Code'' in all of their [[movie theater]]s throughout the country.  This decision is in line with their policy for not showing films that were rated by MTRCB as R-18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= 
http://news.inq7.net/entertainment/index.php?index=1&amp;story_id=76266 | publisher= inq7.net| title=  No 'Da Vinci' in SM malls | location=Philippines| date=May 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although, ''The Da Vinci Code'' was banned in the City of Manila and all SM Malls, it was still shown in other cinemas all over the Philippines. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&amp;story_id=76260]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robinsons Malls]] Movieworld, Gaisano Cinemas, Ayala Malls Cinemas, Glorietta Cinemas are a few of the cinema companies that showed the film.

==Proposed abolition of MTRCB==
Despite ''The Da Vinci Code's'' R-18 rating by the MTRCB, [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Congressman]] [[Benny Abante|Bienvenido Abante Jr]]. rallied to abolish the MTRCB for allowing the film to be shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

In Cebu City, city moralist Rene Josef Bullecer said that the law that created the MTRCB does not allow the showing of the movie. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2006/05/11/news/cebu.church.leaders.on.movie.it.s.up.to.you..html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Painted Bird '''''is a 1965 [[novel]] by [[Jerzy Kosiński]] which describes [[World War II]] as seen by a boy, considered a "Gypsy or Jewish stray,"&lt;ref name="Kauvar"/&gt;  wandering about small villages scattered around an unspecified country in Eastern Europe. The story was originally introduced by Kosiński as [[autobiographical]]. It was only upon its publication by [[Houghton Mifflin]] that he quietly refrained from making such claims any further. Assumed by reviewers to be a [[memoir]] of a Jewish survivor and witness to the Holocaust telling the supposed true story of his search for the deported family, the book received enthusiastic reviews. However, within two decades it was discovered that the story was not only fictional,&lt;ref name="Begley2008"/&gt; but also plagiarized from popular books written in the Polish language, largely unknown to English readers.&lt;ref name="Grabowska"/&gt;

It is almost certain that Kosiński did not write the novel himself since his command of English was too limited around the time the novel was written. In a series of articles in newspapers and books which followed, it was revealed that Kosiński engaged in wilful deception in order to corroborate the claim of being separated from his family,&lt;ref name="Begley2008"/&gt; and that he did not share any of the boy's experiences.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; Unlike the main character of the novel, Kosiński spent the times of war hidden by a Polish Catholic family who confirmed that his living conditions were excellent; he even had a female servant to look after his needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kielce - July 4, 1946: Background, Context and Events |year=1996 |page=139 |authors=Tadeusz Piotrowski [[et al]] |via=Google Books, Snippet view |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtFtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22A+servant+cleaned+their+quarters+and+Jerzy+had+a+nanny.%22&amp; |publisher=Polish Educational Foundation in North America |quote="A servant cleaned their quarters and Jerzy had a nanny."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==
The book describes the wandering boy's encounters with peasants engaged in all forms of sexual and social deviance such as [[incest]], [[bestiality]] and [[rape]], and in other forms of extreme violence exciting lust. The book title was drawn from an incident in the story. The boy, while in the company of a professional bird catcher, observes how the man took one of his captured birds and painted it several colors. Then he released the bird to fly in search of a flock of its kin, but when the painted bird came upon the flock, they saw it as an intruder and viciously attacked the bird until it fell from the sky.

===The plot===
''The Painted Bird'' is told from the perspective of a young boy during World War II. He is a Jewish stray struggling to live during this chaotic period, although Kosiński's narrator denies being Jewish.&lt;ref name="Kauvar"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy6hm_qBtIgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gypsy%20or%20Jewish%20stray%22&amp;f=false | title=Cynthia Ozick's Fiction: Tradition and Invention | publisher=Indiana University Press | date=1993 | accessdate=22 June 2015 | author=Elaine Kauvar | pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story begins by introducing the war and linking it with the boy. The young boy's parents are hiding from the Germans, and he lives in a village with an elderly woman. When the woman dies, he is left to care for himself. From here, he journeys to another village where local townspeople turn him over to the Germans. He escapes and travels to another village, where he sees Jews and Gypsies headed to concentration camps. It is here that Kosiński adds some social commentary, describing the boy's belief that to have fair hair and blue eyes is to be favored by God. Kosiński sums up a Bosch-like world of harrowing excess where senseless violence and untempered hatred are the norm. The boy travels from village to village in Eastern Europe. Throughout the rest of the book, the boy endures various kinds of violence and cruelty.  He wanders alone from one village to another, sometimes hounded and tortured, only rarely sheltered and cared for. He becomes an altar boy, and he is exposed to father-daughter incest. After being thrown into a manure pit, he becomes mute. Only at the end of the novel does he become reunited with his parents and regain his speech.

==Literary significance and criticism==
In his 1965 editorial review [[Elie Wiesel]] wrote that the book was "one of the best... Written with deep sincerity and sensitivity," a review written in ''[[The New York Times]]'' Book Review and quoted by the book's publisher.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|title=Everybody's Victim|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03EFDB123CEE3ABC4950DFB667838E679EDE&amp;legacy=true|website=New York Times|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Kluger]], reviewing it for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', wrote: "Extraordinary... literally staggering ... one of the most powerful books I have ever read."&lt;ref name="BN"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Painted Bird [Nook Book]|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/painted-bird-jerzy-n-kosinski/1101317543?ean=9780802195753|website=Barnes and Noble|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Jonathan Yardley, reviewing it for ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', wrote: "Of all the remarkable fiction that emerged from World War II, nothing stands higher than Jerzy Kosiński's ''The Painted Bird''. A magnificent work of art, and a celebration of the individual will. No one who reads it will forget it; no one who reads it will be unmoved by it. ''The Painted Bird'' enriches our literature and our lives".&lt;ref name="BN"/&gt; According to [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Cynthia Ozick]] said "that she 'immediately' recognized Kosiński's authenticity as 'a Jewish survivor and witness to the Holocaust.'"&lt;ref name="NF"&gt;Norman G. Finkelstein, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrqK5VdO2i0C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=%22she+'immediately'+recognized+Kosi%C5%84ski's+authenticity+%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=52xu3jyWpo&amp;sig=0n3VtM94EeH4Ksj89wIfzuSaPco&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result ''The Holocaust Industry'', Published by Verso, page 56]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine included the novel in its "Time 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005",&lt;ref&gt;Time Inc., 2005, "Critics Lev Grossman and Richard Lacayo pick the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to the present"[http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,the_painted_bird,00.html] by Lev Grossman&lt;/ref&gt; accentuating the alleged atrocities perceived by the protagonist.

Reviewing [[James Park Sloan]]'s biography of Kosiński for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', [[Louis Begley]] wrote: "Perhaps the most surprising element of this aspect of Kosiński's mystifications is that he obtained from his mother, who was still alive in Poland &amp;ndash; the father had died by the time ''The Painted Bird'' was published – a letter corroborating the claim that he had been separated from his family during the war."&lt;ref name="Begley2008"&gt;Louis Begley, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04EEDF1F39F932A15757C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all  "True Lies"],  ''New York Times" Books section, Friday, August 15, 2008. Originally published: April 21, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Finkelstein]], former professor of [[political science]] at [[DePaul University]], wrote in ''[[The Holocaust Industry]]'': "Long after Kosiński was exposed as a consummate literary [[hoaxer]], Wiesel continued to heap encomiums on his 'remarkable body of work.'"&lt;ref name="NF" /&gt; Finkelstein wrote that Kosiński's book "depicts the Polish peasants he lived with as virulently anti-Semitic" even though they were fully aware of his Jewishness and "the dire consequences they themselves faced if caught."&lt;ref name="NF-2"&gt;Norman G. Finkelstein, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VrqK5VdO2i0C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=%22depicts+the+Polish+peasants+he+lived+with%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=52xu3jzUmv&amp;sig=Ev5Ny_DE6wFigXkywHRX6ZmNv1w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result  ''The Holocaust Industry'', Page 55]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's reception in Poland was far from uniform. The Polish literary critic and [[University of Warsaw]] professor, Paweł Dudziak, noted that the ''Painted Bird'' is a ''great, if controversial'' piece. He stressed that since the book is surreal – a fictional tale – and does not present, or claim to present &amp;ndash; real world events, accusations of [[anti-Polish sentiment]] are nothing but a misunderstanding of the book by those who take it too literally.&lt;ref name="culture.pl"&gt;Paweł Dudziak (2003), [http://www.culture.pl/web/english/resources-film-full-page/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/jerzy-kosinski "Jerzy Kosiński"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Culture.pl. Last accessed on 10 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Polish literary historian Prof. Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska [[:pl:Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska|(pl)]] from [[Maria Curie-Skłodowska University|Lublin University]] wrote that ''The Painted Bird'' published in 1965, includes long excerpts lifted verbatim from a book published in the [[Second Polish Republic]] by the [[Polish-Jewish]] ethnographer [[Henryk Biegeleisen]].&lt;ref name="Grabowska"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CMeS2WOSWMC&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=Kariera%20Nikodema%20Dyzmy&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q=Kariera%20Nikodema%20Dyzmy&amp;f=false | title=The Role of Polish Language and Literature | publisher=University of Texas Press | work=The Hidden Isaac Bashevis Singer ''by Seth L.

===Authorship controversy===
According to [[Eliot Weinberger]], contemporary [[American literature|American]] writer, [[essayist]], [[Editing|editor]], and [[translator]],  Kosiński was not the author of the book. Weinberger alleged in his collection ''Karmic Traces'' that Kosiński had very little fluent knowledge of English at the time of its writing.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Weinberger, "Genuine Fakes" from his collection ''Karmic Traces''; New Directions, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

M. A. Orthofer addressed Weinberger's assertion by saying:
"Kosinski was, in many respects, a fake &amp;ndash; possibly near as genuine a one as Weinberger could want. (One aspect of the best fakes is the lingering doubt that, possibly, there is some authenticity behind them &amp;ndash; as is the case with Kosinski.) Kosinski famously liked to pretend he was someone he wasn't (as do many of the characters in his books), he occasionally published under a [[pseudonym]], and, apparently, he plagiarized and forged left and right." &lt;ref&gt;M.A.Orthofer (February 2001), [http://www.complete-review.com/quarterly/vol2/issue1/ffakes.htm "Facts and Fakes."] The Complete Review Quarterly.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of plagiarism===
In June 1982, a ''[[Village Voice]]'' article accused Kosiński of [[plagiarism]], claiming much of his work was derivative of Polish sources unfamiliar to English readers. (''[[Being There (novel)|Being There]]'', for example, bears a strong resemblance to ''Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy'' &amp;ndash; ''[[The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma]]'', a 1932 Polish bestseller by [[Tadeusz Dołęga-Mostowicz]]). The article also claimed that Kosiński's books had actually been ghost-written by his "assistant editors," pointing to striking [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] differences among Kosiński's novels. The New York poet, publisher and translator [[George Reavey]] claimed to have written ''The Painted Bird.'' However, in the opinion of Kosiński's American biographer [[James Park Sloan|James Sloan]], [[George Reavey|Reavey]] was simply embittered by his own lack of literary success. Regardless, Reavey's assertions were ignored by the press.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html ''Books in Review: Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Village Voice'' article presented a different picture of Kosiński's life during [[the Holocaust]] &amp;ndash; a view which was later supported by [[Joanna Siedlecka]], a Polish biographer, and Sloan. The article revealed that ''The Painted Bird,'' assumed by reviewers to be semi-[[autobiographical]], was a work of fiction. The article maintained that rather than wandering the Polish countryside, Kosiński had spent the war years in hiding with a Polish Catholic family who saved his life from the Germans (incidentally - a German officer is one of a few positive characters in the novel -
against the background of savage villagers) and had never been mistreated in any way.

[[Terence Blacker]], an [[England|English]] [[publisher]] of Kosiński's books and an author of children's books and mysteries for adults, wrote in response to the article's accusations in 2002:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The significant point about Jerzy Kosinski was that ... his books ... had a vision and a voice consistent with one another and with the man himself. The problem was perhaps that he was a successful, worldly author who played polo, moved in fashionable circles and even appeared as an actor in [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''.  He seemed to have had an adventurous and rather kinky sexuality which, to many, made him all the more suspect.&lt;ref name="Blacker"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020617/ai_n12627315 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214090342/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020617/ai_n12627315 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 14, 2008 |title=Plagiarism? Let's just call it postmodernism |publisher=The Independent, (London) |date=June 17, 2002 |author=Terence Blacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

D. G. Myers responded to Blacker's assertions in his review of ''Jerzy Kosiński: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This theory explains much: the reckless driving, the abuse of small dogs, the thirst for fame, the fabrication of personal experience, the secretiveness about how he wrote, the denial of his Jewish identity. 'There was a hollow space at the center of Kosiński that had resulted from denying his past,' Sloan writes, 'and his whole life had become a race to fill in that hollow space before it caused him to implode, collapsing inward upon himself like a burnt-out star.' On this theory, Kosiński emerges as a classic [[borderline personality disorder|borderline personality]], frantically defending himself against… all-out [[psychosis]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The journalist John Corry, being himself a controversial author,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EFDE1430F933A05752C0A962958260 |title=Eyeshades and Objectivity |author=Terry Teachout |date=January 30, 1994 |publisher=The New York Times |work=''Adventures in the News Trade.'' By John Corry. Book Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a 6,000-word feature article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' trying to defend Kosiński, which appeared on the front page of the "Arts and Leisure" section in November 1982. Among other things, Corry alleged that reports claiming that "Kosiński was a plagiarist in the pay of the [[C.I.A.]] were the product of a [[Polish United Workers' Party|Polish Communist]] [[disinformation]] campaign."&lt;ref&gt;John Corry (November 7, 1982), [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C1FFC3D5D0C748CDDA80994DA484D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fCorry%2c%20John "17 years of ideological attack on a cultural target."] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found}}

The book was published and marketed as a fictional work although it was generally assumed that it was based on the author's experiences during World War II. Only later did it become clear to most reviewers that Kosiński was neither the boy in the story nor did he share any of the boy's experiences, as revealed in a series of articles in newspapers and books.&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; The depicted events are now widely known to be fictional. D. G. Myers, Associate Professor of English at Texas A&amp;M University, reviewing a biography of Kosiński noted that initially the author had passed off ''The Painted Bird'' as the true story of his own life during the Holocaust: "Long before writing it he regaled friends and dinner parties with macabre tales of a childhood spent in hiding among the Polish peasantry. Among those who were fascinated was Dorothy de Santillana, a senior editor at [[Houghton Mifflin]], to whom Kosiński confided that he had a manuscript based on his experiences."&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html from Myers' review of ''Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to James Park Sloan, by the time the book was going into publication, Kosiński refrained from making further claims of the book being autobiographical &amp;ndash; in a letter to de Santillana and in a subsequent author's note to the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;James Park Sloan.
