'''50 Rockefeller Plaza''' (formerly the '''Associated Press Building''') is a 15-story building located at [[Rockefeller Plaza]] between 50th and 51st Streets in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Completed in 1938, the building is part of [[Rockefeller Center]], which was built in the [[Art Deco]] style. 

==History==
Rockefeller Center occupies three blocks in Midtown Manhattan bounded by Fifth and Sixth Avenues to the east and west, between 48th Street to the south and 51st Street to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=J. | title=Gotham Rising: New York in the 1930s | publisher=I. B. Tauris, Limited | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-78453-529-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxG3DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR18 | access-date=2017-11-23 | page=xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1936, most of the complex had been completed. Rockefeller Center Inc. only needed to develop three empty plots in the middle of the complex's northern and southern blocks.{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=93}}

Rockefeller Center's executives went into talks with the [[Associated Press]] for a building on the northern empty lot,{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=94}} which was occupied by the complex's truck delivery ramp.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=337}} The lot had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house, but the managers could not wait to develop the lot anymore, so in 1937, the opera plans were formally scrapped.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Abandons-Opera-1937"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1937/05/11/94373567.pdf|title=Rockefeller Center Abandons Opera Plans; To Build on Site Long Held for Metropolitan|date=May 11, 1937|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=91}} The lot had also been planned as a hotel site, but this was also deemed economically infeasible.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=54}} In January 1938, Associated Press agreed to rent the fourth through seventh floors of the structure, with the building to be named for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1938/01/25/96784455.pdf|title=ROCKEFELLER CITY RENTS SPACE TO A.P.; New 15-Story Building Will Be Named for News Agency, Occupying Four Floors|date=January 25, 1938|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the steelwork started in April 1938, and after 29 working days, it was topped out by June.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Steelwork-Finished-1938"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1938/06/17/98151818.pdf|title=STEEL WORK FINISHED; New 15-Story Unit in Rockefeller Center 'Topped Out'|date=June 17, 1938|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press moved into the structure in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1938/12/19/98220019.pdf|title=Associated Press Occupies New Home|date=December 19, 1938|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, located at 50 Rockefeller Plaza, was built to the outer limits of its lot without any setbacks or rooftop gardens; it rose only 15 floors because of the 1916 zoning law and the paucity of other tenants.{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=94}}{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=54}} The presence of Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center's scope from strictly a radio-communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=210}} In 1938, the Associated Press opened the Guild, a [[News cinema|newsreel theater]],{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=210}} along the curve of the truck ramp below the building.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Film-House-Opens-1938"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1938/12/02/98872206.pdf |title=FILM HOUSE OPENS TODAY; Fourth Unit in Newsreel Chain Is in Rockefeller Center|date=December 2, 1938|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Detail1_-_Rockefeller_Center.jpg|upright|right|thumb|''News'' by [[Isamu Noguchi]]]]
50 Rockefeller Plaza is located on the west side of Rockefeller Plaza between 50th and 51st Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite aia5|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only building in the Center built to the outer limits of its lot line, the 15-story building took its shape from Associated Press's need for a single, undivided, loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate—namely, a {{convert|200|by|187|ft|adj=on|m}} blocky structure with no setbacks.{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=94}} At one point, {{convert|4,000,000|ft|m}} of transmission wire were embedded in conduits on the building's fourth floor.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=209}} The complex's truck ramp descends under the building from 50th Street, while the rear of the building is located next to the  Radio City Music Hall.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=209}}{{sfn|Balfour|1978|pp=53–54}}{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=90}} The building also contained the Guild Theater, a 450-seat newsreel theater, from 1938&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Film-House-Opens-1938"/&gt; to 1999.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Closes-Theater-1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/19/nyregion/rockefeller-center-quietly-closes-theater.html |title=Rockefeller Center Quietly Closes Theater|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=1999-10-19|website=The New York Times |access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isamu Noguchi]]'s {{convert|10|ST|LT|adj=on}} stainless steel panel, ''News'', is located above the building's entrance. His work, which depicts the various forms of communications used by journalists in the 1930s, honors the different occupations in the news industry.{{sfn|Adams|1985|pp=211–212}}{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=141}} It is one of Noguchi's last abstract works as well as the only stainless steel work he ever commissioned.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=141}}

'''Ally Detroit Center''', formerly '''One Detroit Center''', is a [[List of tallest buildings in Detroit|skyscraper]] and class-A office building located downtown which overlooks the [[Detroit Financial District]]. Rising 619 feet (189&amp;nbsp;m), the 43-story tower is the tallest office building in [[Michigan]] and the second tallest building overall in the state behind the central hotel tower of the [[Renaissance Center]], located a few blocks away. Although the [[Penobscot Building]] has more floors above ground (45), those of Ally Detroit Center are taller, with its roof sitting roughly {{convert|60|ft|m}} taller than that of the Penobscot. Its floor area is {{convert|1674708|sqft|abbr=on}}.

==Architecture==
[[File:comericatowerhart.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ally Detroit Center from Jefferson Avenue]]

The building was designed by noted architects [[John Burgee]] &amp; [[Philip Johnson]], partners influential in [[postmodern architecture]].&lt;ref name=Sharoff&gt;{{Cite book | author= Sharoff, Robert | title=American City: Detroit Architecture| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=2005| isbn=0-8143-3270-6| authorlink= Robert Sharoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ally Detroit Center was constructed from 1991 to 1993. It houses numerous tenants, including many prominent Detroit law firms and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. In addition to [[retail]], the building also contains a [[restaurant]] and a [[gym]].

The building is famous for its [[postmodern architecture|postmodern architectural]] design topped with [[Flanders|Flemish]]-inspired [[gothic revival architecture|neo-gothic]] [[spire]]s which blend architecturally with the city's historic skyline.&lt;ref name=Sharoff/&gt; It is constructed mainly of [[granite]]. Sometimes called a "twin gothic structure", for its pairs of spires, it is oriented North-South and East-West (as named on a plaque along the [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] waterfront park). Ally Detroit Center won an Award of Excellence for its design in 1996. Ally Detroit Center replicas have become a souvenir item along with those of other Detroit skyscrapers.&lt;ref name=replicas&gt;[http://infocustech.com/skyscrapers/index.htm InFocusTech skyscrapers]. Retrieved on July 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Project plans for a twin tower directly to the east, '''Two Detroit Center''', were placed indefinitely on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author1=John Gallagher | author2=Dick Rochan | date=27 October 1991 | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/3674043/Unbuilt-Detroit-Detroit-Free-Press-Magazine-October-27-1991 | title=Unbuilt Detroit | work=The Detroit Free Press Magazine | accessdate=15 August 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107164526/http://www.scribd.com/doc/3674043/Unbuilt-Detroit-Detroit-Free-Press-Magazine-October-27-1991 | archive-date=2010-11-07 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Detroit Center parking garage was constructed on the site in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{emporis|270328|Two Detroit Center Garage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bloomberg Markets''''' is a monthly magazine published by [[Bloomberg L.P.]] as part of [[Bloomberg News]]. Aimed at global financial professionals, ''Bloomberg Markets'' publishes articles on the people and issues related to global financial markets. ''Bloomberg Markets'', which is based in [[New York City]], has readers in 147 countries. More than half of its readers live outside the U.S.&lt;ref name="International Circulation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|title=Where the ‘Elite’ Meet to Read|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/business/media/27Adnews.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=20 October 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2011, the magazine had a circulation of 375,000 and was available for sale at bookstores and selected newsstands. All subscribers of the Bloomberg Professional service and the [[Bloomberg Terminal]] also receive ''Bloomberg Markets'' as part of their subscription.&lt;ref name="PR Newswire"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloomberg Markets Reveals the World's Best-Paid Investment Banks|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=141336|accessdate=19 August 2011|newspaper=PR Newswire|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsstand sales averaged 6,154 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ives|first=Nat|title=Bloomberg Hunts New Advertisers for Its Other Magazine|url=http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/bloomberg-hunts-advertisers-magazine/145434/|accessdate=19 December 2011|newspaper=AdAge|date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Bloomberg Markets'' was launched in July 1992&lt;ref name=nyorkp&gt;{{cite news|author=Claire Atkinson|title=Bloomberg Markets will cease to exist as a monthly magazine|url=https://nypost.com/2015/10/15/bloomberg-markets-will-cease-to-exist-as-a-monthly-magazine/|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=New York Post|date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''"Bloomberg: A Magazine for Bloomberg Users"'' and was originally intended to be a guide for the Bloomberg Professional service.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Ian|title=MEDIA: Bloomberg's Mag To Be Launched In The UK High Street|url=http://www.prweek.com/news/rss/168343//|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=PR Week|date=17 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although every issue included instructions for navigating terminal functions, content also included articles about financial markets aimed at portfolio managers, corporate executives, brokers, bankers and securities traders. William Inman served as ''Bloomberg Markets'' founding editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brock|first=Fred|title=Making Due with Less - Voluntarily or Not|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WF4eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EskEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3247,2700957&amp;dq=bloomberg+magazine+william+inman&amp;hl=en|accessdate=19 December 2011|newspaper=Times Daily|date=21 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the magazine became part of [[Bloomberg News]] and Ronald Henkoff became editor. Prior to joining ''Bloomberg Markets'', Henkoff worked as a reporter and editor at ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Henkoff|url=http://www.bloomberglink.com/gatherings_participants_bio.php?gathering=89&amp;Id=2464|publisher=Bloomberg Link|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henkoff was tapped by Bloomberg News chief [[Matthew Winkler (journalist)|Matt Winkler]] to bolster the magazine's feature writing, which had not been a focus of the publication. In 2000, the magazine's name was changed to ''Bloomberg Markets'' and became available on newsstands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stoeffel|first=Kat|title=Always the Bridesmaid! Are Tonight’s ASME Awards ‘Bloomberg Markets" Big Moment?|url=http://www.observer.com/2011/media/always-bridesmaid-are-tonights-asme-awards-bloomberg-markets-big-moment|accessdate=19 December 2011|newspaper=New York Observer|date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2010, ''Bloomberg Markets'' was redesigned in an effort to attract a broader array of advertisers and expand its content.&lt;ref name=Moses&gt;{{cite news|last=Moses|first=Lucia|title=Bloomberg Strikes Again|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/bloomberg-strikes-again-132453|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=AdWeek|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redesign, led by ''Bloomberg Markets'' editor Ronald Henkoff and publisher [[Michael Dukmejian]] and developed by the firm of Priest + Grace, gave the publication a new, more contemporary look. In April 2011, ''Bloomberg Markets'' hired its first creative director, Siung Tjia, the former creative director of [[ESPN The Magazine]].&lt;ref name="Creative Director"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Keith J.|title=Drama for magazines after soap opera slash|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/drama_for_magazines_after_soap_opera_ymiCLz1DyWK9wAeWxfqHgI|accessdate=20 October 2011|newspaper=New York Post|date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to design changes, the editors added regular coverage of careers and personal finance following a global survey of readers.&lt;ref name=Redesign&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonneville|first=Kaitlyn|title=Bloomberg Markets magazine relaunch attracts more high-end print advertisers|url=http://www.luxurydaily.com/bloomberg-markets-magazine-ad-pages-up-30pc-with-nov-relaunch/|publisher=Luxury Daily|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the redesign, ''Bloomberg Markets'' unveiled a trade advertising campaign to position itself as the leading publication for the "global financial elite" and increased its circulation rate base from 355,000 to 375,000 by December 2011.&lt;ref name="Moses" /&gt; The campaign and shift in design lead to new advertising deals with luxury brands such as [[Range Rover]], [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Allianz]].&lt;ref name=Elliot&gt;{{cite news|last=Elliot|first=Stuart|title=Where the 'Elite' Meet to Read|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/business/media/27Adnews.html?_r=1&amp;src=busln|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal, according to Dukmejian, is for ''Bloomberg Markets'' to reach a circulation of 450,000 with 15,000 on newsstands.&lt;ref name=Mickey&gt;{{cite web|last=Mickey|first=Bill|title=Bloomberg Markets Gets a Makeover|url=http://www.audiencedevelopment.com/2010/bloomberg+markets+gets+makeover|publisher=Audience Development|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, ''Bloomberg Markets'' announced the launch of the [[50 Most Influential (Bloomberg Markets ranking)|50 Most Influential]] franchise, its list of the most influential people in global finance, which appeared in the October 2011 issue. To coincide with the issue, the magazine hosted the inaugural Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit, a day-long event, held in September 2011 in New York City.&lt;ref name="Moses" /&gt; A second 50 Most Influential ranking was published in the magazine's October 2012 issue.

''Bloomberg Markets'' would be testing a spin-off luxury title with a spring 2012 issue called ''Bloomberg Pursuits''.&lt;ref name="Lux Spin off"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moses|first=Lucia|title=Bloomberg Bows Luxe Mag|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/bloomberg-bows-luxe-mag-135656|accessdate=20 October 2011|newspaper=AdWeek|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015 it was announced by the parent company that ''Bloomberg Markets'' would reduce publication from 11 issues a year to six.&lt;ref name=nyorkp/&gt;

===Staff===
''Bloomberg Markets'' has a staff of editors in the U.S., Latin America, Europe and Asia. In addition, the magazine draws on contributions from journalists at [[Bloomberg News]], a global news service with 146 bureaus in 72 countries.&lt;ref name="FT Article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|title=Bloomberg editor casts a wider net|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/10b70754-f98e-11df-9e29-00144feab49a.html#axzz1S0KJRaSV|accessdate=15 July 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|date=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThompsonWatergate.jpg|thumb|An example of a chairman in action – [[Sam Ervin]] (right), chairing the Senate [[Watergate]] hearings, 1973]]	

The '''chairman''' (also '''chair''') is the highest officer of an organized group such as a [[Board of directors|board]], a [[committee]], or a [[deliberative assembly]]. The person holding the office is typically elected or appointed by the members of the group, and the chairman presides over [[meeting]]s of the assembled group and conducts its business in an orderly fashion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 22|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some organizations, the chairman position is also called ''[[President (corporate title)|president]]'' (or other title),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Sturgis|edition = Fourth|year = 2001|title = [[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]|isbn = 978-0-07-136513-0|publisher = McGraw-Hill|location = New York|page = 163|authorlink2 = American Institute of Parliamentarians|authorlink = Alice Sturgis|first = Alice|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; in others, where a board appoints a president (or other title), the two different terms are used for distinctly different positions.

==Terminology==
{{Wikidata property|P488}}
Other terms sometimes used for the office and its holder include ''chair'', ''chairperson'', ''chairwoman'', ''presiding officer'', ''president'', ''[[moderator (town official)|moderator]]'', ''facilitator'', and ''convenor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Marlis|editor-last=Hellinger|title=Gender across languages: The Linguistic Representation of Women and Men (IMPACT: Studies in Language and Society)|year=2001|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|isbn=90-272-1841-2|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chairperson |title=Chairperson |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=Moderator&amp;title=21st|title=moderator|work=[[Chambers 21st Century Dictionary]] via Search Chambers |publisher=[[Chambers Harrap]]|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although ''convener'' means someone who summons (convenes) a meeting, the convener may take the chair.  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, 1989) offers this citation: 1833 Act 3–4 Will. IV, c. 46 §43 "The convener, who shall preside at such committee, shall be entitled to a casting vote." This meaning is most commonly found in assemblies with Scottish heritage.&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of a parliamentary chamber is often called the ''[[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/Admin/Speaker/Speeches/1/1/9/119e71c13d954e63bd049231bdee91e9.htm|title=Speeches: The many roles of the Speaker|date=2006-02-01|publisher=Office of the Speaker, [[Parliament of New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/principal/lord_speaker.cfm |title=About Parliament: The Lord Speaker |quote=... responsibilities of the Lord Speaker include chairing the Lords debating chamber,... |accessdate=2008-10-23 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609075343/http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/principal/lord_speaker.cfm |archivedate=2008-06-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''chair'' is sometimes used in lieu of chairman, in response to criticisms that using chairman is [[sexist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|title=Sex and society Volume 1: Abstinence – Gender Identity|year=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Reference|location=New York|isbn=0-7614-7906-6|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dicrefman&gt;{{cite news | title=Chairman | year=2006 | publisher= | url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chairman | work =Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zinsser 2007 81"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zinsser|first=William|title=On writing well : the classic guide to writing nonfiction|year=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York |isbn=0-06-089154-8|page=81|edition=30. anniversary ed., 7. ed., rev. and updated, [Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Chairperson | year=2006 | publisher= | url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chairperson | work =Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1) | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-27 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used today, and has been used as a substitute for chairman since the middle of the 17th century, with its earliest citation in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dated 1658–1659, only four years after the first citation for chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's dictionary of English usage.|year=1993|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield, Mass.|isbn=0-87779-132-5|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Wiktionary|chair|chairman|chairwoman|chairperson|preside}}Major dictionaries state that the word derives from "chair" (a seat or office of authority) and "man", a person.&lt;ref name="dicrefman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the ''American Heritage Dictionary'', the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the online edition of the current Merriam-Webster Dictionary, ''Word Origins'' by Anatoly Liberman (page 88), ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'' (page 235)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===

A 1994 Canadian study found the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' newspaper referring to most presiding men as "chairman", and to most presiding women as "chairperson" or as "chairwoman". The ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' uses "chairman" for men and "chairperson" for women. An analysis of the [[British National Corpus]] found chairman used 1,142 times, chairperson 130 times and chairwoman 68 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Romaine|first= Suzanne|title= Communicating gender|year= 1999|publisher= Erlbaum|location= Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-2925-3|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Association of Parliamentarians]] does not approve using "chairperson".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing (For writers, editors and speakers)|last = Miller|first = Casey|publisher = iUniverse.com|year = 2000|isbn = 0-595-15921-4|location = Lincoln, NE|pages = 32|last2 = Swift|first2 = Kate|edition = 2nd|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KY_XiQa5PhMC&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[United Press International]] all use "chairwoman" or "chairman" when referring to women, and forbid use of "chair" or of "chairperson" except in direct quotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= editor|first= Paul R.

=== Examples ===
The word ''chair'' can refer to the place from which the holder of the office presides, whether on a chair, at a lectern, or elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During meetings, the person presiding is said to be "in the chair" and is also referred to as "the chair".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Parliamentary procedure]] requires that members address the "chair" as "Mr. (or Madam) Chairman (or Chair or Chairperson)" rather than using a name –  one of many customs intended to maintain the presiding officer's impartiality and to ensure an objective and impersonal approach.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sturgis|2001|p = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the presiding officer of the lower house of a legislative body, such as the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], is frequently titled the ''Speaker'', while the upper house, such as the [[United States Senate|Senate]], is commonly chaired by a ''President''. In his 1992 [[State of the Union address]], then-U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] used "chairman" for men and "chair" for women.

In the British [[music hall]] tradition, the Chairman was the [[master of ceremonies]] who announced the performances and was responsible for controlling any rowdy elements in the audience.  The role was popularised on British TV in the 1960s and 1970s by [[Leonard Sachs]], the Chairman on the variety show ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]''.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Richard Anthony| last1= Baker| year= 2014| title= British Music Hall: An Illustrated History| publisher= Pen &amp; Sword| location= Barnsley| page=207 | isbn= 978-1-78383-118-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Chairman" as a quasi-title gained particular resonance when socialist states from 1917 onward shunned more traditional [[leadership]] labels and stressed the collective control of ''soviets'' (councils or committees) by beginning to refer to executive figureheads as "Chairman of the X Committee". [[Vladimir Lenin]], for example, officially functioned as the head of Soviet Russia not as tsar or as president but in roles such as "Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 =  Cawthorne| first1 =  Nigel| author-link1 = Nigel Cawthorne| title = Stalin: The Murderous Career of the Red Tsar| url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=2CAEAwAAQBAJ| publisher = Arcturus Publishing| publication-date = 2012| isbn = 978-1-84858-951-3| accessdate = 2015-02-25| quote = [...] Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Molotov and Abel Yenukidze [...] began discussing the structure of the new government.

Note in particular the popular standard method for referring to [[Mao Zedong]]: "Chairman Mao" (officially: [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]]).

== Roles &amp; Responsibilities ==

=== Duties at meetings ===
[[File:Christina Magnuson group 2016.jpg|thumb|As Chairman, [[Princess Christina, Mrs. Magnuson]] presides over the 2016 annual meeting of the ''Friends of the [[Confidencen|Ulriksdal Palace Theater]]''.]]
In addition to the administrative or executive duties in organizations, the chairman has the duties of presiding over meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such duties at meetings include:

* Calling the meeting to order
* Determining if a [[quorum]] is present
* Announcing the items on the [[order of business]] or [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] as they come up
*[[Recognition (parliamentary procedure)|Recognition]] of members to have the [[Floor (legislative)|floor]]
* Enforcing the rules of the group
* Putting all questions ([[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]]) to a vote
* Adjourning the meeting

While presiding, the chairman should remain impartial and not interrupt a speaker if the speaker has the floor and is following the rules of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=44}}: "The presiding officer must never interrupt a speaker simply because he knows more about the matter than the speaker does."&lt;/ref&gt; In committees or small boards, the chairman votes along with the other members. However, in assemblies or larger boards, the chairman should vote only when it can affect the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|title=Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 1)|date=|website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher=The Robert's Rules Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#1|archivedate=2004-11-12|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting, the chairman only has one vote (i.e. the chairman cannot vote twice and cannot override the decision of the group unless the organization has specifically given the chairman such authority).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Powers and authority ===
The powers of the chairman vary widely across organizations. In some organizations the chairman has the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions, while in others the chairman only makes recommendations to a [[board of directors]], and still others the chairman has no executive powers and is mainly a [[Spokesperson|spokesman]] for the organization. The amount of power given to the chairman depends on the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.

=== Disciplinary procedures ===
If the chairman exceeds the given authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform the duties, the chairman may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include [[censure]], suspension, or [[Declare the chair vacant|removal from office]]. The rules of the particular organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures and the extent that they can be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title=Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date=|website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher=The Robert's Rules Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate=2004-11-12|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, whoever appointed or elected the chairman has the power to discipline this officer.

==Public corporations==
There are three common types of chairman in public corporations.

=== Chairman and CEO{{Anchor|Chairman and CEO}}===

* Chairman and CEO – The CEO may also hold the title of chairman, in which case the board frequently names an independent member of the board as a lead director.

=== Executive chairman ===

* Executive chairman – An office separate from that of CEO, where the titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as [[Larry Ellison]] of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Douglas Flint]] of [[HSBC]] and [[Steve Case]] of the former [[AOL Time Warner]]. In particular, the group chairmanship of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures. Prior to the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chairman essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairman oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8019235/HSBC-investors-against-Michael-Geoghegan-becoming-chairman.html HSBC investors against Michael Geoghegan becoming chairman].

Telegraph. Retrieved on 2013-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-executive chairman ===

* Non-executive chairman – also a separate post from the CEO, unlike an executive chairman, a non-executive chairman does not interfere in day-to-day company matters. Across the world, many companies have separated the roles of chairman and CEO, often resulting in a non-executive chairman, saying that this move improves corporate governance.

The non-executive chairman's duties are typically limited to matters directly related to the board, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Keith | last = Kefgen | title = The Non-Executive Chairman Comes of Age | date = 2004-05-11 | publisher = HVS | url = http://www.hvs.com/Jump/?aid=1033 | work = HVS web site | accessdate = 2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Chairing the meetings of the board.
* Organizing and coordinating the board's activities, such as by setting its annual agenda.
* Reviewing and evaluating the performance of the CEO and the other board members.

=== Examples ===
Many U.S. companies have an executive chairman, and this method of organization is sometimes called the American model. Having a non-executive chair is common in the United Kingdom and Canada, and is sometimes called the British model. Expert opinion is rather evenly divided over which is the preferable model overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/jan2008/ca2008018_642807.htm |title=Splitting the Chairman and CEO roles |accessdate=2011-04-03 |last=Behan |first=Beverly |date=10 January 2008 |work=BusinessWeek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416101510/http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/jan2008/ca2008018_642807.htm |archivedate=2011-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies with both an executive chairman and a CEO include [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=141|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511112107/http://blog.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=141|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-05-11|title=Board of Directors|publisher=[[Ford Motor Company]]|accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HSBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/about/board-of-directors|title=Board of Directors|publisher=[[HSBC]]|accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html|title=Management Team|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HP Investor Relations – Board of directors|url=http://h30261.www3.hp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=71087&amp;p=irol-govboard|publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard]]|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/bios|title=Apple – Press Info|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice chairman and deputy chairman==
A ''vice-chairman'' or ''deputy chairman'', subordinate to the chairman, is sometimes chosen to assist the chairman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/vice-chairman|title=vice-chairman|publisher=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to serve as chairman in the absence of the chairman, or when a motion involving the chairman is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of the chairman and vice chairman, groups sometimes elect a ''chairman [[pro tempore]]'' to fill the role for a single meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some organizations that have both titles, deputy chairman ranks higher than vice chairman, as there are often multiple vice chairs but only a single deputy chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbccm.com/about/cid-264063.html|title=Leadership|website=Rbccm.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of deputy chairman title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one (such as [[Ted Turner]] at Time Warner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/news/a10201/ted-turner-quits-as-aoltw-vice-chairman.html|title=Ted Turner quits as AOLTW Vice Chairman – TV News|author=|date=2003-01-29|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unrelated definition of vice chair and deputy chair describes an executive who is higher ranking or has more seniority than an [[Executive Vice President|executive vice president]] (EVP). Sometimes, EVPs report to a vice chair, who in turn reports directly to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) (so vice chairs in effect constitute an additional layer of management), while other vice chairs have more responsibilities but are otherwise on an equal tier with EVPs. Executives with the title vice chair and deputy chair are usually ''not'' members of the board of directors. The [[Royal Bank of Canada]] previously used "deputy chair" (i.e. [[Anthony S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3543">When used in [[foreign trade]], a '''commercial invoice''' is a [[customs]] document. It is used as a [[customs declaration]] provided by the person or corporation that is exporting an item across international borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedex.com/bs/tools/invoice.html FedEx - Tools - Commercial Invoice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no standard format, the document must include a few specific pieces of information such as the parties involved in the shipping transaction, the goods being transported, the country of manufacture, and the [[Harmonized System]] codes for those goods. A commercial invoice must often include a statement certifying that the invoice is true, and a signature. 

A commercial invoice is used to calculate [[tariffs]], international commercial terms (like the Cost in a CIF) and is commonly used for customs purposes.

Commercial invoices in European countries are not normally for [[payment]]. The definitive '''[[invoice]]''' for payment usually has only the words "invoice". This invoice can also be used as a commercial invoice if additional information is disclosed.

'''Competition law theory''' covers the strands of thought relating to [[competition law]] or antitrust policy.

==Classical perspective==
{{see also|Classical economics}}
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]] believed the [[restraint of trade]] doctrine was justified to preserve [[liberty]] and [[competition]]]]
The classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the [[individual liberty]] of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) Book I, Chapter 7, para 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [[Adam Smith]] also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate legal measures to combat them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN4.html#B.I,%20Ch.10,%20Of%20Wages%20and%20Profit%20in%20the%20Different%20Employments%20of%20Labour%20and%20Stock Book I, Chapter 10], para 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith also rejected the very existence of, not just dominant and abusive corporations, but [[corporation]]s at all.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) Book V, Chapter 1, para 107&lt;/ref&gt;

By the latter half of the nineteenth century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s approach was laid down in his treatise ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society... both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil..."&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1859) Chapter V, para 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of the word "society" to mean the state, and the false claim that because a "social act" effects the "interest" of other persons it comes under the "jurisdiction" of the state, even if the act is entirely voluntary (i.e. an act of Free Will, agency, for both parties in the exchange). Liberty in commercial matters (in the voluntary buying and selling of goods and services) is not some different "principle" to liberty generally - it is clearly the same principle.

==Neo-classical synthesis==
{{see also|Neo-classical economics}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:1schumpeter.jpg|right|thumb|[[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued competition drove the progress of capitalist democracies]] --&gt;
After Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasised a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes [[social welfare]]. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no [[barriers to entry]]. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver [[allocative efficiency|allocative]], [[productive efficiency|productive]] and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as [[Pareto efficiency]] after the Italian economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and means that resources in an economy over the [[long run]] will go precisely to those who are [[Consumerism|willing]] and [[Poverty|able]] to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last [[Marginalism|marginal unit]] of possible output - or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced - there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and [[Utilitarianism|utility]] is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency.  Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who [[Protestant work ethic|work hard]], and therefore those who will put society's resources towards the [[Production possibility frontier|frontier of its possible production]].&lt;ref&gt;for one of the opposite views, see [[Kenneth Galbraith]], ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s notion that a "perennial gale of creative destruction" is ever sweeping through [[capitalism|capitalist]] economies, driving enterprise at the market's mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], ''The Process of Creative Destruction'' (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices raise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing [[social welfare]] by creating a [[deadweight loss]]. Sources of this market power are said to include the existence of [[externalities]], [[barriers to entry]] of the market, and the [[free rider problem]]. Markets may [[market failure|fail]] to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of ''[[laissez faire]]'' is justified. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that [[perfect competition]] is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called "workable" or "[[effective competition]]".&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, "Towards a Concept of Workable Competition" (1940) 30 Am Ec Rev p.241-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markham, "An Alternative Approach to the Concept of Workable Competition" (1950) 40 Am Ec Rev p.349-361&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Lipsey and Lancaster, "The General Theory of Second Best" (1956-7) 24 Rev Ec Stud 11-32&lt;/ref&gt; by using the law to tame market operation where it can.

==Chicago School==
{{see also|Chicago School (economics)}}
[[File:Robert Bork.jpg|thumb|Robert Bork|right|[[Robert Bork]] argued that competition law was fundamentally flawed]]
A group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the [[University of Chicago]], advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition. The [[US Supreme Court]] has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.'', 433 U.S. 36 (1977), ''Broadcast Music Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.'', ''NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma'', ''Spectrum Sports Inc. v. McQuillan'', ''State Oil Co. v. Khan'', ''Verizon v. Trinko'', and ''Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.''&lt;/ref&gt; One view of the Chicago School approach to antitrust is found in United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner's books''Antitrust law''&lt;ref&gt;Posner, ''Antitrust Law'' (2001) 2nd ed., {{ISBN|978-0-226-67576-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Economic Analysis of Law''&lt;ref&gt;Posner, ''Economic Analysis of Law'' (2007) 7th ed., {{ISBN|978-0-7355-6354-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posner once worked in the Department of Justice's antitrust division, has long been a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and is likely the most widely cited antitrust scholar and jurist in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Posner (2001) p.24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Bork]] was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bork, Robert H. ''The Antitrust Paradox'' (1978)  New York Free Press {{ISBN|0-465-00369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was pursuit ''only'' of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors.&lt;ref name="Bork 1978 p.405"&gt;Bork (1978) p.405&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and [[price discrimination]] on the grounds that it did not harm consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1978) p.406&lt;/ref&gt; Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Easterbrook]], ''The Limits of Antitrust'', 63 U. Tex. L. Rev. 1 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; "The only cure for bad theory", writes Bork, "is better theory".&lt;ref name="Bork 1978 p.405"/&gt; The late [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Phillip Areeda]], who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork's preference for non intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooke Group v. Williamson'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=509&amp;invol=209 509 US 209] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- why is this case more notable than the rest? --&gt;

==Other critiques==
Some [[economic libertarian]]s have criticised competition law in its entirety,
challenging the legitimacy of action against price fixing and [[cartel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For a criticism of the libertarian view see Michael E. DeBow (2007) ''What's Wrong with Price Fixing: Responding to the New Critics of Antitrust'', published by the [http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv12n2/reg12n2-debow.html Cato Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

See Dominic Armentaro "Antitrust: The Case for Repeal" (Ludwig Von Mises Institute 1986) and "The Case Against Antitrust" by Robert A. Levy (Cato Institute 2004). The case being that "competition law" (or "Antitrust") is based upon a false view of economics - that it harms rather than benefits consumers in the long term. And that "competition law" (or "Antitrust") is based upon principles of law and philosophy that are both false and confused.

==Policy developments==
Anti-[[cartel]] enforcement is a key focus of competition law enforcement policy. In the [[United States]] the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act 2004 raised the maximum imprisonment term for price fixing from three to ten years, and the maximum fine from $10 million to $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;see generally, Pate (2004) at [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/206479.htm USDOJ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[British Airways]] and [[Korean Air]] pleaded guilty to fixing cargo and passenger flight prices.&lt;ref&gt;see, USDOJ Antitrust's [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2007/224928.htm press release] and the [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f224900/224943.htm court filing]&lt;/ref&gt;

These actions complement the private enforcement which has always been an important feature of [[United States antitrust law]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] summarised why [[United States Congress|Congress]] allows punitive damages in ''Hawaii v. Standard Oil''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of California'' 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[European Union|EU]], the Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 means that the [[European Commission]] is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of [[European Community competition law]]. This was done in order to facilitate quicker resolution of competition-related inquiries. In 2005 the Commission issued a [[Green Paper]] on ''Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules'',&lt;ref&gt;''Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules'' {SEC(2005) 1732} /* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2005:0672:FIN:EN:HTML COM/2005/0672]&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier.&lt;ref&gt;see FAQ on the Green paper [http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/05/489&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Albuquerque aerial.jpg|thumb|Downtown Albuquerque aerial]]

'''Downtown Albuquerque''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. It is where a large number of the city's [[highrise]] buildings are located, as well as being the center of government and business for the region.

Downtown is roughly defined as the area between Marble Avenue, Coal Avenue, Sixth Street, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]] railroad tracks. The area on the east side of the railroad tracks is known as '''East Downtown''' or '''EDo'''.

==Street grid==
Downtown Albuquerque is laid out in a standard grid pattern, with numbered north-south ''streets'' and named east-west ''avenues''. [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]] (originally known as Railroad Avenue) is the main east-west thoroughfare through the center of Downtown, while Lomas Boulevard (originally New York Avenue) is a major east-west arterial through the north part of downtown.

The streets start with First Street just west of the railroad tracks and increase in number moving westward. Fourth Street was originally the main north-south thoroughfare through Downtown but today it is discontinuous, interrupted by Civic Plaza. The two block stretch between Central and Civic Plaza was once converted into a pedestrian mall, but was reverted to a vehicular roadway in late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cabq.gov/council/find-your-councilor/district-2/projects-planning-efforts-district-2/4th-street-mall-conversion 4th Street Mall Conversion - City Of Albuquerque&lt;/ref&gt; Since these developments took place Second Street has been the main north-south street through downtown.

Fourth Street through downtown Albuquerque was part of [[U.S. Route 66]] prior to the route's 1937 realignment. Afterwards, Route 66 ran along Central Avenue until its decommissioning.

==Districts==
Downtown Albuquerque is divided into six official '''districts''', which are identified by a unified system of signage and icons.

===Courthouse District===
Located on the north side of downtown, this district is bounded by Marble Avenue, Roma Avenue, Second Street, and Seventh Street. It is named for the three major courthouses located at the intersection of Fourth and Lomas: [[Pete V. Domenici United States Courthouse]], Bernalillo County Courthouse, and the Bernalillo County [[Metropolitan Courthouse]].

===Warehouse District===
[[File:Santa Fe Freight House, Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|Old [[Santa Fe Railroad]] Freight House in 2007, Transportation Center District.]]
On the north side of downtown along the railroad tracks, the Warehouse District includes the area between Second and the railroad tracks, north of the Convention Center to Slate Avenue. As its name implies, this area contains mostly warehouses from the railroad era.

===Plaza District===
The Plaza District is the central area of downtown, bounded by Roma, Copper, Seventh, and the railroad tracks. It is centered on Civic Plaza and includes many of Albuquerque's large office and government buildings including the Albuquerque City-County Building, the Convention Center, [[Albuquerque Plaza]], the [[Compass Bank Building (Albuquerque)|Compass Bank Building]], and the [[Albuquerque Petroleum Building]]. The Main Library of the [[Albuquerque/Bernalillo County Library System]] is also located in this district.

===Arts and Entertainment District===
This district is centered along Central Avenue and Gold Avenue east of First Street. It contains most of downtown Albuquerque's historic buildings as well as most of its shopping, dining, and nightlife destinations. Notable landmarks in this district include the [[KiMo Theater]], [[Occidental Life Building]], [[First National Bank Building (Albuquerque)|First National Bank Building]], and [[Sunshine Building]]. There is a small concentration of government and office buildings on Gold Avenue which includes the [[Dennis Chavez Federal Building]], [[Gold Building]], and [[Simms Building]]. [[Amy Biehl High School]] is also located in this district.

===Transportation Center District===
This is the smallest district, encompassing the area south of Central Avenue and east of First Street. Most of the district is occupied by [[Alvarado Transportation Center]].

===Casa District===
The southernmost part of downtown, the Casa District includes the area between Gold and Coal Avenue, extending all the way west to Tenth Street. This is a primarily residential district, with a large number of [[loft apartment]] buildings. Alvarado Square, the location of the [[PNM Building]] and the headquarters of [[Bernalillo County]], is also located in the Casa District.

[[Image:Old Albuquerque High School Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|right|Old Albuquerque High School]]

==EDo==
Not one of the official downtown districts, EDo (East Downtown) is a small but expanding neighborhood centered on Central and Broadway on the east side of the railroad tracks, bounded roughly by the railroad tracks on the west, [[I-25]] on the east, Coal on the south, and Martin Luther King Avenue on the north. EDo is a trendy area containing several loft apartment buildings and a number of small shops and restaurants. The focal point of EDo is the renovated [[Old Albuquerque High School]] campus, which is now a residential complex. The name "EDo" was coined in imitation of the [[LoDo]] area of [[Denver]] which in turn was an imitation of [[SoHo]] and [[TriBeCa]] in [[New York City]] .

==Buildings==

===Tallest buildings===
Downtown Albuquerque contains most of the city's highrise buildings, including the four tallest. The tallest downtown buildings are listed below:

==Transportation==
[[Image:Alvarado Transportation Center.jpg|thumb|right|Alvarado Transportation Center]]
Downtown is the center of public transit in the city, and is served by a network of [[ABQ RIDE]] routes including local routes, the [[Albuquerque Rapid Transit]] [[Bus rapid transit|BRT]] route, and the [[Rapid Ride]] express routes, most of which include stops at the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]]. ABQ RIDE also operates a free circulator bus service in the downtown area named Downtown Get Around (or "D-Ride" for short) which runs from 6:30 am to 7:00 pm every 7 minutes on weekdays. D-Ride service will end on May 12, 2018, and will be replaced by various local routes, such as 12th Street/Rio Grande (routes #36 and #37) and Menaul (route #8). All inbound routes to the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]], except route #66 and [[Rapid Ride]] routes, will have a fare-free zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabq.gov/transit/news/abq-ride-implementing-route-and-schedule-changes-on-may-12|title=ABQ RIDE Implementing Route and Schedule Changes on May 12|website=City of Albuquerque|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to local bus transit, the Alvarado Transportation Center also incorporates [[Amtrak]] and [[Greyhound bus]] facilities, as well as a stop on the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]] [[commuter rail]] line. The [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|rail runner express]] provides commuter service seven days a week along a 96.5-mile corridor that runs through multiple counties in New Mexico through 13 stations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7429">'''Employee voice''' refers to the participation of employees in influencing organisational decision making.    Because research and analysis have grown around the voice concept in a variety of disciplines, ‘employee voice’ has become an elastic term  meaning  somewhat different things to different policy, academic and  practitioner actors.  In the many disciplines that cover voice, such as human resource management, political science, economics, organisational behaviour, psychology or law, perspectives toward the concept differ.  Drawing on Dundon et al. voice can be seen with different lenses. First, voice is an articulation of individual dissatisfaction or concern that aims to address a specific problem or issue with management.  Second, voice takes the form of collective organisation, where voice provides a countervailing source of power to management. Third, there is the role of voice as a contribution to management decision-making. Here the purpose is to gain employee input to improve work organisation and efficiency more generally, perhaps through quality circles or teamwork, or eliciting workforce engagement. Fourth, voice can be seen as an instrument for mutual gain, with productive collaboration between capital and labour increasing the long-term viability of an organisation and economic well-being of employees. The editors of the Elgar Handbook of Employee Voice &lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson A.Dundon ,Donaghey J and R.Freeman (2014) The Handbook of employee voice, Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; define employee voice as the ways and means through which employees attempt to have a say and potentially influence organisational affairs about issues that affect their work and the interests of managers and owners.  This definition combines a variety of voice mechanisms that analysts often group in separate boxes (e.g. involvement or bargaining; union and non-union). It allows for employer implemented Non-union Employee Representative (NER) systems as a collective form of voice, be it chosen to marginalise a union presence or to provide an alternative to union influence   In general, employee voice is about how employees are able to have a say over work activities and decisions within the organizations in which they work, regardless of the institutional channel through which it operates—whether through speak-up programmes, quality circles, teamwork, or collective negotiation.

Arguments for employee voice can be both moral and political as well as economic.&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, S and Ackers, P (2015), Finding a Voice at Work? New Perspectives on Employment Relations, Oxford, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a wide range of mechanisms related to employee voice, and these may be direct or indirect, formal or informal, and power-centred or task-centred.  As well as trade union representation, voice may refer to a wide array of techniques including Empowerment, Employee Engagement and Teamworking initiatives.  In reality, many employers adopt a blend of voice mechanisms.  However, some employers may also wish to limit employee voice, believing instead that the best approach is for management to command and control the organisation. Equally, some employees may not want to have their voice heard, or may not want to express their thoughts.

In July 2013, an international workshop on the benefits of employee voice was organised by Dr Andrew R Timming, an employee voice scholar based at the University of St Andrews. The workshop, entitled, 'Strengthening Democracy at Work', brought together the world's leading employee voice researchers, including: Peter Ackers (University of Loughborough), John Budd (University of Minnesota), Tony Dundon (National University of Ireland, Galway), Stewart Johnstone (University of Newcastle), Andrew Pendleton (York University) and Andrew Timming (University of St Andrews). Also present were several practitioners. The workshop was funded by the Scottish Universities Insight Institute and the Russell Trust. The first day took place in Glasgow and the second day was held at New Lanark. The workshop participants discussed the benefits of employee voice for employees, organisations and societies. In short, when employers give employees a 'say' in the strategic direction of the organisation, all three levels benefit.

== Informal and formal mechanisms ==
Employee voice is attained through both informal and formal mechanisms. Informal employee voice mechanisms include general conversation between employees and employers, email communication, employee feedback, social functions and meetings at the workplace. Employees can also influence corporate decision making through their actions, such as turnover and absenteeism&lt;ref name="McLean, P 2008"&gt;McLean, P (2008), Employee Voice, MGMT341, International and Comparative [[Human resource management|Human Resource Management]], [[University of Wollongong]], delivered 19 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal mechanisms include communication tools implemented by an organisations human resource department, such as employee surveys and [[suggestion box]]es. Some organisations promote employee voice through financial participation, such as share ownership and [[Profit sharing|profit-sharing]] opportunities. Employee consultative committees and representation through [[trade union]]s are also formal ways of ensuring employees are informed and are given a voice in decisions that affect their employment&lt;ref name="McLean, P 2008"/&gt;

== European Works Councils ==
In an international context, the role of employee voice varies immensely. The European model is fundamentally based on employee communication and consultation between employees and [[Management|corporate management]]. European [[Works council|Works Councils]] were introduced through the European Directive 1994 to accommodate these goals and provided employees with an opportunity to gain access to senior levels of their employers. The European model has required amendments to improve its effectiveness in managing employee voice and legal compliance&lt;ref&gt;Timming, A (2007), ‘European Works Councils and the Dark Side of Managing Worker Voice’, Human Resource Management Journal, Vol.17, Iss.3, pp.248-254&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Øystein Aarseth''' ({{IPA-no|ˈœʏstæɪn ˈɔʂət|lang}}; 22 March 1968 – 10 August 1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i838.photobucket.com/albums/zz310/chagrynn/Euronymous_passport_1.jpg|title=Euronymous' passport|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his stage name '''Euronymous''', was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[guitarist]]. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and was the only constant member from the band's formation in 1984 until his death in 1993. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal [[record label]] [[Deathlike Silence Productions]] and record shop Helvete.

Euronymous professed to be a [[Theistic Satanism|Satanist]] and was known for making extreme [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] statements. He presented himself as leading a militant [[cult]]-like group known as the "Black Metal Inner Circle." 

In August 1993, he was murdered by fellow musician [[Varg Vikernes]].

==Biography==

===1984–1991===
[[File:Øystein Aarseth (Euronymous).jpg|thumb|Euronymous in 1987]]
Aarseth formed Mayhem in 1984 along with bassist [[Necrobutcher|Jørn "Necrobutcher" Stubberud]] and drummer [[Kjetil Manheim]]. At the time he was going by the stage name Destructor but later changed his name to Euronymous,&lt;ref name=diaries39&gt;{{cite book |title=Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries |last=Kristiansen |first=Jon |year=2011 |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |location= |isbn= |page=39 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the demon [[Eurynomos]] which had inspired the [[Hellhammer]] song of the same name.

In summer 1986, Euronymous, Necrobutcher and [[Metalion|Jon "Metalion" Kristiansen]] visited the German [[thrash metal]] band [[Assassin (band)|Assassin]] and recorded the ''Metalion in the Park'' demo under the name Checker Patrol, Metalion contributing background vocals to the title song "Metalion in the Park."&lt;ref name=checkerpatrol&gt;Kristiansen, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Per "Dead" Ohlin]] became Mayhem's vocalist and [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Jan Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg]] became its drummer. By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near [[Kråkstad]], which was used as a place for the band to rehearse.&lt;ref name=purefucking&gt;{{cite video |people=Stefan Rydehed (director) |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Index Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous "got on each other's nerves a lot" and "weren't really friends at the end."&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt; Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous then went outside and began shooting into the air with a shotgun.&lt;ref name=LoC52&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varg Vikernes]] claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 1991, Dead was found dead by Euronymous at his home with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head. Dead's death was considered [[suicide]]. Before calling the police, he went to a shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body, after rearranging some items.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt;&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC49&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: ''[[Dawn of the Black Hearts]]''.&lt;ref name=soundsofdeath&gt;[http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-sod.htm ''Sounds of Death'' magazine (1998): Hellhammer interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823184150/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-sod.htm |date=23 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Necrobutcher recalls how Euronymous told him of the suicide:&lt;blockquote&gt;Øystein called me up the next day ... and says, "Dead has done something really cool! He killed himself". I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, "Relax, I have photos of everything". I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. So I told him, "OK. Don't even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's "evil" image and claimed Dead had killed himself because death metal had become "trendy" and commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a [[stew]] with bits of Dead's brain and had made [[necklace]]s with bits of his skull.&lt;ref name=murdermusic&gt;{{cite video|people=Michael Dome (director) |year=2007 |title=Murder Music: Black Metal |url=http://www.rockworld.tv/MurderMusicPlayer.html |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Rockworld TV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014183138/http://rockworld.tv/MurderMusicPlayer.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band later denied the former rumor but confirmed that the latter was true.&lt;ref name=soundsofdeath/&gt;&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy,&lt;ref name=sam&gt;{{cite video |people=Sam Dunn (director) |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like [[Faust (musician)|Bård "Faust" Eithun]]&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and Metalion.&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Necrobutcher later speculated that taking the photographs and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend dead.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime&gt;{{cite video |people=Martin Ledang (director), Pål Aasdal (director) |year=2007 |title=Once Upon a Time in Norway |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Another World Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; He claimed that Euronymous "went into a fantasy world."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Faust of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] believes that Dead's suicide "marked the point at which, under Euronymous' direction, the black metal scene began its obsession with all things satanic and evil."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Kjetil Manheim said that, after the suicide, Euronymous "tried to be as extreme as he had talked about."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; The suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead before the suicide, and his behavior afterwards. Necrobutcher ended his friendship with Euronymous.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Thus, after the suicide, Mayhem was left with only two members: guitarist Euronymous and drummer Hellhammer. [[Stian Johannsen|Stian "Occultus" Johannsen]] was recruited as Mayhem's new singer and bassist. However, this was short-lived; he left the band after receiving a death threat from Euronymous.&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;

===1991–1993===
[[File:Helvete Oslo - black metal graffiti.jpg|thumb|The basement of Euronymous' former record shop, showing graffiti from the early 1990s]]
During May–June 1991,&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous opened a record shop named ''Helvete''&lt;ref name=EuronymousInterview&gt;{{cite web |title=Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth |date=June 1992 |url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/mayhem/euro2.html |accessdate=10 October 2009 |quote=''Well, the original idea was to make a specialist shop for metal in general, but that's a long time ago. Normal metal isn't very popular any more, all the children are listening to 'death' metal now. I'd rather be selling Judas Priest than Napalm Death, but at least now we can be specialized within 'death' metal and make a shop where all the trend people know that they will find all the trend music. This will help us earning money so that we can order more EVIL records to the evil people. But no matter how shitty music we have to sell, we'll make a BLACK METAL look on the shop, we've had a couple of 'actions' in churches lately, and the shop is going to look like a black church in the future. We've also thought about having total darkness inside, so that people would have to carry torches to be able to see the records.'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909160330/http://www.angelfire.com/band/mayhem/euro2.html |archivedate=9 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for "[[hell]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/ordboksoek/ordbok.cgi?OPP=helvete&amp;bokmaal=S%F8k+i+Bokm%E5lsordboka&amp;ordbok=bokmaal&amp;alfabet=n&amp;renset=j|title=Norwegian dictionary entry for "Helvete"|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Schweigaards gate 56 in [[Oslo]]. Norwegian black metal musicians often met in the shop's basement, including the two members of Mayhem, the members of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], Varg "Count Grishnackh" Vikernes of [[Burzum]], and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]]. Euronymous also started an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. It released albums by Norwegian bands Mayhem and Burzum, and Swedish bands [[Merciless]] and [[Abruptum]]. Euronymous, Varg,&lt;ref name=untilthelight&gt;{{cite video |people=Aaron Aites (director, producer), Audrey Ewell (director, producer) |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emperor guitarist [[Samoth|Tomas 'Samoth' Haugen]]&lt;ref name=hist2&gt;{{cite book |last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc |year=2003 |location=New York, New York |isbn= |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; all lived at Helvete at various times. Emperor drummer Faust also lived and worked there.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The shop's walls were painted black and bedecked with medieval weapons, posters of bands, and [[picture disc]]s, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

According to Occultus, the space that Euronymous rented "was far too big and the rent was too high. That's the reason why it never did well." Only a small part of the building was used for the shop itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it became the focal point of the Norwegian black metal scene. Metalion, writer of the fanzine ''Slayer'', said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene."&lt;ref name=LoC39&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Within just a few months [of Helvete opening], many young musicians had become obsessed with Euronymous and his ideas, and soon a lot of Norwegian death metal bands transformed into black metal bands. Amputation became Immortal, [[Thou Shalt Suffer]] turned into Emperor, and Darkthrone swapped their Swedish-inspired death metal for primitive black metal. Most notoriously, [[Old Funeral]]'s guitar player [[Varg Vikernes | Kristian (later renamed as Varg) Vikernes]] had already left the band to form his own creation, Burzum.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ekeroth: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Swedish Death Metal'']. Second printing. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Euronymous helped many younger bands in the scene, especially Emperor and Enslaved, both of whom he recommended to Candlelight Records.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Dayal. ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''. Feral House, 2013. p.156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said that "if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted" by the Helvete scene.&lt;ref name=loc65/&gt; Euronymous "took Vikernes, who was five years younger than him, under his wing: inviting him to play bass with Mayhem and offering to release his music as Burzum".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lifedeathprizes.com/real-life-crime/oystein-aarseth-murdered-by-varg-vikernes-64542|title=What drove this black-metal star to stab his bandmate 23 times?|date=2017-09-02|work=Life Death Prizes|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, it has been claimed that their friendship turned to rivalry. Looking back, Faust said: "It sounds really silly, but I think there was a little bit of a contest between them to see who could be more evil. It created a very difficult situation, especially for Euronymous, who wanted the glamour and the showbiz. With him, there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

[[File:Holmenkollen kapell 0003.jpg|thumb|left|Euronymous took part in the [[Holmenkollen Chapel#Fire and reconstruction|burning of Holmenkollen Chapel]] (pictured)]]
On 6 June 1992, the [[Fantoft Stave Church]] in [[Bergen]] was destroyed by [[arson]]. Vikernes is strongly suspected as the culprit but was never convicted.&lt;ref name=LoC78&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; There followed a wave of church burnings across Norway perpetrated by musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene.&lt;ref name=EuronymousInterview/&gt;&lt;ref name=grude&gt;{{cite video |people=Grude, Torstein (director) |year=1998 |title=Satan rir Media |medium=motion picture |location=Norway |publisher=Grude, Torstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous was present at the burning of [[Holmenkollen Chapel]] together with Vikernes and Faust,&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt;&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; who were convicted for the arson after Euronymous was dead. Faust says he believes that Euronymous got involved because he "felt he had to prove that he could be a part of it and not just in the background."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Euronymous had allegedly plotted to bomb [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. Euronymous' death in August 1993 put an end to this plan and stalled the album's release.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; In a 1993 interview on a Swedish radio show, Euronymous said of the church burnings:&lt;blockquote&gt;They [Christians] must feel that there is a dark, evil power present that they have to fight, which…will make them more extreme. We also believe that when a church burns it's not only Christians who suffer, but people in general. Imagine a beautiful old stave church...what happens when it burns? The Christians feel despair, God's house is destroyed and ordinary people will suffer from grief because something beautiful was destroyed. So you end up spreading grief and despair, which is a good thing.&lt;ref name=radioint&gt;Interview with Euronymous of Mayhem on a Swedish radio show, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'', brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Varg Vikernes (using his pseudonym Count Grishnackh) gave an anonymous interview to a journalist from the newspaper, in which he claimed to have burnt the churches and [[Early Norwegian black metal scene#Murder of Magne Andreassen|killed a man in Lillehammer]].&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete.&lt;ref name=countregret&gt;[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml "Count" Regrets Nothing]. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Vikernes himself was released in March 1993, also for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; That month, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' published an article about the Norwegian black metal scene. In it, Euronymous and Vikernes presented themselves as leaders of a militant, cult-like group of "Satanic terrorists." Euronymous claimed that Helvete helps fund its activities, but said that he is not directly involved in its crimes, because if he was caught the organization would fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp.99-101&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Bergens Tidende'' episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media. Vikernes and the authors of ''Lords of Chaos'' claim that Euronymous' parents pressured him into shutting Helvete.&lt;ref name=LoC120&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torstein Grude: ''[[Satan rir media]]'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder===
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, as well as between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene as a whole.&lt;ref name=LoC117&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Tøyengata&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt; in Oslo. Upon their arrival, a confrontation began, and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back.&lt;ref&gt;Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.&lt;ref name=LoC117/&gt;

It has been speculated{{by whom|date=February 2017}} that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at "outdoing" the stabbing in Lillehammer.&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130209232033/http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/|deadurl=yes|title=Mayhem Biography - Yahoo! Music|date=9 February 2013|archivedate=9 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up, and [[torture]] him to death while [[snuff film|videotaping the event]]. Vikernes explains: "If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me."&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] to ambush him.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=burzumstory2&gt;Vikernes, Varg: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous'']. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous "panicked" and kicked him in the chest.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The self-defense story is doubted by Faust&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and other members of the scene.

According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was "in the wrong place at the wrong time".&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, "I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Øystein".&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a "defense […] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]".&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt;

====Aftermath====
Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.&lt;ref name=LoC120/&gt; Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 1994,&lt;ref name=countregret/&gt; Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".&lt;ref name=LoC141&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.&lt;ref name=LoC141/&gt;

At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' album.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was rerecording the bass parts, but I never did."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.

A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous&lt;ref name=nordicmetal&gt;Various Artists: ''Nordic Metal - A Tribute to Euronymous''. [[Necropolis Records]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I don't doubt this, but we should use a better source.--&gt; and turning his back on [[Satanism]] in favor of nationalism and [[Odinism]],&lt;ref name=loc139&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used Satan to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers "have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death."&lt;ref name=loc138&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years after the murder, [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said, "There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop."&lt;ref name=loc65&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, a "cult developed around the memory of Euronymous," and he was hailed by some as "the King"&lt;ref name=nordicmetal/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc138/&gt; or "Godfather of Black Metal."&lt;ref name=loc138/&gt; 

A new generation of musicians also tried to gain credibility by riding on the back of his legacy.&lt;ref name="loc138" /&gt; However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates "speak of the killing with a tone of indifference." ''Lords of Chaos'' remarks: "what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another."&lt;ref name="Lords of Chaos, p. 137"&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Hellhammer,&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Ihsahn&lt;ref name="LoC120" /&gt; and Samoth&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. [[Anders Odden]] (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: "It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences." He added: "I think many people felt relief once he was gone." Writer and musician [[Erlend Erichsen]] agreed, saying, "Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone."&lt;ref name="onceuponatime" /&gt;

==Beliefs and personality==
The book ''Lords of Chaos'' says of Euronymous:&lt;blockquote&gt;He was always dressed in black from head to foot, his hair dyed black for added effect. He sported long, aristocratic mustaches and wore knee-high boots. His black leather biker jacket was decorated with badges [...] When talking, he seemed stern and serious, sometimes with pomposity verging on the theatrical".&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against [[individualism]], compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; In a 1992 interview, he said "The [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] [punk] pigs have correctly made themselves guardians of morality, but we must kick them in the face and become guardians of anti-morality."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he told ''Kill Yourself'' zine, "There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted" and claimed "I have no problem with killing someone in cold blood."&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985&lt;ref name=diaries39/&gt; and considered him his best friend)&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, pp. 266-269.&lt;/ref&gt; said Euronymous "was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme".&lt;ref name="LoC39"/&gt; Euronymous' shop attracted a lot of new young fans, many of whom looked up to and even idolized him.&lt;ref name="cult155"&gt;''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult'', p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some who knew Euronymous claim that "the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that — a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality."&lt;ref name="Lords of Chaos, p. 137"/&gt; They include [[Necrobutcher]],&lt;ref name="cult155"/&gt; [[Kjetil Manheim]],&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;&lt;!--the documentary makes clear that Manheim remained friends with Euronymous long after leaving the band--&gt; Vikernes&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; and Blackthorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Faust said that with Euronymous, "there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; When asked why Euronymous made such extreme statements to the press, Ihsahn said: "I think that was very much to create fear among people."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the scene "wanted to be in opposition to society" and "tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 218f.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim (Euronymous' friend from 1983 until his death) described him as "health oriented ... A nice guy, a family guy," but said that when his older friends weren't around, "he could play out his role." Manheim claimed that Euronymous became "extreme" towards the end of his life: "He liked telling people that they were worthless; that he was the best. He was all 'I define black metal. Black metal is me!' … I think he was trapped in the image of Mayhem. He became a [[megalomaniac]]."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; In the documentary ''Pure Fucking Mayhem'', he said "Øystein's daily life was a total theater" that was based on the black metal "[[archetype]]" of Euronymous.&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;

===Religion===
In interviews, Euronymous said he was a [[Theistic Satanism|theistic Satanist]].&lt;ref name=religious&gt;Esa Lahdenpera: {{cite web |url=http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html |title=''Northern Black Metal Legends'' |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}. In: ''Kill Yourself'', no. 2, August 1993. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smnnews.com/board/showthread.php?threadid=32213|title=Rare Euronymous interview - SMNnews Forums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview by Esa Lahdenperä conducted in August 1993, Euronymous stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe in a horned devil, a personified Satan. In my opinion all the other forms of Satanism are bullshit. [...] Satanism comes from religious Christianity, and there it shall stay. I'm a religious person and I will fight those who misuse His name. People are not supposed to believe in themselves and be individualists. They are supposed to OBEY, to be the SLAVES of religion.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The theistic Satanism espoused by Euronymous was an inversion of [[Roman Catholic]] dogma&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic/&gt;, and he claimed "We praise the evil and we believe blindly in a godly creature just like a Christian."&lt;ref name=beat&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-of-mayhem-1993-beat-issue-02/ Interview with Euronymous from ''Beat'', Issue 2 (1993)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125005627/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-of-mayhem-1993-beat-issue-02/ |date=25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[relationship between religion and science]], he said: "Scientists can't disprove [...] religion. No matter how hard you try, you can't explain the universe. You can't leave out a religious belief."&lt;ref name=beat/&gt;

He opposed the Satanic and [[occultism|occultist]] teachings of [[Anton LaVey]] and [[Aleister Crowley]], for unlike Euronymous, they promoted what he saw as "peace" and commercial frivolity, as well as individualism in contrast to [[dogma]].&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic/&gt; He said he would "never accept any band which preaches [[Church of Satan]] ideas, as they are just a bunch of freedom and life-loving [[Atheism|atheists]], and they stand exactly the opposite of me."&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; When asked what he thought of Crowley's code of "[[Thelema|do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law]]", he answered, "People shall do what WE want them to do. We're against freedom, and forced a band from Rogaland in Norway—Belsebub—to split up."&lt;ref name=beat/&gt;

As noted earlier, some of those who knew Euronymous claim that his "extreme Satanic image" was an act. While [[Mortiis]] said that Euronymous "was such a devil worshipper you wouldn't believe it,"&lt;ref&gt;Ian Christe: ''Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal''. New York, NY: HarperCollins, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; in the black metal documentary ''Until the Light Takes Us'', Varg Vikernes claimed that Euronymous was not a Satanist. He said: "To Aarseth everything was about image and he wanted to appear extreme. He wanted people to think of him as being extreme; the most extreme of them all. But he didn't want to ''be'' extreme and he wasn't ''really'' extreme."&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; While Metalion, who was friends with both Vikernes and Euronymous when the latter died, and called Euronymous his best friend,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Bazillion Points Books 2011, pp. 266-269.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that "some people in our scene read a few books and considered themselves Satanists," he made no such statements about Euronymous.{{sfn|Kristiansen|2011|p=261f}} Tenebris (allegedly Jon Nödtveidt&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]], a Swedish Satanic order formed in 1995, wrote that "back then, in 1991, things&lt;!--Do we know what 'things' he's talking about here?--&gt; mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism […] and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop. Therefore, it vanished with his death in '93".&lt;ref&gt;''MLO''. ''Misantropiska Lucifer Orden''. In: Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, some members of the Norwegian scene began to follow [[Paganism]]. Vikernes later claimed that Euronymous—"obsessed with this 'Satanist' thing"—disapproved of Vikernes promoting paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16250 "Updated: Burzum Leader Fails to Return After Short Leave from Prison"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201200958/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16250 |date=1 December 2008 }}. ''[[Blabbermouth.net]]''. [[Roadrunner Records]]. 26 October 2003. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous showed no explicit disapproval of paganism though, and released the pagan band [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]]'s first album, ''[[Vikingligr Veldi]]'', on Deathlike Silence Productions.

===Black metal and death metal===
Euronymous said that the term "black metal" can apply to any kind of metal so long as it is "Satanic" and "heavy".&lt;ref name=radioint/&gt; He said, "If a band cultivates and worships Satan, it's black metal,"&lt;ref name=orcustus&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/interview-with-euronymous-by-bard-faust-for-orcustus-fanzine-unknown/ Interview with Euronymous by Faust in ''Orcustus'' zine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717031130/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/interview-with-euronymous-by-bard-faust-for-orcustus-fanzine-unknown/ |date=17 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "in a way, it can be ordinary heavy metal or just noise. What's important is that it's Satanic; that's what makes it black metal."&lt;ref name=radioint/&gt; He rejected bands like [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] being called black metal, "as they are not Satanists," but supported the band nonetheless.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; As noted earlier, bands who had [[LaVeyan Satanism|LaVeyan beliefs]] were also rejected.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; When it was pointed out that [[Venom (band)|Venom]] (the band that coined the term "black metal") only used Satanism as a gimmick, Euronymous said that he and the Black Circle "choose to believe otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Euronymous said that the term [[death metal]] can apply to any kind of metal, so long as the band "cultivates and worships death."&lt;ref name=orcustus/&gt; Euronymous lamented the commercialization and loss of extremity within death metal. He said "Real Death Metal should be something normal people are afraid of, not something mothers can listen to," and "Death Metal is for brutal people who are capable of killing, it's not for idiotic children who want to have [a] funny hobby after school".&lt;ref name=slayer8&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-and-dead-interview-in-slayer-issue-8-1991/ Interview with Euronymous and Dead in ''Slayer'', Issue 8 (1991)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716160423/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-and-dead-interview-in-slayer-issue-8-1991/ |date=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many others in the black metal scene, Euronymous originally believed that black metal should stay [[Underground music|underground]]. However, he later changed his mind. He believed that the idea of staying underground came from [[hardcore punk]], and said, "Those who scream most about being in 'underground' is also often those who make so bad music that they don't have a chance to get big themselves." He added: "I wouldn't mind making DSP big and earn a million, as long as I don't change my ways of thinking and being. […] If there were one million black metal fans in the world, most of them would be jerks, but there would be really many true and brutal people as well. The bigger we get, the more we can manipulate people into thinking like us".&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;

===Politics===
Euronymous was interested in [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[communist state]]s such as the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Soviet Union under Stalin]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]].&lt;ref name=communism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://surrealdocuments.blogspot.com/2008/04/euronymous-as-kafka.html|title=Documents: Euronymous as Kafka|first=|last=Valter|date=29 April 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collected [[Eastern Bloc]] memorabilia&lt;ref name=LoC74/&gt;, and in the '80s, he was a member of the Norwegian communist youth group [[Red Youth (Norway)|Rød Ungdom]], which was [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Coogan: [http://oraclesyndicate.twoday.net/files/how+black+is+black+metal1/ ''How Black Is Black Metal'']. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC74&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Rød Ungdom, allegedly because he came to realise that they were "just a bunch of humanists."&lt;ref name=LoC74/&gt; He said "as I HATE people I don't want them to have a good time, I'd like to see them rot under communist [[dictatorship]]."&lt;ref name=communism/&gt; He had a fascination with the idea of [[mass surveillance]], [[secret police]] and [[forced disappearance]].&lt;ref name=communism/&gt; Mayhem's [[Attila Csihar]] said Euronymous was not a communist "in the political sense" but was fascinated by the power communist dictators had over their people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/nl/interviews/view/id/687 Interview with Mayhem]. Lords of Metal.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private letter written in the early '90s, Euronymous claimed that "almost all" Norwegian black metal bands at the time were "more or less Nazis," including Mayhem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalsucks.net/2017/01/05/editorial-regarding-euronymous-claim-that-almost-all-norwegian-bands-are-more-or-less-nazis/ Editorial: Regarding Euronymous’ Claim that “Almost ALL Norwegian Bands are More or Less Nazis”]. [[MetalSucks]]. 5 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, however, use the music of Mayhem to promote any kind of politics.&lt;ref name=communism/&gt;

==Instruments==
Euronymous played a Standard sunburst [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar, which can be seen in many pictures of him playing. He stated in various interviews that his and Mayhem's main influences were [[Venom (band)|Venom]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Hellhammer]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]]&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], whilst he also liked [[Iron Maiden]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Metallica]].&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; He played through a slightly modified 1981 Marshall Super Lead tube amp and used an Ibanez Tube Screamer pedal, as well as an Arion Metal Master distortion pedal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Legacy==
Euronymous was ranked No. 51 out of ''The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time'' by ''[[Guitar World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=18446 |title=Guitar World's 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time |date=23 January 2004 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |accessdate=11 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902145402/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=18446 |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, low-cost carrier [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] set up a public poll asking customers to pick a famous Norwegian historic figure whose picture would decorate the aircraft's tail fin. Aarseth was leading the poll, but his name was removed from the campaign after his family's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20120402/black-metal-stars-family-says-no-to-norwegian-tailfin-honour|title=Black metal star's family says no to Norwegian tailfin honour|date=2 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/bummer-alert/mayhems-euronymous-wont-be-the-face-of-norwegian-air|title=MAYHEM's Euronymous Won't Be The Face Of Norwegian Air|date=5 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fazenda Piedade.jpg|thumb|350px|Piedade farm. The [[Casa-grande|master's house]] of a coffee plantation founded in the 18th century in [[Paty do Alferes]] in the Province (now State) of Rio de Janeiro.]]

A '''fazenda''' is a plantation found throughout Brazil; during the colonial period (16th - 18th centuries) they were concentrated primarily in the northeastern region, where (sugar)  was produced, expanding during the 19th century in the southeastern region to [[coffee]] production. Fazenda now denotes any kind of [[farm]].

Fazendas created major export commodities for Brazilian trade, but also led to intensification of [[slavery in Brazil]]. Coffee provided a new basis for agricultural expansion in southern Brazil. In the provinces of Rio de Janeiro and then São Paulo, coffee estates, or ''fazendas'', began to spread toward the interior as new lands were opened.&lt;ref name="chambers1879"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = W. &amp; R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==

Along with the expansion of coffee growing came an intensification of [[slavery in Brazil]], as the country's primary form of labor. More than 1.4 million [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]] were forced to be slaves in Brazil in the last 50 years of the slave trade, and even after the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]] ended, slavery continued until 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the increased profit from the trade of coffee, the years after 1850 saw considerable growth and prosperity in Brazil. [[Dom Pedro II]] proved to be willing to expand economic prosperity, even if that prosperity was based on slave labor.{{clarify|date=January 2014}} [[Railroad]]s, [[steamship]]s and the [[telegraph]] were introduced to Brazil, all paid for by the money the fazendas supplied from their coffee crop. In growing cities such as [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo]], merchants, lawyers, a middle class, and an urban working class grew, once again paid for by the money coming from the fazendas.

==Early life==
Duffy was the youngest of three brothers and lived as a child in [[Sallins]], [[County Kildare]], where his father, Ned Duffy, had a pig farm. His mother, Anne Duffy, ran The Gem restaurant in [[Naas]]. He attended the local primary school, St. Laurence's, in Sallins. The family sold the farm after the outbreaks of [[Classical swine fever|swine fever]] in the early 1970s and moved to [[Drogheda]], [[County Louth]], where they bought a pub. He lived ‘above the shop’ on West Street, while attending St. Joseph's Secondary School. He later went to [[Newbridge College]] in County Kildare where he did his [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gavinduffy.ie/who-am-i/|title=About Gavin Duffy}} Retrieved September 28 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Liberia==
Kouwenhoven started his career in Liberia in the 1980s as the manager of Hotel Africa&lt;ref&gt;see eg. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/27/theobserver &lt;/ref&gt; and lateron headed the Oriental Timber Corporation (OTC), the main timber company in Liberia in the early 2000s, during the [[Second Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]]. The company was used as a cover for arms smuggling.&lt;ref name=iol-arrest/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor-made&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/taylormade2.pdf|title=Taylor Made: The Pivotal Role of Liberia's Forests and Flag of Convenience in Regional Conflict|publisher=Global Witness|date=2001|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] issued an order in 2001 banning him from traveling because of arms trafficking.&lt;ref name=taylor-made/&gt;

==Trials==
Kouwenhoven was arrested in the Netherlands on 18 March 2005 and stood trial at the [[Judiciary of the Netherlands#District Courts|Court of First Instance]] in [[The Hague]], starting 24 April 2006, charged with arms smuggling and war crimes in Liberia in the 90s, for which the Dutch public prosecutors sought a 20-year jail sentence and a fine of €450,000. The court tried to summon Charles Taylor to testify against Kouwenhoven.  On 7 June 2006 Kouwenhoven was sentenced to 8 years in jail for arms smuggling. The court did not find him guilty of war crimes. Both the public prosecutors and Kouwenhoven sought a higher court appeal and Kouwenhoven was released in March 2007 in anticipation of his new trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rd.nl/vandaag/binnenland/kouwenhoven-vrij-tot-rechtszaak-1.1150680|title=Kouwenhoven vrij tot rechtszaak|date=19 March 2017|language=nl|accessdate=14 December 2017|publisher=Reformatorisch Dagblad}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Judiciary of the Netherlands#Courts of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] in The Hague acquitted him of all charges on 10 March 2008 and sharply criticized the work of the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=6412|title=Guus Kouwenhoven|publisher=Hague Justice Portal|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution appealed the acquittal to the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Supreme Court]] on 20 March 2008. In April 2010 the Supreme Court ordered a re-trial at the court in [[Den Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=11630|title=Dutch Supreme Court quashes Court of Appeal decision in Guus K. case|date=20 April 2010|accessdate=14 December 2017|publisher=The Hague Justice Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, the court in Den Bosch was to hear arguments for dismissal as there were no witnesses available to testify.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6589">'''Hans Gerling''' (born June 6, 1915 in Cologne, † August 14, 1991) was a German businessman who headed the [[Gerling Konzern]], one of Europe's largest insurance groups, from 1949 until his death.

He was the second of three sons of Auguste, b. Hoffmeister and [[Robert Gerling]], founder of the Cologne-based Gerling insurance company. Hans Gerling joined the Gerling Konzern in 1937 and became CEO in 1949. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerling-Konzern Versicherungs-Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/gerling-konzern-versicherungs-beteiligungs-aktiengesellschaft-history/|website=Funding Universe|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Major Financial Institutions of Europe 1993|date=December 18, 1992|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1853338779|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Robert Gerling in 1935, management of the [[Gerling-Konzern]], which was the largest privately owned insurance company in Europe, passed first to Walter Forstreuter, then to Hans Gerling's brother Robert Gerling II, and finally, in 1939 when Robert Gerling II emigrated to the United States, to Hans Gerling. 
At the end of World War II, the US military government allowed the Gerling insurance company to reopen for business with Forstreuter at its head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerling-Konzern Versicherungs-Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/gerling-konzern-versicherungs-beteiligungs-aktiengesellschaft-history/|website=Funding Universe|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 13, 1948 Forstreuter resigned from the chairmanship in favor of Hans Gerling, who became chairman of all Gerling companies in January 1949.

Control of the Gerling insurance group sparked a long legal battle between the three brothers. A settlement provided that Hans Gerling and initially his brother Walter retained the German companies of the Gerling Group, Robert received DM 30 million as compensation and the Swiss and American companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VERSICHERUNGEN / GERLING-KONZERN Der Bruderkrieg|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41761252.html|website=Der Spiegel|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Gerling initiated the construction of the Gerling skyscraper in Cologne Gereonsviertel, inviting sculptor [[Arno Breker]] to participate in the design. It was completed on January 25, 1953.

In 1954, Hans Gerling established Gerling-Konzern Globale Rückversicherungs-AG, an international reinsurance holding company, and Gerling Globale became the first German insurance company to expand overseas.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerling-Konzern Versicherungs-Beteiligungs-Aktiengesellschaft History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/gerling-konzern-versicherungs-beteiligungs-aktiengesellschaft-history/|website=Funding Universe|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Gerling founded on April 20, 1954, the Gerling Speziale Kreditversicherungs-AG, which initially operated credit, suretyship and fidelity insurance. After the departure of his youngest brother Walter, Hans Gerling took over in 1965 the sole management.

Together with [[Herbert Quandt]] and [[Emil Georg Bührle]], Hans Gerling financed Ivan David Herstatt's [[Herstatt Bank]], in which Gerling held a majority share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harald Wixforth, Bielefeld / Bremen|title=Upheavals, Continuities and Structural Change at Financial Center Cologne after WWII|url=http://www.ibf-frankfurt.de/ibf_paper_series/IBF_Paper_Series-11_17-WIXFORTH-Umbrueche_Kontinuitaeten_und_Strukturwandel-First_Draft.pdf|website=IBF Frankfurt|publisher=IBF Paper Series|accessdate=12 December 2017|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, enormous losses at the Herstatt Bank forced Hans Gerling to sell the Gerling insurance business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE BILLIONAIRES 1991|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1991/09/09/75462/index.htm|publisher=Fortune Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerling Continuing Talks With Zurich Insurance Unit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/28/archives/gerling-continuing-talks-with-zurich-insurance-unit.html|website=nytimes|publisher=New York Times|quote=Negotiations between the West German banking consortium Hans Gerling and the Zurich Insurance Group in an attempt to avoid the Bankhaus I.

Hans Gerling was inducted into the [[Insurance Hall of Fame]] in 2000, alongside [[Otto Von Bismarck]], one of only seven Germans to be so honored in the history of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insurance Hall of Fame|url=http://www.insurancehalloffame.org/laureateprofile.php?laureate=73|website=insurancehalloffame|publisher=Insurance Hall of Fame|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Andresen was born in 1961 in [[Oslo]], as the son of industrialist [[Johan Henrik Andresen (1930–2011)|Johan Henrik Andresen]] (1930–2011), and Swedish [[Bielke|noblewoman]] [[Marianne Andresen|Marianne Ebba Therese Bielke]]. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Government and Policy Studies from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1988, and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in 1993 from the [[Rotterdam School of Management]].&lt;ref name="orkla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orkla.no/bedriftsforsamling/johan-h-andresen|title=Orkla ASA&amp;nbsp;— Johan H.

== Personal life ==
Andresen is married to Kristin Gamlemshaug. The couple has two daughters, [[Katharina Andresen|Katharina]] and [[Alexandra Andresen|Alexandra]]. &lt;ref name="12mrd" /&gt; In 2007, Andresen transferred most of the Ferd Holding shares, for an estimated value of NOK 12 billion, to his daughters.&lt;ref name="12mrd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kjendis.no/2007/12/21/521892.html|title=Gir døtrene 12 milliarder|last=Solend|first=Per Arne|author2=Ulf Andre Andersen|date=2007-12-21|publisher=''[[Dagbladet]]''|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the grandson of [[Johan H. Andresen]], and the great-grandson of [[Johan Henrik Andresen (1815–1874)|Johan Henrik Andresen]].

== Professional career ==
Andresen was Product Manager in International Paper Co., USA from 1989 to 1991. In 1993 he became a Partner in the Norwegian industrial group Tiedemanns-gruppen. He succeeded his father as the sole owner and CEO in 1998, and thus became the fifth generation of the Andresen family in charge of the company since the first Johan H. Andresen bought the tobacco company J.L. Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik in 1849.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ferd.no/en/startpage|title = Historyline|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the tobacco production of Tiedemanns Tobaksfabrik was merged with the [[Scandinavian Tobacco Company]],&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.snl.no/Johan_Henrik_Andresen_jr. |title=Johan Henrik Andresen jr. |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927081649/http://snl.no/Johan_Henrik_Andresen_jr. |archivedate=September 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 Andresen sold all his shares in the company for [[Norwegian Krone|NOK]] &lt;span&gt;3.3 billion&lt;/span&gt;.

Tiedemanns-gruppen changed its name to Ferd in 2001. Today, Ferd owns Elopak, Aibel (50%),TeleComputing, Interwell and Swix Sport, among other companies, in addition to substantial portfolios of stock, hedge fund investments, Private Equity and property. The company’s net asset value has grown from NOK 7,4 billion in 2003 to NOK 24,3 billion as of year’s end 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ferd Annual Report 2013|last = |first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Andresen famously attempted to acquire the Swiss packaging and former weapons producer [[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft|SIG]], by placing a bid of NOK 11 billion for 50.01% of the shares in the company. Andresen's plan was to merge SIG with Ferd-owned Elopak, making it the world's second largest packaging manufacturer.&lt;ref name="dn_sig1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/naringsliv/article881693.ece|title=Andresen jr. med gigantbud|last=Bjørndal|first=Bente|date=2006-09-25|publisher=''[[Dagens Næringsliv]]''|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; SIG, however, initiated a [[bid price|bidding war]], and in March 2007 Ferd announced that it would no longer be pursuing the transaction. This would have been one of the largest acquisitions in Norwegian history.&lt;ref name="dn_sig2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/borsMarked/article1046542.ece|title=Andresen jr. kaster kortene i SIG|last=Langum Becker|first=Cecilie|date=2007-03-12|publisher=''[[Dagens Næringsliv]]''|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andresen chairs the Council on Ethics for the Government Pension Fund Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://etikkradet.no/en/council-members-2/|title =Counsil on Ethics, Council Members|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150126194917/http://etikkradet.no/en/council-members-2/#|archive-date =2015-01-26|dead-url =yes|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is Chairman of the Board of Ferd AS, and serves as a board member of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEB) in Sweden, NMI – Norwegian Microfinance Initiative, Junior Achievement –Young Enterprise, Europe, and Junior Achievement –Young Enterprise, Norway (Ungt Entreprenørskap).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ferd.no/en/about_ferd/board_and_administration/board_of_directors|title = Ferd home page, Board of Directors|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
In 2006, Andersen initiated a collaborative project between public and private interests. This led to the launching of NMI – Norwegian Microfinance Initiative in 2008, a microfinance institution aimed at stimulating growth in impoverished countries. In 2009 he formed Ferd Social Entrepreneurs, a separate non-commercial business area within Ferd that supports selected organizations, projects and individuals in activities where the social results carry greater weight than the financial results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mafersa S.A.''' is a [[Brazil]]ian manufacturer of passenger rail cars, buses and [[trolleybus]]es, and related components. It was founded in 1944 and was located in the city of [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref name="janes1997"&gt;Bushell, Chris (Ed.) (1997).  ''Jane's Urban Transport Systems 1997-98'', p. 451.  Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): [[Jane's Information Group]].  {{ISBN|0-7106-1562-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of 1997 it became a subsidiary of [[Alstom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mafersa S.A.|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=64783325 | accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of its customers were in Brazil. However, export orders included, in 1990–92, 38 stainless-steel [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] [[commuter rail]] cars for the [[Virginia Railway Express]]&lt;ref name="janes1991"&gt;Bushell, Chris (Ed.)

Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): Jane's Information Group.  {{ISBN|0-7106-0951-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (10 [[Control car (rail)|control cars]] [cab-equipped trailers] and 28 trailers)&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, William D.; and [[Mac Sebree|Sebree, Mac]] (1994). ''North American Commuter Rail 1994'', pp. 16 and 47. Pasadena (CA), US: [[Pentrex]]. ISSN 0160-6913.&lt;/ref&gt; and 256 [[Rapid transit|metro]]-car bodyshells for the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (as a subcontractor to [[Morrison-Knudsen]]).&lt;ref name="janes1991"/&gt;  In the mid-1980s the company built more than 270 [[Rapid transit|metro]] cars for [[Rio de Janeiro Metro|Rio de Janeiro]] and more than 400 for [[São Paulo Metro|São Paulo]], and these were built under license from the [[Budd Company]].&lt;ref name="janes1984"&gt;Bushell, Chris; and Stonham, Peter (Eds.)

In addition to building new rail vehicles, Mafersa also carried out overhauls of existing rail cars.&lt;ref name="janes1997"/&gt;

In 1997, Mafersa was acquired by Alstom.  A subsidiary of Alstom keeping the same name, Mafersa SA, continued producing rail vehicle components (such as wheels and [[axle]]s), while manufacturing of rail cars also continued but now under the name, "Alstom Transporte do Brazil S.A."&lt;ref name="janes1999"&gt;Pattison, Tony (Ed.)

==Buses==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7794">'''Micro businesses in the Philippines''' can be defined according to the size of assets, size of equity capital, and number of employees. A typical micro business is a business that employs nine people or fewer, with assets of {{Philippine peso|3 million and below}}.

In the Philippines, about 90 percent of all businesses are categorized as micro businesses. These consist of enterprises engaged in industry, agribusiness and or services, whether single proprietorship, cooperative, partnership or corporation. Their total assets, inclusive of those arising from loans but exclusive of the land on which the particular business entity’s office, plant and equipment are situated, have value of not more than {{Philippine peso|3 million}}.

Of all micro businesses, about 46 percent are involved in the wholesale, retail and repair business; 27.6 percent are in the accommodations and food service; 13.5 percent are in manufacturing; while 12.5 percent are engaged in other service categories.

== History ==
The “''[[Magna Carta]]'' for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)” is a landmark legislation that defines the current national policy to promote, support, strengthen, and encourage the growth and development of MSMEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://businesstips.ph/how-to-register-as-a-barangay-micro-business-enterprise-bmbe-in-the-philippines/|title=How to Register as a Barangay Micro Business Enterprise (BMBE) in the Philippines {{!}} Business Tips Philippines|website=businesstips.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enacted by the [[Philippine Congress]] in 1991 as RA 6977, amended by Republic Act 8289 in 1997, and further amended by RA 9501 in 2008, the law is geared towards the development of the Filipino entrepreneurial spirit by providing a business environment conducive for MSMEs.

The full texts of RA 6977, RA 8289, and RA 9501 and its IRR including the revised rules and regulations governing the mandatory allocation of credit resources provide ready reference for a complete compilation of laws on the ''Magna Carta'' for MSMEs.

== Comparison to other business models ==
Here is a quick guide to properly differentiate a micro business from other types of businesses:
{| class="wikitable"
!Category
!Assets
!No. of Employees
|-
|Micro
|{{Philippine peso|3 million and below}}
|9 employees or less
|-
|Small
|{{Philippine peso|3-15 million}}
|10-99 employees
|-
|Medium
|{{Philippine peso|15-100 million}}
|100-199 employees
|-
|Large
|{{Philippine peso|100 million and above}}
|200 employees and up
|}
MSMEs businesses are driven by profitability and stable long-term value.

A startup business’ objectives are focused on top-end revenue and growth potential. As defined by Steve Banks : “Start-up entrepreneurs have a more idealistic mentality, being more socialist, vs. the SME entrepreneurs, which are more financially driven. It is a “temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.” A startup is searching for answers to the product it will sell, the customer it will serve and the way it will make money from delivering value to its customers.

== Barangay Micro Business Enterprise (BMBE) ==
A business which falls under the ''Republic Act 9501 Magna Carta for Micro, Small, Medium Enterprise (MSME)'' is eligible of the following incentives from the BMBE:
# Income tax exemption from income arising from the operations of the enterprise
# Exemption from the coverage of the Minimum Wage Law (BMBE employees will still receive the same social security and health care benefits as other employees)
# Priority to a special credit window set up specifically for the financing requirements of BMBEs
# Technology transfer, production and management training, and marketing assistance programs for BMBE beneficiaries.
The government, in its objective to strengthen Barangay Micro Business Enterprises in the country and provide more jobs, livelihood and a better quality of life for Filipinos, has enacted Republic Act 9178, otherwise known as the “Barangay Micro Business Enterprises Act of 2002”.

In other words, a business or activity may be eligible to register as BMBE if they meet the following criteria:
# The business enterprise is engaged in production, processing, or manufacturing of products, including agro-processing, as well as trading and services.
# The business enterprise has total assets of {{Philippine peso|3 million}} or less including those arising from loans but excluding the land on which the plant and equipment are located.
# The business enterprise or service provider, in connection with his or her exercise of profession, is not a professional who is duly licensed by the government after having passed a government licensure examination for aspiring accountants, lawyers, doctors, and other professions.
# The business enterprise is not a branch, subsidiary, division or office of a large scale enterprise or it is not a franchisee.

== Recent Developments ==
Senator [[Bam Aquino]] was reported to announce his intention to pass two bills on MSMEs within a year. These are: the Small Business Tax Reform Act, which aims to give MSMEs a three-year operation period before imposing taxes; and the Philippine Startup Bill, which seeks to provide a viable environment for startups.

President Rodrigo Duterte has announced during his [[2016 State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|SONA held on July 25, 2016]] that he vows to carry out the following during his term:
# Improve the Ease of Doing Business ranking of the Philippines
# Cut processing times and streamline requirements by:
#* Addressing bottlenecks in business registration and processing
#* Streamlining investment applications processes
#* Integrating the services of various government offices
DTI Region 10 has held the "Negosyo Konsumer at iba pa" for MSMEs and consumers last August 17–19, 2016 in [[Cagayan de Oro]].

The activity included the launching of a fabrication laboratory; innovation technopreneurship; the Negosyo Center in the region; an E-Commerce forum; and a host of trainings for various business types.

== "ThinkMicro" Model ==
Since the third quarter of 2016, a move to empower micro businesses through an active eco system of support through funding, logistics and creative guidance has begun to take place. The move challenges everyone to consider the micro business model as a viable business option, and empowers aspiring entrepreneurs to pursue their business goals with the support they need. It gives due emphasis to the microbusiness model and how it can grow into a strong and stable enterprise that generates a steady stream of income, enough for it to expand as a world-class conglomerate while staying in the micro model.

It challenges the status quo to #thinkmicro, as the current hashtag relating to this school of thought suggests.

The move is both a nod and a push toward greater influence to earlier efforts of business advocates with similar intentions. Among them, the Go Negosyo]and DTI’s Kapatid campaign; Josiah Go's mentoring programs; and [[PLDT]]'s SME Nation "Ka-Asenso" campaign.

{{wiktionary|net}}

A '''net''' (sometimes written '''nett''') value is the resultant amount after accounting for the [[summation|sum]] or [[difference (mathematics)|difference]] of two or more variables.

In [[economics]], it is frequently used to imply the remaining value after accounting for a specific, commonly understood deduction.  In these cases it is contrasted with the term ''[[Gross (economics)|gross]]'', which refers to the pre-deduction value. For example, [[net income]] is the total income of a [[company]] after deducting its [[expenses]]—commonly known as [[Profit (economics)|profit]]—or the total income of an individual after deducting his or her [[income tax]].  Profit may be broken down further into pre-taxed or [[gross profit]] and profit after taxes or [[net profit]].  Similarly, an individual's [[net worth]] the difference between their [[asset]]s (what they own) and their [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] (what they owe to others).

Similarly, [[net investment]] in physical [[capital (economics)|capital]] such as machinery equals [[gross investment|gross (total) investment]] minus the dollar amount of replacement investment that offsets [[depreciation (economics)|depreciation]] of pre-existing machinery, thus giving the change in the amount of machinery available for use. Likewise, [[net national product]] equals [[gross national product]] minus depreciation.

==Etymology==
The word ''net'', in this sense, originally derives from the Latin ''nitere'' (to shine) and ''nitidus'' (elegant, trim), and more recently from the French ''net'' (sharp, neat, clean).&lt;ref&gt;New World Dictionary of the American Language, Simon and Schuster, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical usage==
In this sense, it may appear, separated by a comma, ''following'' the noun it modifies, e.g., "earned two million dollars, net".

==See also==
* [[Net metering]], electricity policy
* [[Net 30]], form of trade credit
* [[Net profit]], gross profit minus overhead and interest
* [[Net weight]], weight of a product, not counting packaging
* [[Net pay]], salary after deductions
* [[Net operating loss]]
* [[Present value]]

==Biography==
===Early life===
In 1972, Nikolai Glushkov graduated from the Moscow [[Peoples' Friendship University of Russia|Peoples' Friendship University]] with a degree in physics. In 1981, he completed the [[All-Russian Academy of Foreign Trade|Academy of Foreign Trade]] with a degree in economics.

=== His Aeroflot job, arrests, trials, and convictions===
Glushkov had been AvtoVAZ's Finance Chief until he left his job in autumn 1995 and was appointed as Deputy General Director of [[Aeroflot]] on request from [[Yevgeny Shaposhnikov]] in February 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Godfather of the Kremlin: The Decline of Russia in the Age of Gangster Capitalism |last=Klebnikov |first=Paul |isbn=0-15-601330-4 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alexander Goldfarb (biologist)|Alexander Goldfarb]], he found that the airline company worked as a "cash cow to support international spying operations":&lt;ref name="dissident"&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Death of a Dissident|Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB]] |last=Goldfarb |first=Alex |last2=Litvinenko |first2=Marina |date=2007 |publisher=The Free Press |isbn=1-4165-5165-4 |author-link=Alexander Goldfarb (biologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3,000 people out of the total workforce of 14,000 in Aeroflot were [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]], or [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]] officers. All proceeds from ticket sales were distributed to 352 foreign bank accounts that could not be controlled by the Aeroflot administration.  Glushkov closed all these accounts and channeled the money to Swiss company called Andava in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="dissident" /&gt; He also sent a bill and wrote a letter to SVR director [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and FSB director [[Mikhail Barsukov]], asking them to pay the salaries of their intelligence officers in Aeroflot in 1996.&lt;ref name="dissident" /&gt; Both Glushkov and [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Berezovsky]] were the main [[shareholder]]s of Andava at that time.&lt;ref name="rian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rian.ru/spravka/20071122/89057348.html |title=Aeroflot case. What Berezovsky is accused of? |date=2007-11-22 |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |lang=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, a Forbes article claimed that Glushkov was convicted of theft in 1982.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1996/1230/5815090a.html#92687067562d |title=Godfather of the Kremlin? |date=6 March 2003 |work=Forbes |access-date=2018-06-17 |language=en |orig-year=Dec. 30, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glushkov and Berezovsky sued Forbes for libel in the United Kingdom, with the ruling coming down against the publisher.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/nikolai-glushkov-who-was-russian-businessman-murdered-strangled-vladimir-putin-boris-berezovsky-a8260261.html|title=Who was the exiled Russian businessman murdered in London?|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glushkov was arrested in December 2000 by Russian law enforcers and charged with channeling money through his accounting center ''Andava''. He was a business partner and close friend of [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], who from November 2000 resided in Britain; Berezovsky had to give up his ownership of the [[Channel One Russia|ORT]] TV channel&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=January 3, 2001 |title=ORT Officials Accused of Contraband and Evading Customs Tariffs |url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=24&amp;issue_id=1931&amp;article_id=17910 |journal=MONITOR |issue=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122183938/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=24&amp;issue_id=1931&amp;article_id=17910 |archive-date=2006-11-22 |via=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferred them to [[Roman Abramovich]]'s [[Gazprom Neft|Sibneft]]) in exchange for the promise to release Glushkov, which was not fulfilled.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.ru/HISTORY/FELSHTINSKY/naslednik.txt |title=Владимир Прибыловский, Юрий Фельштинский.

In April 2001 [[Andrey Lugovoy]] organized an "escape" of Glushkov from a hospital where he was kept by authorities. According to Glushkov, that was a set-up by FSB. He had no intention to escape and "was walking in his slippers to the hospital gate to go home for the night, with his guards' knowledge, as he had done a few days earlier".&lt;ref name="dissident" /&gt;

During his trial, Glushkov was incarcerated in [[Lefortovo Prison]]. He was cleared of the original fraud and money laundering charges by the court in March 2004, but found guilty of attempted escape and "abuse of authority"&lt;ref name="dissident" /&gt; and sentenced to 3 years and 3 months of imprisonment. Glushkov was released in the courtroom, since he had already served his sentence in the pre-trial detention center. However, the Moscow City Court rejected the verdict and returned the case for new consideration. In 2006, the Savelovsky District Court terminated the prosecution of Glushkov, but gave him a two years of suspended sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://graniru.org/Events/Crime/m.268403.html |title=Не своя смерть: Британская полиция расследует смерть Глушкова как убийство |date=16 March 2018 |trans-title=Not my own death: British police investigates death of Glushkov as murder |lang=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emigration to UK and extradition request ===
Gluskov emigrated to the UK and received [[Right of asylum|political asylum]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="bbcconter" /&gt; The Russian state resumed his criminal prosecution. In 2017, during a trial ''in absentia'' in Russia, Glushkov was sentenced to eight years in prison for allegedly stealing $123 million from Aeroflot.&lt;ref name=guardianmarch2018 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20170303/277922666.html | title=Prosecutor again seeks 8 years in jail for Aeroflot ex-manager in embezzlement case | author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; | date=2017-03-03 | website=www.rapsinews.com | publisher=Russian Legal Information Agency | access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK refused to extradite him to Russia.&lt;ref name="cnnfoundead" /&gt;

=== Death ===
On 13 March 2018, friends of Glushkov revealed that he had been found dead the night before in his home in [[New Malden]], London. His death was initially treated by police as unexplained. His death came a week after the [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]] in [[Salisbury]], which along with his reputation as a critic of the Putin government, was said to be the reason for putting the [[Counter Terrorism Command]] in charge of the investigation.&lt;ref name="bbcconter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43385998|title=Counter-terror police investigate death|date=13 March 2018|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnfoundead"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/13/europe/nikolai-glushkov-russia-intl/index.html |title=Russian emigre Nikolai Glushkov found dead in London home|date=13 March 2018|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glushkov reportedly feared being on Putin's hit list and expected to be a likely target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/russian-exile-nikolai-glushkov-feared-12183797|title=Russian exile feared he was on Putin's hit-list five years before his death|first=Natalie|last=Evans|date=14 March 2018|publisher=|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process costing''' is an accounting methodology that traces and accumulates [[direct cost]]s, and allocates [[indirect cost]]s of a manufacturing process. Costs are assigned to products, usually in a large batch, which might include an entire month's production. Eventually, costs have to be allocated to individual units of product.  It assigns average costs to each unit, and is the opposite extreme of [[Job costing]] which attempts to measure individual costs of production of each unit.  Process costing is usually a significant chapter. It is a method of assigning costs to units of production in companies producing large quantities of homogeneous products..

Process costing is a type of operation costing which is used to ascertain the [[cost]] of a product at each process or stage of manufacture. [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]] defines process costing as "The costing method applicable where goods or services result from a sequence of continuous or repetitive operations or processes. Costs are averaged over the units produced during the period".
Process costing is suitable for industries producing homogeneous products and where production is a continuous flow. A process can be referred to as the sub-unit of an organization specifically defined for cost collection purpose.

==The importance of process costing==
Costing is an important process that many companies engage in to keep track of where their money is being spent in the [[Production (economics)|production]] and distribution processes. Understanding these costs is the first step in being able to control them. It is very important that a company chooses the appropriate type of costing [[system]] for their product type and industry. One type of costing system that is used in certain industries is '''process costing''' that varies from other types of costing (such as 
[[job costing]]) in some ways. In process costing unit costs are more like averages, the process-costing system requires less bookkeeping than does a job-order costing system. Thus, some companies often prefer to use the process-costing system.

==When is process costing applied?==
Process costing is appropriate for companies that produce a continuous mass of like units through series of operations or process. Also, when one order does not affect the production process and a standardization of the process and product exists. However, if there are significant differences among the costs of various [[product (business)|products]], a process costing system would not provide adequate product-cost information. Costing is generally used in such [[industries]] such as petroleum, coal mining, chemicals, textiles, paper, plastic, glass, food, banks, courier, cement, and soap.

==Reasons for use==
Compan units of product in a given period of time.
*Products are manufactured in large quantities, but products may be sold in small quantities, sometimes one at a time ([[automobiles]], loaves of bread), a dozen or two at a time (eggs, cookies), etc.
*Product costs must be transferred from Finished Goods to Cost of Goods Sold as sales are made. This requires a correct and accurate accounting of product costs per unit, to have a proper matching of product costs against related sales revenue.
*Managers need to maintain cost control over the [[manufacturing]] process. Process costing provides managers with feedback that can be used to compare similar product costs from one month to the next, keeping costs in line with projected manufacturing budgets.
*A fraction-of-a-cent cost change can represent a large dollar change in overall [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]], when selling millions of units of product a month. Managers must carefully watch per unit costs on a daily basis through the production process, while at the same time dealing with materials and output in huge quantities.
*Materials part way through a process (e.g. chemicals) might need to be given a value, process costing allows for this. By determining what cost the part processed material has incurred such as labor or overhead an "equivalent unit" relative to the value of a finished process can be calculated.''

==Process cost procedures==
There are '''four basic steps''' in [[accounting]] for Process cost:
* Summarize the flow of physical units of output.
* Compute output in terms of equivalent units.
* Summarize total costs to account for and Compute equivalent unit costs.
* Assign total costs to units completed and to units in ending work in process [[inventory]].

The journal entries for process costing are the same as those for job-order costing with one exception. The entry to transfer cost from one work-in-process account to another is:

Work-in-process inventory-second department          Debit (Left)

Work-in-process-first department                                      Credit (Right)

e.g.(1) Micro Labs Company produces house paint in two processing departments: the Mixing Department which mixes the paint colors and the Finishing Department which puts the paint in containers and labels them. The following information related to the company’s operation for October follows:

A) Raw materials were issued for use in production: Mixing department, $551,000, and the Finishing department, $629,000.
B) Direct labor costs incurred: Mixing department $230,000, and Finishing department $270,000. C) Manufacturing overhead cost applied: Mixing department $665,000, and Finishing department, $405,000. D) The cost of the mixed paint transferred from the Mixing department to the Finishing department was $1,850,000. E) Paint that had been prepared for shipping was transferred from the Finishing department to Finished Goods. Cost of the transferred paint was $3,200,000.

Required: Prepare journal entries to record items A) through E) above.

Solution(1):

 –Work in Process – Mixing           551,000
 –Work in Process – Finishing        629,000
 –Raw Materials                                 1,180,000
 –Work in Process – Mixing           230,000
 –Work in Process – Finishing        270,000
 –Wages and Salaries Payable                    500,000
 –Work in Process – Mixing           665,000
 –Work in Process – Finishing        405,000
 –Manufacturing Overhead                        1,070,000
 –Work in Process – Finishing        1,850,000
 –Work in Process – Mixing                      1,850,000
 –Finished Goods                     3,200,000
 –Work in Process – Finishing                   3,200,000

e.g.(2) Larney Corporation uses process costing. A number of transactions that occurred in June are listed below. As follows:

A) Raw materials that cost $38,200 are withdrawn from the storeroom for use in the Mixing Department. B) Direct labor costs incurred $36,500,in the Mixing Department. C) Manufacturing overhead of $42,100 is applied in the Mixing Department. D) Units with a carrying cost of $112,400 finish processing in the Mixing Department and are transferred to the Drying Department for further processing. E) Units with a carrying cost of $143,800 finish processing in the Drying Department, the final step in the production process, and are transferred to the finished goods warehouse. F) Finished goods with a carrying cost of $138,500

Required: Prepare journal entries to record items A) through F).

Solution (2):

 –work in process-mixing department       $38,200
 —raw materials                                     $38,200 
 –work in process                         $36,500 
 –salaries/wages payable                            $36,500 
 –work in process-mixing department       $42,100 
 –manufacturing overhead                            $42,100 
 –work in process-drying department.      $112,400
 –work in process mixing department                 $112,400
 –finished goods                          $143,800 
 –work in process-drying department                 $143,800 
 -costs of goods sold                     $138,500
 –finished goods                                    $138,500

==Operation cost in batch manufacturing==
[[Batch production|Batch]] costing is a modification of [[job costing]]. When production is repetitive nature and consists of a definite number of articles, batch is used. In batch costing, the most important problem is to determine the optimum size of the batch that follows the fact that production of two elements of costs:
* Set up costs which are generally fixed per batch.
* Carrying costs which vadetermination of batch quantity requires considerations of some factors:
* setting up costs per batch.
* cost of [[manufacturing]] such as ([[direct materials cost]] + direct [[wages]] + direct overhead) per piece.
* cost of [[Warehouse|storage]].
* rate of interest on the capital invested in product and rate of demand for product.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3012">'''Ragnar Sohlman''' (February 26, 1870 in [[Stockholm]] &amp;ndash; July 9, 1948 at the Karolinska hospital, [[Solna Municipality|Solna]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[chemical engineer]], [[Management|manager]], [[civil servant]], and creator of the [[Nobel Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/sohlman.html Nobelprize.org: Ragnar Sohlman - Executor of the Will (1870-1948)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Ragnar Sohlman (1870-1948).jpg|thumb|right|Ragnar Sohlman]]
Ragnar Sohlman was born in Stockholm, son to August Sohlman, a well-known newspaper man, and his wife Hulda Maria Sandeberg. In 1887, he enrolled at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm and graduated as a chemical engineer in 1890.

In 1893 Sohlman became the assistant of [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Sanremo|San Remo]], and Nobel's will from 1895 named him and [[Rudolf Lilljequist]] as [[executor]]s, with Sohlman expected to do most of the work. The will stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/will-full.html Nobelprize.org: Alfred Nobel's Will] (English translation)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|As Executors of my testamentary dispositions, I hereby appoint Mr Ragnar Sohlman, resident at Bofors, Värmland, and Mr [[Rudolf Lilljequist]], 31 Malmskillnadsgatan, Stockholm, and at Bengtsfors near Uddevalla. To compensate for their pains and attention, I grant to Mr Ragnar Sohlman, who will presumably have to devote most time to this matter, One Hundred Thousand Crowns, and to Mr Rudolf Lilljequist, Fifty Thousand Crowns;|Alfred Bernhard Nobel|will dated Paris, 27 November 1895}}

The sum of 100.000 [[Swedish krona|crowns]] was a very significant amount at the time, and made Sohlman a wealthy man. The amount can be compared to the prize amount of the first Nobel Prizes in 1901, 150.782 crowns each.&lt;ref&gt;Nobelprize.org: [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts/ Nobel Prize amounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Alfred Nobel's death on December 10, 1896, Sohlman was occupied for several years with the task of realizing Nobel's intentions of establishing the [[Nobel Prize]]. Since the will did not contain detailed regulations regarding selection of laureates and was contested by Nobel's relatives, the task kept Sohlman and his advisors occupied for several years. Sohlman was a member of the interim board of the Nobel Foundation.

Sohlman also had a career as engineer and manager in Nobel-related companies, such as [[Bofors]]. He was also the director general of the [[Swedish National Board of Trade]] 1935-1936.

He was the executive director of the Nobel Foundation 1929-1946.

Solhman's son was a Swedish diplomat and his grandson [[Michael Sohlman]] is the present executive director of the Nobel Foundation.

At the time of completion in 1974, it was the tallest building in Dallas at {{convert|710|ft|abbr=on}} and was originally known as the First International Bancshares Tower (First International Bancshares, Inc. was the new holding company parent of First National Bank in Dallas). In 1985, it was surpassed by [[Fountain Place]] and [[Bank of America Plaza (Dallas)|Bank of America Plaza]], which became Dallas's tallest building. It was also clear that Renaissance Tower would be overtaken by [[Comerica Bank Tower]] and [[Chase Tower (Dallas)|Chase Tower]] then under construction. Therefore, in order to regain some status, the building underwent a major renovation in 1986 that included a re-glazed exterior and removal of the lighting on its sides. In 1986, James T. Chiles was brought in by the owner, the Prudential Insurance Company of America to design the broadcast center and towers on top the building, one of which was {{convert|176|ft|abbr=on}}. This brought the structural height of the building up to {{convert|886|ft|abbr=on}}, securing its place as the second-tallest building in Dallas. Excluding antennas and spires, the Renaissance Tower is the fifth-tallest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[Dan Goodwin]], a high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate, scaled the outside of the Renaissance Tower on November 7, 1981, clad in a Spider-Man suit and using only suction cups and his hands and feet to climb the outside of the building. Goodwin later stated he made the climb as a gift to a young Dallas boy stricken with cystic fibrosis whom he had met shortly after his ascent of Chicago's [[Sears Tower]] on May 25, 1981. Goodwin scaled the Renaissance Tower on his twenty-sixth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dan Goodwin Building Climbs | url=http://www.skyscraperdefense.com/building_climbs.html | work=SkyscraperDefense| year=2010 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, [[Winstead PC]] moved from the Mercantile National Bank complex to the Renaissance Tower.&lt;ref name="Studymove"&gt;{{cite news | author=Steve Brown | title=Law firm Winstead may move from Renaissance Tower to Dallas' Uptown | url=http://next-generation-communications.tmcnet.com/news/2008/08/13/3598414.htm | work=The Dallas Morning News | date=August 12, 2008 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Winstead PC occupied almost {{convert|200000|sqft|abbr=on}} of space in the building. During that year, the firm hired [[CB Richard Ellis]] to study possibilities for relocation. Winstead selected an [[Uptown Dallas]] as a location and&lt;ref name="Studymove" /&gt; relocated in 2012.

In 1996, [[Blockbuster Inc.]], which was then headquartered in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], began studying the idea of moving its headquarters, which consisted of 400 employees, into {{convert|260000|sqft|abbr=on}} of space in the Renaissance Tower. In November 1996, Blockbuster confirmed that it was moving into {{convert|240000|sqft|abbr=on}} of space on eight floors in the Renaissance Tower, choosing floor 23 as their center of operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Steve Brown| title=Commercial real estate sales up 43% in 3rd quarter | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00376,0ED3D6EE64E8FFEB.html | work=The Dallas Morning News | date=22 November 1996 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Blockbuster sets meeting on move Video rental chain preparing possible relocation to Dallas | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&amp;s_site=dfw&amp;p_multi=ST&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF90BCC96B3AB5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | work=Fort Worth Star-Telegram | date=1 November 1996 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbuster moved all employees out of Renaissance Tower in 2011 following its bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Blockbuster headquarters will move out of Renaissance Tower into its McKinney distribution center | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20110429-blockbuster-headquarters-will-move-out-of-renaissance-tower-into-its-mckinney-distribution-center1.ece | work=DallasNews.com | date=29 April 2011 | accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Santa Fe''' is one of [[Mexico City|Mexico City's]] major business districts, located in the west part of the city in the ''delegaciones'' (boroughs) of [[Cuajimalpa]] and [[Álvaro Obregón, D.F.|Álvaro Obregón]]. The [[Paseo de la Reforma]] avenue and [[Metro Constituyentes|Constituyentes]] avenue are the primary means of access to the district from the central part of Mexico City. Santa Fe consists mainly of [[highrise]] buildings surrounding a large [[shopping mall]], [[Centro Santa Fe]], which is currently the largest mall in [[Latin America]].  The district also includes a residential area and three university campuses, among other facilities. The [[Toluca–Mexico City commuter rail]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; due to open in 2020, will also improve mobility and development in the district.

== History ==
[[File:SANTA FE, MEXICO DF PROYECTOS EN DESARROLLO.jpg|thumb|"Santa Fe" project]]
The current area of Santa Fe took its name from [[Santa Fe de Mexico (pueblo hospital)|Santa Fé de México]], the 16th century ''Pueblo Hospital of Santa Fe'', founded by [[Vasco de Quiroga]] in 1532. The ruins of the hospital still exist in the area.

=== Colonial period and independence ===

During the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial era]] (late 15th century – early 19th century) and the first century of independent Mexico (early 19th century – early 20th century), the then town of Santa Fe had an open landscape of sand mining activity, which was divided between the towns of Santa Fe, [[Monterrey|Santa Lucia]], [[San Mateo Atenco|San Mateo]] and [[San Pedro Garza García|San Pedro]] in Cuajimalpa.

Santa Fe was situated along the route of the former royal road connecting [[Tacubaya]] to [[Toluca]]. This road was located on the present-day avenue that is known by the name of Cuajimalpa Arteaga and Salazar, traversing the Sierra de las Cruces mountains and continuing by the current route of the federal interstate highway that connects Mexico City to Toluca. During the [[Porfiriato]] era, a steam tramline was built on the former royal road, which at first ended at Santa Fe, and later expanded to [[La Venta]], [[Cuajimalpa]], and San Ángel. Several trees were removed during the construction of the tramline towards San Ángel.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===

The presence of sandbanks in the area was exploited in the 1930s to feed the growing construction industry in Mexico City. The extraction of sand had the unfortunate consequence of creating a deep trench in the landscape, almost 4&amp;nbsp;km long by 2&amp;nbsp;km wide and in some places up to 100 meters in depth.

A number of other land usage problems surfaced during this time period.
* The diversion of the Tacubaya River during construction of the federal highway to Toluca, meant that no water source was left available to supply the river that feeds the area of [[Lomas de Chapultepec|Lomas]], through the natural flow of water and drainage of the area by gravity.
* Abrupt changes in ground level meant that the area had very limited potential for road building, as there was a natural barrier north of the neighborhoods that were being constructed, ravines were present to the east and west, and the [[Desert of the Lions]] national park was located to the south.
* As construction was taking place above a solid bedrock, the lack of natural drainage meant that potable water lines that were introduced were in danger of becoming contaminated by [[leachate]] that could not be removed from the soil. It was difficult to introduce artificial drainage lines due to the mechanical weakness of the soil. Also, soil settlements were in danger of rupturing and further increasing soil pollution, which led to gases being released every so often.

=== 1950s ===

In 1953, after a derailment where several were killed in what is now the colony's Ocote Cuajimalpa, electric train service was withdrawn. the old royal road to Toluca already had by then  strong competition from road federal Toluca, which runs along the west ridge which had to be stopped to avoid the collapse of the road. Today, in the south of the Calle 16 de Septiembre, one can see the outline of the path that requires them to leave the eastern ridge bordering the area and who once was a slum called Romita. This right of way gave rise to the Avenida Tamaulipas which connects with the road from Santa Lucia and the avenue Vasco de Quiroga.

=== 1960s ===

In the 1960s, sand deposits became difficult to exploit because reinforcement of the walls became increasingly difficult and costly, so the mine owners began to sell the mines to the Federal District, which used it as landfill. Contrary to what is said, from the northern edge of Santa Fe Shopping Center to the area of the colony was used as Pena Blanca dump, even on the side of Cuajimalpa with tunnels that cross to walk of Tamarind. It was a mess that was duly closed and locked when President [[José López Portillo]] built his residential complex in the place popularly known as "Dog Hill."

=== 1970s ===

In the early 1970s, an urban development plan was created for the area, which would be built in an industrial zone in the area to provide jobs to locals and develop import substitution, between what is planned consider creating the social rehabilitation center west "Ceres" like those built in the north, south and west of Mexico City. This plan did not consider the construction of residential areas as it was anticipated the weak capacity to carry water or drainage out of the area. This even had to be ratified by the boards of neighbors from the surrounding towns.

=== 1980s ===

In the 1980s, most landfills had been closed and building construction had begun.

In 1982, the [[Universidad Iberoamericana]] was built on land donated by the Santa Fe unity government, marking the change from industrial land usage to the development of a residential area of great economic importance.

=== 1990s ===

During the administration of President [[Carlos Salinas|Salinas de Gortari]] (1988–1994), the mayor of the city, [[Manuel Camacho Solís]], and his colleagues devised a project that in theory would be similar to the [[edge city]] of [[La Défense]] in [[Paris]], which would be located on existing landfills. A major risk due to building on existing landfills was the spread of contaminated water that would slip into Mexico City's water supply. Modern building techniques had to be initiated to spread several flattened layers of sand over millions of tons of garbage. To safely build upon the landfill, the City created a modern Master Program which the government and investors regulate.

It is in this decade that a construction boom began with the arrival of the Santa Fe Mall.  At this time and under the authority of [[Manuel Camacho Solís]], evictions were issued to the dwellers of Romita and other neighborhoods. Most of the dwellers have resettled in the San Jose neighborhood at Cuajimalpa. Through this avenue there is access to Tamaulipas and there started the construction of the toll highway Mexico-Toluca, which was to be extended on the outskirts of the city to reach the highway to Cuernavaca.

As a result of the economic crisis in Mexico in 1994, the master plan was halted and it was not until 2000 when the first phase of Santa Fe City was reinstated. Another of Santa Fe's original projects was cancelled, the so-called "Mountain Meadows Park", as the West Alameda Park; there are three other Alameda Parks in the northern, eastern, and southern parts of Mexico City.

=== 2000s===

The inadequate road infrastructure, energy, hydro power, which was originally planned for a residential zone, and residents, generated active participation in solving their basic problems, so they propose and manage a new organization where they create a sort of government procedure in which a special item given: the GDF without telling borough governments, leading to coordination problems. For example, for drinking water can not connect to networks and to get their Cuajimalpa sewage cannot connect to networks of Álvaro Obregón and no treatment plant exists in proximity. Hence the new Government of Mexico City "GDF" has presented proposals for solution, as a road tunnel that starts from the Roma to City Santa Fe, which fail to be viable the high economic investment.

For those circumstances, in 2011, the possibility of creating a new office in the area is considered. The new borough of Mexico City was seen more as a way of validating the almost self-government in the area for the trust that manages it because the proposal covers only residential and commercial areas of high economic level, excluding the low level found on its periphery, which are part of the problem, since that is where are the roads and networks that feed the area.

== Santa Fe Trust ==

[[File:Los rascacielos de Santa Fe - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|Roadways at Santa Fe]]

Along with the creation of Santa Fe industrial project in the 1970s was created a trust, where the government of the then Federal District "DDF" participate with their respective offices responsible for urban development, giving investors the facilities in the area electricity, lighting, roads, water and drainage to install its industry. But with the change of plans the plans were modified the characteristics of flows and inflows, which have great impact on the area.
In 1994 the Association of Settlers Zedec Santa Fe, CA with the first investors in this development, among these we have:

* Automotriz Hermer, SA of C.V.
* Banca Serfin, SA of C.V.
* Impulsora Corporate Real Estate, SA of C.V.
* Corporate Option Santa Fe II, SA of C.V.
* Universidad Iberoamericana, A.C.
* Santa Fe Park, SA of C.V.
* Property Home, SA of C.V.
* Hewlett Packard de Mexico, SA of C.V.

Residents created the Association of Settlers Zedec Santa Fe in 1999, to present a common front to the problems that were found in the area.

On February 23, 2004 under the government of [[Marcelo Ebrard]], who had been Secretary to the Government of the DDF under the government of the regent [[Manuel Camacho Solis]], with infrastructure problems and challenges for the Federal District to meet the objectives of the original trust was created the Trust Colon de Santa Fe, constituted by the Government of the District Federal and Settlers Association Zedec Santa Fe This is because in its origin was an urban infrastructure development, where the federal government represented by the DDF was responsible for providing urban infrastructure for industrial use, even thought to use the right of way of the old railroad to build a radio station, connecting the cities of Toluca and Mexico. Something similar to the current [[Ferrocarril Suburbano de la Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México|''Tren Suburbano'']] (suburban train) from [[Buenavista Station]] to [[Cuautitlán]], which is partly drawn from the current highway. For this reason it has kept the local governments out of both the administration and budgets have been invested in the area by the government. Not to mention that some areas for security reasons are closed to the public way, has had to hire police corps and industrial bank, has had to provide water supply service pipes and removal by sewage pipes also.

The agreement invested amounts are a percentage of property tax and are subject to review and approval expressed by the technical committee as the highest authority of the trust and trustee, this is composed of 7 members of which 4 are appointed by the association and the 3 remaining the Federal District government and decisions are taken by majority vote and at least 1 of the GDF with the president casting vote in case of tie and extraordinarily many times as needed.

==Design==
[[File:SantaFeMexico.jpg|thumb|250px|Row of Cruz Manca's buildings seen from 'La Mexicana']]
Academics from many universities in Mexico and abroad have studied Santa Fe's design. Some believe that the design is well-planned while others believe that the design is poor and will harm the area. Enrique Martín Moreno and María Moreno of [[Iberoamericana University]] characterize Santa Fe as a self-contained city where the inhabitants do not venture outside. Jeffrey Inaba of [[Harvard University]] argued that Santa Fe should build connections to other parts of Mexico City. Roque González, the author of the original Santa Fe development project, said in 2005 "in 15 years will be a serious problem due to the fact that there are insufficient roads, public spaces, pedestrian areas. We're headed straight into gridlock and a lack of spaces usable by humans."&lt;ref name="GrajedaTrouble"&gt;Grajeda, Ella.

==Transportation==
Road access from central Mexico City remains inadequate, with Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida Constituyentes both congested at peak hours. Plans have been circulated to build a tunnel from the [[Circuito Interior]] in [[Condesa]] along Constituyentes to the point where it meets Reforma just before Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=BID/FOMIN/PIAPPEM|url=http://www.cca.org.mx/ps/funcionarios/muniapp/descargas/Documentos_de_apoyo/otros/Caso_hipotetico_TallerPIAPPEM_2011.pdf|title=CASO: TÚNEL URBANO PONIENTE: CONSTITUYENTES|date=2011-02-16|accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Supervía Poniente]] opened, a toll road linking Santa Fe with the [[Anillo Periférico]] ring road at San Jerónimo in southwestern Mexico City.
Just west of Santa Fe, the [[Autopista Chamapa-La Venta|Chamapa-La Venta]] toll road connects to the [[Interlomas]] edge city and points north.

===Public transportation===
As far as public transportation, there are [[pesero]] minibuses and regular public buses. The ''Ecobus'' connects Santa Fe with [[Metro Balderas]] in [[downtown Mexico City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtp.gob.mx/rutas_ordinario/RUTA%20ECOBUS.pdf|title=''Ruta Ecobus'', RTP (Mexico City)|website=Rtp.gob.mx|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other buses connect to [[Metro Tacubaya]] and [[Metro La Villa-Basílica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uia.mx/web/site/tpl-Nivel2.php?menu=eiEntorno&amp;seccion=euUbicacioncomo|title=Universidad Iber|website=IBERO|accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Despite the criticism Santa Fe continues its development. However, the lack of infrastructure and over-investment have created an oversupply of commercial real estate.  According to Colliers the vacancy rate in Santa Fe is 27 percent (2005), the highest in the city.  This oversupply in the commercial real estate market can also be seen in the monthly rent, having been the highest in the city for A+ buildings it is now in the average c (range of $20–25 per square meter), Higher that of the central [[Paseo de la Reforma]] and [[Polanco]] markets.

[[File:S.F. Edge.png|thumb|Selwyn Francis Edge 1868-1940]]
'''Selwyn Francis Edge''' (1868–1940) was a British businessman, [[race car driver|racing driver]], cyclist and record-breaker. He is principally associated with selling and racing De Dion-Bouton, Gladiator; Clemént-Panhard, Napier and AC cars.&lt;ref name=Wise-589/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Bordeaux Paris Englisches Team.jpg|thumb|S F Edge (far right) in the English Cycle Team, [[Bordeaux–Paris#History|Bordeaux-Paris 1891]] won by [[George Pilkington Mills|Mills]] second from left]]
Edge was born in [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]] township,&lt;ref name=Wise-589/&gt; near Sydney, on 29 March 1868; his parents were Alexander Ernest Edge and Annie Charlotte Sharp.{{r|ODNB}} At age three,&lt;ref name=Wise-589/&gt; he was taken to London where in his teens he competed successfully as a bicycle racer, winning the Westerham Hill climb when he was nineteen.{{r|ODNB}} One of the English Team and aged 23 he came 3rd in the first [[Bordeaux–Paris]] cycle race in 1891. He worked for [[Daniel Rudge|Rudge]] then [[Harvey Du Cros]] as manager of his new [[Dunlop Rubber#Pneumatic Tyre|Dunlop]] offices in London.{{r|ODNB}} In 1892 he married Eleanor Rose Sharp who died sometime before 1917; his second wife, Myra Caroline Martin, whom he married in 1917, had two daughters by him.{{r|ODNB}}

From 1910 until at least 1922 he resided at Gallops Homestead, [[Ditchling]], Sussex, and from 1912–19, courtesy of his contract with Napiers, he devoted himself to farming.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

He died 12 February 1940 in Eastbourne, Sussex, England.&lt;ref name=Guardian_13_Feb_1940/&gt;

==Business career==
In 1899, he went into partnership with pioneering motorist Charles Jarrott and Herbert Duncan to found [[De Dion-Bouton]] British and Colonial Ltd as importers of cars. He had become friends with [[Montague Napier]] (of [[Napier &amp; Son]]), another keen cyclist, and in 1898 asked Napier to carry out some improvements to his [[Panhard]]. In 1899, along with [[Harvey du Cros]], Edge formed the Motor Vehicle Company Ltd to sell these improved cars, made by Napiers (Edge paid [[Pound sterling|₤]]400, selling at £500),&lt;ref name=Hull_p1485/&gt; as well as [[Gladiator Cycle Company|Gladiator]]s and [[Clément-Panhard]]s, both manufactured in Paris by [[Adolphe Clément-Bayard]].&lt;ref name=Wise-589/&gt;
[[File:Mr S. F. Edge and his 16HP Napier Car 6067362615.jpg|thumb|Selwyn Edge and his 16 hp Napier Car|alt=Man sitting in open-top vehicle]]
In 1907 ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' reported: "S. F. Edge (1907), Ltd., has been registered at Somerset House, London, with a capital of £275,000, to carry on the business of motor car, cycle, launch, and flying machine manufacturers." &lt;ref&gt;''The Sydney Morning Herald'', Thursday 29 August 1907, Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He sold his company, S.F. Edge Ltd, to Napier in 1912, for £120,000.&lt;ref name=Wise-589/&gt; The sale included an agreement not to be involved in motor manufacturing for seven years. During this period he devoted himself to farming at Ditchling, Sussex.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;

In 1917 he was appointed controller of the agricultural machinery department of the [[Ministry of Munitions]].&lt;ref name=Guardian_13_Feb_1940/&gt;

When the embargo on motor manufacturing expired in 1919 he started to build up a shareholding in [[AC Cars]], gaining full control in 1922. About 1923 Edge was also managing director of William Cubitt &amp; Company, who had entered the car market with the Cubitt ''marque'', but were out of business by 1925.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vintage Car 1919–1930'', T.R. Nicholson, Batsford, 1966, Page 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Edge switched the contract for purchasing engines for the AC car from [[Anzani]], where he also sat on the board, to Cubitt, who produced what was essentially a copy of the Anzani design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishanzani.co.uk/HISTORY2.htm See history of British Anzani company]&lt;/ref&gt; Edge purchased AC cars outright for £135,000 in 1927.&lt;ref name=Guardian_17_Mar_1927/&gt; When AC collapsed in 1929, Edge sold his interest in the company and took no further business interest in the motor industry.&lt;ref name=Wise-589/&gt;

==Motor racing==
Recognizing the value of publicity gained from [[auto racing]], which no other British marque did,&lt;ref name=Wise-589/&gt; Edge entered an 8&amp;nbsp;hp (6&amp;nbsp;kW) four-cylinder Napier in the [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club]]'s 1900 Thousand Miles (1600&amp;nbsp;km) [[Classic Trials|Trial]] of the [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club]] on behalf of [[Edward Kennard]]; driven by Edge, with Kennard along, on a circuit from Newbury to Edinburgh and back, she won her class, being one of only thirty-five finishers (of sixty-four starters)&lt;ref name=Hull_p1483/&gt; and one of just twelve to average the requisite 12&amp;nbsp;mph (19&amp;nbsp;km/h) in England and 10&amp;nbsp;mph (16&amp;nbsp;km/h) in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Hull_p1486-7/&gt; He did the same (with [[Charles Rolls|C. S. Rolls]] his [[riding mechanic]]) at the 837&amp;nbsp;mi (1350&amp;nbsp;km) [[Paris-Toulouse-Paris]] [[rally racing|rally]] in June; the car would be eliminated due to ignition trouble.&lt;ref name=Hull_p1486-7/&gt;

In the 1901 [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing|Gordon Bennett Cup]], Edge entered a special 17-litre Napier which he was only able to test ''en route'' because it had been completed on 25 May, only four days before the event. Montague Napier was the riding mechanic. The car was too powerful for the Dunlop tyres and fitting new French tyres led to disqualification, since they were not of the same national of origin.&lt;ref name=Hull_p1486-7/&gt; In the concurrent [[Paris-Bordeaux rally]], it retired with clutch trouble.&lt;ref name=Hull_p1486-7/&gt;

For the 1902 Gordon Bennett, Edge's Napier was the sole British entrant; with his cousin, Cecil Edge, as riding mechanic, he won, at an average 31.8&amp;nbsp;mph (51.2&amp;nbsp;km/h) (though by default, since the French entrants all fell out).&lt;ref name=Hull_p1486-7/&gt; The preparation of the car was hurried with some parts being fitted on the train to Paris. Additionally the second gear had not been hardened properly so, on arriving in Paris, Edge got the gear out, contacted his friend [[Adolphe Clément-Bayard|Adolphe Clément]] (Adolphe Clément-Bayard), borrowed his factory, hardened the gear, reassembled everything, and went on to win the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birthplaceofspeed2005.com/napier2.htm |publisher=Birthplace of Speed |title=Profile of the restored 1902 Napier that won the Gordon Bennet Trophy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204095948/http://www.birthplaceofspeed2005.com/napier2.htm |archivedate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Miss Dorothy Levitt &amp; the 12h.p. Gladiator car which she drove in a series of reliability trials in 1903.jpg|thumb|Miss Dorothy Levitt and her 12 hp [[Gladiator Cycle Company|Gladiator]]]]
At the 1903 Gordon Bennett, Edge had an 80&amp;nbsp;hp (60&amp;nbsp;kW) Napier, the Type K5, but was disqualified.&lt;ref name=Hull_p1486-7/&gt; Edge (with [[Arthur McDonald]], manager of Napiers' [[Genoa]] factory, as riding mechanic) fared no better with the K5 in the 1904 Gordon Bennett in Germany.

In 1903 Edge's eye for publicity created a world first when, on 2 October, [[Dorothy Levitt]] won her class at the Southport Speed Trials driving his 12 Hp [[Gladiator Cycle Company|Gladiator]], shocking [[History of British society|British society]] as she was the first woman, a working secretary, to compete in a 'motor race'.&lt;ref name=Codrivers/&gt; 
:''... "Selwyn Edge, Director of the Napier Car Company and famous racing driver ... spotted Miss Dorothy Levitt amongst his staff, a beautiful secretary with long legs and eyes like pools. In a bid to promote his cars ... Edge decided that she should take part in a race, though first he had to teach her to drive. She surpassed his expectations by winning her class in the 1903 Southport Speed Trial, and proved such a good driver that she was taken on by De Dion for a major publicity stunt."'' Jean Francois Bouzanquet&lt;ref name=Bouz/&gt;
[[File:S.F. Edge lors de son record du monde des 24 heures sur Napier 60HP en 1908.jpg|thumb|Breaking the 24-hour distance record]]
In June 1907 Edge broke the 24-hour distance record, driving a 60&amp;nbsp;hp (44.7&amp;nbsp;kW) Napier six, at the newly opened [[Brooklands]] track, accompanied by riding-mechanic Joseph H Blackburn.(Born 17 December 1875 D 8 May 1919)&lt;ref name=Mercury/&gt; He covered 1,581 miles (2544&amp;nbsp;km), 1,310 yards at an average speed of 65.905&amp;nbsp;mph (106.06&amp;nbsp;km/h). This record stood for 18 years.&lt;ref name=Hull_p1486-7/&gt; In 1910 Edge was awarded the [[Dewar Trophy]] for his drive in top gear in a {{convert|60|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Napier on the route London-Edinburgh-London.&lt;ref name=MotorSport/&gt;

In 1922 Edge returned to Brooklands in a [[Spyker]] setting a new "Double 12" world record covering 1,782 miles 1,066 yards (2,868&amp;nbsp;km 693 m) at an average speed of {{convert|74.27|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for the aggregate 24 hours.&lt;ref name=Guardian_21_Jul_1922/&gt;

His final contribution to motor racing was the inauguration of the Campbell Circuit at Brooklands in 1937.&lt;ref name=Wise-589/&gt;

==Motor yachting ==
[[Image:Dorothy Levitt driving the Napier motor yacht 1903.jpg|thumb|[[Dorothy Levitt]] driving S.F. Edge's Napier motor yacht 1903]]
In 1903 Edge won the inaugural British International [[Harmsworth Trophy]] for speedboats held on the River Lee, Queenstown, [[Cork Harbour]], Ireland, in a boat called ''Napier I''. The {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} steel-hulled, '[[Napier &amp; Son|Napier]]' speedboat fitted with a 3-blade propeller, achieved {{convert|19.3|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. It was driven by [[Dorothy Levitt]], but as both owner and entrant "S.F.Edge" is engraved on the trophy as the winner. The third crew member, Campbell Muir, may also have taken the controls.&lt;ref name="Field 2"/&gt;

In May 1905 ''The Rudder'' reported that :

:The first event of the season, the Monaco meeting, from 2 to 16 April, ... is without precedent [for quantity of entrants] in yachting history; beginning with an exhibition of all types of motor-boats, lasting four days, after which three days afloat were allowed for preparations, the races began on 9 April and continued for the following week.&lt;ref name="Field 2"/&gt;

Edge, driving ''[[Napier &amp; Son|Napier II]]'', won the {{convert|100|km|mi|}} race for racers in the eight to 12 metres classes in 1 hour 5 minutes, he also finished second in ''Napier 1'' as it was common practice to describe the owner and entrant as the driver, even if he did not take the wheel.&lt;ref name="Field 2"&gt;[http://www.lesliefield.com/other_history/french_launches_and_launch_engin.htm Hydroplane History – French Launches and Launch Engines of 1905 by W. P. Stephens. (Transcribed from ''The Rudder'', May 1905, p. 283-287)]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__

== The term in software analysis ==

In the context of [[software analysis]], the term software ecosystem is defined by Lungu &lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Mircea |last=Lungu |title=Reverse Engineering Software Ecosystems |publisher=University of Lugano |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as “a collection of software projects, which are developed and co-evolve in the same environment”. The environment can be organizational (a company), social (an [[Open-source software|open-source]] community), or technical (the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] ecosystem). The ecosystem metaphor is used in order to denote an analysis which takes into account multiple software systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crystalnix.com/blog/2012/11/23/software-ecosystems/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130120005654/http://crystalnix.com/blog/2012/11/23/software-ecosystems/ |archivedate=2013-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most frequent of such analyses is [[Static program analysis|static analysis]] of the [[source code]] of the [[software component|component]] systems of the ecosystem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21414">'''[[Trade]]''' can be a key factor in '''[[economic development]]'''. The prudent use of trade can boost a country's [[Economic development|development]] and create absolute gains for the trading partners involved. Trade has been touted as an important tool in the path to development by prominent economists. However trade may not be a panacea for development as important questions surrounding how [[free trade]] really is and the harm trade can cause domestic infant industries to come into play.

==Overview==
The current consensus is that trade, development, and [[poverty reduction]] are intimately linked. Sustained [[economic growth]] over longer periods is associated with [[poverty reduction]], while [[trade]] and growth are linked. Countries that develop invariably increase their integration with the [[global economy]], while [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]] has been no no no they used writing to remember about the leaders 

Continents, countries and sectors that have not developed and remain largely poor have comparative advantage in three main areas:

* natural [[resource exploitation]], i.e. running down of [[natural capital]] such as [[rain forest]] [[timber]];
* low-education labor-intensive [[manufacturing]], due to high [[population density|population densities]] and little suitable land per person;
* [[agriculture]], due to low population densities and relatively large areas of suitable land per person.

Crucially for poverty reduction, the latter two at least are labor-intensive, helping to ensure that growth in these sectors will be poverty-reducing. However, low value-added, [[price instability]] and sustainability in these [[commodity]] sectors means they should be used only temporarily and as stepping stones in the path to [[economic development]].

==Agriculture==
In many developing countries, [[agriculture]] employs a large proportion of the [[labor force]], while [[food consumption]] accounts for a large share of household income. The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) notes that this means that “even small changes in agricultural employment opportunities, or prices, can have major socio-economic effects in developing countries”.  Thus whatever the development strategy a particular country adopts, the role of agriculture will often be crucial. In 1994, the agricultural sector employed over 70% of the labor force in low-income countries, 30% in middle-income countries, and only 4% in [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income countries]] (UNCTAD 1999).

In [[poor countries]] with low [[population densities]] and enough suitable land area, which includes most countries in Africa and Latin America, agriculture is central to the economy. In poor regions and rural areas within middle-income developing countries, the concentration of poverty in rural areas of otherwise better-off developing countries makes the development of agriculture vital there. Finally, in Net Food Importing Developing Countries (NFIDCs), there is a positive link between growing agricultural exports and increases in local food production, which makes agricultural development if anything even more important, as [[food security]] and the financial stability of the government are also at stake. In [[Vietnam]] in the 1990s, increases in production and export of coffee of 15% a year contributed to a nearly 50% rise in food production in the same period. As agricultural GDP grew 4.6% per year, rural poverty fell from 66% in 1993 to 45% in 1998 (Global Economic Prospects 2002:40).

Anderson et al. (1999) estimate annual [[welfare]] losses of $19.8 billion for developing countries from agricultural tariffs – even after [[Uruguay Round]] reforms. This is three times the loss from [[OECD]] import restrictions on textiles and clothing. A combination of better market access, and domestic reforms and foreign aid to enhance the ability of developing countries to take advantage of it, could have a significant impact on poverty reduction, and help to meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

The largest beneficiaries of agricultural [[economic liberalization|liberalization]] would be OECD countries themselves: welfare losses of $62.9bn a year are estimated as resulting from the distortionary policies (Binswanger and Ernst 1999:5). Nor is the traditional objective of OECD agricultural subsidy (supporting small farmers) achieved by this system in a manner that could be characterised as efficient: most of the producer support incomes goes to better-off farmers, with the poorest 40% receiving just 8% of the support spent.

==Market access==

===Market access to developed countries===
The issue of market access to high-income countries is a thorny but crucial one. The issues fall into three main groups: first, those relating to deliberately imposed [[barriers to trade]], such as [[tariffs]], [[import quota|quotas]], and tariff escalation. Second, barriers to trade resulting from domestic and external producer support, primarily in the form of [[subsidies]], but also including, for example, export credits. Third, those relating to indirect barriers to trade resulting from developing countries’ lack of institutional capacity to engage in the global economy and in multilateral institutions (e.g., the [[World Trade Organization]]) on equal terms.

====Barriers to trade====
* High [[tariffs]] are imposed on agriculture: in high-income countries, the average tariff rate on agriculture is almost double the tariff for manufactures. And more than one third of the European Union's agricultural tariff lines, for instance, carry duties above 15% [http://www.WorldTradeOrganization.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/special_study_6_e.pdf]. Tariff peaks within agriculture occur most frequently on processed products and temperate commodities, rather than the major export crops of [[least developed countries]] (unprocessed fruits and vegetables and tropical commodities). However, many developing countries in temperate zones have the potential of competing as lower-cost producers in temperate commodities. Thus liberalization could open up new development-through-trade possibilities.
* Strong tariff escalation is typically imposed on agricultural and food products by high-income countries. This strongly discourages the development of high [[value added]] exports, and hinders [[Agricultural diversification|diversification]] in particular as well as development in general. In high-income countries, tariffs on agricultural products escalate steeply, especially in the EU and Japan. ('Tariff escalation' is the imposition of higher import tariffs on processed products than the tariffs applied to unprocessed ingredients. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/tariff_escalation_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Complex tariffs make it more difficult for developing country exporters to access industrialised-country markets because of the disadvantages developing countries face in accessing, and in their capacity to process, information. Not only are price signals distorted, they are often unclear, subject to change (for example seasonally) and difficult to interpret. [http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/c1em8d3.en.pdf]
* [[Tariff-rate quota]]s (TRQs), introduced by the Uruguay Round with the aim of securing a minimum level of market access, have performed poorly. Average fill rates have been low and declining, from 67% in 1995 to 63% in 1998, with about a quarter of TRQs filled to less than 20%. The low fill rate may reflect high in-quota rates. Overall, the UR tariffication process which produced them has not resulted in the increased market access developing countries hoped for.

====Producer support====
* [[agricultural policy|Support to agricultural producers]] remains sizable, at about five times the level of international development assistance - $245 billion in 2000. Total support to agriculture, as defined by the OECD, reaches $327 billion  - 1.3% of OECD countries’ GDP. To some extent these can be justified by “multifunctionality” arguments, but it remains a priority to find means of support which effectively meet the primary objectives without the negative developmental and environmental consequences that have been seen in the past.
* The dumping of unwanted production surpluses onto the world market through export subsidies has depressed prices for many temperate agricultural commodities, with EU surpluses of exportable wheat a prime example. (Despite several [[Common Agricultural Policy]] reforms, domestic support for wheat - as measured by OECD producer support estimates - declined only marginally from an average 52% of gross farm receipts in 1986-88, to around 48% in 1998-2000. [http://www.worldbank.org/prospects/gep2002/])  The [[URAA]] has been relatively unsuccessful in disciplining export subsidies, with the proportion of subsidised exports in total exports increasing in many products of export interest for developing countries: for example for wheat, from 7% in 1995 to 25% in 1998. The cost to developing country production and exports is considerable, and only partially offset by the lower food prices available to [[NFIDC]] consumers. This form of transfer from high-income country taxpayers to low-income consumers is in any case rather inefficient, and the lower prices may harm production for local consumption even in NFIDCs. Agricultural reform as a whole, including the removal of export subsidies, would only result in quite small price rises for developing-country consumers.
*The [[business cycle|counter-cyclical]] nature of producer support is also harmful to developing-country producers. High-income farmers are insulated from changes in world prices, making production less responsive to swings in demand. As a result, world commodity prices are more volatile, and the burden of adjustment falls disproportionately on developing-country producers.

====Lack of capacity====
This includes [[non-tariff barriers]] such as food regulations and standards, which developing countries are often not (or not effectively) involved in setting, and which may be deliberately used to reduce competition from developing countries. In any case, the lack of capacity to meet implement regulations and ensure compliance with standards constitutes a barrier to trade, and must be met by increasing that capacity.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have identified many capacity related issues that developing economies face aside from tariff barriers:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# Traders and potential traders must know about an agreement and its details, however, the interests and skills of good producers lie in production and not in legal rules, only the largest firms can afford policy advisers.
# Markets and suppliers must share information - producer associations, industrial organisations, and chambers of commerce exchange information among their members and this information exchange must then take place across borders (as seen between Brazil and Argentina after [[Mercosur]]).
# A successful agreement must be flexible and governments need to accept that it will need to evolve.
# Trade agreements must generate relevant reforms in areas such as customs documentation, but also more fundamentally in relaxing rules for cross-border transportation.
# Selling to new markets requires adequate finance.
# Poor or wrong infrastructure can restrict trade
# Governments can support producers or traders in other ways.
The benefits of trade agreements for developing countries are not automatic, especially for  SMEs whether or not they are already exporting as the costs of entering a new market are greater for them than for large companies when compared to their potential revenue.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Sheila Page (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1014&amp;title=happens-after-trade-agreements What happens after trade agreements?] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market access to developing countries===
* Average applied tariffs in agriculture are higher in developing countries (although most of the very high rates, over 100%, are found in developed countries). With an increasing share of agricultural exports directed toward other developing countries, high levels of tariff protection in the South may impede prospects for export-led growth. This may be particularly true for the export opportunities of low-income countries, which have increased export market share in agriculture .
* "Open regionalism" holds the potential to stimulate global trade and improve the efficiency of regional producers. But regional arrangements can also become a vehicle for protection, trade diversion, and unintended inefficiency. Agreements in particular between richer and poorer developing countries risk generating trade losses for the poorer ones when their imports are diverted toward the richer members whose firms are not internationally competitive. However, where regional arrangements lead to the reduction of non-tariff barriers, trade creation is likely, and the dynamic benefits of effective regional integration in terms of improved governance and regional stability are likely to outweigh diversion concerns. The World Bank suggests that key conditions to benefit from expanded trade and investment include lowering common external trade barriers, stimulating competition, reducing transaction costs, and reinforcing nondiscriminatory investment and services policies.  It should be noted that the greater structural differences between North and South economies mean that North-South arrangements hold the greatest promise for economic convergence and trade creation, including in agricultural products, underlining the importance of links between [[South-South cooperation|South-South arrangements]] and northern economies.
* [[Trade liberalization]]. According to the [[World Bank]], “most analyses suggest that unilateral reduction in barriers can produce the greatest and the quickest gains.” [http://www.worldbank.org/prospects/gep2002/]  Some countries, such as Chile, China and Costa Rica, have undertaken domestic policy reforms. Caution must however be employed: as the case of Haiti shows, liberalization when institutions and the economy are not strong enough to face risks and opportunities can be harmful ([[Dani Rodrik|Rodrik]] 2001). And while reforms may be beneficial in the long run, for example by reducing possibilities for customs [[political corruption|corruption]], in the short run they create both winners and losers. Low-income consumers, unskilled workers in sheltered industries, and previously shielded producers may suffer in the transition period as the economy adapts to changed incentive structures. Temporary safety nets can help cushion the blow and ensure trade-led growth is pro-poor.  Specific assistance to meet costs of adaptation – for example of switching to a different crop – may be appropriate.

==Market access is vital, but not enough==
It is important to recognise that the issues facing [[Least developed country|LDCs]] and middle-income [[developing countries]] differ significantly. For the middle-income countries, the primary issue is market access. Many of the world’s poor live in these countries, and so market access alone can have significant poverty-reducing effects in these countries. However, for the least developed countries, the principal problem is not market access, but lack of production capacity to achieve new trading opportunities. This is recognised by paragraph 42 of the [[Doha Round|Doha Development Agenda]]:

{{quote|We recognize that the integration of the LDCs into the multilateral trading system requires meaningful market access, support for the diversification of their production and export base, and trade-related technical assistance and capacity building.}}

So while the further development of middle-income countries, and in particular the tackling of rural poverty in these countries, can be achieved most importantly through increased market access in agriculture, lower-income countries need additional help, not only to take advantage of new opportunities, but to be able to adapt to changing conditions due to the loss of preferences. This additional help must take three main forms: support for developing-country agricultural production; support for participation in trade; and support for good policies and good governance.

===Support for agricultural production===
*Support for agricultural modernization and development – investment in productive capacity in agriculture and food processing.
*Support for agricultural-related development institutions which are not trade-distorting, e.g. research; e.g. risk-management of agricultural product price fluctuations; e.g. diversification.

===Support for participation in trade and the global economy===
Cases such as [[Haiti]]’s post-1986 liberalization  show that the opportunities thereby created will not be taken advantage of if macroeconomic policies, institutions, and the investment climate are not favorable. This includes

*trade-related infrastructure: the cost of exporting must be low enough to ensure competitiveness in rapidly expanding high-value agricultural markets where competition is stiff – such as fruits and vegetables.
*It also includes related issues that are part of the general investment climate but can be particularly important for exports, such as a weak financial sector. Here, export finance “is often a major constraint inhibiting exports in many low-income countries.”
*Other issues are more specific to exports: developing countries and their exporters may have difficulty with both the implementation  of, and showing compliance with, international product standards and other multilateral agreements. Low-income developing countries need both technical and financial assistance in this area.
*Technical Assistance for negotiations is also needed to further developing-country interests in multilateral and bilateral arenas and ensure the success of future negotiations and agreements.
*Marketing of exports is also a challenge for low-income countries: product and country brands need to be built, and quality concerns met.
	
Given the importance of agriculture for poverty reduction, additional policies and institutional capacity are needed to ensure an effective supply response to market incentives provide by better market access. Rural infrastructure is particularly important in enabling agricultural exports in developing countries. Sufficient credit at competitive conditions is important for private sector investment in storage, transportation and marketing of agricultural products. Investment in skills and education in rural areas is needed to bolster agricultural productivity. Trade policy reforms must address any remaining anti-export bias. Efficient land policies and land tenure institutions are needed to ensure the functioning of land markets, property rights, and efficient farm structures.

==World Trade Organization negotiations==
The most recent round of [[World Trade Organization]] negotiations (the [[Doha round|Doha "Development" Round]]) was promoted as being directed at the interests of [[developing countries]], addressing issues of [[developed country]] [[protectionism]]. The introduction of the (investment-related) [[Singapore issues]] together with a lack of sufficient concessions to developing countries' interests has put the success of the negotiations in doubt.

'''Water supply and sanitation in Chile''' is characterized by high levels of access and good service quality. Compared to most other countries, [[Chile]]'s water and sanitation sector distinguishes itself by the fact that almost all urban water companies are privately owned or operated (the only exception is SMAPA). The sector also prides itself of having a modern and effective regulatory framework, including an innovative subsidy to water demand by the poor. One weakness of the sector is the relatively high water losses.

This article is part of a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Water supply and sanitation|series of articles]] comparing the institutional and financial characteristics of [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] around the world.

== Access ==
{{see also|Ranked lists of Chilean regions#By access to drinking water|Ranked lists of Chilean regions#By access to sewage treatment}}
In 2015, in Chile 99% of the population had access to "improved" water, 99.6% and 93%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. In 2015, there were around 180 thousand people who lacked access to "improved" water. Regarding sanitation, in 2015, 99% of the population had access to "improved" sanitation, 100% and 90%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. Around 170 thousand still lacked access to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washwatch.org/en/countries/chile/summary/statistics/|title=WASHwatch.org -      Chile|website=washwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2010 data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) (see below), Chilean urban areas with improved water coverage stood at 96% and coverage of improved sanitation was also 96%, which is one of the highest levels in Latin America.&lt;ref name="JMP1"&gt;{{cite web

One of the reasons of the high coverage rates in Chile is the early effort for extending and improving the infrastructure (see below). As a result, in 1990 97% of the urban population was already connected to water and 84% to sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Service quality ==
[[Water supply#Service quality|Service quality]] is generally good in Chile. It is regularly controlled by the SISS since it was founded in 1990. The agency examines if the services comply with the Chilean norm NCh 409, which was modified for the last time in 2005 and includes standards concerning water quality, water pressure and continuity among others. 
At the beginning of the 1990s, there were problems regarding the [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] systems of some water service providers. Consequently, in 1991 20% of the companies did not comply with the bacteriological norms. In 2006, this share had dropped to about 1%. In the same period, compliance with disinfection norms increased from 89% to more than 99%.&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt;

Water supply is continuous (24/7), both in urban areas and in concentrated rural areas and water pressure is adequate.&lt;ref name="OMS situation"&gt;{{cite web

The sector currently undergoes a major [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] investment program with the goal of treating 100% of all collected municipal wastewater in 2012. This share has increased from 8% in 1989 to 82% in 2006.&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt;

==Water use==
[[File:Ci-map-CIA.png|thumb|right|Map of Chile]]
Water use has gradually decreased since 1998. An estimated 96% of water consumption is measured resulting in precise information concerning water consumption. In 2006, the total water consumption was 958&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;m³. Each customer therefore used on average 19.9&amp;nbsp;m³ per month, resulting in 196&amp;nbsp;liters daily p/capita. Water consumption is highest in the [[Santiago de Chile|capital]] region, ranging from 44m3/month (Aguas Cordillera) to 125m3/month (Aguas de Manquehue).&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt;

== History and recent developments ==
The Chilean water supply and sanitation sector today is characterized by one of the best coverage and quality levels of Latin America. One of the reasons was a gradual and lasting extension of infrastructure which began in the 1970s. In the 1990s, most utilities improved their economic efficiency and became self-financing companies which were partially handed over to the private sector.

=== Before 1977: A fragmented sector structure ===
Before 1977, urban water and sewer services in Chile were provided by a multitude of public entities. The largest entity was the Sanitation Department (Dirección de Obras Sanitarias, DOS) of the Ministry of Public Works, which was in charge of service provision in towns outside of the two largest cities, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] and [[Valparaíso]]. In these two cities municipal utilities were responsible for service provision. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development also had water and sanitation departments. To guarantee its operation, the service was directly subsidized by the national government.!

=== 1977–1988: The National Water Company SENDOS ===
In 1977, the national public water and sanitation company SENDOS (Servicio Nacional de Obras Sanitarias) was created which had 11 regional branches. The municipal utilities in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] and [[Valparaíso]] were corporatized and modernized. During that time employment in the utilities was significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The public utilities for Santiago and Valparaíso, EMOS (Empresa Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias) and ESVAL (Empresa Sanitaria de Valparaiso), were strengthened through loans from the World Bank during that period. In parallel, the government of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] privatized the electricity and telecommunications sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Water coverage during this period increased substantially from 78% in 1976 to 98% in 1988. Sewer coverage increased from 52% in 1976 to 82% in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== 1988–1998: Corporatization and regulation ===
[[Image:Water and sanitation coverage in Chile.png|thumb|right|Coverage rates of urban Chile (1975–2006). Source of data: SISS]]
In 1988, the Chilean people denied General [[Augusto Pinochet]] a new term in a referendum, thus passing a key step in the country's transition to democracy. Unlike the privatization and liberalization in other infrastructure sectors, reform of the water and sanitation sector was thus not imposed by the military government but initiated in a climate of democracy.

Between 1988 and 1990, a number of legal reforms and the creation of new institutions had two principal objectives:
#The service providers should become self-financing through higher tariffs which represent the real costs of the services and more efficient performance
#Water supply and sanitation coverage and quality should become universal
[[Image:275-valparaiso.jpg|thumb|left|Valparaiso]]
Therefore, in December 1988 the General Water and Sanitation Law (Ley General de Servicios Sanitarios) allowed the granting of 13 regional [[concession (contract)|concession]]s to public, private or mixed shareholding companies in each of Chile’s regions. In 1990 the regulatory agency SISS (Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios) was created through a separate law. An innovative model of tariff regulation was borrowed from the Chilean electricity and telecommunications sector: Efficient cost levels were estimated for an imaginary model company and used as a benchmark to set tariffs for the utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The legal framework with some modifications is still in force today.

Initially, the regional companies remained public, but the intent was to prepare them for privatization. During that period they achieved financial self-sufficiency, were granted tariff increases, improved their efficiency and increased coverage.&lt;ref name="OMS antecedentes"&gt;{{cite web

=== 1998-2004: Privatization ===
Under the government of Christian Democrat President [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle|Eduardo Frei]], the law was amended in 1998 to promote private sector participation. The stated motive was to increase efficiency, to improve service quality and to mobilize capital to extend wastewater treatment. Subsequently, all regional branches of SENDOS, as well as the water and sanitation companies of Santiago and Valparaiso, were privatized. Staffing was further reduced, new complaints management procedures were introduced and the share of collected wastewater treated increased significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Contrary to the case of many other Latin American cities where the private sector was asked to provide services, the Chilean service providers were financially self-sufficient when the private sector took responsibility for them. The public companies had been prepared to gradually improve efficiency and profitability since the legal reforms of 1988-1990. This may explain the stable process of private sector participation compared to other Latin American cases.&lt;ref&gt;For example, private water concessions in [[Water supply and sanitation in Argentina#History and recent developments|Buenos Aires, Argentina, many other cities in Argentina]], as well as in [[Water supply and sanitation in Bolivia#The 1990s: Privatization and regulation|La Paz and Cochabamba, Bolivia]], were terminated before their term expired&lt;/ref&gt; A factor that explains the continuity of sector policies during various administrations is the fact that all Presidents since Chile's return to democracy in 1990 belonged to the same [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]].

The privatization was carried out in stages, beginning with the five largest of the 13 regional water companies serving more than 75% of users. Because of the staging, it is possible to compare the performance of the privatized and public utilities at that time. This comparison shows that from 1998 to 2001 private companies invested substantially more than public companies and - unlike the public companies - increased their labor productivity significantly. Tariffs increased for both types of companies, but more so for the privatized ones. However, according to one study, "in Chile a social consensus emerged that has made the higher water rates acceptable given the improvements in service quality and the addition of new services such as wastewater treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The participation of the private sector occurred in two different ways. From 1998 to 2001, when the biggest companies were privatized, the majority of their shares were sold to the private actors. The government then decided to not continue to sell parts of the companies, but to transfer the operation rights of the companies to private actors for 30&amp;nbsp;years between 2001 and 2004. This latter way of private sector participation, also known as [[concession (contract)|concession]], differs substantially from selling shares of the companies because the infrastructure remains property of the Chilean state. All seven companies which were privatized in the second way merged in 2005, assuming the name ESSAN.&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt;

According to the World Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure database, investment commitments by the private sector in Chile's water and sanitation sector reached US$5.7 bn in 1993–2005 through 20 projects, with US$4 bn of commitments made in 1999 alone through 4 projects. 7 projects were divestitures, 10 were concessions and 3 were [[Greenfield investment|greenfield projects]] in wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Socialist Presidents [[Ricardo Lagos]] (2000–2006) and [[Michelle Bachelet]] (since 2006) maintained the basic institutional structure of the sector established under previous governments based on private service provision, means-targeted subsidies and regulation by a public, autonomous regulator.

===Further changes in ownership===
In 2011, the state holding company Corfo sold its stakes in the three largest water companies—Aguas Andinas, Esval and Esbio—on the stock exchange, primarily to individual local and foreign shareholders. The sale of the 30% stake in Aguas Andinas alone brought the state revenues of USD 984 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chilean government sells water utility stock raises 984 million USD|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/06/20/chilean-government-sells-water-utility-stock-raises-984-million-usd|accessdate=26 May 2015|date=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of the stakes in the two other companies brought USD 564 million in revenues. However, the planned sale of shares in a fourth water company, Essal, was suspended because of low prices offered.&lt;ref name=Canadians&gt;{{cite web|title=Auction of Essal shares in Chile suspended|url=http://canadians.org/fr/node/8120|publisher=Council of Canadians|accessdate=26 May 2015|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Antofagasta plc, which had won the concession for the local water supply in [[Antofagasta]] in 2003, sold its shares to the publicly owned Colombian multi-utility [[Empresas Públicas de Medellín]] (EPM)for USD 965 million.

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy and regulation ===
[[Image:Stgo Abril.jpg|thumb|Santiago de Chile]]
Responsibility for sector policy in Chile is vested primarily in the Ministry of Public Works, which grants concessions and promotes rural water supply and sanitation through its Department of Sanitation Programs. The responsibility for regulation is shared between the Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios {{es icon}} [http://www.siss.gob.cl/577/w3-channel.html SISS], the [[economic regulator]] in urban areas, and the Ministry of Health which controls drinking water quality standards in both urban and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== Regulation in urban areas ====
The SISS controls water and sanitation services in urban areas according to financial and quality norms (see above). To guarantee political independence, it is a decentralized organization with its own budget. The SISS has the right to impose fines on the service providers in case of violation of norms, which directly flow in the regulator's budget. Furthermore, it receives user complaints, assesses their validity and acts on them. The agency has databases of all 53 urban service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The water and sanitation regulatory system in Chile is considered by the [[WHO]] to be a model not only for Latin America, but also for Europe.&lt;ref name="OMS fortalezas"&gt;{{cite web

  |doi=
  |accessdate=2008-02-13|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its innovative features is the use of a hypothetical efficient model enterprise to assist in determining if tariff increases requested by service providers are justified.

====Rural areas====
In the Chilean rural areas, the ministry of health and the ministry of economy are responsible for supervising water cooperatives and water committees. In rural areas there is no independent regulator, such as the SISS in urban areas. Since 1994, the Direction for Water Works (DOH) is in charge of executing the national program of Rural Potable Water (APR). Unlike urban service providers, rural water supply and sanitation sector has not been subject of regulation like urban services. Currently, the Government of President Bachelet has submitted before the Chilean Congress a Bill to give this sector a new institutional framework.&lt;ref name="cariola"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Service provision ===
The responsibility for service provision is different in urban and rural areas.

==== Urban areas ====
Water supply and sanitation services in Chile's urban areas is provided by 53 entities. To prevent monopolization, the providers were classified into three categories according to the percentage of the population served by them. No person or society is allowed to possess more than 49% of the companies within one category:&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"

| 6

|-
| Smaller companies

|}

The three largest companies are

* Aguas Andinas, serving the capital [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], majority-owned by the Spanish company [[Aguas de Barcelona]],
* the Empresa de Servicios Sanitarios del Bio-Bío ESSBIO in the [[O'Higgins Region|sixth region]] and [[Bío-Bío Region|eighth region]] around [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], majority-owned by the Latin American Investment Fund Southern Cross, and
* The Empresa Sanitaria de [[Valparaíso]] ESVAL in the [[Valparaíso Region]] owned by various [[institutional investor]]s.

Together, the three companies serve 63% of urban water customers in Chile.&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt;

Until 2011, the Chilean state held 36% of water and sanitation companies through its [[CORFO|Production Development Corporation (CORFO)]]. Today, this share has substantially decreased. As shown in the following table which shows the situation of 2006, the majority of the sector was still owned by Chilean actors.&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt;

The [[Ontario Teachers Pension Plan]] from Canada is a major shareholder of the private water utilities Essbio and Esval.&lt;ref name=Canadians/&gt;

====Rural areas====
In rural areas, local water cooperatives and water committees provide water supply services. In concentrated rural areas (i.e. rural communities with 150 to 3,000 inhabitants with a concentration of not less than 15 houses per km of water network), there was a significant development due to the national program of Rural Potable Water (APR). However, most isolated housings in Chile still lack adequate water connections.&lt;ref name="cariola"/&gt;

==Efficiency==
[[Non-revenue water]] ("water losses") in Chilean water companies was on average 34% in 2006, an unusually high level for a sector that is so modern in so many other aspects. The level of non-revenue water is thus still higher than in Germany, France or the United Kingdom. (see e.g. [[Public water supply and sanitation in Germany#Water losses|water losses in Germany]]). Indeed, non-revenue water in Chile increased from 29% in 1999 to the current 34%.&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt; The regulator considers a level of 15% efficient.

In 2006, on average one employee of the urban water supply and sanitation providers served 418 clients,&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt; resulting in 2.4 employees per 1000 connections, below the Latin American average of 5.

==Financial aspects==
[[Image:Investment in water supply and sanitation Chile.png|thumb|right|Annual investment in the Chilean urban water supply and sanitation sector. Source of data: SISS, Cariola/Alegria (2004)]]
'''Tariff level''' Water tariffs in Chile differ substantially between regions, reflecting differences in the cost of supplying water. Tariffs in urban areas varied between US$0.8 (Aguas Manquehue in Chicureo) per cubic meter and US$4.1 (Aguas Patagonia in [[Coyhaique]]) per cubic meter in 2006.&lt;ref name="SISS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1 Chilean Peso = US$0.001880 (2006-12-31)&lt;/ref&gt; In rural areas, tariffs only cover operation and maintenance costs&lt;ref name="OMS antecedentes"/&gt;

'''Affordability''' On average, the water and sanitation bill accounted for 1.14% of household income according to a 1998 survey by the National Statistical Institute. They varied between 0.77% for the highest (wealthiest) quintile and 2.35% for the lowest (poorest) quintile.&lt;ref name="OMS situation"/&gt;

'''Financing and Subsidies''' Urban water and sanitation systems do not receive direct subsidies and are financed through the capital market, and ultimately through user fees. However, Chile has an innovative system of means-tested subsidies that allows qualifying poor households to receive a subsidy administered by the municipalities to pay parts of their water and sanitation bills. Rural water systems receive a partial investment subsidy that is defined in the Ley del Subsidio al Agua Potable y Saneamiento.&lt;ref name="OMS fortalezas"/&gt; By law, the subsidy can cover 25-85 percent of a household's water and sewer bill up to 15&amp;nbsp;m³ per month. The client pays the rest of the bill. Beyond 15&amp;nbsp;m³, households are charged full price. The subsidy is meant to target only those households that are unable to buy water at a subsistence level and is based on willingness to pay. In 1998, about 13% of households benefited at a level of ~$10 per month. The total cost of the program in 1998 was US $36&amp;nbsp;million. Opponents argue this subsidy program can act as a regressive policy and actually hurt the poor because a false assumption is made that high consumption is positively correlated to high income. On the contrary, poor families do not have access to efficient methods of using water in cooking, cleaning, and washing.

'''Investment''' Since the sector was prepared for self-sufficiency, investment increased significantly from an annual average of about US$ 100m in the period 1965 to 1989 to an annual average of US$ 242m in the period 1990 to 1998, when the first company was privatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Werner Grothmann''' (23 August 1915 – 26 February 2002) was a mid-ranking commander in the [[Waffen-SS]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] from 1940 until Himmler's death in 1945.

==Biography==
Grothmann was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1915. In his youth he studied [[economics]] and carved out a career as an [[accountant]] at a bank.  In 1933 he joined the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) at 18 years old, and was assigned to the ''Junkerschule SS''.  On 20 April 1936, he was commissioned an SS-''[[Untersturmführer]]'' ([[second lieutenant]]) and thereafter promoted to the rank of SS-''[[Obersturmführer]]'' ([[first lieutenant]]) on 11 September 1938. He was made the commander the ''Deutsches SS Standarten'' in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], he had already reached the rank of SS-''[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' (captain) and was given command of ''SS-Sturmbann Nº 13'', a unit of the ''SS Standarte Deutschland''.  He was mobilized with his unit during the conquest of France and was wounded in combat in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcap70.net/A%20History%20of%20the%20SS%20Organisation%201924-1945.html/G/GROTHMANN,%20Werner.html Index SS-Grothmann, Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of [[Joachim Peiper]], Grothmann was appointed second assistant to ''Reichsführer-SS'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] until July 1942, when he was promoted to ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the leader of the SS.  As  Himmler's aide, Grothmann accompanied him on all field visits.  In 1943 he was promoted to SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' (major) and then to SS-''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' (lieutenant colonel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epier.com/product.asp?1723003 Color photograph of Grothmann with Himmler in the field]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last few days of the war in Europe, Himmler, Grothmann and [[Heinz Macher]] traveled from Lübeck to [[Flensburg]], where Himmler offered his services as second-in-command to the new [[Flensburg government|interim government]] led by [[Karl Dönitz]], successor to [[Adolf Hitler]]. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. Himmler was formally dismissed from all his posts.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=733–734}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2007|pp=239, 243}}

Unwanted by his former colleagues and hunted by the Allies, Himmler attempted to go into hiding. Himmler had not made extensive preparations for this, but he had equipped himself with a forged paybook under the name of Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger of the ''[[Geheime Feldpolizei]]'' (Secret Field Police), which was a mistake since members of this organization were sought after by the liberation forces. Grothmann and Macher were both dressed as army privates.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=410}} Grothmann, Himmler, and Macher were stopped at a checkpoint, which had been set up by former Soviet POWs, on 21 May and detained. The three men were taken to an Allied barracks in [[Lüneburg]] on 23 May.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=410}} During a routine interrogation, Himmler admitted who he was, and was then taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army. During an attempted medical examination, Himmler bit into a hidden cyanide pill and died.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=410, 411}}  After Himmler's suicide, Grothmann and Macher were arrested.

Grothmann was taken to a barracks at [[Lübeck]], where he was extensively questioned.  He denied any knowledge of [[Operation Reinhard]].  Then he was taken to an SS prison camp.  Grothmann served as a prosecution witness against several SS officials between 1946 and 1948,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/captured-german-records/microfilm/m1019.pdf ''Records of the United States Nuernberg War Crimes trials Interrogations 1946-1949''] (PDF; 186&amp;nbsp;kB), published 1977&lt;/ref&gt; but during the trial of [[Karl Wolff]] he denied having any knowledge of the [[Final Solution]].  
After release from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] internment, Grothmann was [[denazification|denazified]], considered part of category III (Lesser Offenders), by a court in [[Freising]] in March 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]]: [http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/archiv/zs/zs-0521.pdf ''Werner Grothmann – Zeugenschrifttum''] (PDF; 1,8&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

Grothmann remade his life as a [[businessman]] and granted a few interviews in the 1970s in which he disparaged Himmler's character. Werner Grothmann died in 2002.
