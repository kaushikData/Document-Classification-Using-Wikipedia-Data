'''Twentieth-century art'''—and what it became as [[modern art]]—began with [[modernism]] in the late nineteenth century. Nineteenth-century movements of [[Post-Impressionism]] ([[Les Nabis]]), [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] led to the first twentieth-century art movements of [[Fauvism]] in France and [[Die Brücke]] ("The Bridge") in Germany. Fauvism in Paris introduced heightened non-representational colour into figurative painting. Die Brücke strove for emotional [[Expressionism]]. Another German group was [[Der Blaue Reiter]] ("The Blue Rider"), led by [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] in [[Munich]], who associated the ''blue rider'' image with a spiritual non-figurative mystical art of the future. Kandinsky, [[František Kupka|Kupka]], [[Robert Delaunay|R. Delaunay]] and [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]] were pioneers of [[Abstract art|abstract]] (or non-representational) art. [[Cubism]], generated by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]] and others rejected the plastic norms of the [[Renaissance]] by introducing multiple perspectives into a two-dimensional image. [[Futurism]] incorporated the depiction of movement and machine age imagery. [[Dadaism]], with its most notable exponents, [[Marcel Duchamp]], who rejected conventional art styles altogether by exhibiting [[found object]]s, notably a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal]], and too [[Francis Picabia]], with his ''Portraits Mécaniques''.

Parallel movements in Russia were [[Suprematism]], where [[Kasimir Malevich]] also created non-representational work, notably a black canvas. The [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] group with [[Mikhail Larionov]] was expressionist in nature.

[[Dadaism]] preceded [[Surrealism]], where the theories of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] psychology led to the depiction of the dream and the unconscious in art in work by [[Salvador Dalí]]. [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky's]] introduction of [[Abstract art|non-representational art]] preceded the 1950s American [[Abstract Expressionist]] school, including [[Jackson Pollock]], who dripped paint onto the canvas, and [[Mark Rothko]], who created large areas of flat colour. Detachment from the world of imagery was reversed in the 1960s by the [[Pop Art]] movement, notably [[Andy Warhol]], where brash commercial imagery became a Fine Art staple. Warhol also minimised the role of the artist, often employing assistants to make his work and using mechanical means of production, such as [[Screen-printing|silkscreen printing]]. This marked a change from [[Modernism]] to [[Post-Modernism]]. [[Photorealism]] evolved from Pop Art and as a counter to Abstract Expressionists.

Subsequent initiatives towards the end of the century involved a paring down of the material of art through [[Minimalism]], and a shift toward non-visual components with [[Conceptual art]], where the idea, not necessarily the made object, was seen as the art. The last decade of the century saw a fusion of earlier ideas in work by [[Jeff Koons]], who made large sculptures from [[kitsch]] subjects, and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Young British Artists]], where Conceptual Art, Dada and Pop Art ideas led to [[Damien Hirst]]'s exhibition of a [[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living|shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine]].

'''Aldo Leopold''' (January 11, 1887 – April 21, 1948) was an American author, philosopher, scientist, ecologist, forester, conservationist, and environmentalist. He was a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and is best known for his book ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), which has sold more than two million copies.

Leopold was influential in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for wilderness conservation. His ethics of nature and wildlife preservation had a profound impact on the environmental movement, with his ecocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip F. Cramer, ''Deep Environmental Politics: The Role of Radical Environmentalism in Crafting American Environmental Policy'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized biodiversity and ecology and was a founder of the science of [[wildlife management]].&lt;ref&gt;Errington, pp. 341–350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rand Aldo Leopold was born in [[Burlington, Iowa]], on January 11, 1887. His father, Carl Leopold, was a businessman who made walnut desks and was first cousin to his wife, Clara Starker. Charles Starker, father of Clara and uncle of Carl, was a German immigrant, educated in engineering and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hansen. "[http://www.leopoldheritage.org/index.php/leopold-s-legacy/hansen-column Bringing up Aldo]". Leopold Heritage Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand Aldo was named after two of his father's business partners—C. W. Rand and Aldo Sommers—although he eventually dropped the use of "Rand". The Leopold family included younger siblings Mary Luize, Carl Starker, and Frederic.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold's first language was German,&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; although he mastered English at an early age.

Aldo Leopold's early life was highlighted by the outdoors. Carl would take his children on excursions into the woods and taught his oldest son woodcraft and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Aldo showed an aptitude for observation, spending hours counting and cataloging birds near his home.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Mary would later say of her older brother, "He was very much an outdoorsman, even in his extreme youth. He was always out climbing around the bluffs, or going down to the river, or going across the river into the woods."&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Prospect Hill Elementary, where he ranked at the top of his class, and then, the overcrowded Burlington High School. Every August, the family vacationed in Michigan at the forested [[Les Cheneaux Islands]] in [[Lake Huron]], which the children took to exploring.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schooling==
[[File:Aldo Leopold Sheffield Scientific School Class of 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Leopold's entry in the [[Yale]] [[Sheffield Scientific School]] yearbook, 1908]]

In 1900, [[Gifford Pinchot]], who oversaw the newly implemented Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture, donated money to [[Yale University]] to begin one of the nation's first forestry schools. Hearing of this development, the teenaged Leopold decided on forestry as a vocation.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; His parents agreed to let him attend [[The Lawrenceville School]], a preparatory college in New Jersey, to improve his chances of admission to Yale. The Burlington High School principal wrote in a reference letter to the headmaster at Lawrenceville that Leopold was "as earnest a boy as we have in school... painstaking in his work.... Moral character above reproach."&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived at his new school in January 1904, shortly before he turned 17. He was considered an attentive student, although he was again drawn to the outdoors. Lawrenceville was suitably rural, and Leopold spent much time mapping the area and studying its wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold studied at the Lawrenceville School for a year, during which time he was accepted to Yale. Because the [[Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|Yale School of Forestry]] granted only graduate degrees, he first enrolled in [[Sheffield Scientific School]]'s preparatory forestry courses for his undergraduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; While Leopold was able to explore the woods and fields of Lawrenceville daily, sometimes to the detriment of his studying, at Yale he had little opportunity to do so; his studies and social life engagements made his outdoor trips few and far between.&lt;ref&gt;Meine, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1909, Leopold was assigned to the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]'s District 3 in the Arizona and New Mexico territories. At first, he was a forest assistant at the Apache National Forest in the Arizona Territory. In 1911, he was transferred to the Carson National Forest in northern New Mexico. Leopold's career, which kept him in New Mexico until 1924, included developing the first comprehensive management plan for the [[Grand Canyon]], writing the Forest Service's first game and fish handbook, and proposing [[Gila Wilderness|Gila Wilderness Area]], the first national wilderness area in the Forest Service system.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1"&gt;Meine&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 1923, he was elected an associate member (now called "professional member") of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], a wildlife conservation organization founded by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[George Bird Grinnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boone and Crockett Club Archives|url=http://cdm16013.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/125/rec/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, he accepted transfer to the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin, and became an associate director.

In 1933, he was appointed Professor of Game Management in the Agricultural Economics Department at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], the first such professorship of wildlife management.

[[File:Aldo Leopold's headstone.jpeg|thumb|Leopold's headstone at his family plot in Aspen Grove Cemetery in [[Burlington, Iowa]]]]

He married Estella Bergere in northern New Mexico in 1912 and they had five children together.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold Family. "[https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/aldo-leopold/leopold-family/ Leopold Family]". The Aldo Leopold Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in a modest two-story home close to the UW–Madison campus. His children followed in his footsteps as teachers and naturalists: [[A. Starker Leopold|Aldo Starker Leopold]] (1913–1983) was a wildlife biologist and professor at UC Berkeley;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raitt, RJ|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v101n04/p0868-p0871.pdf |title=In Memoriam: A. Starker Leopold|journal=Auk|year=1984|volume= 101|issue=4|pages= 868–871|doi=10.2307/4086914}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luna Leopold|Luna B. Leopold]] (1915–2006) became a [[hydrology|hydrologist]] and geology professor at UC Berkeley; [[Nina Leopold Bradley]] (1917–2011) was a researcher and naturalist; [[A. Carl Leopold|Aldo Carl Leopold]] (1919–2009) was a plant physiologist,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Staves and [[Randy Wayne (biologist)|Randy Wayne]]. (December 3, 2009.) "[http://www.lansingstar.com/content/view/5628/71/#ixzz0ZaZuYZGo In Memoriam: A. Carl Leopold]". ''The Lansing Star''. Retrieved on February 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; who taught at Purdue University for 25 years; and daughter [[Estella Leopold]] (b. 1927) is  a noted botanist and conservationist who is a professor ''emeritus'' at the University of Washington. Today, Leopold's home is an official landmark of the city of Madison.

He purchased 80 acres in the [[Central Plain (Wisconsin)|sand country]] of central Wisconsin. The once-forested region had been logged, swept by repeated fires, overgrazed by dairy cows, and left barren. There, he put his theories to work in the field and eventually wrote his best-selling ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), finished just prior to his death. Leopold died of a heart attack while battling a wild fire on a neighbor's property.&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
Early on, Leopold was assigned to hunt and kill bears, wolves, and mountain lions in New Mexico. Local ranchers hated these predators because of livestock losses, but Leopold came to respect the animals. He developed an ecological ethic that replaced the earlier wilderness ethic that stressed the need for human dominance. His rethinking the importance of predators in the balance of nature has resulted in the return of bears and mountain lions to New Mexico wilderness areas.&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

By the early 1920s, Leopold had concluded that a particular kind of preservation should be embraced in the national forests of the American West. He was prompted to this by the rampant building of roads to accommodate the "proliferation of the automobile" and the related increasingly heavy recreational demands placed on public lands. He was the first to employ the term "wilderness" to describe such preservation. Over the next two decades, he added ethical and scientific rationales to his defense of the wilderness concept. In one essay, he rhetorically asked, "Of what avail are forty freedoms without a blank spot on the map?" Leopold saw a progress of ethical sensitivity from interpersonal relationships, to relationships to society as a whole, to relationships with the land, leading to a steady diminution of actions based on expediency, conquest, and self-interest. Leopold thus rejected the utilitarianism of conservationists such as [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt;

By the 1930s, Leopold was the nation's foremost expert on wildlife management.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He advocated the scientific management of wildlife habitats by both public and private landholders rather than a reliance on game refuges, hunting laws, and other methods intended to protect specific species of desired game. In his 1933 book ''Game Management'', Leopold defined the science of wildlife management as "the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use." But, as Curt Meine&lt;ref name="GroupedRef1" /&gt; has pointed out, he also considered it to be a technique for restoring and maintaining diversity in the environment.

The concept of "wilderness" also took on a new meaning; Leopold no longer saw it as a hunting or recreational ground, but as an arena for a healthy biotic community, including wolves and mountain lions. In 1935, he helped found the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]], dedicated to expanding and protecting the nation's wilderness areas. He regarded the society as "one of the focal points of a new attitude—an intelligent humility toward Man's place in nature."&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Flader, ''Thinking Like a Mountain: Aldo Leopold and the Evolution of an Ecological Attitude toward Deer, Wolves and Forests''. Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 1974, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Science writer Connie Barlow says Leopold wrote eloquently from a perspective that today would be called [[Religious Naturalism]].

==Nature writing==
Leopold's [[Nature Writing|nature writing]] is notable for its simple directness. His portrayals of various natural environments through which he had moved, or had known for many years, displayed impressive intimacy with what exists and happens in nature. He offered frank criticism of the harm he believed was frequently done to natural systems (such as land) out of a sense of a culture or society's sovereign ownership over the land base – eclipsing any sense of a community of life to which humans belong. He felt the security and prosperity resulting from "mechanization" now gives people the time to reflect on the preciousness of nature and to learn more about what happens there; however, he also wrote, "Theoretically, the mechanization of farming ought to cut the farmer's chains, but whether it really does is debatable."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. ''A Sand County Almanac'' (1970 ed.) p. 262)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Sand County Almanac''===
The book was published in 1949, shortly after Leopold's death. One of the well-known quotes from the book which clarifies his [[land ethic]] is,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the [[biotic community]]. It is wrong when it tends otherwise. (p.262) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of a [[trophic cascade]] is put forth in the chapter, "[[Thinking like a mountain|Thinking Like a Mountain]]", wherein Leopold realizes that killing a predator wolf carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo [http://www.eco-action.org/dt/thinking.html "Thinking Like a Mountain"]&lt;/ref&gt; — a conclusion that found sympathetic appreciation generations later:

{{quote|In January 1995 I helped carry the first grey wolf into Yellowstone, where they had been eradicated by federal predator control policy only six decades earlier. Looking through the crates into her eyes, I reflected on how Aldo Leopold once took part in that policy, then eloquently challenged it. By illuminating for us how wolves play a critical role in the whole of creation, he expressed the ethic and the laws which would reintroduce them nearly a half-century after his death.|[[Bruce Babbitt]], former [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]&lt;ref&gt;Lorbiecki, quote on back cover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===[[Land ethic|Land Ethic]]===
In "The Land Ethic", a chapter in ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'', Leopold delves into conservation in "The Ecological Conscience" section. He wrote: "Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land." He noted that conservation guidelines at the time boiled down to: "obey the law, vote right, join some organizations, and practice what conservation is profitable on your own land; the government will do the rest." (p.&amp;nbsp;243–244)

Leopold explained:

{{quote|The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.

This sounds simple: do we not already sing our love for and obligation to the land of the free and the home of the brave? Yes, but just what and whom do we love? Certainly not the soil, which we are sending helter-skelter down river. Certainly not the waters, which we assume have no function except to turn turbines, float barges, and carry off sewage. Certainly not the plants, of which we exterminate whole communities without batting an eye. Certainly not the animals, of which we have already extirpated many of the largest and most beautiful species. A land ethic of course cannot prevent the alteration, management, and use of these ‘resources,’ but it does affirm their right to continued existence, and, at least in spots, their continued existence in a natural state. In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it.

The Aldo Leopold Foundation of [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]], was founded in 1982 by Aldo and Estella Leopold's five children as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit conservation organization whose mission is "to foster the land ethic through the legacy of Aldo Leopold." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/about/mission-vision/ Mission / Vision]&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldo Leopold Foundation owns and manages the original [[Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm]] and 300 surrounding acres, in addition to several other parcels. Its headquarters is at the green-built Leopold Center, where it conducts educational and land stewardship programs. The foundation also acts as the executor of Leopold's literary estate, encourages scholarship on Leopold, and serves as a clearinghouse for information regarding Leopold, his work, and his ideas. It provides interpretive resources and tours for thousands of visitors annually, distributes a curriculum about how to use Leopold's writing and [[land ethic|ideas]] in environmental education,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/teach-learn/leopold-education-project/ Leopold Education Project]&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a robust website and numerous print resources. In 2012, in collaboration with the [[United States Forest Service]], the foundation released the first high-definition, full-length film about Leopold, entitled ''Green Fire: Aldo Leopold and a Land Ethic for Our Time.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aldoleopold.org/greenfire/index.shtml|title=Green Fire Film |publisher=The Aldo Leopold Foundation|accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film aired on public television stations across the nation and won a Midwest regional Emmy award in the documentary category.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aldoleopold.org/teach-learn/green-fire-film/about-green-fire/ About Green Fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute at University of Montana Missoula 20130725.JPG|thumb|Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute]]
The [[Aldo Leopold Wilderness]] in New Mexico's [[Gila National Forest]] was named after him in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&amp;sec=wildView&amp;wid=4&amp;tab=General&amp;CFID=5163954&amp;CFTOKEN=93201038 Aldo Leopold Wilderness], Wilderness.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture was established in 1987 at [[Iowa State University]] in Ames. It was named in honor of Leopold. Since its founding, it has pioneered new forms of sustainable agriculture practices.

The [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] established the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute at the [[University of Montana|University of Montana, Missoula]] in 1993. It is "the only Federal research group in the United States dedicated to the development and dissemination of knowledge needed to improve management of [[wilderness]], [[park]]s, and similarly [[protected area]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopold.wilderness.net/about-us/default.php |title=About Us |publisher=Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute |accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aldo Leopold Legacy Trail System]], a system of 42 state trails in Wisconsin, was created by the state in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dnr.wi.gov/news/BreakingNews_Print.asp?id=1290 DNR Secretary: Aldo Leopold's legacy alive on renamed trails Find a Wisconsin State Trail].

The '''Arabid race''' (also '''Orientalid race''') is a historical term for a morphological subtype of the [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid race]], as used in traditional [[physical anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Baker Race. — New York and London: Oxford University Press, 1974. — P. 625. {{ISBN|978-0-936396-04-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The Arabid race is thought to have originated within the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and it is currently predominant there as well. It is a major element in the [[Levant]] region of the [[Middle East]], and a minor element in other parts of [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref name=TROE1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI2.htm|title=The Mediterranean race in Arabia|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type is known as ''Araboid'' in forensic pathology and anthropology. In the [[Near East]] region, it is heavily mixed with the [[Armenoid race]]. This Armenoid-Araboid hybrid type is alternatively known as the ''Assyrid''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns, who were ancestral to the Lebanese and Syrians, also generally belonged to this type. Gulf Arabs, also known as [[Arabian]] Arabs or true Arabs, among whom are the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudis]], [[Bahrain]]is, [[Kuwait]]is, southern Iraqis and the [[Bedouin]]s, are more frequently of classic Arabid type. In areas bordering the [[Iranian plateau]], the Arabid type also not seldom merges with the [[Irano-Afghan race]], a local Mediterranean subtype.&lt;ref name=TROE1/&gt;

In parts of [[North Africa]], primarily among the Arabic-speaking Bedouin herders of the deserts and oases of the [[Maghreb]] and [[Egypt]], the Arabid type fuses with another local Mediterranean subtype, the [[Hamitic]], to produce a new hybrid morphological type. The Hamitic type, however, predominates throughout, especially among the [[Berbers]] as well as the [[Copts]] and [[Fellah]]in, since it is the taxon to which belonged most [[Ancient Libyan]]s and [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, respectively.&lt;ref name=TROE2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI9.htm|title=The modern Egyptians|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TROE3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI12.htm|title=The Tuareg|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TROE4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI13.htm|title=Eastern Barbary, Algeria and Tunisia|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar, minor Arabid element is found in parts of the [[Horn of Africa]], having been introduced from the [[Persian Gulf]] region in historic times by the first Islamic proselytizers as well as the adjacent [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarites]] and [[Sabaeans]] of [[Hadhramaut]]. However, here again the Arabid element is secondary to the predominant Hamitic type of the region's first [[Afroasiatic languages|Hamito-Semitic]] speakers, who were ancestral to the [[Somalis]], [[Habesha people|Abyssinians]] and other [[Ethiopid race|Ethiopid]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/chapter-XI8.htm|title=The Mediterranean race in East Africa|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sudan]] area, classic Arabid types can be found among the [[Kababish]] and certain other Arabic-speaking desert tribes collectively known as [[Sudanese Arabs]]. Here, they often occur in solution with the local Hamitic Mediterranean type, which was the morphological taxon to which belonged the [[A-Group Culture|A-Group]], [[C-Group Culture|C-Group]] and [[Meroe|Meroitic]] culture makers, among certain other early populations in the region. Elsewhere, Arabid elements fuse with the [[Negroid]] type of the region's indigenous [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] speakers, the [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]], thereby producing an [[Afro-Arab]] hybrid type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2843546|title=Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.|first=C. G.|last=Seligmann|date=28 October 2017|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=43|pages=593–705|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/2843546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iberian Peninsula]], a rather tall, gracile, progressive, procopomorphic and high-skulled South Mediterranean type related to the Hamitic variety of North Africa is the predominant element. However, instead of Arabid, it is usually mixed here with low-skulled, long-skulled ([[dolichocephalic]]), short-statured Berid and West Mediterranid subtypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/lundman-races4.htm|title=Systematic Appendix: The Races of Europe|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/lundman-races.htm|title=The living races and peoples of Europe|website=Theapricity.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical appearance==
The Arabid race is distinguished from the West-Mediterranean race by some minor characteristic facial traits. The Arabid physical type had in earlier times a broader-formed Syrid subtype, which was found among the farmers of the [[Fertile Crescent]].

'''Arachnoid''' as a descriptive term in botany, refers to organs such as leaves or stems that have a cobwebby exterior appearance, from being covered with fine white hairs, usually tangled. Such material is one common cause of plants having a grey or white appearance.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; The usages of various authors in distinguishing between "arachnoid" and a few other terms referring to [[leaf#Hairiness|hairiness]], such as [[Glossary of botanical terms|floccose]], [[Glossary of botanical terms|pubescent]], [[Glossary of botanical terms|tomentum]], cottony, or [[Glossary of botanical terms|villous]], tend to be arbitrary, but as a rule the term is best reserved for hairiness lighter than a [[felted]] layer, and inclined to rub off or to be easily damaged in other ways. The arachnoid appearance is common on the leaves and stems of various sclerophyllous members of the [[Asteraceae]], such as some [[thistle]]s.

Nonetheless, "cobwebbiness" is a subjective impression, and in the likes of ''Hayworthia arachnoidea'' the arachnoid impression arises from the thicket of [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spinescent leaf denticles]] that are not at all fine, tangled, or fragile. In the cactus ''[[Cephalocereus senilis]]'', the arachnoid effect arises from long-lasting hairy spines.

An '''architectural educator''' is one who [[education|educates]] ("draws out") others about [[architecture]]; the latter being the broad subject of the [[design]] of constructed [[built environment|environment]]s.  [[Architectural Education]] has both [[public architectural education]] and [[professional architectural education]] stakeholder groups. The career of an architectural educator usually develops from a career in architecture or developed interest and practise in architecture and/or education about architecture.

Educating people about architecture as a system of placing things in the world, which was once considered an elite or sacred form of "knowledge".  Architecture was "archaically" defined in Western history, for example, by [[Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] (Rome c. 40 BC) as a culturally "higher order".  Yet in writing ''De Re Architectura Libri Decem'' (''On Architecture, in Ten Books''), Vitruvius also formalised written Western architectural education.  Many other cultures have aural and tactile non-textual architectural education traditions.  Contemporary education about the order and placement of things can equally be regarded as a [[hermeneutic]] (in [[Schleiermacher]]'s sense): as developing citizens' understanding about the ecological significance of arrangements of people and things in particular human environments.

Architectural educators may work in the service of the architectural profession or in the wider community. In the architectural profession, architectural education in many countries is guided or regulated by validation or [[School accreditation|accreditation]]. In the community, architectural educators may work to aid [[citizens]] or members of a [[community]] to become aware of their [[Social environment|environment]], and their role in its [[ownership]] and custodianship.

Architectural Educators are represented by national and regional associations such ACSA in the US, and the EAAE in Europe.

In some cases, architecture itself may become a tool of education, as traditionally practised by architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Le Corbusier]], or as an educational heurism, as in the case of the work of a lesser known figure such as [[Anupama Kundoo]] (see below)

==Biography==
Asimakopulos was born in Montreal in 1930.  He was educated at [[McGill University]] earning a B.A. in 1951 and an M.A. in 1953. In September 1953 Tom went to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]; his research topic was a three-commodity, three-country study in international trade theory entitled ''Productivity Changes, the Trade Balance and the Terms of Trade''.&lt;ref name=TERMS&gt;Asimakopulos, A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2661902 ''A Note on Productivity Changes and the Terms of Trade'']. Oxford Economic Papers, New Series, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Jun., 1957), pp. 225–233.&lt;/ref&gt; With his classmate [[Keith Frearson]], the Australian economist, Tom went to [[Joan Robinson|Joan Robinson's]] lectures on what would become ''The Accumulation of Capital''&lt;ref name=ACCUMCAP&gt;Robinson, Joan. [https://www.questia.com/library/book/the-accumulation-of-capital-by-joan-robinson.jsp ''The Accumulation of Capital'']. London: Macmillan Company, 1965. First published 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; – Robinson's ''magnum opus'', which sought to extend [[Keynesian economics|Keynes's theory]] to account for long-run issues of growth and [[capital accumulation]]. Initially Asimakopulos was irritated by Robinson's criticisms  of the orthodox theories of value and distribution and [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical methodology]] on which he had been brought up. Asimakopulos also went regularly to research students's seminars run by [[Piero Sraffa]], [[Robin Marris]], and [[Nicholas Kaldor]].

Asimakopulos was a Lecturer in Economics and Political Science from 1956 to 1957 at McGill. From 1957 to 1959 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the Royal Military College. In 1959 he returned to McGill and became an assistant professor, working close to [[J.C. Weldon]]. Promoted to the position of associate professor in 1963, he became a full professor in 1966. In 1988 he was appointed ''"William Dow Professor of Political Economy"'' on Weldon's vacancy. He served as Chairman of the Department of Economics from 1974 to 1978. Teaching was his top priority; Asimakopulos loved teaching the microeconomics course to the Honours Students at McGill. Even though he had an assistant, Asimakopulos made sure that, from time to time, he gave tutorials himself, on which he would emphasize, ''ad nauseam'' the importance of the ''assumptions'' of the analysis and its implications on the results of the theoretical model studied.  He wrote extensively on the work of such economic theorists as J. M. Keynes, Joan Robinson, and [[Michał Kalecki]]. He was active in many professional associations and organizations. He held numerous fellowships and was a Visiting Professor and a Fellow at universities in the United States, England and Australia. From 1976 to 1990 he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

Athanasios Asimakopulos died of leukemia in 1990.&lt;ref name=harcourt/&gt;

==Contributions to economic theory==
Asimakopulos was a [[Post Keynesian]] / "[[Michał Kalecki|Kaleckian]]" scholar, who elaborated upon Michał Kalecki's theories.&lt;ref name=KALECIANMODEL&gt;Lavoie, Marc. [http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/6/789 ''The Kaleckian model of growth and distribution and its neo-Ricardian and neo-Marxian critiques'']. Cambridge Journal of Economics 19 (6), 1993, pp. 789–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimakopulos wrote mainly around and on Keynesian themes and on growth, distribution and technical progress (the latter often with Weldon). Over time Kalecki's contributions came to be a major influence and interest; Tom came back to Kalecki, influenced by Joan Robinson. Kalecki stresses on determinants of income distribution, determinants of economic activity, determinants of profits, long-run growth, prospects of economy, or impact of imperfect competition on growth of income has been an important inspiration to many economists we call [[Post Keynesian]]s, including Asimakopulos.&lt;ref name= KALECKI1&gt;Nuti, D. M. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n5_v39/ai_6123769 ''Michal Kalecki – excerpts from a paper entitled Michal Kalecki's Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Socialist Planning'']. Monthly Review, Oct. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=POSTKEYNES2&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/postk.htm The American Post Keynesians] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418155213/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/postk.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of theories that originate from Kalecki is that they are closer to what can be called "normal" theories. Kalecki's papers are acceptably formalized and not as extensively open to various interpretations as Keynes' ''General Theory''.&lt;ref name=KALECKINAMOD2&gt;Lavoie. Marc. [http://rrp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/4/113 ''Traverse, Hysteresis, and Normal Rates of Capacity Utilization in Kaleckian Models of Growth and Distribution'']. Review of Radical Political Economics 28 (4), 1996, 113–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Post Keynesians]] treat production side of the economy in their models, they usually inhabit their models with firms, which operate within neither perfectly competitive environment, nor within perfect monopoly setting. Post Keynesian firms usually set their prices as mark-ups above their prime costs. Profits of those firms usually, along with ''"animal spirits and expectations"'', have pronounced impact on investment decisions and therefore determine profits in the future. This double-sided relationship between profits and investment is clearly in spirit of Asimakopulos (1971)&lt;ref name=DETKEY&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journals/00084239.html Asimakopulos, Athanasios. ''The Determination of Investment in Keynes's Model'', Canadian JE, 1971, vol. 4, issue 3, pp. 382–88.]&lt;/ref&gt; The most succinct definition of post-Keynesian economics comes from Joan Robinson:

::To me, the expression '''''post-Keynesian''''' has a definite meaning; it applies to an economic theory or method of analysis which takes account of the difference between the future and the past. {{small|(emphasis in the original)}} {{small|(1978; CEP, vol. V, 1979b, 210)}}

===Post Keynesianism===
The principal concern of [[Post Keynesians]] is to have a more complex and realistic aggregate [[supply and demand]] framework that includes mark-up pricing, the trend to monopoly, the workings of [[endogenous money]] and credit, circular and cumulative causation, and a pragmatic guide to policy. The workings of uncertainty lead to an unstable capitalistic system that requires the making of agreements and accords to promote stability. At the global level, it requires a fairer distribution of power such that the onus is on nations with trade surpluses to adjust their policies. More than anything, Post Keynesians eschew the quantity theory of money, since money and credit are seen to affect output and employment in both the short and long term. Indeed, like the institutionalists and Marxists, they see the capitalist economy as a monetary system of production, where money and [[creative financing]] are essential aspects of its functioning.&lt;ref name=POSTKEY1&gt;[http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/37-RA-2.pdf O'Hara, Phillip Anthony.

They all moved well and truly outside it, attempting to create either a revolutionary alternative or to rehabilitate the [[Marxist Socialism|classical Marxian tradition]], in most cases in the light of the [[Keynesians|Keynesian revolution]]. The one exception is Michał Kalecki, whose personal history and independent mind combined to place him virtually always outside the mainstream.

Asimakopulos however viewed himself as a [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream]] economist. He even declined an invitation to be included in the first edition of Philip Arestis and Malcolm Sawyer's ''A Biographical Dictionary of Dissenting Economists'',&lt;ref name=DICTDISSENT&gt;Arestis, Philip and Sawyer, Malcolm.

Edward Elgar Publishing, 2000, pp. 7–11. First published 1992. {{ISBN|1-85898-560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he regarded his views and contributions as belonging fully within the tradition of economics proper, not in a dissenting stream (he was included in the second edition).&lt;ref name=POSTKEY&gt;Harcourt, G.

====Asimakopulos' critique of Keynes' ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment''====
In his ''General Theory'', John Maynard Keynes proposed an investment function of the sort &lt;  I = I0 + I(r)  &gt; where the relationship between investment and interest rate was of a rather naive form. Firms were presumed to "rank" various investment projects depending on their ''"[[internal rate of return]]"'' (or ''"marginal efficiency of investment"'') and thereafter, faced with a given rate of interest, chose those projects whose internal rate of return exceeded the rate of interest. With an infinite number of projects available, this amounted to arguing that firms would invest until their marginal efficiency of investment was equal to the rate of interest, i.e. &lt;  MEI = r  &gt;.

Asimakopulos (1971, 1991), Piero Garegnani (1978) and several Post Keynesians offered a troublesome critique to Keynes' original formulation. Asimakopulos et al. questioned the very possibility of a downward-sloping ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI)'' function in the presence of unemployment. In particular, we can note that Keynes's multiplier story implies that if investment is undertaken then, by the multiplier, aggregate demand and output rises. But if the marginal efficiency of investment function is dependent on expected future returns, then should not the increased income and thus aggregate demand from the multiplier imply higher future returns? If so, then the MEI function ought to shift outwards to the right. This, in turn, implies that investment ought to increase  which leads to another increase in aggregate demand and thus the ''MEI'' curve shifts out again, raising investment, etc.&lt;ref name=KEYNESIRR&gt;Asimakopulos et al., [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm ''J. M. Keynes's Internal Rate of Return''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418015246/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}, at HET website.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, it is easy to conceive that, in situations of unemployment where the multiplier works its magic, investment is actually indeterminate&amp;nbsp;– or rather, an ever-shifting ''MEI'' curve could imply that all investment projects will be eventually undertaken and not merely those that are profitable at the given rate of interest since the profitability of projects is itself a function of aggregate demand and thus endogenous to the problem.

==Quotes on Asimakopulos==
::Tom Asimakopulos was a great Kaleckian scholar. His knowledge of the nuances and innuendos of Kalecki's approach to macroeconomics had no equal. {{small|Paul Davidson, Journal of Economic Issues.}}

::This book (''Keynes's General Theory and Accumulation'') is the legacy of a dedicated and tough-minded scholar who did his heroes the compliment of taking their work seriously, rather than just praising it. {{small|Robert W. Dimand, History of Political Economy.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1500">A '''binary constraint''', in [[mathematical optimization]], is a constraint that involves exactly two variables.

For example, consider the [[n-queens problem]], where the goal is to place ''n'' [[Queen (chess)|chess queens]] on an ''n''-by-''n'' chessboard such that none of  the queens can attack each other (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).  The formal set of constraints are therefore "Queen 1 can't attack Queen 2", "Queen 1 can't attack Queen 3", and so on between all pairs of queens.  Each constraint in this problem is binary, in that it only considers the placement of two individual queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Programming with Constraints: An Introduction|first1=Kim|last1=Marriott|first2=Peter J.|last2=Stuckey|publisher=MIT Press|year=1998|isbn=9780262133418|page=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBYAleHTldsC&amp;pg=PA282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linear program]]s in which all constraints are binary can be solved in [[strongly polynomial time]], a result that is not known to be true for more general linear programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Biodegradable waste''' includes any [[organic matter]] in  [[type of waste|waste]] which can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, methane or simple organic molecules by micro-organisms and other living things by [[compost]]ing, [[aerobic digestion]], [[anaerobic digestion]] or similar processes. In waste management, it also includes some inorganic materials which can be decomposed by bacteria. Such materials include [[gypsum]] and its products such as [[plasterboard]] and other simple organic [[sulfate]]s which can decompose to yield [[hydrogen sulphide]] in anaerobic land-fill conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why can't I put my leftover gyproc/drywall in the garbage? |publisher=Recycling Council of British Columbia|url=https://www.rcbc.ca/resources/faqs/hazard9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Fact Sheet: Methane and Hydrogen Sulfide Gases at C&amp;DD Landfills|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency. State of Ohio, U.S.|url= http://epa.ohio.gov/portals/34/document/guidance/gd_669.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In domestic waste collection, the scope of biodegradable waste may be narrowed to include only those degradable wastes capable of being handled in the local waste handling facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|publisher=Christchurch City Council|title=Organics -Green Bin|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Biodegradable waste can be found in [[municipal solid waste]] (sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste, or BMW) as [[green waste]], [[food waste]], [[paper]] waste, and [[biodegradable plastics]]. Other [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] wastes include [[human waste]], [[manure]], [[sewage]], [[sewage sludge]] and [[slaughterhouse waste]]. In the absence of [[oxygen]], much of this waste will decay to [[methane]] by [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cslondon.org/downloads/2010_Waste_Review.pdf CSL London Olympics Waste Review]. cslondon.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of the developed world, biodegradable waste is separated from the rest of the waste stream, either by separate kerb-side collection or by waste sorting after collection. At the point of collection such waste is often referred to as ''green waste''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|title=Organics - Green Bin|publisher= Christchurch City Council|access-date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing such waste from the rest of the waste stream substantially reduces waste volumes for disposal and also allows biodegradable waste to be [[compost]]ed.

==Uses of biodegradable waste==
Biodegradable waste can be used for composting or a resource for heat, electricity and fuel by means of [[incineration]] or [[anaerobic digestion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 NNFCC report on Evaluation of Opportunities for Converting Indigenous UK Wastes to Fuels and Energy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720181907/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-opportunities-for-converting-indigenous-uk-wastes-to-fuels-and-energy-report-nnfcc-09-012 |date=2011-07-20 }}. nnfcc.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss ''Kompogas'' and the Danish ''AIKAN'' process are examples of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kompogas-utzenstorf.ch/pdf/kreislauf.pdf Recycling chain]. kompogas-utzenstorf.ch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aikantechnology.com/ AIKAN website]. aikantechnology.com&lt;/ref&gt; While incineration can recover the most energy, anaerobic digestion plants retain nutrients and make compost for soil amendment and still recover some of the contained energy in the form of [[biogas]]. Kompogas produced 27 million [[Kwh]] of electricity and biogas in 2009. The oldest of the company's lorries has achieved 1,000,000 kilometers driven with biogas from household waste in the last 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zuonline.ch/storys/storys.cfm?vID=1585|title=Gesundheit, Kraft und Energie für 2002|date=3 January 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020902075207/http://www.zuonline.ch/storys/storys.cfm?vID=1585|work=zuonline.ch|archivedate=2 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas relying on organic waste==

Featured in an edition of ''[[The Economist]]'' that predicted events in 2014, it was revealed that [[Massachusetts]] creates roughly 1.4 million tons of organic waste every year&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/2013/11/18/waste-not-want-not&lt;/ref&gt;. Massachusetts, along with [[Connecticut]] and [[Vermont]], are also going to enact laws to divert food waste from landfills.

In small and densely populated states, landfill capacity is limited so disposal costs are higher ($60–90 per ton in MA compared to national average of $49&lt;ref&gt;https://nrra.net/sweep/cost-to-landfill-waste-continues-to-rise-through-2016/&lt;/ref&gt;). Decomposing food waste generates methane, a notorious [[greenhouse gas]]. However, this biogas can be captured and turned into energy through anaerobic digestion, and then sold into the electricity grid.

Anaerobic digestion grew in Europe, but is starting to develop in America. Massachusetts is increasing its production of anaerobic digesters.


==Climate change impacts==

The main environmental threat from biodegradable waste is the production of [[methane]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/compost/index.htm Biodegradable waste]. European Commission

'''Block floating point''' ('''BFP''') is a method used to provide an arithmetic approaching [[floating point]] while using a [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] processor. The algorithm will assign an entire block of data an exponent, rather than single units themselves being assigned an exponent, thus making them a block, rather than a simple floating point. Block floating-point algorithm operations are done through a block using a common exponent, and can be advantageous to limit the space use in the hardware to perform the same functions as floating-point algorithms.&lt;ref name="BDTI_2015"/&gt;

The common exponent is found by data with the largest amplitude in the block. To find the value of the exponent, the number of leading bits must be found. For this to be done, the number of left shifts needed for the data must be normalized to the dynamic range of the processor used. Some processors have means to find this out themselves, such as exponent detection and normalization instructions.&lt;ref name="Chhabra_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elam_2003"/&gt;

Block floating-point algorithms were extensively studied by [[James Hardy Wilkinson]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson_1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Overton_2001"/&gt;

A similar arithmetic can be used on top of a floating-point format having a limited range.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48933">'''Canadian health claims''' by [[Health Canada]], the department of the [[Government of Canada]] responsible for national health, has allowed five scientifically verified disease risk reduction claims to be used on [[food label]]s and on food [[advertising]]. Other countries, including the United States and Great Britain, have approved similar [[health claims on food labels]].

==Regulations==
The Food Directorate of Health Canada is responsible for the development of policies, regulations and standards that relate to the use of health claims on foods. They assess whether health claims are truthful and not misleading by reviewing mandatory and voluntary pre-market submissions. Health Claims are regulated under the  [[Food and Drugs Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/f-27///en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063312/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/f-27///en |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-05 |title=Food and Drugs Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date=2002-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Food and Drug Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cr/C.R.C.-c.870 |title=Food and Drug Regulations |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date=2002-12-20 |accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Section 5(1) of the Food and Drugs Act requires that all health claims be truthful and not misleading or deceptive. The regulatory requirements permitting the use of claims vary significantly depending on the nature and type of the claim. Some claims may be made without pre-market approval provided they are truthful and not misleading or deceptive, whereas other claims, such as disease risk reduction or therapeutic claims are only allowed once a regulatory amendment specifying the conditions for their use has been completed &lt;ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"&gt;Health Canada (2009). "Food and Nutrition: Questions and Answers on Health Claims" URL: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/qa-qr_claims-allegations-eng.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827124329/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/qa-qr_claims-allegations-eng.php# |date=2010-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are responsible for the accuracy of all information on the labels and advertisements for food and for compliance with all relevant food legislation and policies, including those pertaining to health claims. The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] is responsible for ensuring that industry complies with these requirements &lt;ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"/&gt;

==There are several types of claims that can be made on food products==
'''Food claims''' express the composition, quality, quantity or origin of a food product.&lt;ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"/&gt; Examples of Food Claims are "made in Canada" "Home-style Chilli" and "Fresh Pasta."

''' Nutrition (nutrient content) claims''' characterizes the energy value of the food or the amount of a [[nutrient]] contained in a food. It provides a quick and easy way to identify foods with specific nutritional features of interest.&lt;ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"/&gt; Examples of nutrition claims are "low in sodium" sodium free" and "100 Calories per serving."

'''Health claims''' is any representation in labeling or advertising that states, suggests, or implies that a relationship exists between consumption of a food or an ingredient in the food and a person's health.&lt;ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"/&gt;

There are two categories of health claims: General Health Claims and Specific Health Claims.

'''General health Claims:''' These claims are broad general claims that promote health through healthy eating or that provide dietary guidance. These claims do not refer to a specific or general health effect, [[disease]], or health condition.&lt;ref name="hc-sc.gc.ca"/&gt;

Example: The claim "Include low fat product "x" as part of healthy eating"  "healthy for you" or "healthy choice"

==Specific health claims==
'''Disease risk reduction and therapeutic claims:'''

Since 2003, [[Health Canada]] has allowed certain disease risk reduction claims to be used on food labels or in advertisements. These claims are used to describe the link between the characteristics of a diet, a food or food constituent and the risk reduction of a disease or the therapeutic effect of a food or food constituent or diet, (including restoring, correcting, or modifying body functions). Example: The claim "(naming the diet characteristics, food or food constituent) reduces the risk of heart disease" or "lowers blood cholesterol" can be used when the food carrying the claim meets conditions for use set out in the food regulations.&lt;ref name="hc-sc1"&gt;# ^ Health Canada (2009). "Food and Nutrition: Questions and Answers on Health Claims" URL: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/qa-qr_claims-allegations-eng.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827124329/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/qa-qr_claims-allegations-eng.php# |date=2010-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Function claims:'''

These claims are used to describe the specific physiological effects of foods and food constituents associated with health or performance. Example: The claim "(naming the food or food constituent) promotes regularity or laxation" can be used for coarse wheat bran providing a minimum of 7&amp;nbsp;grams of dietary fibre in a reasonable daily intake of the food.

Nutrient function claims (formerly known as biological role claims), are a type of function claim that describe the well-established functions of nutrients or energy necessary for the maintenance of good health, normal growth and development
Example: The claim "Calcium aids in the formation and maintenance of bones and teeth" may be used for foods providing a minimum of 5% of the [[Recommended daily intake|Recommended Daily Intake]] of the nutrient per serving of stated size and reference amount of the food.&lt;ref name="hc-sc1"/&gt;

== Health claim #1 ==

===''"A healthy diet low in sodium and high in potassium can reduce the risk of high blood pressure''"===

===Measurements of dietary sodium===
[[Dietary sodium]] can be measured in two ways. Total dietary sodium measures the amount (in grams or milligrams) of sodium in the food. Sodium ratio refers to the amount of sodium per amount of food eaten, usually in grams per [[kilocalorie]], or milligrams per kilocalorie.

Dietary [[potassium]] can be measured as the total amount of potassium in the diet (usually in milligrams). It can also be measured in relation to sodium intake as the potassium-sodium ratio, in mg K/mg Na, or mg K/g Na. Only this last measurement shows the effect of dietary potassium as part of the equation; the rest measure only sodium intake, which is less important overall than the combined effects of potassium and sodium.

===DASH diet===
[[Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]] (DASH) is a dietary intervention designed to reduce blood pressure in patients with [[hypertension]]. It emphasizes fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, poultry, nuts and fish, and limits red meats, sweets and sweetened drinks. It has been found to reduce hypertension in patients even without weight loss or reduction of sodium intake. However, it is usually used in combination with a sodium-controlled diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/archinte.159.3.285 | last1 = Svetkey | first1 = LP | last2 = Simons-Morton | first2 = D | last3 = Vollmer | first3 = WM | last4 = Appel | first4 = LJ | pmid = 9989541 | last5 = Conlin | first5 = PR | last6 = Ryan | first6 = DH | last7 = Ard | first7 = J | last8 = Kennedy | first8 = BM. | year = 1999 | title = Effects of Dietary Patterns on Blood Pressure: Subgroup Analysis of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Randomized Clinical Trial | url = | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 159 | issue = 3| pages = 285–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research supporting the claim===
Most research has shown that reducing sodium intake reduces the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]](CVD) and all-cause [[mortality rate]].

A study by Langford in 1983&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Langford | first1 = HG. | year = 1983 | title = Dietary Potassium and Hypertension: Epidemiologic Data | url = | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 770–772 |pmid=6847016 | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-98-5-770}}&lt;/ref&gt; observed that populations that consume less sodium also tend to have relatively high potassium intake, and a lower rate of CVD. Within the USA, he also noticed racial and class differences in CVD, which he suggests may be due to sodium being cheaper to acquire in the diet than potassium, since many products contain added salt. Reddy and Katan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reddy | first1 = K Srinath | last2 = Katan | first2 = Martijn B | title = Diet, nutrition and the prevention of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 7 | issue = 1A | pages = 167–186 | year = 2007 | pmid = 14972059 | doi = 10.1079/PHN2003587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recommend a salt intake below 5 g/day (5000&amp;nbsp;mg/day), and to increase potassium intake by 2 - 3 g/day. The study emphasizes that this should be done through dietary changes, rather than by taking a [[dietary supplement]] containing potassium.

He ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.282.21.2027 | last1 = He | first1 = J | last2 = Ogden | first2 = LG | last3 = Vupputuri | first3 = S | last4 = Bazzano | first4 = LA | last5 = Loria | first5 = C | last6 = Whelton | first6 = PK | year = 1999 | title = Dietary Sodium Intake and Subsequent Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Overweight Adults | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 282 | issue = 21| pages = 2027–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observed in 1999 that increased salt consumption had a direct relationship to increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality in [[overweight]] people.

Cook ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39147.604896.55 | last1 = Cook | first1 = N | last2 = Cutler | year = 2007 | first2 = JA | last3 = Obarzanek | first3 = E | last4 = Buring | first4 = JE | last5 = Rexrode | first5 = KM | last6 = Kumanyika | first6 = SK | last7 = Appel | first7 = LJ | last8 = Whelton | first8 = PK| title = Long term effects of dietary sodium reduction on cardiovascular disease outcomes: observational follow-up of the trials of hypertension prevention (TOHP) | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 334 | issue = 7599| pages = 885–8 | pmid = 17449506 | pmc = 1857760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observed patients 10–15 years after they had received treatments for [[prehypertension]]. They found that reducing sodium intake by 1.2 g/day reduced the number of people needing anti-hypertension treatment by 50%. Subjects who had no hypertension when they began the study 10 – 15 years earlier were also 50% less likely to require treatment for hypertension.

Their results suggest that increased sodium intake can cause CVD independently of hypertension - that is, even if the patient continues to have normal blood pressure. High sodium intake is associated with increased vascular reactivity and growth, and myocardial fibrosis, which is associated with [[myocardial disarray]]. They also noticed a direct relationship between sodium intake and [[ventricular hypertrophy]], an increase in the mass of the left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] of the heart. In lay terms, this means an enlargement of the heart chamber that pumps blood to body tissues, including the [[cardiac muscle]] itself. In order to reduce blood pressure, and prevent hypertension and CVD, Cook ''et al.'' recommend reducing sodium intake by 25 - 30% from current levels.

Increasing dietary potassium intake has been shown to have a significant effect on blood pressure in populations with high sodium intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Khaw | first1 = KT | last2 = Barrett-Connor | first2 = E | year = 1984 | title = Dietary potassium and blood pressure in a population | url = | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 39 | issue = 6| pages = 963–8 | pmid = 6720624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not apparent from the study performed by Khaw ''et al.'' whether there is a difference for populations consuming low amounts of sodium; however, this is not particularly relevant in Canada, where people are more likely to consume excess sodium.

===Dietary sources of sodium===
In 2007, Joffres ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Joffres | first1 = MR | last2 = Campbell | first2 = NRC | last3 = Manns | first3 = B | last4 = Tu | first4 = K | year = 2007 | title = Estimate of the benefits of a population-based reduction in dietary sodium additives on hypertension and its related health care costs in Canada | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Cardiology | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 437–443 |pmid = 17487286 | pmc = 2650661 | doi = 10.1016/S0828-282X(07)70780-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that in the typical Canadian diet, 11% of sodium occurs naturally, 12% is added during cooking and at the table, and 77% is added by industry during processing. Their study was to determine whether regulations to limit the amount of salt added by food manufacturers could reduce the prevalence of hypertension by 30%, which would substantially reduce [[Canadian health care]] costs.

===Research not supporting the claim===
Some Studies do not recommend that the general healthy population should reduce their sodium intake because they feel that there is no conclusive evidence that this will guarantee a lower incidence of hypertension. A major study with this recommendation is the [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)09092-2 | last1 = Alderman | first1 = MH | last2 = Cohen | first2 = H | last3 = Madhavan | first3 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Dietary sodium intake and mortality: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 351 | issue = 9105| pages = 781–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (NHANES I). They did observe that people with a lower-sodium diet had a lower all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) -related mortality rate. However, because they could not be certain that reducing sodium intake could reduce hypertension and CVD, and it was not just one factor in the [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] of people who naturally ate a lower-sodium diet, they did not feel a need to recommend that the general population should reduce sodium intake.

The Developers of the DASH diet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200101043440101 |vauthors=Sacks FM, Svetkey LP, Vollmer WM, Appel LJ, Bray GA, Harsha D, Obarzanek E, Conlin PR, Miller ER 3rd, Simons-Morton DG, Karanja N, Lin PH, ((DASH-Sodium Collaborative Research Group)) | pmid = 11136953 | year = 2001 | title = Effects on Blood Pressure of Reduced Dietary Sodium and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 344 | issue = 1| pages = 3–10 | display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; do not recommend reducing dietary sodium, because they found that the overall DASH diet is effective even without reducing sodium intake. That is, an overall healthy diet is more important than only reducing sodium intake, even in regulating hypertension. A 1996 study by Midgley ''et al.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.275.20.1590 | last1 = Midgley | first1 = JP | last2 = Matthew | first2 = AG | pmid = 8622251 | last3 = Greenwood | first3 = CMT | last4 = Logan | first4 = AG | year = 1996 | title = Effect of Reduced Dietary Sodium on Blood Pressure | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 275 | issue = 20| pages = 1590–1597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recommends a reduction in sodium intake for older patients with hypertension, but does not support recommendations for the general population to reduce their sodium intake.

As mentioned above, sodium intake can have cardiovascular effects without hypertension. It is therefore prudent to reduce sodium intake even if blood pressure is normal. It is important to consume an overall healthy diet that essentially follows the [[Canada Food Guide]]. Reducing sodium intake to recommended levels can reduce the risk of future hypertension and cardiovascular problems, and reduction of sodium intake carries no inherent risk. Because most of the sodium we consume is added during processing, preparing healthy meals at home and adding salt during cooking, rather than purchasing ready meals and snacks, is an easy way to reduce sodium intake without compromising the flavour and texture that salt provides in food.

===Summary===
Most studies to date have shown that reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake, to levels recommended in Canadian nutritional guidelines such as RDA, can reduce the risk of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Most dietary sodium in Canada is added by food manufacturers during processing, and regulations controlling the amount of salt that can be added by food manufacturers may help reduce the prevalence of these illnesses in Canada.

== Health claim #2 ==

=== ''"A healthy diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D may reduce the risk of osteoporosis"'' ===
In order to make the health claim "A healthy diet adequate in [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]], and regular physical activity, help to achieve strong [[bone]]s and may reduce the risk of [[osteoporosis]], the food must be:

*high or very high in calcium,
*may also be very high in Vitamin D,
*cannot have more Phosphorus than Calcium,
*must be limited in Alcohol, and 
* must have more than 40 kcal (unless it is a fruit or vegetable.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada,(2009). Nutrition Labelling...Get the Facts! website: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/nutrition/educat/te_background-le_point-08-table2-eng.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712064629/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/nutrition/educat/te_background-le_point-08-table2-eng.php# |date=2009-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition and bone health===
The two main calcium centers in the body are found in bones and blood. Homeostatic controls of the body ensure that the blood maintains a constant proportion of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;. If there is a decrease in serum calcium levels, the body responds by secreting [[Parathormone]] (PTH) from the [[parathyroid gland]] into the blood which;

1)Increases re-absorption of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; from the [[kidneys]] and [[gastrointestinal tract]](GI)

2)Releases calcium from bones into the blood

[[Vitamin D]] also plays a crucial role in maintaining serum calcium levels (Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; in the blood). Vitamin D stimulates absorption of calcium from the GI tract through its interaction with receptors in the [[enterocyte]].&lt;ref name="Gropper, S. Smith 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gropper |first1=  S. |last2=Smith |first2= Jack |last3=Groff |first3= James |year=2009 |title= Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism |edition=5th |publisher=Cengage Learning | isbn=978-0-495-11657-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin D also increases transcription of genes that code for [[Calbindin]].&lt;ref name="Gropper, S. Smith 2009"/&gt; As the name implies, Calbindin functions as a calcium-binding protein thereby enhancing calcium absorption.&lt;ref name="Gropper, S. Smith 2009"/&gt; As a result of the body scavenging for calcium from bones; the bones may become fragile, brittle and weak, which in prolonged states can lead to osteoporosis and or bone fractures.

Conversely, if there is an adequate level of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; in the blood, PTH will be inhibited. Similarly, in the case where there is an excess of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; in the blood, it will be stored in bones as this is the nutritional reserve for Calcium and Phosphorus &lt;ref name="jacn.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Heaney |first= Robert |year=2000 | url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/content/full/19/suppl_2/83S#T1 |title= Calcium, Dairy Products and Osteoporosis | journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition |volume= 19 |issue=2 |pages =83S–99S | pmid=10759135 | doi=10.1080/07315724.2000.10718088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone depends upon dietary intake to supply the bulk materials needed for synthesis of the extracellular material, which composes more than 95% of bone. These bulk materials are mainly calcium, phosphorus and protein. Roughly half the volume of the extracellular material of bone consists of protein and the other half of calcium phosphate crystals. It is self-evident that a growing organism cannot amass this structural material if the bulk components of bone are not present in adequate amounts in the diet. It is for this reason that bone growth is stunted during general [[malnutrition]] and specific bone abnormalities develop with deficiencies in [[protein]], [[ascorbic acid]], [[vitamin D]], [[magnesium]], [[zinc]], [[copper]] and [[manganese]] to name only a few &lt;ref name="jacn.org" /&gt;

===Research supporting the claim===
There is a significant body of evidence which establishes that high calcium intakes augment bone gain during growth, retards age-related bone loss, and reduces osteoporotic fracture risk.&lt;ref name="jacn.org"/&gt; A meta-analysis study in 2007 assessed whether calcium supplementation can reduce osteoporotic fractures. The meta-analysis included all the randomized trials in which calcium, or calcium in combination with vitamin D, was used to prevent fracture and osteoporotic bone loss.&lt;ref name="The Lancet 2007, Pages 657-666"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61342-7 | last1 = Tang | first1 = B | last2 = Eslick | first2 = G | last3 = Nowson | first3 = C | last4 = Smith | first4 = C | last5 = Bensoussan | first5 = A | title = Use of calcium or calcium in combination with vitamin D supplementation to prevent fractures and bone loss in people aged 50 years and older: a meta-analysis | journal = The Lancet | volume =370 | issue =9588 | date= 25 August 2007| pages =657–666 | pmid=17720017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 63 897 individuals were analysed, most of whom were women (n=58 785 [92%]) with a mean age of 67.8 years (SD 9.7). In trials that reported fracture as an outcome (17 trials, n=52 625), treatment was associated with a 12% risk reduction in fractures of all types. In trials that reported bone-mineral density as an outcome (23 trials, n=41 419), the treatment was associated with a reduced rate of bone loss of 0.54% (0.35–0.73; p&lt;0.0001) at the hip and 1.19% (0.76–1.61%; p&lt;0.0001) in the spine. The fracture risk reduction was significantly greater (24%) in trials in which the compliance rate was high (p&lt;0.0001). The treatment effect was better with calcium doses of 1200&amp;nbsp;mg or more than with doses less than 1200&amp;nbsp;mg (0.80 vs 0.94; p=0.006), and with vitamin D doses of 800 IU or more than with doses less than 800 IU (0·84 vs 0·87; p=0·03).&lt;ref name="The Lancet 2007, Pages 657-666"/&gt;

Evidence supports the use of calcium, or calcium in combination with vitamin D supplementation, in the preventive treatment of osteoporosis in people aged 50 years or older. For best therapeutic effect, minimum doses of 1200&amp;nbsp;mg of calcium, and 800 IU of vitamin D (for combined calcium plus vitamin D supplementation is recommended.&lt;ref name="The Lancet 2007, Pages 657-666"/&gt;

===Dietary recommendations===
Current recommendations for Calcium are:
*1,000&amp;nbsp;mg per day for people aged 19–50 years
*1,200&amp;nbsp;mg per day for people over the age of 51 years.

The Upper Tolerable intake is 2.5 g/day &lt;ref&gt;Health Canada (2009). Drugs and Health Products: Calcium.

== Health claim #3 ==

=== ''"A healthy diet low in saturated and trans fat reduces the risk of heart disease"'' ===
The Canadian health claim "A healthy diet low in saturated and trans fat and reduced risk of heart disease" is commonly accepted and correlated.  [[Saturated fatty acids]] do not contain any carbon-to-carbon double bonds in the fatty acid chain.  [[Trans fatty acids]] contain carbon-to-carbon double bonds in the trans confirmation.

During the past several decades, reduction of fat intake has been one of the main focuses from a dietary perspective. During these decades, fats have been progressively gaining a greater correlation with health complications especially heart disease.  Subsequently, the food industry had been taking notice of this, more labels like "fat-free" or "low-fat" appeared on food packaging.

=== Research supporting the claim ===
80,082 women who were between 34 and 59 years of age having no known [[stroke]], [[cancer]], [[coronary heart disease]], hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes in 1980 were studied regarding dietary fat intake and its correlation with [[coronary heart disease]].  They found that with each 5% increase of energy intake from saturated fat with the same energy intake from [[carbohydrates]] was associated with a 17% increase in the risk of [[coronary heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199711203372102 | last1 = Hu | first1 = F.

A related study found that the types of fat consumed is much more important than the amount of fat which is consumed with regards to [[coronary heart disease]].  Controlled clinical trials have proved that replacing [[saturated fat]] with [[polyunsaturated fat]] was much more effective in lowering serum [[cholesterol]] and reducing risk of [[Coronary heart disease|CHD]] compared to reducing total fat consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hu | first1 = F. B. | last2 = Manson | first2 = J. E. | last3 = Willett | first3 = W. C. | year = 2001 | title = Types of dietary fat and risk of coronary heart disease: A critical review | url = | journal = Journal of American College of Nutrition | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 5–19 | pmid=11293467 | doi=10.1080/07315724.2001.10719008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared to [[saturated fatty acids]], [[trans-fatty acids]] have a much greater ability to turn [[High-density lipoprotein]] (HDL) into [[Low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL).  HDL commonly referred to as a "good cholesterol" due to its ability to remove cholesterol from clogs in arteries.  LDL subsequently is known as a "bad cholesterol"  since high levels of it is usually an indication of [[heart disease]].  The loss of HDL and creation of LDL is highly likely to lead to CHD complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.20.2569 | last1 = Hu | first1 = F.

=== Beneficial fatty acids ===
Despite the fact that trans-fatty acids are not saturated, does not correlate to all unsaturated fats lead to CHD.  Omega-3 fatty acids are [[polyunsaturated]] cis-fatty acids which are an essential fatty acid which the body cannot produce.  They are found to prevent and manage [[cardiovascular disease]] in clinical interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Simopoulous | first1 = Artemes P. | year = 1999 | title = Essential fatty acids in health and chronic disease | url = | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 3 Suppl| pages = 560–569 |pmid=10479232| doi = 10.1093/ajcn/70.3.560s }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They do not change serum lipid concentrations but reduce blood clotting in vessel walls.

=== ''Canada's Food Guide'' recommendations ===
''Canada's Food Guide'' recommends 30–45&amp;nbsp;mL consumption of unsaturated fat each day to get the fat you require for the day. This amount includes oil used for cooking, salad dressings, margarine and mayonnaise.

Examples of unsaturated vegetable oils they included were:
* canola
* corn
* flaxseed
* olive
* peanut
* soybean
* sunflower

''Canada's Food Guide'' also recommends limiting the consumption of food and beverages high in saturated and trans fat.

== Health claim #4 ==

=== ''"A healthy diet rich in vegetables and fruits may reduce the risk of some types of cancer"'' ===
Scientific literature shows that consuming a "variety" of fruits and vegetables is linked with reduction of some cancers. There is insufficient evidence to support any one fruit/vegetable or food constituent with a reduction of [[cancer]] occurrence. Fruits and vegetables have a wide range of nutrients and phytochemicals, thus to achieve optimal nutrient levels a variety is recommended. ''Some'' types of cancer signifies that not all types of cancers are diet related and thus not all types of cancer can be reduced by a dietary change. The statement "may help" eliminates consumer confusion that diet is the only factors in reducing risk of some types of cancers. The wording of this disease reduction health claim cannot be modified in any way. However, words, numbers or signs can be added before or after the claim, provided that they do not change the nature of the claim.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada. (2006).

=== Regulations ===
This claim is only allowed on certain fruits and vegetables listed below:

* Fresh, frozen, canned or dried vegetable
* Fresh, frozen, canned or dried fruit
* Vegetable or fruit juice
* Combination of the foods listed above

This claim is not allowed on some fruits and vegetables:

* Potatoes, yams, cassava, plantain, corn, mushrooms, mature legumes and their juices*
* Vegetable or fruit used as condiments, garnishes or flavourings- including maraschino cherries, glace fruit, candied fruit and onion flakes
* Jams or jam type spreads, marmalades, preserves and jellies
* Olives
* Powdered vegetable or fruit

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Mature seeds of legumes such as kidney beans are excluded from this claim, however young and immature pods of legumes such as edible podded peas. Additionally, the food cannot contain 0.5% alcohol or less.The claim is not extended to those foods because there is insufficient scientific evidence about any beneficial properties.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

=== Benefits of fruits and vegetables ===
Fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer due to:

1)Beneficial properties of the micronutrients in fruits and vegetables such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants
2)Consumption of fruits and vegetables may decrease the consumption of other less healthy alternatives

=== Current Canadian intakes of fruits and vegetables ===
According to [[Statistics Canada]] during 2008 Canadians ate an average of 79.5&amp;nbsp;kg vegetables per person, about 4&amp;nbsp;kg lower than in 2005 when Canadians consumed 83.5&amp;nbsp;kg per person. Potatoes were the most consumed vegetable with 44%, followed by carrots, lettuce onions and tomatoes which marked a cumulative 29% of all vegetables consumed. During 2008 fruit consumption in Canada increased to a record high 47.5&amp;nbsp;kg per person. Fresh fruit consumption remains the same as in previous years; however, processed fruit consumption increased by 7%. Berries such as strawberries, cranberries, blackberries and blueberries have had a substantial consumption increase to 5&amp;nbsp;kg by Canadians in 2008. Oranges also remain a major part of fruit consumption at 4.9&amp;nbsp;kg per person.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada. (2008). Analysis: food available for consumption in Canada- 2008.

=== ''Canada's Food Guide'' recommendations ===
The recommended number of daily servings in healthy adults aged 19–50 is 7-8 servings for women and 8-10 servings for men. Consumption of a "variety" of fruits and vegetables is emphasized as well as consumption of whole foods rather than their juices. Also recommended is to have at least one dark green and one orange vegetable per day. Moreover, the [[Canada Food Guide]] suggests that Canadians should consume fruits and vegetables with little or no added salt, sugar or fat.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada. (2007).

=== Research supporting the claim ===
Scientific studies have found a relationship between some cancers and fruit and vegetable intake and are the basis for making it one of Canada's five Health Claims. Some studies have looked at overall intake of fruits and vegetables and its relationship with certain types of cancer. Other studies have looked at specific nutrients found in certain fruits and vegetables, such as Vitamins, Minerals and antioxidants and their relationship with cancer. A review conducted by the [[World Cancer Research Fund]] and the [[American Institute for Cancer Research]] has concluded that there is a considerable amount of convincing evidence to support the claim suggesting a protective effect of fruits and vegetables against some cancers.&lt;ref&gt;WCRF/AICR. (1997). Food, nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

A diet rich in fruits and vegetables are found to have a protective effect and reduce the occurrence of [[breast cancer]]. An analysis of 12-case control studies has been conducted in Oxford and found that fruits and vegetables have a consistent protective effect against breast cancer. In particular scholars found that [[Vitamin C]] intake had the most statistically significant inverse association with breast cancer. The study concludes that if this relationship represents causality then it is estimated that breast cancer might be prevented in 24% of postmenopausal women and 16% of pre-menopausal women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/jnci/82.7.561 | last1 = Howe | first1 = G.

There is an established relationship between cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and esophagus) and fruit and vegetable consumption. An EPIC ([[European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition]]) study was conducted during 1992-1998 in which 345,904 people were studied using a dietary questionnaire. During 1998 data was collected and an inverse association was found between fruit and vegetable intake and upper aero-digestive tract cancer occurrence.  The large study recommends an increase of fruit and vegetable consumption in order to reduce the risk of cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boeing | pmid = 16841263 | first1 = H | year = 2006 | last2 = Dietrich | first2 = T | last3 = Hoffmann | first3 = K | last4 = Pischon | first4 = T | last5 = Ferrari | first5 = P | last6 = Lahmann | first6 = PH | last7 = Boutron-Ruault | first7 = MC | last8 = Clavel-Chapelon | first8 = F | last9 = Allen | first9 = N | last10 = Key | first10 = Tim | last11 = Skeie | first11 = Guri | last12 = Lund | first12 = Eiliv | last13 = Olsen | first13 = Anja | last14 = Tjonneland | first14 = Anne | last15 = Overvad | first15 = Kim | last16 = Jensen | first16 = Majken K. | last17 = Rohrmann | first17 = Sabine | last18 = Linseisen | first18 = Jakob | last19 = Trichopoulou | first19 = Antonia | last20 = Bamia | first20 = Christina | last21 = Psaltopoulou | first21 = Theodora | last22 = Weinehall | first22 = Lars | last23 = Johansson | first23 = Ingegerd | last24 = Sánchez | first24 = Maria-José | last25 = Jakszyn | first25 = Paula | last26 = Ardanaz | first26 = Eva | last27 = Amiano | first27 = Pilar | last28 = Chirlaque | first28 = Maria Dolores | last29 = Quirós | first29 = J.

Some fruits and vegetables contain [[antioxidants]] which are also linked with cancer reduction risks. Micronutrient antioxidants (Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, B-carotene, lycopene) neutralize [[free radicals]] in the body and thus prevent cell damage and oxidative damage to DNA. The Journal of Internal medicine published a paper in 2007 which reviews 41 studies conducted concerning [[Vitamin C]] and [[Vitamin E]] and their role in cancer prevention and treatment. Thirty eight studies did show statistically insufficient beneficial effects of Vitamin E and C on cancer patients. Three of the studies show that there are statistically significant beneficial results. Overall, the systemic review of literature does not support the hypothesis that increased intake of Vitamin E and C (in the form of supplements) can help prevent or treat cancer and that more studies need to be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2006.00483.x | last1 = Coulter | first1 = I.

A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute was done on 1300 prostate cancer patients.

[[Lycopene]] is a strong antioxidant found in large quantities in tomatoes as well as other red fruits and vegetables. It has recently been a subject of great research concerning many potential beneficial properties in the human body. There has been some research suggesting that it may reduce the risk of some types of cancer including colorectal, lung and cervical cancer. However, a review done by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2007 looks at 168 research studies and concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support a relationship of lycopene and a reduction of any cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kavanaugh | first1 = C. J. | last2 = Trumbo | first2 = P. R. | last3 = Ellwood | first3 = K.

Overall, no single nutrient has been found to reduce the risk of cancer. However, a definite correlation has been found in fruit and vegetable intake and reduced risk of cancer, therefore, consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables is recommended. Due to an extensive and conclusive research done in this area, Canada has officially made this a Disease Reduction Health Claim in 1997. However, much more research needs to be done in order to identify which chemicals in fruits and vegetables are responsible for a reduced risk of cancer.

== Health claim #5 ==

=== ''"Non-fermentable carbohydrates in gums and hard candies can reduce dental caries"'' ===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Product labelling regulations===
According to [[Health Canada]], the "chewing gums, confectionery, or breath freshening products" are the only types of products that may contain this health claim. As follows, the following phrases are allowed to be printed on the mentioned product packaging.

'''Allowed phrases:'''&lt;ref name="hc-sc2006"&gt;Health Canada (2006). "Consultation Document on Generic Health Claims" URL: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/health_claims-allegations_sante-eng.php#11&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Won't cause cavities"
* "Does not promote tooth decay"
* "Does not promote dental caries"
* "Non-cariogenic"
* "Tooth friendly" (this phrase is allowed to be printed with one of the previous phrases)

In addition to the product type specificity, the products must contain one or more of these non-cariogenic sweeteners also known as non-fermentable carbohydrates.

'''Allowed sweeteners:'''&lt;ref name="hc-sc2006"/&gt;

* "xylitol, sorbitol, sorbitol syrup, mannitol, maltitol, maltitol syrup, isomalt, lactitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, acesulfame K, aspartame, or sucralose"

=== Involvement of bacteria in development of dental caries ===
The main culprits in creation of dental caries are cariogenic microorganisms such as [[streptococcus mutans]] and sugar (see [[dental caries]] for detailed explanation of tooth cavity formation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1108/09566169110003030 | last1 = Makinen | first1 = Kauko K. | year = 1991 | title = Prevention of Dental Caries by Xylitol | url = | journal = Environmental Management and Health.'':' | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 6–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research supporting the claim ===
There are several studies that show the positive effect of non-fermentable carbohydrates such as xylitol and sorbitol, the most commonly used sugar substitutes in gums and candies, on the reduction of dental caries.

In one study in Belize done on 1277 school children of the mean age of 10.2 years, which were given gums with the contents of either xylitol, xylitol-sorbitol, sorbitol, or sucrose to chew under teachers' supervision daily. After a dental exam after 16, 28, and 40 months, the results showed the most significant reduction in dental caries by the consumption of the xylitol gum (Relative Risk = 0.27). For the sorbitol gum the RR = 0.74 while the sucrose gum increased the incidence of dental caries (RR = 1.20).&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;Hayes, C. "The effect of non-cariogenic sweeteners on the prevention of dental caries: A review of the evidence". ''Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology. Harvard School of Dental Medicine''. URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20041031003008/http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8ACB65DC-F8C9-4160-A310-A846B363DD2A/0/Catherine_Hayes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study in Belize done on six-year-old children given xylitol or sorbitol pellets to chew, the results showed the Relative Risk to be 0.35 and 0.44 relative. This study shows that although both xylitol and sorbitol are effective in reduction of incidence of dental caries, xylitol is more effective.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

In yet another study done on school children in Estonia, that were either given xylitol gums or hard candies to chew/eat for three and two years respectively, the results showed overall results in reduction caries rates versus the control group to be 53.5% for gums and 33-59% for candies.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

Overall, all these studies and more, show that non-fermentable carbohydrates can reduce dental caries, but let's look at one study that didn't get quite the same results.

=== Research not supporting the claim ===
This one study in Madagascar done on school children in grades 1 and 4 were given a "school-based oral health education program." In addition to that all children had to undergo supervised toothbrushing daily. The group was then split into control group and test group where the test group received two types of gum to chew 3-5 times a day. One type of gum was [[polyol]] while the other contained a mix of [[sorbitol]] (55.5%), [[xylitol]] (4.3%), and [[carbamide]] (2.3%). After 3 years of this program, the results of the dental exams showed no significant difference between the test and control groups. It is thought that due to the daily supervised toothbrushing, the groups were similar in their overall oral hygiene and therefore the significant difference between the results was reduced.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

==Claims under consideration==
# A healthy diet rich in a variety of vegetables, fruit and whole grain products and reduced risk of heart disease; and
# A diet rich in folate along with a daily folic acid supplement and reduced risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord

A diet rich in folate along with a daily [[folic acid]] supplement and reduced risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord

For the past decades, lack of folate (vitamin B9) had been linked to risk of having a baby with a birth defect of the brain or spinal cord (specifically neural tube defect).  Neural tube defect is the most common brain and spinal cord related defect in Canada today. In a randomized controlled double-blind trial in South Wales, 44 women who had one child with neural tube defect, took 4&amp;nbsp;mg. of folic acid a day before and during pregnancy.  This resulted in no recurrences amongst these who received supplementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bmj.282.6275.1509 | last1 = Laurence | first1 = K.

In another related study, it was stated that folic acid prevents 70 percent of neural tube defects but its mode of action is unclear.  Not fully understanding the mechanism of how folate prevents neural tube defects may be a concern that is preventing Canada from allowing it to be a health claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.280.5372.2107 | last1 = Fleming | first1 = A. | last2 = Andrew | first2 = C. J. | year = 1998 | title = Embryonic folate metabolism and mouse neural tube defects | url = | journal = Science | volume = 280 | issue = 5372| pages = 2107–2109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, if this becomes a health claim it will be the first Canadian health claim recommending a natural health product supplement.  Thus, more research on this topic is required to insure safety to Canadians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10228">[[Image:SABG MEFs.jpg|thumb|(Upper) Primary mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) before senescence. Spindle-shaped.&lt;br&gt;(Lower) MEFs became senescent after passages. Cells grow larger, flatten shape and expressed senescence-associated [[Beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]] (SABG, blue areas), a marker of cellular senescence.]]

'''Cellular senescence''' is one phenomenon by which normal [[cell (biology)|cells]] cease to [[cell division|divide]]. In their seminal experiments from the early 1960's, [[Leonard Hayflick]] and Paul Moorhead found out that normal human fetal fibroblasts in culture reach a maximum of approximately 50 cell population doublings before becoming senescent.&lt;ref name="Cell 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collado|first1=M|last2=Blasco|first2=MA|last3=Serrano|first3=M|title=Cellular senescence in cancer and aging|journal=Cell|date=27 July 2007|volume=130|issue=2|pages=223–233|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.003|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2007.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayat|first1=M|title=Tumor dormancy, quiescence, and senescence, Volume 2: Aging, cancer, and noncancer pathologies|date=2014|publisher=Springer|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tollefsbol|first1=T|title=Epigenetics of Aging|date=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-0638-0|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is known as "replicative senescence", or the [[Hayflick limit]]. Hayflick's discovery that normal cells are mortal overturned a 60-year-old dogma in cell biology that maintained that all cultured cells are immortal. Hayflick found that the only immortal cultured cells are cancer cells.&lt;ref name=Shay2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shay|first1=JW|last2=Wright|first2=WE|title=Hayflick, his limit, and cellular ageing.|journal=Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology|date=October 2000|volume=1|issue=1|pages=72–6|doi=10.1038/35036093|pmid=11413492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular mechanisms==
Mechanistically, replicative senescence is triggered by a [[DNA damage]] response which results from the shortening of [[telomere]]s during each cellular division process. Cells can also be induced to senesce independent of the number of cellular divisions via DNA damage in response to elevated [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS), activation of [[oncogene]]s and cell-[[cell fusion]]. The number of senescent cells in tissues rises substantially during normal aging.&lt;ref name="pmid26646499" /&gt;

Although senescent cells can no longer replicate, they remain metabolically active and commonly adopt an immunogenic [[phenotype]] consisting of a pro-inflammatory secretome, the up-regulation of immune [[ligand]]s, a pro-survival response, promiscuous gene expression (pGE) and stain positive for [[Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase|senescence-associated β-galactosidase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campisi|first=Judith|title=Aging, Cellular Senescence, and Cancer|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|date=February 2013|volume=75|pages=685–705|doi=10.1146/annurev-physiol-030212-183653|pmid=23140366|pmc=4166529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, along with [[p16|p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4A&lt;/sup&gt;]], is regarded to be a [[biomarker]] of [[Senescence#Cellular senescence|cellular senescence]]. This results in false positives for maturing tissue [[macrophage]]s and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase as well as for [[T-cell]]s p16&lt;sup&gt;Ink4A&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="pmid26646499"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Childs BG, Durik M, Baker DJ, van Deursen JM | title=Cellular senescence in aging and age-related disease: from mechanisms to therapy | journal= [[Nature Medicine]] | volume=21 | issue=12 | pages=1424–1435 | year=2015 | doi= 10.1038/nm.4000 | pmc = 4748967 | id= | pmid=26646499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] response (DDR) arrests cell cycle progression until damages, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs), are repaired.  Senescent cells display persistent DDR foci that appear to be resistant to endogenous [[DNA repair]] activities.  Such senescent cells in culture and tissues from aged mammals retain true DSBs associated with DDR markers.&lt;ref name="pmid28124509"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galbiati A, Beauséjour C, d'Adda di Fagagna F |title=A novel single-cell method provides direct evidence of persistent DNA damage in senescent cells and aged mammalian tissues |journal=Aging Cell |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=422–427 |year=2017 |pmid=28124509 |pmc=5334542 |doi=10.1111/acel.12573 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been proposed that retained DSBs are major drivers of the [[ageing|aging]] process&lt;ref name="pmid27588601"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=White RR, Vijg J |title=Do DNA Double-Strand Breaks Drive Aging? |journal=Mol.

=== Role of telomeres ===
Lately, the role of [[Telomere|telomeres]] in cellular senescence has aroused general interest, especially with a view to the possible genetically adverse effects of [[cloning]]. The successive shortening of the [[Chromosome|chromosomal]] telomeres with each [[cell cycle]] is also believed to limit the number of divisions of the cell, thus contributing to aging. There have, on the other hand, also been reports that cloning could alter the shortening of telomeres. Some cells do not age and are, therefore, described as being "[[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]]". It is theorized by some that when it is discovered exactly what allows these cells, whether it be the result of telomere lengthening or not, to divide without limit that it will be possible to genetically alter other cells to have the same capability. 

The length of the telomere strand has senescent effects; telomere shortening activates extensive alterations in alternative RNA splicing that produce senescent toxins such as [[progerin]], which degrades the tissue and makes it more prone to failure.&lt;ref name="pmid21670498"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Collins FS, etal|date=13 June 2011|title=Progerin and telomere dysfunction collaborate to trigger cellular senescence in normal human fibroblasts|journal=J Clin Invest|volume=121|issue=7|pages=2833–44|doi=10.1172/JCI43578|pmc=3223819|pmid=21670498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of senescent cells==
A Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) consisting of inflammatory [[cytokine]]s, [[growth factor]]s, and [[protease]]s is another characteristic feature of senescent cells.&lt;ref name="pmid27235851"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Malaquin N, Martinez A, Rodier F | title=Keeping the senescence secretome under control: Molecular reins on the senescence-associated secretory phenotype | journal= EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY | volume=82 |  pages=39–49 | year=2016 | doi= 10.1016/j.exger.2016.05.010 | id= | pmid=27235851}}&lt;/ref&gt; SASP is associated with many age-related diseases, including [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] and [[atherosclerosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid26646499" /&gt; This has motivated researchers to develop [[senolytic]] drugs to kill and/or eliminate senescent cells in an effort to improve health in the elderly.&lt;ref name="pmid26646499" /&gt; Whether or not this approach will prove effective is debatable.

The nucleus of senescent cells is characterized by senescence-associated [[heterochromatin]] foci (SAHF) and [[DNA-SCARS|DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence]] (DNA-SCARS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodier|first1=F.|last2=Campisi|first2=J.|title=Four faces of cellular senescence|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=14 February 2011|volume=192|issue=4|pages=547–556|doi=10.1083/jcb.201009094|pmid=21321098|pmc=3044123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senescent cells affect tumour suppression, wound healing and possibly embryonic/placental development, and play a pathological role in age-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burton|first1=Dominick G. A.|last2=Krizhanovsky|first2=Valery|title=Physiological and pathological consequences of cellular senescence|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|date=31 July 2014|volume=71|issue=22|pages=4373–4386|doi=10.1007/s00018-014-1691-3|pmid=25080110|pmc=4207941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisms lacking senescence==
Cellular senescence is not observed in some organisms, including [[perennial]] plants, [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[coral]]s, and [[lobster]]s. In those species where cellular senescence is observed, cells eventually become post-[[mitotic]] when they can no longer replicate themselves through the process of [[mitosis|cellular mitosis]]; i.e., cells experience ''replicative senescence''. How and why some cells become post-mitotic in some species has been the subject of much research and speculation, but it has been suggested that cellular senescence evolved as a way to prevent the onset and spread of [[cancer]]. [[Somatic cell]]s that have divided many times will have accumulated [[DNA]] [[mutation]]s and would therefore be in danger of becoming [[cancer]]ous if cell division continued. As such, it is becoming apparent that senescent cells undergo conversion to an immunogenic phenotype that enables them to be eliminated by the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burton | last2 = Faragher | year = 2015 | title = Cellular senescence: from growth arrest to immunogenic conversion | url = | journal = AGE | volume = 37| issue = | page = | doi = 10.1007/s11357-015-9764-2|pmid= 25787341|pmc=4365077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' dictionary defines civics as "the study of the rights and duties of citizens and of how government works." The definition from dictionary.com is: "the study or science of the privileges and obligations of citizens."

== History ==

Within a given political or [[ethical tradition]], ''civics'' can refer to [[educating]] the [[citizens]]. The history of civics dates back to the earliest theories of civics by [[Confucius]] in ancient China and by [[Plato]] in [[ancient Greece]]. In China also along with Confucianism developed the tradition of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]. These traditions in the [[Eastern world|East]] and in the [[Western world|West]] developed to an extent differently, therefore, with bringing in the past different concepts of citizens' rights and the application of [[justice]], together with different [[ethics]] in public life.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} This was mainly valid before the translation of the Western legal tradition to Chinese which started in 1839, after which influence by Western tradition was brought{{by whom|date=May 2016}} to China, with periods of restoration of [[traditional Chinese law]] and influence by [[Soviet law]]; specific is the common ordinary language used in Chinese laws which has a significant educational role.

'''Coding bootcamps''' are intensive programs of [[software development]] which started in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/08/coding-bootcamps-are-replacing-computer-science-degrees/|title=Coding bootcamps are replacing computer science degrees|last=Choxi|first=Roshan|date=2015|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Coding bootcamps made their debut in 2011 with the Code Academy (now Starter League). Since then, many others have followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/what-hacker-apprenticeships-tell-us-about-the-future-of-education/251039/|title=What Hacker Apprenticeships Tell Us About the Future of Education|last=Moon|first=Joe|date=2012|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2017, there were 95 full-time coding bootcamp courses in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/in-2016-the-coding-bootcamp-bubble-is-bound-to-burst/|title=In 2016, The Coding Bootcamp Bubble Is Bound to Burst|last=Lapowsky|first=Issie|date=2016|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-02-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of courses typically ranges from between 8 to 36 weeks, with most lasting 10 to 12 (averaging 12.9) weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2017|title=2017 Coding Bootcamp Market Size Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- I am thinking that these subheadings could probably be merged into a single paragraph, though I am not quite sure how at the moment. -TheSandDoctor --&gt;
=== Collaboration with higher education ===
Following the increased popularity of coding bootcamps, some universities have started their own intensive coding programs or partnered with existing private coding bootcamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/collaboration-in-higher-education-universities-coding-bootcamps|title=Collaboration in Higher Education: Universities + Coding Bootcamps|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online coding bootcamps ===
There are various online options for online bootcamps. Bootcamps usually match students with a mentor and are also generally cheaper and more accommodating to specific student needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2016-08-11/4-things-to-know-about-online-coding-boot-camps|title=4 Things to Know About Online Coding Boot Camps|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data science bootcamps and fellowships ===
Bootcamps that focus less on [[Solution stack|full stack development]] and more on producing [[Data science|data scientists]] and 
[[Information engineering|data engineers]] are known as data science bootcamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/q-%22Data-Scientist%22-q-%22Data-Engineer%22.html|title="Data Scientist" and "Data Engineer" Job Trends|website=www.indeed.com|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tuition ==

Coding bootcamps can be part-time or online, they may be funded by employers or qualify for student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/edtechs-next-big-disruption-is-the-college-degree/|title=Edtech’s Next Big Disruption Is The College Degree|last=Skonnard|first=Aaron|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2017 market research report, tuition ranged from free to $21,000 for a course, with an average tuition of $11,874.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-job-placement-2017|title=2017 Coding Bootcamp Market Size Study|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Deferred Tuition" refers to a payment model in which students pay the school a percentage (18%-22.5%) of their salary for 1–3 years after graduation, instead of upfront tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursereport.com/blog/coding-bootcamp-deferred-tuition-income-share-agreements|title=Deferred Tuition|last=|first=|date=|website=www.coursereport.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, coding bootcamps can be free or a couple thousand euros per program. In contrast to formal university education, private offerings for training appear expensive. {{Citation needed|reason= Please cite|date=April 2018}}

On August 16, 2016, the US Department of Education announced up to $17 million in loans or grants for students to study with nontraditional training providers, including coding bootcamps.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-administration-to-fund-nontraditional-training-for-students-1471341782|title=Obama Administration to Fund Nontraditional Training for Students|last=Mitchell|first=Josh|date=2016-08-16|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These grants or loans will be administered through the pilot program, EQUIP which stands for Educational Quality through Innovation Partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-08-16-the-equip-eight-dept-of-ed-selects-partners-for-higher-education-experiment|title=The EQUIP Eight: Dept. of Ed Selects Partners for Higher Education Experiment (EdSurge News)|date=2016-08-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs must partner with an accredited college and third-party quality assurance entity (QAE) in order to receive federal financial aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/03/18/groups-seek-become-quality-reviewers-boot-camps-online-courses-and-other-noncollege|title=Groups seek to become quality reviewers of boot camps, online courses and other noncollege offerings|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2016, there were concerns that partnering private coding bootcamps with federal financial aid could attract less reputable organizations to create coding bootcamp programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2016/08/22/keep-coding-bootcamps-great-dont-give-them-taxpayer-money/#7821bb1350a0|title=Keep Coding Bootcamps Great: Don't Give Them Taxpayer Money|last=Cooper|first=Preston|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barriers to entry and exit mean established schools face less competition than in a free market, which can lead to deterioration of quality, and increase in prices. Also, problems within traditional university models could easily transfer to the university/bootcamp partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/16/colleges-partner-with-training-bootcamps-and-online-course-providers-for-federal-experiment/|title=Colleges partner with training boot camps and online course providers for federal experiment|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, others believe that enhancing policy around financial aid will help lower income prospective students attend. There are several sentiments of coding bootcamps being accessible only for the rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/06/are-coding-bootcamps-only-for-the-rich/|title=Are coding bootcamps only for the rich?|last=Pathak|first=Prasid|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7678">'''Cognitive computing''' ('''CC''') describes [[Computing platform|technology platforms]] that, broadly speaking, are based on the scientific disciplines of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[signal processing]].  These platforms encompass [[machine learning]], [[Automated reasoning|reasoning]], [[natural language processing]], [[Speech recognition|speech]] recognition and [[Computer vision|vision]] (object recognition), [[human–computer interaction]], [[Dialog system|dialog]] and narrative generation, among other technologies.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augmented intelligence, helping humans make smarter decisions.

== Definition ==
At present, there is no widely agreed upon definition for cognitive computing in either [[academia]] or industry.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/software/IBMResearch/multimedia/Computing_Cognition_WhitePaper.pdf|title=Computing, cognition and the future of knowing|last=Kelly III|first=Dr. John|date=2015|website=IBM Research: Cognitive Computing|publisher=IBM Corporation|access-date=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing/|title=IBM Research: Cognitive Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://synthexis.com/cognitive-computing/|title=Cognitive Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the term cognitive computing has been used to refer to new hardware and/or software that [[Neuromorphic computing|mimics the functioning]] of the [[human brain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labs.hpe.com/research/next-next/brain/|title=Hewlett Packard Labs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terdiman, Daniel (2014) .IBM's TrueNorth processor mimics the human brain.http://www.cnet.com/news/ibms-truenorth-processor-mimics-the-human-brain/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Shawn (2011).

CC applications link [[data analysis]] and adaptive page displays ([[Adaptive user interface|AUI]]) to adjust content for a particular type of audience. As such, CC hardware and applications strive to be more [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] and more influential by design.

Some features that cognitive systems may express are:
* '''[[Adaptive system|Adaptive]]''': They may learn as information changes, and as goals and requirements evolve. They may resolve ambiguity and tolerate unpredictability. They may be engineered to feed on dynamic data in real time, or near real time.&lt;ref name="Ferrucci"&gt;Ferrucci, D. et al. (2010) Building Watson: an overview of the DeepQA Project. Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2010, 59–79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Interactive]]''': They may interact easily with users so that those users can define their needs comfortably. They may also interact with other processors, devices, and [[Cloud computing|cloud services]], as well as with people.
* '''Iterative and [[stateful]]''': They may aid in defining a problem by asking questions or finding additional source input if a problem statement is ambiguous or incomplete. They may "remember" previous interactions in a process and return information that is suitable for the specific application at that point in time.
* '''[[Context awareness|Contextual]]''': They may understand, identify, and extract contextual elements such as [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], [[syntax]], time, location, appropriate domain, regulations, user’s profile, process, task and goal. They may draw on multiple sources of information, including both structured and [[Unstructured information|unstructured]] digital information, as well as sensory inputs (visual, gestural, auditory, or sensor-provided).&lt;ref&gt;Deanfelis, Stephen (2014). ''[https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/04/will-2014-year-fall-love-cognitive-computing/ Will 2014 Be the Year You Fall in Love With Cognitive Computing?]'' Wired: 2014-04-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use cases==

* [[Speech recognition]] 
* [[Sentiment analysis]] 
* [[Face detection]] 
* [[Risk assessment]]
* [[Fraud detection]]
* Behavioral recommendations

== Cognitive analytics ==
Cognitive computing-branded technology platforms typically specialize in the processing and analysis of large, [[Unstructured data|unstructured datasets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://public.deloitte.com/media/analytics/pdfs/us_da_3min_guide_cognitive_analytics.pdf|title=Cognitive analytics - The three-minute guide|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-cognitive-analytics|title=What is cognitive analytics? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Word processing documents, emails, videos, images, audio files, presentations, webpages, social media and many other data formats often need to be manually [[Tag (metadata)|tagged with metadata]] before they can be fed to a computer for analysis and insight generation. The principal benefit of utilizing cognitive analytics over traditional big data analytics is that such datasets do not need to be pretagged.

Other characteristics of a cognitive analytics system include:
* '''Adaptability:''' cognitive analytics systems can use machine learning to adapt to different contexts with minimal human supervision
* '''Natural language interaction:''' cognitive analytics systems can be equipped with a chatbot or search assistant that understands queries, explains data insights and interacts with humans in natural language.

'''Cognitive deficit''' or '''cognitive impairment''' is an inclusive term to describe any characteristic that acts as a barrier to [[cognition|the cognition process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coren |first=Stanley |author2=Lawrence M. Ward |author3=James T. Enns  |title=Sensation and Perception |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace]] |year=1999 |page=9 |isbn= 0-470-00226-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term may describe
* deficits in overall [[intelligence]] (as with [[intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities]]),

==Treatment==
Older people with cognitive impairment appear to improve somewhat with [[light therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiu|first1=HL|last2=Chan|first2=PT|last3=Chu|first3=H|last4=Hsiao|first4=SS|last5=Liu|first5=D|last6=Lin|first6=CH|last7=Chou|first7=KR|title=Effectiveness of Light Therapy in Cognitively Impaired Persons: A Metaanalysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=October 2017|volume=65|issue=10|pages=2227-2234|doi=10.1111/jgs.14990|pmid=28734045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case studies ==

{{Cleanup|section|reason=most of these examples are longitudinal studies with large samples, not case studies|date=December 2015}}

There is evidence to indicate that parallel age trends have been similar over a vast amount of time, as with Schaie’s Seattle Longitudinal Study, which contained fifty years worth of data  as well as seventy years in Wechsler tests. Studies such as these{{Example needed}} have demonstrated the different patterns in age trends have two specific patterns in cognition, a constant decrease in measures of processing abilities such as reasoning, and stability followed by a steady decline for knowledge previously acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gualtieri|first=C. Thomas|author2=Johnson, Lynda G.|title=Age-related cognitive decline in patients with mood disorders|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|volume=32|issue=4|pages=962–967|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.12.030|pmid=18243461|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A twelve-year study published in 2012 researched the effects of lifestyle activities on cognitive deficit in the hopes that a long study such as this could, to some degree, help older adults to ward off cognitive decline. The study looked at verbal speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory to be influenced by physical, social, and cognitive activities. The results of the study concluded that maintenance of cognitive functions with normal aging can be maintained by keeping an active lifestyle. The results also seemed to conclude that the correlation between lifestyle activities and cognition is not a simple one, as not all cognitive abilities were related to changes in the daily activities. Therefore, further research of longitudinal design observing the matches between activities and cognitive abilities in cognitively impaired adults could be critical.&lt;ref name="Small 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=B|author2=Dixon R|author3=McArdle J|author4=Grimm K.|title=Do changes in lifestyle engagement moderate cognitive decline in normal aging? Evidence from the Victoria Longitudinal Study|journal=Neuropsychology|date=March 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=144–155|doi=10.1037/a0026579|pmid=22149165|pmc=3761970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies using brain imaging have been done in an attempt to note early signs of cognitive decline on healthy individuals before changes noticed clinically occur. In this way the study attempted to find more biomarkers for early onset of degenerative diseases.  The results from the study concluded that there are indeed patterns of brain abnormality that can be associated with brain decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=VH|author2=Resnick SM|author3=Doshi J|author4=Beason-Held LL|author5=Zhou Y|author6=Ferrucci L|author7=Wong DF|author8=Kraut MA|author9=Davatzikos C|title=Longitudinal imaging pattern analysis (SPARE-CD index) detects early structural and functional changes before cognitive decline in healthy older adults|journal=Neurobiology of Aging|volume=33|issue=12|pages=2733–45|doi=10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2012.01.010|pmid=22365049|pmc=4023476|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-sectional study, researchers investigated patients with mood disorders in comparison with a control group to see if there was a difference on the effect of aging between the groups. These patients were tested with the Central Nervous System Vital Signs, a neurocognitive battery test. The study examined subjects from ages 18 to 90, noticing a sharp decline in the patients with mood disorder compared to the normal group when subjects were ages 65 and up. These declines were observed in the cognitive areas of attention, executive function, processing speed, and memory.&lt;ref name="Small 2012" /&gt;

== Other findings ==

Although one would expect cognitive decline to have major effects on [[job performance]], it seems that there is little to no correlation of health with job performance.  With the exception of cognitive-dependent jobs such as air-traffic controller, professional athlete, or other elite jobs, age does not seem to impact one’s job performance. This obviously conflicts with cognitive tests given, so the matter has been researched further.
One possible reason for this conclusion is the rare need for a person to perform at their maximum. There is a difference between typical functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– the normal level of functioning for daily life, and maximal functioning, that is&amp;nbsp;– what cognitive tests observe as our maximum level of functioning. As the maximum cognitive ability that we are able to achieve decreases, it may not actually affect our daily lives, which only require the normal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salthouse|first=Timothy|title=Consequences of Age-Related Cognitive Declines|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=10 January 2012|volume=63|issue=1|pages=201–226|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100328|pmc=3632788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have indicated that childhood hunger might have a protective effect on cognitive decline. One possible explanation is that the onset of age-related changes in the body can be delayed by [[calorie restriction]]. Another possible explanation is the selective survival effect, as the study participants who had a childhood with hunger tend to be the healthiest of their era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barnes |first=L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9949">The '''Columbia School of Linguistics''' is a group of linguists with a radically functional and empirical conception of language.  According to their school of thought, the main function of language is communication.  Columbia School linguistic analyses typically are based on observable data, such as corpora (texts or recorded speech), not on introspective ad hoc sentence examples.  Rather than a single theory of language, the Columbia School is set of orientations in which scholars analyze actual speech acts in an attempt to explain why they take the forms they do.  This was the methodology of its founder, the late [[William Diver]], who taught linguistics at Columbia University until his retirement in 1989.

== Orientations ==

On the one hand, this methodology is more modest in its goals than most other schools.  On the other hand, the results produced are more reliable, because they are based on objective data, rather than on [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] or philosophical entities{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective?|date=May 2018}}.  The assumption is that modest goals are more appropriate for a linguistic science still in its infancy, a science that hasn’t yet freed itself entirely from traditional philological parts of speech, self-standing sentence examples, and logico-philosophical entities such as subject and predicate{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective?|date=May 2018}}. Conclusions about how the mind functions, based on the structure of language, should wait until a new, more reliable linguistics emerges, as did astronomy from its origins in astrology{{citation needed|reason=how is this objective? The author has not even cited someone who claimed this as a fundamental principle of the Columbia school.|date=May 2018}}.

A useful illustration of the differences between the Columbia School of Linguistics (CSL) and other linguistic approaches is the way each regards the field of mathematics.  Rather than considering human language to be itself a kind of logic or mathematics, CSL uses mathematics as a tool to analyze and draw conclusions about languages.  Instead of trying to produce rules to generate all possible “grammatical” sentences, CSL scholars count and compare numbers of occurrences of various phenomena and then apply statistical criteria to draw conclusions about the reasons for this usage.  These conclusions, although not earth-shattering,  are based on the CSL orientations of communication, physiology or psychology. CSL researchers typically search the gray areas for an explanation of why one form appears more often than another, and are not satisfied with a black-and-white mapping of the frontiers of grammaticality.  Whereas most linguists talk of '''constraints''' and combinations of entities that are not permitted, CSL linguists discuss the '''choices''' that speakers of language have and how they make use of those choices.

CSL’s basic unit of language is the morpheme, the smallest meaningful unit of language.  This is the [[linguistic sign]], the unit shared by all other subdisciplines of [[semiotics]].  By taking the sign as the basic unit—as opposed to the sentence—CSL linguists can reasonably compare either spoken or sign language to all other forms of communication through signs, from ideograms to musical notation to bee dancing.  It is not a goal of CSL to search for entities of human language that distinguish it from other forms of animal communication.  As with all posited entities, CSL will accept them after they have been shown to have a function.

== Semantics ==

One radical approach of CSL is in its treatment of meaning.  Rather than assuming that there exist semantic universals—much less that we know what they are—CSL assumes that every linguistic sign has a meaning different from all other signs in any language.  Although meanings may be similar, they are never exactly the same. And until it can be objectively shown that a particular sign has multiple meanings, the assumption is that it has only one meaning (elsewhere known as a [[Gesamtbedeutung]]), capable of carrying diverse messages. This derives from Ferdinand de Saussure's structuralist perspective on language, whose perspective relies heavily on the dictum "one form - one meaning". For example, many linguists believe that the word ''with'' has several meanings, such as ''instrumental'': “cut with a knife,” ''adversarial'': “struggle with your enemies”, and even ''partitive'': “split with the organization,” among others.   However, CSL linguists observe that what varies among these uses is not the meaning of ''with'' but the message of the phrase, due to the accompanying verbs and nouns.   ''Struggle'' undoubtedly contributes to the adversarial message, but so does the word ''enemies'';  “struggle with your comrades” would likely eliminate the adversarial relationship.  The little word ''with'' contributes the same weak meaning (something like: “at some time accompanied by”) throughout.   Not only do words in the same sentence affect the message conveyed by ''with'', but the surrounding context and the non-linguistic circumstances do so as well.   In “don’t struggle with him,” the sense is radically affected by the antecedent of ''him,'' whether ''him'' was identified in the previous sentence or whether the speaker is pointing to someone likely to be the listener’s comrade or enemy.

== Syntax ==

Another distinguishing characteristic of the Columbia school is its approach to syntax.  CSL does not attempt to create an algorithm that can generate all possible sentences, because there is no clear dividing line between “grammatical” and “ungrammatical” sentences.   Many apparently ungrammatical sentences can find a useful application, given the proper context.

== Phonology ==

CSL differs from other schools in the other major aspect of language, phonology, as well.  Here again, CSL does not posit entities, such as binary features, unless they can be shown to have a function.  There is nothing in information theory that requires every message to consist ultimately of a binary code.   Any linguistic message can be represented by a binary code, just as our decimal number system can be represented binarily. Therefore, the bit can be used as convenient but arbitrary measure of information for speech or for numerical information. But nobody seriously proposes that people fundamentally use binary digits in counting, as some linguists do for speech.

Unlike most other schools, CSL concentrates on articulation, rather than sound, as its object of study (but see also [[articulatory phonology]]).  For example, CSL attributes the relative rarity in most languages of words beginning with /g/ to its relative difficulty of articulation, not to auditory causes.  In the production of a (voiced) /g/, air must pass through the vocal cords while the back of the tongue stops up the vocal tract, blocking that air.  Since the resulting chamber of air for /g/ is smaller than for /b/ or /d/, there is less time for air to build up, making it harder to produce a vocal vibration when starting to speak.  Thus, through its physiological theoretical orientation, CSL gives an articulatory explanation of the low frequency of initial /g/ in human language.  CSL does not neglect sound as the means through which spoken language is transmitted and whose perceptible differences serve to distinguish linguistic signs.  However, it considers [[articulatory gestures]], not binary acoustic features, to be the physical units of which any utterance is made up.

== Summary ==

The Columbia School of Linguistics traces its origins through [[André Martinet]] and others back to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the founder of modern linguistics.  Like Saussure, CSL considers a language to be a kind of system “où tout se tient” (where everything depends on or influences everything else).  But CSL differs from Saussure and his followers in its interest in substance as well as in form.   Saussure emphatically denied the relevance of the physical media (vocal tract, sound) through which language functions, claiming that language consists of nothing but differences, which are phonetically achieved through the use of physical media.  But CSL linguists make a practice of explaining the arrangement of various forms (/g/, red barn vs. barn red) through their related substances (air chambers, difference in meaning).  CSL researchers set as their goal what other linguists postulate—but do not explain how—children do as they acquire their first language, that is, they analyze the undifferentiated mass of linguistic input actually produced by people.   Rather than marveling at the infinitude of possible sentences that could be produced by an algorithm, CSL linguists wonder at the remarkable skill that humans have in employing a limited number of physical resources and meanings to produce a myriad of messages appropriate for a myriad of situations.

== Mission ==

The mission of Earth Expeditions is to build an alliance of people with direct knowledge of inquiry-driven, community-based learning for the benefit of ecological communities, student achievement, and global understanding.
The image of people who merely transmit and receive knowledge from books is of limited usefulness in an era of rapid social, environmental and technological change. This program envisions each person as an ambassador who creates and transmits knowledge and who promotes authentic dialogue at all levels of society, inspiring others to do the same. With the adoption of participatory models of education, schools become centers of investigation, students engage more deeply in their studies, and communities achieve higher levels of self-determination.

== Project ''Dragonfly'' ==

Since its inception nearly 20 years ago, '''Project ''Dragonfly''''' has reached millions of children, parents and educators through [[science learning]] media, exhibits, and graduate programs. The project began in 1994 with the creation of the award-winning ''Dragonfly'' magazine, the first national magazine to feature the investigations and discoveries of children.  Created in 1994 at [[Miami University]], ''Dragonfly'' magazine was funded by NSF and published by the [[National Science Teachers Association]]. Through mid-2000, the magazine published young investigators alongside such adult researchers as Dr. [[Jane Goodall]].

Project ''Dragonfly'' pioneered the "Real Kids, Real Science" approach to learning and continues to work for inquiry-driven reform to increase public involvement in science and global understanding. In addition to Earth Expeditions, Project ''Dragonfly'' worked with [[Twin Cities Public Television|TPT]] Public Television to launch the Emmy-Award winning PBS children's television series ''[[DragonflyTV]]'', which led to the 2010 launch of the spinoff series ''[[SciGirls]]'', both produced by TPT Public Television.  Project ''Dragonfly'' also oversees two national exhibit projects: Wild Research and iSaveSpecies, which are creating public research stations at zoos and aquariums nationwide to engage families in science inquiry and conservation action. The [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) has called ''Dragonfly'' "A true innovation and a model of what active learning should be."

==  Founding partners ==

===  Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden ===

[[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]] opened in 1875 and is the second oldest zoo in the nation. This national historical landmark hosts more than 500 animal species and 3,000 plant species. More than 1.2 million people visit the Cincinnati Zoo annually. A non-profit entity, the zoo is internationally known for its success in the protection and propagation of plants and animals in danger and engages in research and conservation projects around the world.

'''Ecophenotypic variation''' ("ecophenotype") refers to [[Phenotype|phenotypical variation]] as a function of life station. In wide-ranging species, the contributions of [[heredity]] and environment are not always certain, but their interplay can sometimes be determined by experiment.

==Plants==
Plants display the most obvious examples of ecophenotypic variation. One example are trees growing in the woods developing long straight trunks, with branching crowns high in the canopy, while the same species growing alone in the open develops a spreading form, branching much lower to the ground. [[Genotype]]s often have much flexibility in the modification and expression of [[phenotype]]s; in many organisms these phenotypes are very different under varying environmental conditions. The plant ''[[Hieracium umbellatum]]'' is found growing in two different habitats in Sweden. One habitat is rocky sea-side cliffs, where the plants are bushy with broad leaves and expanded [[inflorescence]]s; the other is among sand dunes where the plants grow prostrate with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. These habitats alternate along the coast of Sweden and the habitat that the seeds of ''H. umbellatum'' land in determines the phenotype that grows.&lt;ref name=Botanyonline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e37/37b.htm |title=Botany online: Evolution: The Modern Synthesis - Phenotypic and Genetic Variation; Ecotypes |work= |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Invasive species|Invasive plants]] such as the [[honeysuckle]] can thrive by altering their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] in response to changes in the environment,&lt;ref name="Jstor2997251"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Greater morphological plasticity of exotic honeysuckle species may make them better invaders than native species|first1=Jennifer|last1=Schweitzer|first2=Katherine|last2=Larson|journal=Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society|issue=126|volume=1|year=1999|pages=15–23|publisher=jstor.org|jstor=2997251|doi=10.2307/2997251}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives them a competitive advantage. Another example of a plants phenotypic reaction and adaptation with its environment is how [[Thlaspi caerulescens]] can absorb the metals in the soil to use to its advantage in defending against harmful microbes and bacteria in its leaves.&lt;ref&gt;"Plants 'armor up' with metals." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The more immediate responses shown by vascular plants to their environment, for instance a vine's ability to conform to the wall or tree upon which it grows, are not usually considered ecophenotypic, even though the mechanisms may be related.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J. Phil, and Terri R. Gibson. "plants and the environment." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
Since animals are far less plastic than plants, ecophenotypic variation is noteworthy. When encountered, it can cause confusion in identification if it is not anticipated. The most obvious examples are again common observations, as the dwarfing of aquarium fish living in a restricted environment.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Katherine. "evolution." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In asexual reproduction, the parent passes on the entire genome to the next generation. Mutations to the genes are the only source of genetic variation. In sexual reproduction, each parent contributes half of his or her genome to the offspring; thus the offspring contain a mixture of genetic material. Adaptations are traits that increase fitness, the driving force for natural selection. The level of fitness associated with an allele can only be ascertained by comparison with alternate alleles. Traits that increase the survival rate of a species contribute to an animal's fitness, but selection will only favor such traits insofar as survival improves the reproductive success of the organism. More interesting are examples where causation is less clear. Among [[mollusca|mollusks]], examples include the [[muricidae|muricid]] snail species ''[[Nucella lamellosa]]'', which in rough, shallow waters is generally less spiny than in deeper, quiet waters.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, R. T., 1968 Seashells of North America. Golden Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[unionidae|unionid]] [[freshwater bivalves]], there are lake, small river, and large river forms of several species.&lt;ref&gt;Burch, J. B., 1975 Freshwater unionacean clams (mollusca, Pelecypoda) of North America. Malacological Publications. p 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[vertebrate]]s, experiments on mice show reduced length of ears and tails in response to being reared in a lower temperature, a phenomenon known as [[Allen's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, William, and Charles E. Little. "Allen's rule." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humans==
In humans, environmental differences due to [[lifestyle choice]]s are a consideration, for instance the differences between someone who spends much time on the sofa before the television, beer in hand, and an individual who spends his time in the gym or the soccer field can be pronounced. [[Franz Boas]] found that [[cephalic index]] was to some degree dependent on where a child was born, independent of the child's genetic or cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Stanley A. "environmental psychology." Science Online. Facts On File, Inc. Web. Retrieved 10 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another way in which environmental differences can cause physical and/or behavioral alterations is in being put under great levels of [[stress (psychological)|stress]], causing a wide range of effects. Chronic Stress has been proven to cause health issues in many individuals. "Early childhood attempts to cope with fear or rejection ... set up psychological patterns of behavior for the person's later life. Those behaviors in turn affect the biochemical imbalances in the brain's neuronal systems. Those altered imbalances in turn reinforce the behaviors, and the cycle feeds upon itself." "The body reacts biochemically to excessive stress as it attempts to regain its healthy dynamic balance" ; "In psychologically stressful situations, hormones may be brought into play to remedy the imbalance the body finds itself in."&lt;ref name="Davis, J. 1984"&gt;Davis, J. (1984) Endorphins. Garden City, N.Y.: Dial Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the General Adaption Syndrome, which is the biological response to stress, there are three stages.
1.) The "Alarm Action" - heart rate increases, blood sugar levels rise, pupils dilate, and digestion slows.
2.) The "Resistance" or "Adaptive" stage - The body attempts to repair the damage which caused the emergency arousal
3.) The "Exhaustion Stage" - The body grows ill; Mentally, possibly by neurosis or even psychotic disturbances, or physically, having the possibility to trigger several kinds of cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and Quite commonly, certain forms of [[asthma]].&lt;ref name="Davis, J. 1984"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6105">'''Environmentally Endangered Lands Programs''' are bond funded wildland conservation efforts in Florida, USA.

The programs in more than 27 Florida counties include:
*[[Environmental Lands Acquisition and Protection Program]] (ELAPP), Hillsborough County
*[[Environmentally Endangered Lands]] protection program, Brevard County
*[[Environmentally Sensitive Lands Protection Program]] (ESLPP), Sarasota County
* Environmentally Endangered Lands (EEL) [[Miami-Dade County]]
*[[Environmentally Sensitive Lands]], [[Hernando County]]'s program
*Land Preservation Bond Program, [[Broward County]]
*Palm Beach County land acquisition program

==History==
Miami-Dade County voters approved a tax for Environmentally Endangered Lands in 1990 and $40 million more $40 million in 2004 through the Building Better Communities Bond.&lt;ref name=counties/&gt;

[[Broward County]] approved its Land Preservation Bond Program in 2000 and purchased 83 sites for a totalof 850 acres as of 2007, using $152 million of its $200 million.&lt;ref name=counties/&gt;

Palm Beach County started its land acquisition program in 1991 with a $100 million bond. Through 2006 the country had protected 35,063 acres. A volunteer program helps with restoration and maintenance.&lt;ref name=counties&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2007/06/17/140849/counties-spend-millions-on-acquiring.html#storylink=cpy Counties spend millions on acquiring land] June 17, 2007Miami Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, voters in Hillsborough County, Florida, overwhelmingly chose to increase taxes and create the Environmental Lands Acquisition and Protection Program (ELAPP)&lt;ref&gt;[https://usflibrary.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=f620c1b74f624fa982414db2391b290a ELAPP History Project]&lt;/ref&gt;. Through this program, environmentally sensitive areas were preserved and/or restored. Again in 1990 and 2008, voters opted to increase taxes in order to expand ELAPP.

On November 6, 2008 Florida voted for an amendment to the [[Florida Constitution]] requiring the state legislature to exempt land permanently set aside for conservation from all property taxes beginning in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/green/Florida_Voters_Lift_Property_Taxes_for_Conservation_Lands.html Florida Voters Lift Property Taxes for Conservation Lands] Janaryu 7, 2010 NBC4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evergreen forest==
Twenty-seven endangered and threatened plants live in the evergreen forests called hammocks. Several species originated in the [[West Indies]] including ''[[Ficus]]'', [[gumbo-limbo]], [[Nectandra coriacea|lancewood]] and [[paradise-tree]]s. Temperate [[live oak]] grows in the forests. [[Hattie Bauer Hammock]] is one preserve with this type of habitat and was acquired in 1996. Vines are a problem outcompeting the native [[goatsfoot]] (''[[Passiflora sexflora]]''). The threatened broad [[halberd fern]] (''[[Tectaria heracleifolia]]'') and [[maidenhair ferns]]. [[Cuban nakedwood]], ''[[Colubrina cubensis]]'' var. ''floridana'' is highly endangered. ''[[Colubrina]]''. It is also known as [[Cuban snakebark]].&lt;ref name=endangered/&gt;

==Southern glade==
Plants protected in Southern glades include wildflowers like ''[[Samolus parviflorus]]'' (water pimpernel), [[yellowtop]], [[lavender thistle]], [[marsh pink]]s, and [[Calopogon tuberosus|grass pink]] orchids (''[[Calapogon tuberosus]]''). Bird inhabitants include [[double-crested cormorant]]s, [[great blue heron]], [[little blue heron]], [[tricolored heron]], [[snowy egret]], [[osprey]], [[kingfisher]] and [[grebe]]. Native [[poisonwood]] grows in these areas. Other species include [[white-crowned pigeon]], [[Spike rush]], [[Cladium|sawgrass]], [[crayfish]], [[marsh rabbit]], [[deer]] and [[Florida panther]]; as well as colicroot (''[[Aletris bracteata]]''), the lavender ground orchid ''[[Bletia purpurea]]'' and ''[[Pinguicula pumila]]'', a dwarf [[butterwort]].&lt;ref name=endangered/&gt;

==Scrub==
Florida's oldest ecosystem is scrub. One area is of it protected in a fenced 15-acre plot called [[County Line Scrub]] on the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]]/ [[Broward County]] border boundary and at the four acre [[Dolphin Center Park]] Addition. Inhabitants include [[live oak]], [[Chapman's oak]], [[myrtle oak]] and a natural [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] known as [[Rolf's oak]]. [[Winged sumac]], which provides red fruit for small [[warbler]]s and other wildlife in the fall, pawpaws (''[[Asimina]]''), [[Saw palmetto]]s, [[cocoplum]], [[wax myrtle]], [[tarflower]] (''[[Befaria racemosa]]'') as well as the endangered [[quailberry]] (''[[Crossopetalum ilicifolium]]''). [[Blueberry]] and [[rusty lyonia]]. Animals such as [[gopher tortoise]], [[scrub lizard]], [[burrowing owl]] and [[indigo snake]]. Even smaller parcels can host [[coontie]], [[sabal palm]], [[partridge pea]] and a native cactus: ''[[Opuntia humifusa]]''.
These can be seen at [[Arch Creek, Florida|Arch Creek]] or [[Greynolds Park]].&lt;ref name=endangered/&gt;

==Pine Rockland==
Pine rockland is a rare ecosystem, with only about 4,000 acres of the original 185,000 acres, remaining. This type of habitat developed around limestone and fire. [[Scissor-tail kite]], [[osprey]]. [[Rockdale Pineland]] is one preserve, home to endangered [[Redland sandmat]] (deltoid spurge). The land conservation programs have protected an additional 850 acres. [[locustberry]] [[saw palmetto]], [[coontie]], a native [[cycad]] used by pioneers to make starch, [[wild poinsettia]] and [[lantana]]. [[Opuntia humifusa|Prickly pear]] (''[[Opuntia humifusa]]'').&lt;ref name=endangered&gt;GEORGIA TASKER [http://www.miamiherald.com/2007/06/17/v-fullstory/140835/exploring-south-floridas-endangered.html Exploring South Florida's endangered natural areas] June 17, Miami Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Episodic storytelling''' is when a story is narrated through [[episode|episodes]], as opposed to chapters, which are typically seen in novels. The term used in [[literature]] to refer to a body of work composed of episodes or similar installments is [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]. [[episodic fiction|Serials]] are also known as [[episodic fiction]]. 

Multiple episodes are usually grouped together into a [[Serial (radio and television)|series]] through a unifying [[story arc]]. Episodes may not always contain the same characters, but each episode draws from a broader group of characters, or cast, all of whom exist in the same [[story world]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2387">'''Forensic metrology''' is [[metrology]], the science of measurement, as it applies to [[forensic science]]s. Forensic [[Laboratory|laboratories]] and [[Criminalistics|criminalistic]] laboratories perform numerous measurements and tests to support both [[Criminal prosecution|criminal]] and [[Civil lawsuit|civil legal actions]].  Examples of forensic metrology include the measurement of blood or breath [[alcohol content]], the quantification of [[controlled substance]]s (both net weights and purity), and length measurements of [[Gun barrel|firearm barrels]].  The results of forensic measurements are used to determine if a person is charged with a crime or may be used to determine a statutory sentencing enhancement.  Other examples of forensic metrology includes tests that measure if there is a presence of a substance (e.g., cocaine), latent print examination, [[questioned document examination|questioned documents examination]], and [[DNA analysis]].

Forensic measurements are all supported by reference standards which are traceable to the [[International System of Units]] (SI) maintained by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], to natural constants, or to reference materials such as those provided by the United States' national metrology institute known as the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]].

Examples of instruments and equipment used in forensic metrology include [[breathalyzer]]s, balances &amp; [[Weighing scale|scales]], [[ruler]]s, [[caliper]]s, [[Gas chromotographer]]s, and [[centrifuge]]s.

Recent attention has been given to forensic metrology and metrological traceability as a result of an international effort to accredit forensic laboratories and criminalistic laboratories to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[ISO 17025|17025]] requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16082">A '''geographic range limit''' is the geographic boundary beyond which a [[species]] does not occur, the limit or limits of the [[Range (biology)|range]] of a species. "Core populations" are populations of individuals occurring within the center of the [[Range (biology)|range]], and "peripheral" or "edge populations" are groups of individuals near the boundary of the range.

The inability of a species to expand its range beyond these limits is because of some factor or factors that constrain the species from adapting to overcome the factors that are imposing limits on its distribution.&lt;ref name=Mott&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mott|first=CL|title=Environmental Constraints to the Geographic Expansion of Plant and Animal Species|journal=Natural Education Knowledge|year=2010|volume=3|issue=10|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, geographical range limits are entirely predictable, such as the physical barrier of an ocean for a terrestrial species.&lt;ref name=Mott /&gt; In other cases, reasons why species do not pass these boundaries are unknown, however the main determinants of the distribution of a species across its range are [[ecological]] and [[evolutionary]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardie|first=DC|author2=Hutching JA|title=Evolutionary ecology at the extreme of species' ranges|journal=Environ. Rev.|year=2010|volume=18|pages=1–20|doi=10.1139/a09-014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many species of invertebrate animals, the exact geographic range limits have never been precisely ascertained, because not enough scientific field work has been carried in many parts of the world to map distribution more precisely, therefore finding a range extension for species, especially marine species, is not an uncommon occurrence.

==Abiotic factors==
[[File:Moth September 2008-3.jpg|thumbnail|The pine moth, ''[[Thaumetopoea pityocampa]]'', expanded its range northward in France.]]

Gradients in climactic factors create physiological barriers to dispersal.&lt;ref name=Mott /&gt; All species have limits of tolerance to [[abiotic]] factors, which can lower their survival and [[reproductive success]] and limit range expansion beyond the edge. Changes in [[temperature]] may cause a species to change its geographical distribution. With increasing temperatures resulting from [[global warming]], species have been seen to expand their range northward due to increased survival and reproduction as a result of warming.&lt;ref name=Battisti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Battisti|first=A|author2=Stastny M |author3=Netherer S |author4=Robinet C |author5=Schopf A |author6=Roques A |author7=Larsson S |title=Expansion of geographic range in the pine processionary moth caused by increased winter temperatures|journal=Ecological Applications|year=2005|volume=15|issue=6|pages=2084–2096 |doi=10.1890/04-1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can also be a key determinant in limiting the geographic range edges of species. This is often seen in organisms with high water demands, whose survival and reproduction would decrease beyond the edge due to dry conditions, limiting expansion.&lt;ref name=Bateman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bateman|first=BL|author2=Abell-Davis SE |author3=Johnson CN |title=Climate-driven variation in food availability between the core and range edge of the endangered northern betting (''Bettongia tropica'')|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|year=2011|volume=59|pages=177–185|doi=10.1071/zo11079}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moisture]] of [[soil]] or [[air]] is also seen to limit range expansion. In terms of soil moisture, limited range expansion for species that forage on soil organisms or for species that reside in soil and rely on it for [[nutrients]] are seen.&lt;ref name=Duckworth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duckworth|first=G|author2=Altwegg R |author3=Guo D |title=Soil moisture limits foraging: a possible mechanism for the range dynamics of the hadeda ibis in southern africa|journal=Diversity and Distributions|year=2010|volume=16|pages=765–772|doi=10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00683.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; If moisture requirements are not met beyond the species range, they will not be able to expand due to resulting reductions in [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. There are many other abiotic factors that can determine a species range, including [[dissolved oxygen]], [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] cover, [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], [[alkalinity]] and [[pH]].&lt;ref name=Neff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neff|first=MR|author2=Jackson DA|title=Effects of broad-scale geological changes on patterns in macroinvertebrate assemblages|journal=Am. Benthol. Soc.|year=2011|volume=30|issue=2|pages=459–473|doi=10.1899/10-052.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotic factors==
[[File:Spitzschlammschnecke.jpg|thumbnail|The freshwater gastropod ''[[Lymnaea stagnalis]]'' was found to have the highest occurrence of trematode parasites at the range edge compared to the core.]]

Interactions between species can cause limitations to a species geographic range. The most obvious interaction that limits range expansion is [[predation]], where [[prey]] species do not move beyond their range to avoid predator attack and [[Death|mortality]].&lt;ref name=Holt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt|first=RD|author2=Barfield M|title=Trophic interactions and range limits: the diverse roles of predation|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|year=2009|volume=276|pages=1435–1442|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.1536|pmc=2677217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographic range edges can also be determined by [[competition]], where less competitive species are forced into suboptimal conditions within the range to avoid [[Stress (biology)|stress]] of reduced food and [[habitat]].&lt;ref name=Holt /&gt; The geographic range of one species may be linked to another, where the range of one species cannot extend independent of the other. This is seen in [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationships, where fitness and population growth are reduced outside of the [[Host (biology)|hosts]] range where the [[symbiont]] is not present.&lt;ref name=Stanton-Geddes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton-Geddes|first=J|author2=Anderson C|title=Does a facultative mutualism limit species expansion?|journal=Oecologia|year=2011|volume=167|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/s00442-011-1958-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parasitism]] can also play a role in limiting the expansion of species outside of their range. This occurs when there is a higher presence of [[infection]] at the range edges that reduces population growth and survivorship and ultimately reduces further expansion.&lt;ref name=Briers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Briers|first=R|title=Range limits and parasite prevalence in a freshwater snail|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|year=2003|volume=270|pages=178–180|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0046|pmc=1809944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher parasite presence can occur when abiotic conditions are unfavorable at the edge, leading to lower resistance of species to the infection.&lt;ref name=Briers /&gt;

==Anthropogenic factors==

Humans are responsible for causing changes to the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and habitat that [[plants]] and [[animals]] rely on for survival. These impacts have the potential to alter species [[behaviours]], interactions and distributions. Many areas are [[deforested]] in order to provide land for [[agriculture]] or [[Industry|industrial]] use. Deforestation can cause loss of habitat for millions of species and can cause expansion or contraction of their geographic range.&lt;ref name=Kostecke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kostecke|first=RM|author2=Ellison K |author3=Summers SG |title=Continued range expansion by bronzed cowbirds in the southwestern united states|journal=The southwestern naturalist|year=2004|volume=49|issue=4|pages=487–492|doi=10.1894/0038-4909(2004)049&lt;0487:crebbc&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For species that require deforested land, they may expand  in their range to take advantage of new habitat, however for species that require forest for survival their geographic range may decrease or change completely.  the 
Global warming resulting from [[green house gases]] emitted into the air has been seen to cause changes in species dispersal and geographic distribution.&lt;ref name=Crozier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crozier|first=L|title=Warmer winters drive butterfly range expansion by increasing survivorship|journal=Ecology|year=2004|volume=85|issue=1|pages=231–241|doi=10.1890/02-0607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rising temperatures, organisms move northward to reach slightly colder temperatures to track the environmental [[Ecological niche|niche]] they are adapted to.&lt;ref name=Crozier /&gt; This allows them to continue stable survival and reproduction and ultimately sustain their population. Humans have also initiated many range expansions by transporting species to new locations both [[intentionally]] and [[accidentally]].&lt;ref name=McNeil&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNeil|first=JN|author2=Duchesne R|title=Transport of hay and its importance in the passive dispersal of the European skipper, Thymelicus lineola (Lepidoptera:Hesperiidae)|journal=Can. Ent.|year=1977|volume=109|pages=1253–1256|doi=10.4039/ent1091253-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[introduced species]] can survive and reproduce in these new locations and expand their geographic range as long as conditions are suitable. These species may also cause changes in the geographic range of [[native species]] that cannot tolerate competition from [[invasive species]], who possess [[novel]] ways of using [[resources]].&lt;ref name=McNeil /&gt;

==Genetic factors==
[[File:Mangrove-leaves-nz.jpg|thumbnail|Comparative analysis of core and edge populations of the mangrove ''[[Avicennia marina]]'' found reduced genetic diversity in edge populations.]]

Studies of the [[Genetics|genetic]] influences on geographic range limits tend to focus on genetic effects that restrict peripheral populations from expanding beyond their range edge. Many [[hypotheses]] have been proposed, however there has not been a general consensus on one main cause. Most hypotheses stem from the fact that peripheral populations are expected to be small, due to less optimal conditions at the edge.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=JH|title=On the relationship between abundance and distribution of species|journal=The American Naturalist|year=1984|volume=124|pages=255–279|doi=10.1086/284267}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis predicts that due to smaller [[population size]] at the edge, [[genetic drift]] will have a larger effect and reduce [[genetic variation]] of edge populations.&lt;ref name=Dai&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dai|first=Q|author2=Fu JZ|title=When central populations exhibit more genetic diversity than peripheral populations: a simulation study|journal=Chinese Sci Bull|year=2011|volume=56|issue=24|pages=2531–2540|doi=10.1007/s11434-011-4605-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; With less genetic variation, populations at the edge may have difficulty adapting to changing conditions.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt; Another hypothesis predicts that high [[selection pressure]] at the peripheral edge will only allow for a few [[genotypes]] to survive, decreasing genetic variation and future adaptation.&lt;ref name=Dai /&gt; Reduced [[gene flow]] between central and peripheral populations has also been hypothesized as a limitation for species expansion. Without introduction of new [[alleles]] from central to edge populations, genetic variation will remain low and peripheral populations will have difficulty adapting to new conditions.&lt;ref name=Dai /&gt; Contrary to this, some hypothesize that gene flow between central and peripheral populations can prevent range expansion, where gene flow causes contamination of the edge [[gene pool]].&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=M|author2=Barton NH|title=Evolution of a species' range|journal=American Naturalist|year=1997|volume=150|pages=1–23|doi=10.1086/286054}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions at the center of the range differ from those at the periphery; therefore adapted alleles at the center may not benefit those at the edge who experience different conditions.&lt;ref name=Kirk /&gt; The [[Allee effect]] has also been proposed to reduce range expansion, where small population sizes lead to reduced [[cooperation]] and survival.&lt;ref name=allee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allee|first=WC|author2=Bowen E|title=Studies in animal aggregations: mass protection against colloidal silver among goldfishes|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|year=1932|volume=61|issue=2|pages=185–207|doi=10.1002/jez.1400610202}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many potential causes of the allee effect, including mate-finding failure or [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref name=tobin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tobin|first=PC|author2=Robinet C |author3=Jhonson DM |author4=Whitmire SL |author5=Bjornstad ON |author6=Leibhold AM |title=The role of Allee effects in gypsy moth, ''Lymnatria dispar'' (L.), invasions|journal=Popul Ecol|year=2009|volume=51|pages=373–384 |doi=10.1007/s10144-009-0144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low densities, the challenge for [[males]] and [[females]] to locate each other is much larger, leading to decreased reproduction and survival.&lt;ref name=tobin /&gt; Small population sizes may also cause species to mate with their relatives, increasing chances of [[lethal alleles]] within the population and decreasing survival.&lt;ref name=tobin /&gt;

==Combined influences==
[[File:Scarabaeus viettei 01.jpg|thumbnail|Deforestation leads to dry conditions within the soil, causing the dung beetle to migrate northward into areas of higher moisture.]]

In most cases, combinations of factors are responsible for limiting the geographic range edge of species. Abiotic and [[biotic component|biotic]] factors may work as co-factors in determining the ability of species to expand their range. This is found in [[obligate seeder]] plants, who require [[fire]] to activate their [[seedbank|seed bank]] and produce [[seeds]], and require mediated [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] of seeds by other species to expand their range.&lt;ref name=Arnan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnan|first=X|author2=Rodrigo A |author3=Molowny-Horas R |author4=Retana J |title=Ant-mediated expansion of an obligate seeder species during the first years after fire|journal=Plant Biology|year=2010|volume=12|issue=|pages=842–852|doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.2009.00294.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be seen in species that share an overlapping range, where competition for food and habitat determines where each species resides.&lt;ref name=Hersteinsson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hersteinsson|first=P|author2=Macdonald W|title=Interspecific competition and the geographical distribution of red and arctic foxes Vulpes vulpes and Alopex Lagopus|journal=Oikos|year=1992|volume=64|pages=505–515|doi=10.2307/3545168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abiotic and anthropogenic factors can be found to work together to limit a species range. Deforestation can result in [[climate change]], where reduced protection from [[sun]] blocking [[tree]] cover causes forest [[soils]] to lose [[moisture]] and dry out.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=TH|title=Upslope range shifts of Andean dung beetles in response to deforestation: compounding and onfounding effects of microclimactic change|journal=Biotropica|year=2012|volume=44|issue=1|pages=82–89|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2011.00768.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species that live in soil or [[forage]] on soil living species require moisture for survival, therefore changes in their geographical distribution may occur if these conditions are not met.&lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt; Genetic factors can interplay with abiotic and or biotic factors as determinants of a species range, where unfavorable conditions can reduce fitness and survival of species, limiting their distribution.&lt;ref name=Stanton2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton-Geddes|first=J|author2=Tiffin P |author3=Shaw RG |title=Role of climate and competitors in limiting fitness across range edges of an annual plant|journal=Ecology|year=2012|volume=93|issue=7|pages=1604–1613|doi=10.1890/11-1701.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''glazier''' is a [[skilled tradesman]] responsible for cutting, installing, and removing [[glass]] (and materials used as substitutes for glass, such as some [[plastics]]).&lt;ref name="Oakes"&gt;Elizabeth H. Oakes, ''Ferguson Career Resource Guide to Apprenticeship Programs'' ([[Infobase Publishing|Infobase]]: 3d ed., 2006), p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Glaziers may work with glass in various surfaces and settings, such as [[window]]s, [[door]]s, [[shower door]]s, [[skylight]]s, [[storefront]]s, [[display case]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[facade]]s, [[interior wall]]s, [[ceiling]]s, and [[Table (furniture)|tabletops]].&lt;ref name="Oakes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OES"&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes472121.htm Glaziers] (profile in the [[Occupational Employment Statistics]] of the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties and tools==
[[File:Glazier tools.JPG|thumb|A set of glazier tools]]

The ''[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]]'' of the U.S. Department of Labor lists the following as typical tasks for a glazier:&lt;ref name="OOH"&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/print/glaziers.htm Glaziers], ''[[Occupational Outlook Handbook]]'', United States Department of Labor.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Follow [[blueprint]]s or specifications
*Remove any old or broken glass before installing replacement glass
*Cut glass to the specified size and shape
*Make or install sashes or moldings for glass installation
*Fasten glass into sashes or frames with clips, moldings, or other types of fasteners
*Add weather seal or putty around pane edges to seal joints.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The National Occupational Analysis recognized by the [[Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship]] separates the trade into 5 blocks of skills, each with a list of skills, and a list of tasks and subtasks a journeyman is expected to be able to accomplish:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.red-seal.ca/trades/glaziers/2012n.4.1_.1ppf_tpc-eng.html|title=Red Seal : Appendix F – Task Profile Chart|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.red-seal.ca|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tools used by glaziers "include cutting boards, glass-cutting blades, straightedges, glazing knives, saws, drills, grinders, putty,scrapers, sandpaper, sanding blocks, 5 in 1's respirator/dust mask and glazing compounds."&lt;ref name="Oakes" /&gt;

Some glaziers work specifically with [[car glass|glass in motor vehicles]]; other work specifically with the [[safety glass]] used in aircraft. Others repair old antique windows and doors that need glass replaced.&lt;ref name="Oakes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OOH"/&gt;

==Education and training==
Glaziers are typically educated at the [[high school diploma]] or [[General Educational Development|equivalent]] level and learn the skills of the trade through an [[apprenticeship]] program, which in the U.S. is typically four years.&lt;ref name="OOH"/&gt;

In the U.S., apprenticeship programs are offered through the [[National Glass Association]] as well as [[trade association]]s and local contractors' associations. [[Construction industry|Construction-industry]] glaziers are frequently members of the [[International Union of Painters and Allied Trades]].&lt;ref name="Oakes"/&gt;

In [[Ontario|Ontario, Canada]], apprenticeships are offered at the provincial level and certified through the [[Ontario College of Trades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtglass.com/oifsc-student-visit/|title=OIFSC - Student Visit - M&amp;T Glass|date=6 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other provinces manage their own apprenticeship programs.

The Trade of Glazier is a designated [[Interprovincial Standards|Red Seal Trade]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.red-seal.ca/trades/gl.1z.3.2r-eng.html|title=Red Seal : Glazier|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.red-seal.ca|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occupational hazards==
[[Occupational hazard]]s encountered by glaziers include the risks of being cut by glass or tools and falling from [[scaffold]]s or [[ladder]]s or lead exposure from old lead paint on  antique windows.&lt;ref name="Oakes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OOH"/&gt; The use of heavy equipment may also cause injury: the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) reported in 1990 that a [[journeyman]] glazier died in an [[industrial accident]] in Indiana after attempting to use a [[manlift]] to carry a thousand-pound case of glass which the manlift did not have capacity to carry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/In-house/full9011.html Journeyman glazier dies after being catapulted from manlift - Indiana], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (April 1990, 1-7), NIOSHTIC No. 20024470.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
According to the ''Occupational Outlook Handbook'', there are some 45,300 glaziers in the United States, with median pay of $38,410 per year in 2014.&lt;ref name="OOH"/&gt; Two-thirds of Glaziers work in the foundation, structure, and building exterior contractors industry, with smaller numbers working in building material and supplies dealing, building finishing contracting, [[automotive repair]] and maintenance, and glass and glass product manufacturing.&lt;ref name="OES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OOH"/&gt;

Among the 50 [[U.S. states|states]], only [[Connecticut]] and [[Florida]] require glaziers to hold a [[Occupational licensing|license]].&lt;ref name="OOH"/&gt;

'''Heerema Marine Contractors''' (HMC) is a contractor headquartered in the Netherlands most notable for operation of three of the largest [[crane vessel]]s in the offshore industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hmc.heerema.com/| title=Heerema Marine Contractors| publisher=| accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:HeeremaLeiden2017.jpg|thumb|Current Heerema building (Leiden)]]
Heerema Marine Contractors was formed in 1948 as a small construction company providing oilfield platforms in [[Venezuela]].

In the 1960s the company focused on the North Sea offshore developments. The company developed crane vessels to lift large offshore platforms and modules. The ship shaped crane vessel ''Challenger'' was equipped to lift 800 t.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hmc.heerema.com/About/History/tabid/244/language/nl-NL/Default.aspx |title=History |publisher=Heerema Marine Contractors |accessdate=13 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711162255/http://hmc.heerema.com/About/History/tabid/244/language/nl-NL/Default.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for large stable crane vessels to operate in the North Sea environment lead the company to develop the first large [[semi-submersible]] crane vessels. In 1978, HMC commissioned [[Mitsui]] to construct the two sister semi-submersible crane vessels, {{ship|DCV|Balder}} and [[Hermod (ship)|SSCV ''Hermod'']]. These vessel could lift 5,400 tonnes with the twin cranes, and were later upgraded to 8,200 tonnes.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1988 HMC formed a joint venture with [[McDermott International|McDermott]] called HeereMac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/features/fex80557.htm| title=J. Ray McDermott ends HeereMac joint venture| publisher=Alexander's Gas &amp; Oil Connections| date=28 January 1998| accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SSCVThialf.jpg|thumb|"Thialf" in a Norway fjord]]
The {{ship|SSCV|Thialf}} was added to the Heeremac fleet, and upon the split of the companies in December 1997, Heerema took ownership of the ''Thialf'', the largest deep water construction vessel and is capable of a tandem lift of 14,200 t (15,600 short tons)

The {{ship|DCV|Balder}} was affected by a flooding incident in 2006 and was put out of service for a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oilpubs.com/oso/article.asp?v1=5979| title=DCV Balder to re-start work in Gulf of Mexico in February| date=12 January 2007| publisher=| accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23453">The [[fair trade]] movement has undergone several important changes since its early days following [[World War II]]. Fair trade, first seen as a form of charity advocated by religious organizations, has radically changed in structure, philosophy and approach. The past fifty years have witnessed massive changes in the diversity of fair trade proponents, the products traded and their distribution networks.

==The origins of fair trade==

Fair trade principles have deep roots in European societies long before the first structured [[alternative trading organization]]s (ATOs) emerged following World War II. Many of the fundamental concepts behind fair trade actually show a great resemblance with pre-capitalist ideas about the organization of the economy and society.

The notion of the ‘old moral economy’ is a fitting example of such conceptions. [[E. P. Thompson]], in his  work on 18th century England, described a society where "notions of common well being, often supported by paternalistic traditional authorities, imposed some limits on the free operations of the market".&lt;ref name="Fridell, Gavin 2003"&gt;Fridell, Gavin (2003). ''Fair Trade and the International Moral Economy: Within and Against the Market.'' CERLAC Working Paper Series.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers were then not allowed to manipulate prices by withholding their products to wait for price increases. The actions of the middlemen were always considered legally suspect, were severely restricted and the poor were provided opportunities to buy staple foods in small parcels. Fair trade was already seen as a way to address market failures; although the concept mainly revolved around consumer, rather than producer, rights.&lt;ref name="Fridell, Gavin 2003"/&gt;

In 1827 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], a moral and economic [[boycott]] of slave-derived goods began with the formation of the "Free Produce Society", founded by [[Thomas M'Clintock]] and other [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). In the [[Free produce movement]], they sought to fight against slavery with a new tactic, one that emphasized the value of the honest labor of free men and women, and to try to determine the unseen added costs to goods such as cotton and sugar which came from the toil of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxN8GXEKspQC&amp;pg=PA266 ''Freedom's Prophet: Bishop Richard Allen, the AME Church, and the Black Founding Fathers''], NYU Press, 2008, p. 266. {{ISBN|0-8147-5826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, African Americans formed the "Colored Free Produce Society", and women formed their own branch in 1831. In 1838, supporters from a number of states came together in the American Free Produce Association, which promoted their cause by seeking non-slave alternates to products from slaveholders, forming non-slave distribution channels, and publishing a number of pamphlets, tracts, and the journal ''Non-Slaveholder''. The movement did not grow large enough to gain the benefit of the [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]], and the cost of "free produce" was always higher than competing goods. The national association disbanded in 1847, but Quakers in Philadelphia continued until 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, Peter and McKivigan, John, editors. Williams, R. Owen, assistant editor. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_SeZrcBqt-YC&amp;pg=PA267 ''Encyclopedia of antislavery and abolition''], Greenwood Press, 2007, pp. 267–268. {{ISBN|0-313-33142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Havelaar 9e druk.jpg|right|thumb|Front cover of ''Max Havelaar'', 9th edition (1891).]]
There have been a few instances in which fair trade in the 'old moral economy' was focused on producer rights: as early as 1859, Dutch author [[Multatuli]] (the pen name of Eduard Douwes Dekker) questioned the injustice of the colonial and capitalist system towards commodity producers in his novel ''[[Max Havelaar]]''. The fictional tale recounts the story of Max Havelaar, a Nederlandse Trade Company employee, who leaves everything to work in solidarity with local Indonesian workers. This account draws a direct correlation between the wealth and the prosperity of Europe and the poverty of the suffering of other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement. International Labor Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early fair trade initiatives==

In 1897 [[The Salvation Army]] launched the [[Hamodava]] Tea Company. Hamodava pioneered a fair trade model which sought to pay fair prices to the tea farmers, whilst also offering a scheme by which they could purchase plantation land on a co-operative giving them financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz/our-community/faith-in-life/our-people-our-stories/the-social-cup|title=The social cup|website=www.salvationarmy.org.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fair trade movement was shaped in the years following [[World War II]]. Early attempts to commercialize in Northern markets goods produced by marginalised producers were initiated by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).

The [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml Crafts and Food]. Accessed August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The products, almost exclusively [[handicrafts]] ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold by volunteers in 'charity stores' or 'ethnic shops'. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Hockerts, K. (2005). [http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf The Fair Trade Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071706/http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf |date=2006-08-23 }}. p1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solidarity trade==
[[File:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb|left|Fair Trade goods sold in Worldshops]]
The modern fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against [[neo-imperialism]]: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The global free market economic model came under attack during that period and fair trade ideals, built on a [[Post Keynesian economics]] approach to economies where price is directly linked to the actual production costs and where all producers are given fair and equal access to the markets, gained in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p4&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan at the time, "Trade not Aid", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the [[developing world]].&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history2.shtml Where did it all begin?] URL accessed on August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the first ATO was created: British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched "[[Helping-by-Selling]]", a program which later developed into [[Bridge (program)|Bridge]]. The scheme sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the [[United Kingdom]] and from mail-order catalogues with a circulation of almost 100,000 copies. The program was created to support the work of [[cooperative]]s and community enterprises in the developing world. The program was highly successful: it remained one of the largest and most influential in the sector and then changed in 2002 as more mainstream retailers were persuaded to carry fair trade products. Globally Oxfam still works in many countries on fair trade programs and runs hundreds of shops across Europe and Australia selling and promoting fair trade goods.

In 1969, the first Worldshop opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods such as handcrafts produced under fair trade terms in "underdeveloped regions". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and in other Western European countries.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from [[Angola]] and [[Nicaragua]] in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world’s market, and you support their self-determined sustainable development. The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then at least in terms of dozens of ATOs being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Julius Nyerere]] and the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]]: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world’s markets and consumers.

==Handcrafts vs. agricultural goods==
In the early 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced a major challenge: the novelty of some fair trade products started wearing off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look "tired and old fashioned" in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Redfern A. 2002 p6"&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p6&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, fair trade supporters during this period became increasingly worried by the impact of the fall of agricultural [[commodity]] prices on poor producers. Many then believed it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and to find innovative remedies to address the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations the perfect substitute to the stagnating handicrafts market. The collapse of the [[International Coffee Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/business/coffee-price-talks-foreseen.html |title=Coffee Price Talks Foreseen - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989 fueled the extraordinary growth of the [[fair trade coffee]] market, providing a powerful narrative for a new breed of fair trade brand that engaged producers directly in consumer operations. Cafédirect is a good example of this new thinking and was the first fair trade brand to be found in UK supermarkets. Dedicated to the mainstream, Cafédirect created focused on consumer engagement and language and built a reputation for quality, justifying its premium positioning with the tag-line "We pay more, so you get the pick of the crop".

The first fair trade agricultural products were [[coffee]] and [[tea]], quickly followed by dried [[fruits]], cocoa, sugar, [[fruit juices]], [[rice]], [[spices]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Coffee quickly became the main growth engine behind fair trade: between 25 and 50% of the total alternative trading organization turnover in 2005 came from coffee sales.&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history4.shtml Market Access and Fair Trade Labeling]. URL accessed on August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm in 1992, in 2002 handcrafts accounted for 25.4% of sales while commodity food lines were up at 69.4%.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. &amp; Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to agricultural commodities was further highlighted in 2002, when Oxfam decided to abandon its loss-making handcrafts trading program after 27 years of existence. Oxfam’s move had significant consequences on the entire fair trade movement. Some ATOs saw this as an opportunity to restructure and partner up with mainstream businesses in an effort to find economic efficiencies and broaden their appeal, while others (such as Alternativ Handel in [[Norway]]), unable to adjust to the market and plagued by financial difficulties, were forced to close.

Today, many ATOs still exclusively sell handcrafts - which they judge culturally and economically preferable to agricultural commodities. While these are still considered fair trade flagship products, academics have described them as a [[niche market]] that now only appeals to relatively small segments of the population, mostly fair trade core supporters who buy products on the basis of the story behind the product.&lt;ref name="Redfern A. 2002 p6"/&gt;

==Rise of labelling initiatives==
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to product labelling''
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]] --&gt;&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Oldftlogos2.jpg for rationale --&gt;Sales of fair trade products however only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade labelling]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small Worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, [[North America]]. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, M.-C., (2003). Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions. Journal of Rural Studies, 19, 87-96.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade label, Max Havelaar, was launched under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans van der Hoff]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[ecumenical]] [[development agency]] [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the [[worldshops]] and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p7&lt;/ref&gt;

On the producer end, the Max Havelaar initiative offered disadvantaged producers following various social and environmental standards a fair price, significantly above the market price, for their crop. The coffee, originating from the [[UCIRI]] cooperative in Mexico, was imported by Dutch company [[Van Weely]], roasted by [[Neuteboom]], sold directly to [[world shops]] and, for the first time, to mainstream retailers across the [[Netherlands]].

The initiative was groundbreaking as for the first time Fairtrade coffee was sold in supermarkets and mass-retailers, therefore reaching a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labelling also allowed consumers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the farmers at the end of the [[supply chain]].
The initiative was a great success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called "Max Havelaar" (in [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[France]]), "Transfair" (in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Italy]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]]), or carrying a national name: "Fairtrade  Mark" in the UK and [[Ireland]], "Rättvisemärkt" in [[Sweden]], and "Reilu Kauppa" in [[Finland]].

|}Initially, the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs each had their own Fairtrade standards, product committees and monitoring systems. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives") – started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.

The Fairtrade Certification Mark harmonization process is still under way – today, all but two labelling initiatives ([[Transfair USA]] &amp; [[TransFair Canada]]) have adopted the new International Fairtrade Certification Mark. Full transition to the new Fairtrade Mark should become reality as it gradually replaces the old certification marks at various speeds in various countries.

In January 2004, FLO was divided into two independent organizations: [[FLO International]], which sets Fairtrade standards and provides producer business support, and [[FLO-CERT]], which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.

At present, over 20 Labelling Initiatives are members of FLO International. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO’s certification for [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mangoes]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juices]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herbs]] and [[spices]], [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]] etc.

== WFTO and the FTO Mark ==
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade certification system and allow for example handcraft producers to also sell their products outside [[worldshops]], the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), formerly the International Fair Trade Association (founded 1989), launched a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations in 2004 (as opposed to products in the case of Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and guarantees that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour and the environment.

The FTO Mark gave for the first time Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable recognition amongst consumers, existing and new business partners, governments and donors.

==Fair trade today==
Global fair trade sales have soared over the past decade. The increase has been particularly spectacular among Fairtrade labelled goods:  In 2007, [[Fairtrade certification|Fair trade certified]] sales amounted to approximately €2.3 billion (US $3.62 billion) worldwide, a 47% year-to-year increase.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2008). http://www.fairtrade.net/single_view.html?&amp;cHash=d6f2e27d2c&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=104&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=41.

'''Institutional model theory''' generalizes a large portion of [[first-order logic|first-order]] [[model theory]] to an arbitrary [[logical system]].

== Overview ==
The notion of "logical system" here is formalized as an [[Institution (computer science)|institution]]. Institutions constitute a model-oriented meta-theory on logical systems similar to how the theory of [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s and [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s constitute a meta-theory for classical [[linear algebra]]. Another analogy can be made with [[universal algebra]] versus [[Group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s etc. By abstracting away from the realities of the actual conventional logics, it can be noticed that institution theory comes in fact closer to the realities of non-conventional logics.

Institutional model theory analyzes and generalizes classical model-theoretic notions and results, like

* Elementary diagrams
* [[Elementary embedding]]s
* [[Ultraproduct]]s, [[Los' theorem]]
* [[Saturated model]]s
* [[Axiomatizable class|axiomatizability]]
* [[Variety (universal algebra)|Varieties]], [[Garrett Birkhoff|Birkhoff]] axiomatizability
* [[Craig interpolation]]
* [[Robinson's joint consistency theorem|Robinson consistency]]
* [[Evert Willem Beth|Beth]] definability
* [[Gödel]]'s [[completeness theorem]]

For each concept and theorem, the infrastructure and properties required are analyzed and formulated as conditions on institutions, thus providing a detailed insight on which properties of first-order logic they rely and how much they can be generalized to other logics.

'''Promundo''' is a [[Brazil]]ian-based, non-governmental organization with offices in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, [[Goma]], Democratic Republic of the Congo, and [[Washington, DC]], USA, that work in collaboration to promote caring, non-violent and equitable [[masculinities]] and gender relations in Brazil and internationally. Promundo's work engages women, girls, boys and men; strives to transform [[gender norms]] and power relations within key institutions; and is based on building local and international partnerships.  It is an [[applied research]] institute that works to test, evaluate and advocate for policies and programs that transform masculinities.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Founded in 1997, Promundo was born out of frustration with the prevailing discourses about [[gender equality]] and efforts to put those discourses into action, practice and [[policy]]. The institute has concentrated on developing evaluated interventions and advocacy strategies to achieve gender equality with a focus on engaging men and boys in changing inequitable and violent forms of masculinities.
 
Promundo works locally, nationally, and internationally to:
*Conduct research to build the knowledge base on masculinities and gender equality;
*Develop, evaluate and scale up gender transformative interventions and policies;
*Carry out national and international advocacy to achieve gender equality and social justice.

Promundo designs, implements, and evaluates its research and evidence-based programs in close partnership with local, not-for-profit [[Civil society|Civil Society Organizations]]. In recent years, Promundo has been increasingly recognized for promoting the role of men and boys in achieving gender equality. Most recently, Promundo expanded its presence to Washington, DC, to support the organization’s international communication, advocacy and technical assistance, which include the coordination of the [http://www.menengage.org/ MenEngage Alliance], a global network of NGOs and UN partners working to engage men and boys in gender equality, of which Promundo was a co-founder.

==Main Programs and Activities==

===Program H===
In 1999 Promundo, together with [http://www.ecos.org.br/index2.asp ECOS Comunicação em Sexualidade] ([[São Paulo]], Brazil), [http://www.papai.org.br/ Instituto Papai] ([[Recife]], Brazil), and [http://www.saludygenero.org.mx/ Salud y Género] ([[Mexico]]), with support from the [[Pan American Health Organization|Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)]], the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]], [http://www.ippfwhr.org/ International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region (IPPF/WHR)], [http://www.johnsnow.com.br/ JohnSnowBrasil] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110804001045/http://www.rb.com/home Durex – SSL International] developed the Program H (H for {{lang-pt|Homens}} and {{lang-es|Hombres}}, the words for Men).&lt;ref name="Programs H and M"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/OPASINGLES_WEB.pdf | title=Program H and Program M: Engaging Young Men and Empowering Young Women to Promote Gender Equality and Health | publisher=Promundo | date=October 2010 | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material was born in part of extensive community-based research, including the study ''Dying to be Men: Youth, Masculinity and Social Exclusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dying To Be Men: Youth, Masculinity and Social Exclusion |last=Barker |first=Gary Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Abingdon, New York |isbn=0-415-33774-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Program H seeks to engage young men and their communities in critical reflections about rigid norms related to manhood.  It includes group educational activities, community campaigns, and an innovative evaluation model, called Gender-Equitable Men or GEM scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/en/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Evolving-Men-IMAGES-1.pdf | first1=Gary | last1=Barker | authorlink= | first2= | last2=et alii | title=Evolving Men: Initial Results from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) | edição= | place=Washington, D.C. and Rio de Janeiro | publisher=International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and Instituto Promundo | editor= | year=2011 | pages= | volume= | page= | chapter= | isbn= | accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for assessing the program’s impact on gender-related attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pulerwitz | first1=Julie | last2=Barker | first2=Gary | date=April 2008 | title=Measuring Attitudes toward Gender Norms among Young Men in Brazil: Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the GEM Scale | journal=Men and Masculinities | volume=10 | issue=3 | pages=322–338 | publisher=Sage Publications | doi= 10.1177/1097184x06298778| url=http://promundo.org.br/en/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/04.pdf | issn=1097-184X | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was subjected to quasi-experimental impact evaluation studies in Brazil, [[India]], [[Balkans|the Balkans]] and several settings in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barker | first1=Gary | authorlink= | last2=Ricardo | first2=Christine | date=June 2005 | title=Young Men and the Construction of Masculinity in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for HIV/AIDS, Conflict, and Violence | journal=Social Development Papers | volume= | issue=26 | pages= | publisher=The World Bank | place=Washington, D.C. | issn= | url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/06/23/000012009_20050623134235/Rendered/PDF/327120rev0PAPER0AFR0young0men0WP26.pdf | accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found to lead to significant changes in attitudes among young men, in addition to self-reported increases in condom use, increased in couple communication and reductions in men’s reports of use of violence against female partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOTzpHXgIo4C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=sandy+ruxton+gender+equality+and+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c5aLKM6qfY&amp;sig=b3t-zZil6dns-NxN-TYjtdssfwo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6nioTq2hMI7NtgehhcEM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | first1=Gary | last1=Barker |authorlink= | first2= | last2=et alii | title=Gender Equality and Men: Learning from Practice | place=Oxford | publisher=Oxfam | editor1-first=Sandy | editor1-last=Ruxton | year=2004 | pages=147–161 | chapter=How Do We Know If We Have Changed?

===Program M===
In 1999 Promundo in partnership with [http://www.ecos.org.br/index2.asp Ecos] (São Paulo), Instituto Papai (Recife), Salud y Género (Mexico) and [http://www.worlded.org/WEIInternet/ World Education] (United States), with the support of the [http://www.oakfnd.org/ Oak Foundation], the [http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.3599935/k.1648/John_D__Catherine_T_MacArthur_Foundation.htm MacArthur Foundation], the [http://www.nikefoundation.org/ Nike Foundation] and the [http://www.sepm.gov.br/ Brazilian Secretariat for Women’s Policies] developed Program M (M for {{lang-pt|Mulheres}} and {{lang-es|Mujeres}}, the words for Women).&lt;ref name="Programs H and M"/&gt;

Program M seeks to promote the health and empowerment of young women through critical reflections about gender, rights and health. It consists of educational workshops, community campaigns and innovative evaluation instruments for assessing the program’s impact on young women’s gender-related attitudes and perceived self-efficacy in interpersonal relationships.

===White Ribbon Campaign===
In 2000 Promundo, Instituto Papai and other partner organizations launched the [[White Ribbon Campaign]] in Brazil. Promundo also works together [http://www.noos.org.br/portal/index.php Instituto Noos] and the [http://www.rj.gov.br/web/guest;jsessionid=9E5B7AACE66D1FBCB1A9B1E678098122.lportal3 State Government of Rio de Janeiro] to start one of Brazil’s first batterer intervention programs, which eventually inspired the Brazilian Federal Government to implement such programs in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people= | date=October 22, 2011 |title=A cada hora, cem mulheres são agredidas | url=http://www.band.com.br/jornaldaband/conteudo.asp?ID=100000463790 |format= |medium=Television production |language=Portuguese |trans-title=| publisher=Jornal da Band | location=Rio de Janeiro, Brazil | accessdate=November 7, 2011 | time= | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Against Homophobia===
Because attitudes towards homophobia showed the least amount of attitude change in the study impact evaluation in Brazil, in 2005 Promundo, Ecos, Salud y Género, Papai and the other Program H partners, with support from the [http://www.aids.gov.br/ Brazilian National AIDS Programme], developed a cartoon video called ''Afraid of What?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=2005 |title=Medo de quê? |url=http://www.promundo.org.br/audiovisuais/para-jovens-e-adultos/dvd-medo-de-que/ |format=VHS, DVD |medium=cartoon |language= |trans-title=Afraid of What? |publisher=Promundo |location=Brazil |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007172851/http://www.promundo.org.br/audiovisuais/para-jovens-e-adultos/dvd-medo-de-que/|archivedate=2010-10-07|accessdate=July 22, 2011 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |dead-url=yes|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a complementary educational tool focusing specifically on the issue of homophobia, and targeting mostly heterosexual youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Guia-medo-dvd-ingles.pdf | title=Afraid of What? | publisher=Promundo | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Symposium on Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality===
Between March 30 and April 3, 2009, Promundo and partners co-hosted the ''Global Symposium on Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality'' in Rio de Janeiro. The event brought together 439 activists, researchers, and practitioners from 77 countries to share their experiences in challenging rigid gender norms and engaging men and boys in: reducing violence against women and girls; promoting sexual and reproductive health; HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; and fatherhood and care-giving. The event was organized in collaboration with the MenEngage Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=

== Intent content ==
In the reviewed open military doctrine literature intent is a critical component for command and control. The many definitions that exist of intent are mostly similar but the actual intent content differs and is unclear. Intent content can mainly be found as concept descriptions in doctrinal handbooks relating to development or impact usage of intent.&lt;ref name="PMG" /&gt;

The following examples represent United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, United States, and NATO doctrinal view of intent.
* [[British Army]] ''Doctrine'' defines it as "Intent is similar to purpose. A clear intent initiates a force’s purposeful activity. It represents what the commander wants to achieve and why; and binds the force together; it is the principal result of decision-making. It is normally expressed using effects, objectives and desired outcomes....The best intents are clear to subordinates with minimal amplifying detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (2010) Army Doctrine Publication – Operations Shrivenham, |location=UK |publisher=Ministry of Defence |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/41903E11-B6F4-4351-853B-2C1C2839FE1B/0/ADPOperationsDec10.pdf |title=Operations|format=pdf |page=11 |chapter=6 Command of Operations }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swedish Armed Forces – Integrated Dynamic Command and Control (IDC2) (Josefsson 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Josefsson, A. (2007) Ledningskoncept för integrerad dynamisk ledning (IDC2) C2 concept for integrated dynamic command and control. Stockholm: Swedish Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt; define intent to "Intent is a concise formulation of the overall goals and purpose. The focus is to describe operations, restrictions and resource allocation."
* Canadian Forces Joint Publication 5.0 (Chief of the Defence Staff 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;5E-2)&lt;ref&gt;Chief of the Defence Staff (2008) The Canadian Forces Operational Planning Process (OPP) Available at: http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2010/forces/D2-252-500-2008-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "Commander's Intent. This summary should provide the Commander's overall intent and establish the purpose of the plan. It is an important focusing statement for subordinate commanders. (1) Military Objectives. (2) Desired Military End-State. (3) Transition Conditions".
* US Field Manual 5.0 (U.S. Army 2010, para. 2-90)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army (2010) Field Manual 5.0 – The Operations Process U.S. Department of the Army. Available at: https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm5-0.pdf [Accessed January 20, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; constitute the US Army’s view on planning, preparing, executing, and assessing operations. "The commander’s intent is a clear, concise statement of what the force must do and the conditions the force must establish with respect to the enemy, terrain, and civil considerations that represent the desired end state ([[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 3-0|FM&amp;nbsp;3–0]]). The commander's intent succinctly describes what constitutes success for the operation. It includes the operation’s purpose and the conditions that define the end state. It links the mission, concept of operations, and tasks to subordinate units."
* NATO allied Joint publication 1 (AJP-01) (NATO 2010, para. 0538)&lt;ref&gt;NATO (2010) AJP-01 – Allied Joint Doctrine D. Brussels, Belgium: NATO. Available at: http://nsa.nato.int/nsa/zPublic/ap/AJP-01(D).pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; provide the keystone doctrine for the planning, execution and support of Allied joint operations. "The intent defines the end-state in relation to the factors of mission; adversary, operating environment, terrain, forces, time and preparation for future operations. As such, it addresses what results are expected from the operation, how these results might enable transition to future operations, and how, in broad terms, the Commander expects the force to achieve those results. Its focus is on the force as a whole. Additional information on how the force will achieve the desired results is provided only to clarify the Commander's intentions."
* US Joint Publication 3.0 (US Joint Chiefs of Staff 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;IV-25)&lt;ref&gt;US Joint Chiefs of Staff (2010) Joint Publication 3-0 – Joint Operations. March 2010. Available at: https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_0.pdf [Accessed January 20, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; provides the doctrinal foundation and fundamental principles that guide the Armed Forces of the United States in the conduct of joint operations across the range of military operations. "Commander's intent is a clear and concise expression of the purpose of the operation and the military end state." and continues with "It also includes where the commander will accept risk during the operation. The initial intent statement normally contains the purpose and military end state as the initial inputs for the planning process."

In military doctrinal handbooks the identified intent artefacts generally express the initial state and situation, the desired end state and outcome, and how to get to the desired end state. Artefacts describing the initial situation are: own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Artefacts describing the outcome are: purpose, goals, mission, effects and end state. Artefacts describing how to reach the outcome are: concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, risk willing, how results might enable transition to future operations, objectives, transition conditions, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.

Another way to identify intent artefacts is from how people actually communicate intent. Klein (1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;225–29)&lt;ref name="K1998"&gt;Klein (1998, pp. 225–29)&lt;/ref&gt; present the results of information types that is identified in intent communication. The seven information types of intent are according to Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;226):&lt;ref name="K1998" /&gt; (1) Purpose of task which describes why the task is performed, (2) objective of task, presents a picture of the desired outcome, (3) sequence of steps in the plan. Klein identifies this to be a source of problem since too detailed descriptions may limit the subordinates initiative, (4) rationale for plan includes all the information that where present when making the decision, (5) key decisions that may have to be made, i.e. if there is a choice to be made the commander can provide the intent in how he wants it to be conducted, (6) antigoals, describe unwanted outcomes, and (7) constraints and other considerations describes weather and rule of engagement etc.

=== Intent content definition ===
The doctrinal artefacts are mapped into the structure provided by Klein and the resulting seven facets are grouped in: (a) '''Initial Situation''' describing initial situation and state and consists of Kleins rationale for the plan, (b) '''Outcome''' is describing outcomes and consists of Kleins Purpose of task, objective of task, and antigoals, and (c) '''Execution''' that is describing how to reach the outcome and consists of Kleins sequence of steps, key decisions and constraints and other considerations.

Intent is then defined to consist of the following eight facets.
* '''Mission/Goal''' – The purpose of the task (the higher-level goals). It provides the rationale why the missions and task are to be executed. It is a high-level definition of the overall intent and is regularly stated in one sentence following on the form of Who, What, When, Where and Why. A Mission/Goal can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. Mission/Goal belongs to the intent group outcome.
* '''End-State''' – The objective of the task in form of a representation of the desired outcome. The desired outcome is described as a state, e.g. completion of a task, the effects from tasks, or even the execution of tasks over time. The purpose is to provide a picture of the End-State. According to Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;226) in his investigation, the end-state objective was only missing once in the thirty five examined Commander's intent statements. Effect is in this work defined as the physical and/or behavioural state of a system that results from an action, a set of actions, or another effect. The End State is a more detail description of the Mission/Goal statement and can be described in several sentences. An End State can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. End State belongs to the intent group outcome.
* '''Sequence''' – The sequence of steps in the plan – This is the plan that describes what do in general terms such as Courses of Actions and Course of Effects. Sequence belongs to the intent group execution describing how to reach the desired outcome and include concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, how results might enable the transition to future operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.
* '''Initial State''' – The situation that builds the rationale for the plan, what information was available, who was making the decisions, under what time pressure and similar circumstances. Initial State encompass own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Initial State belongs to the intent group initial situation.
* '''Key Decisions''' – The key decisions that may have to be made and guide the commander in how to make choices. Key Decisions belongs to the intent group execution and describes how to reach the desired outcome and encompass how results might enable the transition to future operations, transition conditions and expectations of force usage.
* '''Antigoals''' – Antigoals describe undesired outcomes. Antigoals are meaningful when to clarify alternatives action plans and what the resulting outcome might be. Antigoals are described in the same way as End State with the difference in that antigoals describe the unwanted outcome. In the surveyed doctrinal descriptions of intent, antigoals were not mentioned. Antigoals belong to the intent outcome.
* '''Constraints''' – Constraints and other considerations that should be taken into account and can vary from policy to weather and terrain. Constraints belongs to the intent group execution and encompass risk willing, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.
* An eight facet '''Expressives''' is proposed in Gustavsson et al. (2008d;&lt;ref name="PMG2008d" /&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="PMG2011" /&gt;) to capture the style of organizations and commanders: experience, risk taking, use of power and force, diplomacy; ethics; norms; morale; creativity; and unorthodox behaviour. The use of ''Expressives'' can range from situations where participants (e.g. commanders) express their style to other participants (e.g. subordinates), or by Staff that develop models over the participants (commanders and subordinates) to be used in Course of Action development and war gaming. In both cases ''Expressives'' are a support to better understand the collaboration participants’ capabilities and conduct of operations.

== Intent in command and control ==
=== Commander's intent ===
'''Commander’s intent''' is an intent describing military focused operations and it is a publicly stated description of the end-state as it relates to forces (entities, people) and terrain, the purpose of the operation, and key tasks to accomplish. It is developed by a small group, e.g. staff, and a commander.

Commander's intent (CSI) plays a central role in military decision making and planning. CSI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders to transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commander.
The commander’s intent links the mission and concept of operations. It describes the end state and key tasks that, along with the mission, are the basis for subordinates’ initiative. Commanders may also use the commander’s intent to explain a broader purpose beyond that of the mission statement. The mission and the commander’s intent must be understood two echelons down. (U.S Army 2003, para. 4-27)&lt;ref name="FM6"/&gt;
Pigeau and McCann (2006)&lt;ref name="P2006"&gt;Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2006) Establishing Common Intent: The Key to Co-Ordinated Military Action. In: The Operational Art : Canadian Perspectives : Leadership and Command, 2006, Kingston, Ontario, Canada: Canadian Defence Academy Press, pp. 85–108.&lt;/ref&gt; state that intent is more than an aim or a purpose; they state that Intent contains the aim and purpose together with all implications. Hence, CSI is not only to describe the End-State but also a concise expression of the purpose of the operation. CSI may also include the commander's assessment of the adversary commander's intent and an assessment of where and how much risk is acceptable during the operation. This view is supported by Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;225)&lt;ref&gt;Klein, G. (1998) Sources of Power - How People Make Decisions Cambridge, MA: The Mit Press. {{ISBN|0-262-11227-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
CSI originates from one commander’s mind and is disseminated to the echelons below. CSI rarely gets reviewed and updated. For a short duration mission, such as a deliberate attack, the original statement may remain valid throughout planning. But for longer phases, in order to be agile the CSI might be changing in phase with the unfolding of the situation. Commanders must develop their intent within the bounds of a whole hierarchy of guiding principles that limit the types of solutions that they can entertain (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006).&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt;

=== Common intent ===
'''Common intent''' is an intent that is shared and understood by all participants, i.e. there is no discrepancy between the intent of the participating humans. Common intent is an idealized view of intent.

In today’s operational environment teams need to work together towards a desired End-State. Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"&gt;Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2000) "Redefining Command and Control". In: R. Pigeau and C. McCann, (eds.) ''The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience'', 2000, New York, NY, USA: Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 165–84. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46366-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; define Command and Control: “Command and Control: The establishment of common intent to achieve coordinated action”. Common intent is the combination of explicit intent and implicit intent. Pigeau and McCann (2006)&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; put forward that for a realizable Common Intent there need to be a single shared objective, together with a clear understanding in how that objective can be attained. They continue that Common Intent is an idealized concept where maximum overlap, with minimum scattering, exists between the intent of the commander and the intents of his subordinates. Knowledge known by the commander and his subordinates needs to be shared at all levels, guiding principles, reasoning ability, and to express similar levels of commitment. Intent is then not only something for a commander to disseminate but to exchange and learning the team members’ intent.
Farrell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"&gt;Farrell, P.S.E. and Lichacz, F. (2004) "Measuring Common Intent during Effects Based Planning". In: ''2004 Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium The Power of Information Age Concepts and Technologies''.&lt;/ref&gt; state that common intent describes a socio-psychological phenomenon that seems to be evident amongst a team that achieves a common objective. The CSI is a sort of a one person’s view, but as said in the introduction “every individual have intent of her own” implies that it may not just be enough to disseminate intent amongst staff members and subordinates. A conclusion of the work of Farrell (2006)&lt;ref name="F2006"&gt;Farrell, P.S.E. (2006) "Common Intent and Information Processing Frameworks applied to Effect Based Approaches to Operations". In: 2006, Cambridge, UK: CCRP.&lt;/ref&gt; is that teams with different military and civilian cultures would need that all team members establish a common understanding of the mission objectives and the Commander's intent with respect to their own competencies, authorities, and responsibilities.
Pigeau and McCann (2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;85–108)&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; state that diverse team members need to have a high degree of common intent to perform effectively. In such teams the commander needs to ensure that the intent is perceived and understood by all team members (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2000;&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004;&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006;&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; Farrell 2006&lt;ref name="F2006"/&gt;).
Alberts and Hayes (2007)&lt;ref name="A2007"/&gt; say that in order to allow subordinates’ initiative the operations order focuses on describing the CSI/CI so that flexibility in coordination and collaboration in the dynamic environment is entailed. There is a need for the commander to connect the subordinates’ human potential (reason, opinions, questions, seek information regarding the mission) to align and be a support to the commanders own intent (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;102).&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt;

=== Command intent ===
'''Command intent''' (CI) is a practical view of common intent, meaning that it is not plausible to expect that all individuals during a whole mission in all situations will share the same intent. CI will be developed for specific parts of missions and shared amongst the participants. To establish CI the involvement of all participants is necessary, e.g. compare with football or soccer teams where the overall intent is formalized by coaches in collaboration with the players and where each player knows what the other players’ intentions are.

Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; states that “In reality, it is presumed true that it is impossible to have common intent”. For a specific mission bounded for a certain time an overlap of intent ought to be achievable, e.g. as illustrated by the players in a soccer team where all have individual goals with their lives and families, but on the soccer field they have the common intent to win the game. This means that during the game, and in training and exercises prior to and after the game their common intent is to perform well according to the mission declared by the coach (Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004;&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Farrell 2006;&lt;ref name="F2006"/&gt; Gustavsson et al. 2008d).&lt;ref name="PMG2008d"&gt;Gustavsson, P.M., Hieb, M.R., Niklasson, L., Eriksson, P. and Moore, P. (2008d) "Machine Interpretable Representation of Commander's Intent". In: ''Proceedings of the 13th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium (ICCRTS)''. Bellevue, Washington, USA. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/13th_iccrts_2008/CD/html/papers/188.pdf. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
A workable version of common intent is command intent that is directed for a specific situation, bounded by participating organization, space and time, i.e. for the operation at hand the intent is common but other intent and goals of the participating humans may differ. Much of the coordination can be done locally, i.e. on a lower level, without explicit orders. Brehmer (2009)&lt;ref name="B2009"&gt;Brehmer, B. (2009) "Command without Commanders". In: June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that the higher levels of command will have the time to consider other aspects of the problems facing them. Brehmer continues that there is the loss of combat power inherent in top-down command-directed synchronization. By NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC) as presented by Alberts, Garstka &amp; Stein (1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;87–93)&lt;ref name="AGS1999"/&gt; this is overcome by a high-speed continuum. Brehmer (2009)&lt;ref name="B2009"/&gt; however says that the main responsibility of the commander and his staff is to articulate intent and crafting rules of engagement. For armed forces that have mission command as their principal doctrine this is not a new concept, but Brehmer further envisions that with articulated intent larger units will be able to co-ordinate with other units and conduct the mission without any explicit directions from higher headquarters. Command Intent is then an outline of a plan, objectives to be achieved, responsibilities, linkages and schemas of manoeuvre, and constraints. Establishing command intent also involves more than one person. Traditional Commander's intent is then replaced by an intent that arises from dialogue between commanders and key staff at more than one level.
Command intent is to allow self-synchronization and to provide understanding of the complex causes and effects. To enable self-synchronization the subordinates must be given the mandate to operate on their own initiatives, within the boundary of the mission. In “Rethinking Command and Control” by Curts and Cambell (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Curts, R.J. and Cambell, D.E. (2006) "Rethinking Command and Control". In: March 2006, San Diego, CA: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/2006_CCRTS/html/papers/005.pdf [Accessed March 16, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; the authors address this fine line between delegating authority and maintaining and controlling hierarchy The commander delegating authority must refrain from directing the actions of subordinates, yet must also maintain some command structure. The subordinates must have the ability to work independently or within a team to achieve the mission goals. To create this empowerment the commander’s information should be shared with everyone. Autonomy is created by [[setting boundaries]] and hierarchy then can be replaced by self-directed teams. CI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders that transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commanders (Gustavsson et al. 2008d;&lt;ref name="PMG2008d"/&gt; 2009&lt;ref&gt;Gustavsson, P.M. and Hieb, M.R. (2009) "Supporting Collaboration in Collective Endeavours with a Model of Operations Intent and Effects". In: ''Proceedings of the 14th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/14th_iccrts_2009/papers/055.pdf. 055.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Explicit and implicit intent ===
'''Explicit intent''' is an intent that is publicly stated and made available for the participants. '''Implicit intent''' is an intent that is not publicly stated. Implicit intent can be made explicit by the mechanism described below.

Shattuck and Woods (2000)&lt;ref name="S2000"&gt;Shattuck, L.G. and Woods, D.D. (2000) "Communication Of Intent In Military Command and Control Systems". In: C. McCann and R. Pigeau, (eds.) ''The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience'', Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 279–92. Available at: http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/woods/C2/shattuck_Nato.pdf [Accessed July 14, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; examined the role of communicating intent. In the study, company commanders received a battalion order including the battalion Commander's intent. Then changes to the situation were introduced and the actions performed by the company commanders were compared with the intent of the battalion commander. The result was that the company commanders matched their battalion commander's intent in only 34% of the cases.
Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; introduced that intent consists of an explicit part and an implicit part.

'''Explicit intent''' is the one that is publicly stated for all the headquarters (HQ) staff and subordinates to perceive, think about, and act upon. The explicit intent is either vocalized (i.e. made publicly) in doctrine, orders, statements or can be derived from questions and answers. Theoretically, each staff and subordinate member should be able to reiterate the commander’s intent at any point during the process.

'''Implicit intent''' consists of all the un-vocalized expectations that the commander and all team members have. The implicit intent is developed over a longer time, prior to the mission, and develops from the style of how the commander is conducting the operations with respect to experience, risk willing, use of power and force, diplomacy, ethics, social values, moral, norms, creativity and unorthodox behaviour and the concepts, policies, laws and doctrine agreed to by military, civil, organizations, agencies, nations and coalitions.
Farell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; proposed that implicit intent is an internal expectation of Commander's intent. The example used by Farell &amp; Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; is that with an explicit intent “to capture the hill” the implicit intent might be “to capture the hill with minimal battle damage” or “to capture the hill with Air Force assets only.” The implicit expectations depend on how the members interpret Commander's intent from personal expectations based on their style and experience, (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2000),&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; and with the staff position (e.g., planner, operator, commander, etc.), (cf. Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004).&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Farell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; provided a way of finding implicit intent by asking questions of the form “from perspective x, how do you interpret Commander’s intent?”
Implicit intent can be made explicit by transforming the implicit into explicit statements. The commander can vocalize the Personal, Military or Cultural implicit intent. The commander can be monitored, e.g. by his subordinates, and his team members, who then draw conclusions about the commanders implicit intent. In the same way a commander can draw conclusions regarding his subordinates. Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; presented some mechanisms of making original implicit intent made explicit. They are: (1) Externalization is when a commander or subordinate make the internal intents explicit declared; (2) Internalization is a version of tacit learning, when a commander presents the intent and the mouth is saying something and the body language signals something different, or add context and meaning that are put into the mental model and affects the implicit intent; (3) Socialization is meeting and talking and performing exercises together, teaming, i.e. is to find the implicit intent and motives etc.; and (4) Dialogue is the explicit stated, publicly vocalized available description of an individual’s intent.

{{Life in the Universe}}
Whether there is '''life on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]''', the largest moon of [[Saturn]], is at present an open question and a topic of scientific assessment and research. Titan is far colder than Earth, and its surface lacks stable liquid [[water]], factors which have led some scientists to consider life there unlikely. On the other hand, its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are bodies of liquid [[methane]] and [[ethane]], and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell; some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide pre-biotic chemistry for [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|living cells different from those on Earth]].

In June 2010, scientists analysing data from the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes.&lt;ref name="life?"/&gt; The ''Cassini–Huygens'' mission was not equipped to look directly for micro-organisms or to provide a thorough inventory of complex [[organic compound]]s.

==Chemistry==

Titan's consideration as an environment for the study of prebiotic chemistry or potentially exotic life stems in large part due to the diversity of the organic chemistry that occurs in its atmosphere, driven by photochemical reactions in its outer layers. The following chemicals have been detected in Titan's upper atmosphere by ''Cassini'''s [[mass spectrometer]]:

As mass spectrometry identifies the atomic mass of a compound but not its structure, additional research is required to identify the exact compound that has been detected.  Where the compounds have been identified in the literature, their chemical formula has been replaced by their name above.  The figures in Magee (2009) involve corrections for high pressure background.  Other compounds believed to be indicated by the data and associated models include [[ammonia]], [[polyyne]]s, [[amine]]s, [[ethylenimine]], [[deuterium hydride]], [[allene]], [[Butadiene|1,3 butadiene]] and any number of more complex chemicals in lower concentrations, as well as carbon dioxide and limited quantities of water vapour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Surface temperature==
Due to its distance from the Sun, Titan is much colder than Earth. Its surface temperature is about 90 K (−179&amp;nbsp;°C, or −290&amp;nbsp;°F). At these temperatures, water ice—if present—does not melt, evaporate or sublime, but remains solid. Because of the extreme cold and also because of lack of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the atmosphere, scientists such as [[Jonathan Lunine]] have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for [[extraterrestrial life]], than as an experiment for examining hypotheses on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html| title=Saturn's Moon Titan: Prebiotic Laboratory|publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |date=August 11, 2004|accessdate=2004-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the usual surface temperature on Titan is not compatible with liquid water, calculations by Lunine and others suggest that meteor strikes could create occasional "impact oases"—craters in which liquid water might persist for hundreds of years or longer, which would enable water-based organic chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

However, Lunine does not rule out life in an environment of liquid methane and ethane, and has written about what discovery of such a life form (even if very primitive) would imply about the prevalence of life in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0762 Jonathan Lunine "Saturn’s Titan: A Strict Test for Life’s Cosmic Ubiquity"] (accepted for publication in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''), July 21, 2009

===Past hypothesis about the temperature===
[[File:PIA20016-SaturnMoon-Titan-20151113.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Titan - infrared view&lt;br&gt;(November 13, 2015).&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the 1970s, astronomers found unexpectedly high levels of [[infrared]] emissions from Titan.&lt;ref name=sagan/&gt; One possible explanation for this was the surface was warmer than expected, due to a [[greenhouse effect]]. Some estimates of the surface temperature even approached temperatures in the cooler regions of Earth. There was, however, another possible explanation for the infrared emissions: Titan's surface was very cold, but the upper atmosphere was heated due to absorption of ultraviolet light by molecules such as ethane, ethylene and acetylene.&lt;ref name=sagan&gt;{{cite book| title=Broca's Brain - the Romance of Science| first=Carl| last= Sagan| publisher=Hodder and Stoughton| date=1979| isbn= 0-340-24424-0}} pp 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1979, [[Pioneer 11]], the first space probe to conduct fly-by observations of Saturn and its moons, sent data showing Titan's surface to be extremely cold by Earth standards, and much below the temperatures generally associated with [[planetary habitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 26, 2007 |title=The Pioneer Missions |publisher=NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory |work=Pioneer Project |url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html |accessdate= 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future temperature===

Titan may become warmer in the future.&lt;ref name=lorenz/&gt; Five to six billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a [[red giant]], surface temperatures could rise to ~{{convert|200|K|°C|-1|abbr=on}}, high enough for stable oceans of a water–ammonia mixture to exist on its surface. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on its surface and enabling the greenhouse effect created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create an environment agreeable to exotic forms of life, and will persist for several hundred million years.&lt;ref name=lorenz/&gt; This was sufficient time for simple life to evolve on Earth, although the presence of ammonia on Titan could cause the same chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.&lt;ref name=lorenz&gt;{{cite web|title=Titan under a red giant sun: A new kind of "habitable" moon|author1=Ralph D.

==Absence of surface liquid water==

The lack of [[liquid water]] on Titan's surface was cited by NASA [[astrobiology|astrobiologist]] Andrew Pohorille in 2009 as an argument against life there. Pohorille considers that water is important not only as the solvent used by "the only life we know" but also because its chemical properties are  "uniquely suited to promote self-organization of organic matter". He has questioned whether prospects for finding life on Titan's surface are sufficient to justify the expense of a mission that would look for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://astrobiology2.arc.nasa.gov/focus-groups/current/origins-of-life/articles/comment-on-titan-first/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130902170025/http://astrobiology2.arc.nasa.gov/focus-groups/current/origins-of-life/articles/comment-on-titan-first/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-09-02 | title = Comment on Titan First | accessdate = 2013-09-02 | last = Pohorille | first = Andrew | date = 2009-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible subsurface liquid water==

Laboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth. While the analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable, several hypotheses suggest that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Artemivia N. |author2=Lunine J |title = Cratering on Titan: impact melt, ejecta, and the fate of surface organics|date = 2003|journal = Icarus|volume = 164| pages = 471–480|doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00148-9|bibcode=2003Icar..164..471A}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface;&lt;ref name=Grasset2000&gt;

For example, the atmospheric methane and nitrogen could be examined for biogenic origin.&lt;ref name=Fortes2000/&gt;

Data published in 2012 obtained from NASA's ''Cassini'' spacecraft, have strengthened evidence that Titan likely harbors a layer of liquid water under its ice shell.&lt;ref name="subsurface"&gt;{{Cite news |author1=Jia-Rui Cook |author2=Dwayne Brown |work=NASA News release |title=Cassini Finds Likely Subsurface Ocean on Saturn Moon |date=2012-06-28 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassini20120628.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of complex molecules==

Titan is the only known natural satellite (moon) in the Solar System that has a fully developed [[atmosphere of Titan|atmosphere]] that consists of more than trace gases. Titan's atmosphere is thick, chemically active, and is known to be rich in [[organic compound]]s; this has led to speculation about whether chemical precursors of life may have been generated there.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; The atmosphere also contains [[hydrogen]] gas, which is cycling through the atmosphere and the surface environment, and which living things comparable to Earth [[methanogen]]s could combine with some of the organic compounds (such as [[acetylene]]) to obtain energy.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt;
[[File:Titan-SaturnMoon-Maps-TraceGases-20141022.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Trace element|Trace]] [[Organic compound|organic]] [[gas]]es in [[Atmosphere of Titan|Titan's atmosphere]]—[[Hydrogen isocyanide|HNC]] (left) and [[Cyanoacetylene|HC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N]] (right).]]
The [[Miller–Urey experiment]] and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of Titan and the addition of [[UV radiation]], complex molecules and polymer substances like [[tholin]]s can be generated. The reaction starts with [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of [[nitrogen]] and methane, forming [[hydrogen cyanide]] and [[acetylene]]. Further reactions have been studied extensively.&lt;ref name=Raulin2002&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Space Science Reviews|volume= 104|issue = 1–2|pages = 377–394|date= 2002|doi = 10.1023/A:1023636623006|title = Organic chemistry and exobiology on Titan|author1=Raulin F. |author2=Owen T. |bibcode=2002SSRv..104..377R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, [[Sarah Hörst]] of the [[University of Arizona]] reported finding the five [[nucleotide bases]]—building blocks of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]—among the many compounds produced when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan's atmosphere. Horst also found [[amino acids]], the building blocks of [[protein]]. She said it was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | date=October 8, 2010 | title=Titan's haze may hold ingredients for life | work=Astronomy | url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=10302 | accessdate=2010-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, NASA reported that complex [[organic chemicals]] could arise on Titan based on studies simulating the [[Titan (moon)#Atmosphere|atmosphere]] of Titan.&lt;ref name="PhysOrg-20130403"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA team investigates complex chemistry at Titan |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-nasa-team-complex-chemistry-titan.html |date=April 3, 2013 |work=[[Phys.Org]] |accessdate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) were detected in the [[upper atmosphere]] of Titan.&lt;ref name="IAA-20130606"&gt;{{cite news |last=López-Puertas |first=Manuel |title=PAH's in Titan's Upper Atmosphere |url=http://www.iaa.es/content/pahs-titans-upper-atmosphere |date=June 6, 2013 |work=[[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] |accessdate=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has suggested that polyimine could readily function as a building block in Titan's conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Polymorphism and electronic structure of polyimine and its potential significance for prebiotic chemistry on Titan | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/29/8121.full.pdf | date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titan's atmosphere produces significant quantities of hydrogen cyanide, which readily polymerize into forms which can capture light energy in Titan's surface conditions.  As of yet, the answer to what happens with Titan's cyanide is unknown; while it is rich in the upper atmosphere where it is created, it is depleted at the surface, suggesting that there is some sort of reaction consuming it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cornellsun.com/2016/09/12/saturns-moon-titan-might-be-able-to-support-life/ | date=2016-09-13 |title=Saturn’s Moon, Titan, Might Be Able to Support Life | author=Victor Aguillar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis==

===Hydrocarbons as solvents===
{{see also|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}
[[Image:Liquid lakes on titan.jpg|thumb|300px|Hydrocarbon lakes on Titan (''Cassini'' radar image from 2006]]
Although all living things on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid water as a solvent, it is conceivable that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane.&lt;ref name=methanesolvent&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=74 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Water is a stronger solvent than hydrocarbons,&lt;ref name=methlife/&gt; however, water is more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref name=methanesolvent/&gt; A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.&lt;ref name=methanesolvent/&gt;

It has been speculated that life could exist in the liquid methane and ethane that form rivers and lakes on Titan's surface, just as organisms on Earth live in water.&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt; Such hypothetical creatures would take in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in place of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, react it with [[acetylene]] instead of [[glucose]], and produce methane instead of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt; By comparison, some [[methanogens]] on Earth obtain energy by reacting hydrogen with carbon dioxide, producing methane and water.

In 2005, [[astrobiologist]]s [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Chris McKay]] and Heather Smith predicted that if methanogenic life is consuming atmospheric hydrogen in sufficient volume, it will have a measurable effect on the [[mixing ratio]] in the [[troposphere]] of Titan. The effects predicted included a level of acetylene much lower than otherwise expected, as well as a reduction in the concentration of hydrogen itself.&lt;ref name=mckay&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Icarus|volume= 178|issue = 1|pages = 274–276|date= 2005|doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018|title = Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan|author1=McKay, C. P. |author2=Smith, H. D. |bibcode=2005Icar..178..274M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence consistent with these predictions was reported in June 2010 by Darrell Strobel of [[Johns Hopkins University]], who analysed measurements of hydrogen concentration in the upper and lower atmosphere. Strobel found that the hydrogen concentration in the upper atmosphere is so much larger than near the surface that the physics of [[diffusion]] leads to hydrogen flowing downwards at a rate of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per second. Near the surface the downward-flowing hydrogen apparently disappears.&lt;ref name=methlife&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan? |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06 |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185640/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190 |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan’s atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions |author=Darrell F.

Chris McKay agreed with Strobel that presence of life, as suggested in McKay's 2005 article, is a possible explanation for the findings about hydrogen and acetylene, but also cautioned that other explanations are currently more likely: namely the possibility that the results are due to [[human error]], to a meteorological process, or to the presence of some mineral [[catalyst]] enabling hydrogen and acetylene to react chemically.&lt;ref name="life?"&gt;{{cite web|title= Have We Discovered Evidence For Life On Titan?|author=Mckay, Chris|date=2010|url=http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/tharriso/ast105/making_sense.php.html| publisher=[[New Mexico State University]], [http://artsci.nmsu.edu/ College of Arts and Sciences], [http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/ Department of Astronomy]| accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/13639-alien-life-methane-habitable-zone.html Could Alien Life Exist in the Methane Habitable Zone?] Keith Cooper, Astrobiology Magazine16 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that such a catalyst, one effective at −178&amp;nbsp;°C (95 K), is presently unknown and would in itself be a startling discovery, though less startling than discovery of an extraterrestrial life form.&lt;ref name="life?"/&gt;

The June 2010 findings gave rise to considerable media interest, including a report in the British newspaper, the [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]], which spoke of clues to the existence of "primitive aliens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 5, 2010 |title=Titan: Nasa scientists discover evidence 'that alien life exists on Saturn's moon'|author=Andew Hough|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/7805069/Titan-Nasa-scientists-discover-evidence-that-alien-life-exists-on-Saturns-moon.html |accessdate= 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell membranes===
A hypothetical [[cell membrane]] capable of functioning in liquid [[methane]] was modeled in February 2015.&lt;ref name=azotosomemodel&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2015-02-life-saturn-moon-titan.html Life 'not as we know it' possible on Saturn's moon Titan]&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed chemical base for these membranes is [[acrylonitrile]], which has been detected on Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10079158 | doi=10.1006/jmsp.1998.7795 | volume=194 | title=Absolute Intensities of the Infrared Bands of Gaseous Acrylonitrile | year=1999 | journal=J Mol Spectrosc | pages=206–210 |vauthors=Khlifi M, Nollet M, Paillous P, Bruston P, Raulin F, Bénilan Y, Khanna RK |bibcode = 1999JMoSp.194..206K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Called an "[[azotosome]]" ('nitrogen body'), formed from "azote", French for nitrogen, and "soma", Greek for body, it lacks the phosphorus and oxygen found in [[phospholipid]]s on Earth but contains nitrogen.  Despite the very different chemical structure and external environment, its properties are surprisingly similar, including autoformation of sheets, flexibility, stability, and other properties.

An analysis of ''Cassini'' data, completed in 2017, confirmed substantial amounts of acrylonitrile in Titan's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="SP-20170728"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Saturn Moon Titan Has Molecules That Could Help Make Cell Membranes |url=https://www.space.com/37653-saturn-moon-titan-cell-membrane-molecules.html |date=28 July 2017 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA-20170728"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palmer, Maureen Y. et al. |title=ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan |url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700022 |date=28 July 2017 |journal=[[Science Advances]] |volume =3 |number=7 |doi= 10.1126/sciadv.1700022 |accessdate=29 July 2017 |bibcode=2017SciA....3E0022P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative habitability===

In order to assess the likelihood of finding any sort of life on various planets and moons, [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] and other scientists have developed a [[Planetary Habitability Index]] which takes into account factors including characteristics of the surface and atmosphere, availability of energy, solvents and organic compounds.&lt;ref name=PHI&gt;{{cite web|title= Which alien worlds are most livable?|publisher=msnbc.com| date=2011-11-22|author=Alan Boyle |accessdate=2012-01-27|url= http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/11/22/8956644-which-alien-worlds-are-most-livable}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this index, based on data available in late 2011, the model suggests that Titan has the highest current habitability rating of any known world, other than Earth.&lt;ref name=PHI/&gt;

===Titan as a test case===

While the ''Cassini–Huygens'' mission was not equipped to provide evidence for [[biosignature]]s or complex organics, it showed an environment on Titan that is similar, in some ways, to ones theorized for the primordial Earth.&lt;ref name=Raulin2005&gt;

Titan is presented as a test case for the relation between chemical reactivity and life, in a 2007 report on life's limiting conditions prepared by a committee of scientists under the [[United States National Research Council]]. The committee, chaired by [[John Baross]], considered that "if life is an intrinsic property of chemical reactivity, life should exist on Titan. Indeed, for life not to exist on Titan, we would have to argue that life is not an intrinsic property of the reactivity of carbon-containing molecules under conditions where they are stable..."&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=74]; The National Academies Press, 2007; pages 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Grinspoon]], one of the scientists who in 2005 proposed that hypothetical organisms on Titan might use hydrogen and acetylene as an energy source,&lt;ref&gt;

He suggests that, just as Earth's environment and its organisms have evolved together, the same thing is likely to have happened on other worlds with life on them. In Grinspoon's view, worlds that are "geologically and meteorologically alive are much more likely to be biologically alive as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Leslie Mullen | date=September 22, 2005 | title=The Living Worlds Hypothesis | work=Astrobiology Magazine | url=http://www.astrobio.net/interview/1720/the-living-worlds-hypothesis | accessdate=2010-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panspermia or independent origin===

An alternate explanation for life's hypothetical existence on Titan has been proposed: if life were to be found on Titan, it could have originated from Earth in a process called [[panspermia]]. It is theorized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface have caused hundreds of millions of fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity. Calculations indicate that a number of these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4819370.stm |title=Earth could seed Titan with life |work=BBC News |date=March 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gladman, Brett |author2=Dones, Luke |author3=Levinson, Harold F. |author4=Burns, Joseph A. |title = Impact Seeding and Reseeding in the Inner Solar System|date = 2005|journal = Astrobiology|volume = 5|pages = 483–496 |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.483|pmid = 16078867|issue = 4|bibcode=2005AsBio...5..483G}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan's cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0762 Jonathan Lunine "Saturn’s Titan: A Strict Test for Life’s Cosmic Ubiquity"] (accepted for publication in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''), July 21, 2009 (Revised November 7, 2009), page 13&lt;/ref&gt; In Lunine's view, presence of organisms in Titan's lakes would mean a second, independent origin of life within the Solar System, implying that life has a high probability of emerging on habitable worlds throughout the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0762 Jonathan Lunine "Saturn’s Titan: A Strict Test for Life’s Cosmic Ubiquity"] (accepted for publication in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''), July 21, 2009 (Revised November 7, 2009), page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed missions==
{{See also|Titan (moon)#Proposed or conceptual missions}}

The proposed [[Titan Mare Explorer]] mission, a [[Discovery Program|Discovery-class]] lander that would splash down in a lake, "would have the possibility of detecting life", according to astronomer [[Chris Impey]] of the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=Jan 31, 2011 |title=Jan 31st: Life on Titan|author=Chris Impey|publisher=[[365 Days of Astronomy]]|url= http://365daysofastronomy.org/2011/01/31/january-31st-life-on-titan/ |accessdate= 2011-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed [[Dragonfly (spacecraft)|Dragonfly]] [[rotorcraft]] probe mission is intended to land on solid ground and relocate many times. Dragonfly is a [[New Frontiers program|New Frontiers-class]] proposal. An aim of the mission is to find out how far Titan’s “rich organics may have ascended up the ‘ladder of life’ “.&lt;ref name="dragonfly"/&gt; Dragonfly would carry equipment to study the chemical composition of Titan's surface, and to sample the lower atmosphere for possible biomarkers, including hydrogen concentrations.&lt;ref name="dragonfly"&gt;[http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/docs/DragonflyTechDigestAPL.pdf Dragonfly: A Rotorcraft Lander Concept for Scientific Exploration at Titan] (PDF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10250">A '''Light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain''' ('''LOV domain''') is a [[protein]] sensor used by a large variety of higher plants, microalgae, fungi and bacteria to sense environmental conditions. In higher plants, they are used to control [[phototropism]], [[chloroplast]] relocation, and [[Stomata|stomatal]] opening, whereas in fungal organisms, they are used for adjusting the [[Circadian rhythm|circadian]] temporal organization of the cells to the daily and seasonal periods.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

== Chromophore ==
Common to all LOV proteins is the blue-light sensitive [[Flavin group|flavin]] chromophore, which in the signaling state is covalently linked to the protein core via an adjacent [[cysteine]] residue.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt; LOV domains are e.g. encountered in [[phototropins]], which are blue-light-sensitive protein complexes regulating a great diversity of biological processes in higher plants as well as in micro-algae.&lt;ref name="r4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r7" /&gt; [[Phototropins]] are composed of two LOV domains, each containing a non-covalently bound [[flavin mononucleotide]] (FMN) chromophore in its dark-state form, and a C-terminal Ser-Thr [[kinase]]. 

Upon blue-light absorption, a covalent bond between the FMN chromophore and an adjacent reactive [[cysteine]] residue of the apo-protein is formed in the LOV2 domain. This subsequently mediates the activation of the [[kinase]], which induces a signal in the organism through phototropin [[autophosphorylation]].&lt;ref name="r8" /&gt; 

While the photochemical reactivity of the LOV2 domain has been found to be essential for the activation of the [[kinase]], the in vivo functionality of the LOV1 domain within the [[protein]] complex still remains unclear.&lt;ref name="r9" /&gt; 

==Fungus==
In case of the fungus ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'', the [[circadian clock]] is controlled by two light-sensitive domains, known as the white-collar-complex (WCC) and the LOV domain vivid (VVD-LOV).&lt;ref name="r10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r12" /&gt; WCC is primarily responsible for the light-induced [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] on the control-gene frequency (FRQ) under day-light conditions, which drives the expression of VVD-LOV and governs the negative feedback loop onto the [[circadian clock]].&lt;ref name="r12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r13" /&gt; By contrast, the role of VVD-LOV is mainly modulatory and does not directly affect FRQ.&lt;ref name="r11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r14" /&gt; 

==Gene expression==
LOV domains have been found to control [[gene expression]] through [[DNA]] binding and
to be involved in redox-dependent regulation, like e.g. in the bacterium ''[[Rhodobacter sphaeroides]]''.&lt;ref name="r15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r16" /&gt; Notably, LOV-based [[Optogenetics|optogenetic]] tools have been gaining wide popularity in recent years to control a myriad of cellular events, including cell motility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A genetically encoded photoactivatable Rac controls the motility of living cells|journal = Nature|date = 2009-01-01|pmc = 2766670|pmid = 19693014|volume = 461|issue = 7260|pages = 104–8|doi = 10.1038/nature08241|first = Yi I.|last = Wu|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Frey|first3 = Oana I.|last3 = Lungu|first4 = Angelika|last4 = Jaehrig|first5 = Ilme|last5 = Schlichting |authorlink5=Ilme Schlichting |first6 = Brian|last6 = Kuhlman|first7 = Klaus M.|last7 = Hahn}}&lt;/ref&gt; subcellular organelle distribution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Optogenetic control of organelle transport and positioning|journal = Nature|date = 2015-01-01|volume = 518|issue = 7537|pages = 111–4|doi = 10.1038/nature14128|pmid = 25561173|first = Petra|last = van Bergeijk|first2 = Max|last2 = Adrian|first3 = Casper C.|last3 = Hoogenraad|first4 = Lukas C.|last4 = Kapitein|pmc=5063096}}&lt;/ref&gt; formation of membrane contact sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Proteomic mapping of ER–PM junctions identifies STIMATE as a regulator of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx|journal = Nature Cell Biology|volume = 17|issue = 10|pages = 1339–47|date = 2015-01-01|doi = 10.1038/ncb3234|pmid = 26322679|first = Ji|last = Jing|first2 = Lian|last2 = He|first3 = Aomin|last3 = Sun|first4 = Ariel|last4 = Quintana|first5 = Yuehe|last5 = Ding|first6 = Guolin|last6 = Ma|first7 = Peng|last7 = Tan|first8 = Xiaowen|last8 = Liang|first9 = Xiaolu|last9 = Zheng|pmc=4589512}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protein degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A LOV2 Domain-Based Optogenetic Tool to Control Protein Degradation and Cellular Function|journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology|issn = 1074-5521|pmid = 23601651|pages = 619–626|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2013.03.005|first = Christian|last = Renicke|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Schuster|first3 = Svetlana|last3 = Usherenko|first4 = Lars-Oliver|last4 = Essen|first5 = Christof|last5 = Taxis|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53554">This is a '''list of broadcast station classes''' applicable in much of North America under international agreements between the United States, Canada and Mexico. [[Effective radiated power]] (ERP) and [[height above average terrain]] (HAAT) are listed unless otherwise noted.

All [[radio station|radio]] and [[television station]]s within 320 kilometers (about 200 miles) of the [[Canada–United States border|US-Canada]] or [[US-Mexico border]] must get approval by both the domestic and foreign agency. These agencies are [[Industry Canada]]/[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) in Canada, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the US, and the [[Federal Telecommunications Institute]] (IFT) in Mexico.

===Station class descriptions===
* '''A''' (formerly '''I''') — [[clear-channel station]]s — 10&amp;nbsp;kW to 50&amp;nbsp;kW, 24 hours. 
**Class A stations are only protected within a 750-mile radius of the transmitter site. 
**The old Class I was divided into three: Class I-A, I-B and I-N. [[NARBA]] distinguished between Class I-A, which were true clear-channel stations that did not share their channel with another Class I station, and Class I-B, in which a station operated with 50&amp;nbsp;kW at night but shared its channel with at least one other I-B station, requiring directional operation. This distinction was superseded by the [[Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2|Rio Agreement]], which instituted the current class system.
**Most former Class I-As are omnidirectional, though some exceptions exist and some formerly operated directional arrays. 
**Most former Class I-Bs are directional at night, although a few are also directional during days. 
**A very few former Class I-As who dropped to Class I-B while retaining their I-A facilities operate omnidirectionally during all hours.
**Former Class I-N stations exist only in Alaska, where they are too remote to interfere with other clear-channel stations. They are only held to Class B efficiency standards (although higher efficiency is acceptable).
**No new Class A stations are licensed in the coterminous United States, although the FCC states it may be possible to license additional Class A stations in Alaska.
* '''B''' (formerly '''II''' and '''III''') — regional stations — 250 W to 50&amp;nbsp;kW, 24 hours. 
**Stations on the [[AM expanded band]], 1610&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz, are limited to 10&amp;nbsp;kW days and 1&amp;nbsp;kW nights, non-directionally.
**Several expanded band stations operate DA-N or even DA-2 with up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW during all hours, after providing proof that such operations will not cause co- or adjacent-channel interference. 
**If under 250 W at night, the antenna must be efficient enough to radiate more than 140.82 mV/m at 1&amp;nbsp;km.
* '''C''' (formerly '''IV''') — local unlimited-time stations — 250 W to 1&amp;nbsp;kW, 24 hours. 
**Class C stations that were licensed at 100 W are [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]]. 
**Rare Class Cs operate with directional arrays, such as [[KYPA]] and [[KHCB (AM)|KHCB]].
* '''D''' (formerly '''II-D''', '''II-S''', '''III-S''') — current and former [[daytimer]]s — Daytime 250 W to 50&amp;nbsp;kW, nighttime under 250 W or off-air. 
**[[Field strength]] is limited to 140 mV/m (millivolts per meter) at 1&amp;nbsp;km. 
**No new class D stations are licensed, with the exception of Class B stations that are downgrading their nighttime operations to Class D (i.e., less than 250 W). The station's daytime operation is then also reclassified as Class D.
**If a Class D station is on the air at night, it is not protected from any co-channel interference.
* '''TIS'''/'''HAR''' — [[travelers' information station]]s / highway advisory radio stations — Up to 10 W transmitter output power. Stations within [[National Park Service|US national parks]] are licensed by [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]] and not the FCC.
* '''Unlicensed broadcasting''' — (see [[low-power broadcasting]]) — 100&amp;nbsp;mW DC input to final amplifier with a 3-meter maximum length radiator, no license needed, may be measured at edge of campus for school stations

'''Notes:'''
* In the Western Hemisphere ([[ITU Region|ITU region 2]]), [[medium wave]] AM broadcasts are on channels spaced 10&amp;nbsp;kHz apart from 530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz, with certain classes restricted to subsets of the available frequencies.
* With few exceptions, Class A stations can be found only on the frequencies of 540&amp;nbsp;kHz, 640 to 780&amp;nbsp;kHz, 800 to 900&amp;nbsp;kHz, 940&amp;nbsp;kHz, 990 to 1140&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1160 to 1220&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 1500 to 1580&amp;nbsp;kHz. The exceptions are cited in relevant international treaties.
* While US and Canadian Class A stations are authorized to operate at a maximum of 50,000 watts day and night (and a minimum of 10,000 watts at night, if grandfathered), certain existing Mexican Class A stations, and certain new Cuban Class A stations are authorized to operate at a higher power. Certain Mexican Class A stations are authorized to operate at less than 50,000 watts at night, if grandfathered, but may operate at up to 100,000 watts during the day.
* Class B and D stations can be found on any frequencies from 540&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz except where frequencies have been reserved for Class C stations.
* Class C stations can be found in the lower 48 US states on the frequencies of 1230&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1240&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1340&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1400&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1450&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 1490&amp;nbsp;kHz (commonly known as "graveyard" frequencies). Other countries may use other frequencies for their Class C stations.
* American territories in ITU region 3 with AM broadcasting stations ([[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]) use the 9&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing customary to the rest of the world. All stations are class B or lower. 
* Canada also defines Class CC ([[Carrier Current]], restricted to the premises) and LP.  (less than 100 watts)&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ic.gc.ca/engineering/engdoc/baserad.zip Industry Canada Broadcasting Database]&lt;/ref&gt;
* TIS stations can be found on any frequency from 530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz in the US, but may only carry non-commercial messages without music. There is a network of TISs on 1710 in New Jersey.
* [[Low-power AM]] stations located on a school campus are allowed to be more powerful, so long as their signal strength does not exceed roughly 14 to 45 µV/m (microvolts per meter) (depending on frequency) at a distance of 30&amp;nbsp;meters (98.4&amp;nbsp;ft) from campus.

====Former system====
AM station classes were previously assigned [[Roman numerals]] from I to IV in the US, with subclasses indicated by a letter suffix. Current class A is equivalent to the old class I; class B is the old classes II and III, with class D being the II-D, II-S, and III-S subclasses; and class C is the old class IV.

The following conversion table compares the old AM station classes with the new AM station classes:

=== AM station classes and clear channels listed by frequency===
{{See also|North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2}}

The following chart lists frequencies on the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] band, and which classes broadcast on these frequencies; [[List of broadcast station classes|Class A]] and [[List of broadcast station classes|Class B]], 10,000 watt and higher (full-time) stations in North America which broadcast on [[clear-channel station]] frequencies are also shown.

By international agreement, Class A stations must be 10,000 watts and above, with a 50,000 watt maximum for the US and Canada, but no maximum for other governments in the region. Mexico, for example, typically runs 150,000 to 500,000 watts, but some stations are [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] at 10,000 to 20,000 watts at night; by treaty, these sub-50,000 watt Mexican stations may operate with a maximum of 100,000 watts during the daytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldradio.com/archives/stations/ccs.htm|title=Clear Channel Stations|author=|date=|website=www.oldradio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the AM broadcast band developed before technology suitable for [[directional antenna]]s, there are numerous exceptions, such as the US use of 800 (kHz) and 900 non-directionally in Alaska, limited to 5&amp;nbsp;kW at night; and 1050 and 1220, directionally, in the [[continental US]], and without time limits; each of these being assigned to specific cities (and each of these being Mexican Class I-A clear channels). In return for these limits on US stations, Mexico accepted limits on 830 and 1030 in Mexico City, non-directionally, restricted to 5&amp;nbsp;kW at night (both of these being US Class I-A clear channels).

'''Notes:'''
* Canada protects all radio stations out to a [[signal strength]] of 0.5[[mV/m]] (54dBu), whereas only commercial B stations in the US are. Commercial B1 in the US is 0.7mV/m (57dBu), and all other stations are 1.0mV/m (60dBu). [[Reserved band|Noncommercial-band]] stations (88.1 to 91.9) are not afforded this protection, and are treated as C3 and C2 even when they are B1 or B. C3 and C2 may also be reported internationally as B1 and B, respectively.
* Class C0 is for former C stations, demoted at request of another station which needs the downgrade to accommodate its own facilities.
* In practice, many stations are above the maximum HAAT for a particular class, and correspondingly must downgrade their power to remain below the reference distance. Conversely, they may ''not'' increase power if they are ''below'' maximum HAAT.
* All class D (including L1 and L2 [[LPFM]] and translator) stations are secondary in the US, and can be bumped or forced off-air completely, even if they are not just a repeater and are the only station a licensee has.
* The United States is divided into regions that have different restrictions for FM stations. Zone I (much of the [[US Northeast]] and [[Midwest]]) and I-A (most of [[California]], plus [[Puerto Rico]]) is limited to classes B and B1, while Zone II (everything else) has only the C classes. All areas have the same classes for A and D.
* Power and height restrictions were put in place in 1962. A number of previously existing stations were [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in, such as [[KVYB]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and [[WMC-FM]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

The following table lists the various classes of FM stations, the reference facilities for each station class, and the protected and city grade contours for each station class:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FM Broadcast Station Classes and Service Contours |url=https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/fm-station-classes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301145227/ttps://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/fm-station-classes |archivedate=1 March 2016 |website=FCC |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=28 October 2018 |date=11 December 2015}} See [[Talk:List of North American broadcast station classes#FM Broadcast Station Classes and Service Contours|Talk page]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, there were local "Class A" frequencies (like AM radio's class C stations) to which only class A stations would be allocated &amp; the other frequencies could not have a class A. According to the 1982 FCC rules &amp; regulations, those frequencies were: 92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9, 101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 &amp; 107.1. Stations on those twenty frequencies were limited to having equivalent signals no greater that 3KW at 300 feet above average terrain.

=== FM zones ===
[[Image:US FM broadcast zones.png|thumb|right|300px|FM broadcast zones in the US]]
The US is divided into three zones for FM broadcasting: I, I-A and II. The zone where a station is located may limit the choices of broadcast class available to a given FM station.

'''Zone&amp;nbsp;I''' in the US includes all of [[Connecticut]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[West Virginia]]. It also includes the areas south of [[latitude]] 43.5°N in [[Michigan]], [[New Hampshire]], New York, and [[Vermont]]; as well as coastal [[Maine]], southeastern [[Wisconsin]], and northern and eastern [[Virginia]].

'''Zone&amp;nbsp;I-A''' includes [[California]] south of 40°N, as well as [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[US Virgin Islands]].

'''Zone&amp;nbsp;II''' includes the remainder of the [[continental US]], plus [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]].

In Zones I and I-A, there are no Class C, C0, or C1 stations.  However, there are a few Class B stations with [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] power limits in excess of 50 KW, such as [[WETA-FM]] (licensed for Washington DC in zone&amp;nbsp;I, at a power of 75&amp;nbsp;kW ERP), [[WNCI-FM]] (licensed for [[Columbus, Ohio]] in zone&amp;nbsp;I, at a power of 175&amp;nbsp;kW ERP) and [[KPFK]] (Los Angeles, in zone&amp;nbsp;I-A, at 110 KW ERP).

== TV ==
{{Confusing section|date=April 2011}}
{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}

=== Full-power stations in the US===
* VHF low (2-6): 100&amp;nbsp;kW video analog; 45&amp;nbsp;kW digital (sliding scale varying with height)
* VHF high (7-13): 316&amp;nbsp;kW video analog; 160&amp;nbsp;kW digital (sliding scale varying with height)
* UHF all (14-51): 5 MW video analog; 1 MW digital

'''Notes:'''

All full-power analog television station transmissions in the US were terminated at midnight [[Eastern Daylight Time]] on June 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtvtransition.org/ A New Era in Television Broadcasting] - DTVTransition.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/Horizons/2009/0204/congress-delays-dtv-switch|title=Congress delays DTV switch|author=|date=4 February 2009|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many broadcasters replaced their analog signal with their digital [[ATSC]] signal on the same transmission channel at that time.

* All US digital stations received a -DT suffix during the analog-to-digital transition.  At analog shutdown, the FCC assigned to each digital station the call sign its associated analog station had used.  (with a -TV suffix if the analog station had this suffix, without the -TV suffix if the analog station didn't have it).  Stations could optionally choose to keep the -DT suffix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-09-1253A1.txt] - FCC DA-09-1253&lt;/ref&gt;  Most stations did not keep the -DT suffix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_sear.htm] Searching for the -DT suffix returns only 91 stations; -TV returns 903, searching for TV stations with no suffix at all returns 1,827.  Searches conducted 29 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* For US analog stations, the -TV suffix was required if there was a radio station with the same three- or four-letter callsign.  Stations not required to use the -TV suffix may optionally request it if desired.
* Analog audio power was limited to 22% of video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/octqtr/47cfr73.1560.htm] - FCC regulation 73.1560(c)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Full-power stations in Canada===
* Class A: UHF, 10&amp;nbsp;kW video/100m [[EHAAT]]
* Class B: UHF, 100&amp;nbsp;kW video/150m [[EHAAT]]
* Class C: UHF, 1000&amp;nbsp;kW video/300m [[EHAAT]] (?)
* Class D: UHF, more than 1000&amp;nbsp;kW/300m [[EHAAT]]
* Class R: VHF, 100&amp;nbsp;kW low-band (channels 2-6), 325&amp;nbsp;kW high-band.  (channels 7-13)
* Class S: VHF, more than 100&amp;nbsp;kW low-band/325&amp;nbsp;kW high-band.

Notes:
* Official definitions of these classes are difficult to locate.  The values above are inferred from the [http://spectrum.ic.gc.ca/engineering/engdoc/baserad.zip Industry Canada database].  There is some ambiguity about the difference between Classes C and D.
* Power-level limitations are not firmly enforced in Canada, and [[Industry Canada]] has been known to license stations for power levels much higher than the generally accepted limits.  For example, [[CFRN-TV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] operated on Channel 3 at over 600&amp;nbsp;kW but was not subject to international co-ordination due to its location 500&amp;nbsp;km north of the border.
* In Canada, the callsigns of all private TV stations have the -TV suffix.  Most [[CBC Television]] and [[Télévision de Radio-Canada]] TV callsigns end in the letter T and have no suffix.  A few Radio-Canada stations, purchased by the CBC from private owners, retain the old -TV callsigns.
* Canadian digital stations all receive the -DT suffix.  (this includes CBC and Radio-Canada stations)  The [http://spectrum.ic.gc.ca/engineering/engdoc/baserad.zip Industry Canada database] shows -PT suffixes for the channel allotments for permanent post-transition digital operation but when licences are issued for these permanent digital stations, -DT callsigns are used.

=== Low-power TV (US) ===
{{Confusing section|date=April 2011}}
[[LPTV]] (secondary) (suffix: -LP, or a sequential-numbered callsign in format W##XX with no suffix for analog or with -D suffix for digital, or -LD for low-power digital stations):
* VHF (2-13): 3&amp;nbsp;kW analog video; 3&amp;nbsp;kW digital 
* UHF (14-69): 150&amp;nbsp;kW analog video; 15&amp;nbsp;kW digital
* Experimental
* Unlicensed: not allowed except for [[medical]] [[telemetry]], and certain [[wireless microphone]]s

The LPTV (low-power television) service was created in 1982 by the FCC to allocate channels for smaller, local stations, and community channels, such as [[public access]] stations.  LPTV stations that meet additional requirements such as children's "[[E/I]]" core programming and [[Emergency Alert System]] broadcasting capabilities can qualify for a [[Class A television service|Class A (-CA)]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/lptv.html|title=Low Power Television (LPTV) Service|author=|date=17 May 2011|website=fcc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Broadcast translator]]s, [[Broadcast translator#Boosters and distributed transmission|boosters]], and other [[LPTV|LPTV stations]] are considered secondary to full-power stations, unless they have upgraded to class A. Class A is still considered LPTV with respect to stations in Canada and Mexico.

==== Class A television (US) ====
{{main|Class A television service}}
{{Confusing section|date=April 2011}}

'''Class-A''' stations (US) (suffix: -CA or -CD for digital class A):
* VHF (2-13): 3&amp;nbsp;kW analog video; 3&amp;nbsp;kW digital
* UHF (14-69): 150&amp;nbsp;kW analog video; 15&amp;nbsp;kW digital

The class-A television class is a variant of LPTV created in 2000 by the FCC to allocate and protect some low-power affiliates. Class-A stations are still low-power, but are protected from [[RF interference]] and from having to change channel should a full-service station request that channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01123.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, class-A stations, LPTV stations, and translators are the only stations currently authorized to broadcast both analog and digital signals, unlike full-power stations which must broadcast a digital signal only.

=== Low-power TV (Canada) ===
In Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which, a television transmitter is considered broadcasting at low power.  Industry Canada considers that a low power digital television undertaking "shall not normally extend a distance of 20 km in any direction from the antenna site," based on the determined noise-limited bounding contour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/bpr10-i1.pdf/$FILE/bpr10-i1.pdf|title=Part 10: Application and Procedures and Rules for Digital Television (DTV) Undertakings|author=|date=|website=ic.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
All digital television stations in Mexico have '''-TDT''' callsign suffixes. Analog stations, which existed until December 31, 2016, had '''-TV''' callsign suffixes.

The equivalent of low power or translator service in Mexico is the ''equipo complementario de zona de sombra'', which is intended only to fill in gaps between a station's expected and actual service area caused by terrain; a station of this type shares the callsign of another station. In analog, these services often were broadcast on the same or adjacent channels to their parent station, except in certain areas with tight packing of television stations (such as central Mexico). In digital, these services usually operate on the same RF channel as their parent station, except for those with conflicting full-power applications ([[XHBS-TDT]] Cd. Obregón, Son., channel 30 instead of 25), in certain other cases where it is technically not feasible ([[XHAW-TDT]] Guadalupe, NL, channel 26 instead of 25) or to make way for eventual repacking on upper UHF ([[XHPNW-TDT]] has four shadows on 33, its post-repacking channel, instead of 39).

''Equipos complementarios'' can relay their parent station, or a station that carries 75% or more of the same programming as its parent station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/2016-12-30dof-diariooficialdelafederacion.pdf IFT: Disposición Técnica IFT-013-2016 "Especificaciones y requerimientos mínimos para la instalación y operación de estaciones de televisión, equipos auxiliares y equipos complementarios"], which became effective on January 1, 2017, provides the guidelines for the operation of digital television stations and their shadows.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stations of either type may have unusually low or high effective radiated powers. [[XHSMI-TDT]] in Oaxaca is licensed for two watts in digital. The highest-powered shadows are [[XEQ-TDT]] Toluca and [[XHBS-TDT]] Ciudad Obregón, both at 200&amp;nbsp;kW.

=== FCC service table ===
The United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] lists the following services on their website for television broadcasting:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Broadcast class
! Service
! Suffixes used or call sign examples
|-
| Television [[table of allotments|allotment]] (analog)
| TA
| An allocation of a frequency to a [[city of license]] for which no corresponding call sign or license has been assigned. FCC placeholder for possible future construction permits or frequencies allocated to non-US broadcast use. No call sign, identifier is a date (yymmdd) followed by a sequential two-letter value in the US FCC database.
|-
| Full-service TV (analog)
| TV
| '''-TV''' or '''none''' (such as "[[WABC-TV]]" and "[[WMYD]]") Since the shutdown of all full power analog stations in June 2009, used only for historical records.
|-
| Class A (analog)
| CA
| '''-CA''', or a translator-style call sign (such as "[[KTFB-CA]]")
|-
| Low-power station (analog) or translator
| LP
| '''-LP''', or a translator-style call sign (such as "[[KDMD-LP]]", "[[WRME-LP]]", and "[[K13IO]]" with the 2 digits denoting the channel of operation)
|-
| TV [[Broadcast translator#Boosters and distributed transmission|boosters]]
| TB
| Rare. These use the parent station's call sign plus a sequential number, such as [[WSTE|WSTE1]], [[WSTE|WSTE2]], [[WSTE|WSTE3]]. Nameplates for on-channel [[repeater]]s bear the parent station's call sign, followed by "booster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=;rgn=div5;view=text;node=47%3A4.0.1.1.3;idno=47;cc=ecfr#47:4.0.1.1.3.7.3.12|title=US CFR 47 Part 74G - 74.733 UHF translator signal boosters.|author=|date=|website=gpoaccess.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[distributed transmission]].  If the station is digital, and has on-channel boosters, they would typically be named [[WSTE|WSTE-DT1]], [[WSTE|WSTE-DT2]], [[WSTE|WSTE-DT3]] and so on.
|-
| TV auxiliary (analog backup) service
| TS
| no specific suffix (uses same call sign as main transmitter)
|-
| NTSC (analog) petition for a channel change
| NN
| no specific suffix; uses same call sign as the station which made a request for a number/channel change (for NTSC/analog stations, and low-power repeaters, such as those registered as TX).
|-
| Digital Television&lt;br&gt;(full power)
| DT
| '''-DT''', '''-TV''' or '''none''' (such as [[KGLA-DT]], [[WSKY-TV]] or [[KOHD]]). Some stations formerly used '''-HD''', but this has become obsolete (though it may sometimes still be seen identifying the station's main subchannel in a [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]] listing). The -DT suffix, optional for digital-only stations, was used primarily to distinguish a DTV transmission from an analog signal of the same broadcast (or is seen identifying the main subchannel of a station on a PSIP display); likewise, -TV is optional except if the eponymous radio stations exist. A similar suffix '''-DTV''', is used on all television stations in [[Japan]].
|-
| Digital Class-A
| CD
| '''-CD'''(such as "[[WDNI-CD]]" and "[[WYYW-CD]]") Some stations briefly used '''-DC''' as well (this has since become obsolete). A scant few still use translator-style call signs with the '''-D''' suffix (such as "[[KBMT-LD|K36ID-D]]").
|-
| Digital Low-power
| LD
| '''-LD''' or translator-style calls with '''-D''' suffix (such as "[[WBND-LD]]" and "[[W25AA-D]]"), occasionally no suffix (uses same call sign as main transmitter). Some stations briefly used '''-DL''' as well (this has since become obsolete).  Some full-powered stations (such as [[WOIO]], [[WXMI]] and [[WLS-TV]]) have been granted approval for fill-in translators within their broadcast market to better cover outlying towns or heavily urbanied areas, particularly by stations with a VHF digital signal.  These are technically -LD stations, but have the same call-sign as their parent station (such as WLS-TV or WOIO, and ''not'' as WLS-LD or WOIO-LD, though they could be considered as such for ease of differentiating the low-power repeater from its parent), similar to a Distributed Transmission System (but on different frequencies).
|-
| Digital [[special temporary authority]] (STA)
| DS
| no specific suffix; uses same call sign as station making a request for permission from the FCC to use a channel, power level or transmitter location not permanently allocated for one particular station. Temporary assignments retain, unmodified, the call sign of the corresponding permanent allocation; this includes translator-style calls (a format, such as W[[Channel 55 (disambiguation)|55]]&lt;nowiki&gt;ZZ&lt;/nowiki&gt;-D, based on RF channel number plus a sequential identifier) even on those temporarily moving to another frequency.

|-
|  Digital Television [[distributed transmission system]] (multiple transmitter sites) 
| DD
| no specific suffix (uses same call sign as main transmitter); this is usually requested for a [[single-frequency network]] and to tailor coverage area to the needs of the viewers in the station's service area (such as covering towns and farmland, and not mountainous terrain or the ocean)
|-
| Digital auxiliary (backup) service
| DX&lt;br&gt;(not to be confused with [[DXing]])
| no specific suffix (uses same call sign as main transmitter)
|-
| Digital [[rulemaking]] petition
| DR
| no specific suffix; uses same call sign as station making this request to add or modify a digital channel allocation
|-
| Land mobile use of a TV channel (TV RF channels 14-20 only)
| LM
| As "LM" is used in the FCC database to indicate reallocation of an entire channel, but not to identify individual users transmitting in that spectrum, a 6&amp;nbsp;MHz LM allocation does not itself carry a TV-style call sign. The spectrum of TV channels 14-20 is called "T-band" in LMR use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?state=&amp;call=&amp;arn=&amp;city=&amp;chan=&amp;cha2=69&amp;serv=LM&amp;type=0&amp;facid=&amp;list=1&amp;dist=&amp;dlat2=&amp;mlat2=&amp;slat2=&amp;dlon2=&amp;mlon2=&amp;slon2=&amp;size=9|title=TV Query Results -- Video Division (FCC) USA|author=|date=|website=www.fcc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeaters that operate in such an allocation use a 3&amp;nbsp;MHz offset instead of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz as normally used in the 450-470&amp;nbsp;MHz range.
|-
| [[ATSC#ATSC 3.0|ATSC 3.0 Futurecast]] Experimental Broadcasts
| EX
| Used for officially licensed experimental [[4K resolution|4K]]/[[2160p]] [[Ultra HDTV]] broadcast stations, such as [[WRAL-TV]]'s UHDTV simulcast, WRAL-EX.

'''Nanoprobing''' is method of extracting device [[Current–voltage characteristic|electrical parameters]] through the use of nanoscale tungsten wires, used primarily in the semiconductor industry. The characterization of individual devices is instrumental to engineers and [[integrated circuit]] designers during initial product development and debug. It is commonly utilized in device [[failure analysis]] laboratories to aid with yield enhancement, quality and reliability issues and customer returns. Commercially available nanoprobing systems are integrated into either a vacuum-based [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) or [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM). Nanoprobing systems that are based on AFM technology are referred to as Atomic Force nanoProbers (AFP).

== Principles and operation ==
AFM based nanoprobers, enable up to eight probe tips to be scanned to generate high resolution AFM topography images, as well as Conductive AFM, Scanning Capacitance, and Electrostatic Force Microscopy images. Conductive AFM provides pico-amp resolution to identify and localize electrical failures such as shorts, opens, resistive contacts and leakage paths, enabling accurate probe positioning for current-voltage measurements. AFM based nanoprobers enable nanometer scale device defect localization and accurate transistor device characterization without the physical damage and electrical bias induced by high energy electron beam exposure.

For SEM based nanoprobers, the ultra-high resolution of the microscopes that house the nanoprobing system allow the operator to navigate the probe tips with precise movement, allowing the user to see exactly where the tips will be landed, in real time. Existing nanoprobe needles or “probe tips” have a typical end-point radius ranging from 5 to 35&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Toh | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Tan | first2 = P.

Navigation of the probe tips in SEM based nanoprobers are typically controlled by precision [[piezoelectric]] manipulators. Typical systems have anywhere from 2 to 8 probe manipulators with high end tools having better than 5&amp;nbsp;nm of placement resolution in the X, Y &amp; Z axes and a high accuracy sample stage for navigation of the sample under test.

The '''National Endowment for the Humanities''' ('''NEH''') is an independent federal agency of the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;government]], established by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 ({{USPL|89|209}}), dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the [[humanities]]. The NEH is housed at 400 7th St SW, [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/visiting-neh | title=Visiting NEH | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979 to 2014, NEH was at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[Old Post Office Pavilion|Nancy Hanks Center at the Old Post Office]].

==History and overview==
The NEH provides grants for high-quality humanities projects to cultural institutions such as museums, archives, libraries, colleges, universities, public television, and radio stations, and to individual scholars.

NEH was created in 1965 under the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities, which included the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and later the [[Institute for Museum and Library Services|Institute for Museum Services]], as a move to provide greater investment in culture by the federal government.&lt;ref name="NEH-history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/history | title=How NEH Got Its Start | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEH was based upon recommendation of the National Commission on the Humanities, convened in 1963 with representatives from three US scholarly and educational associations.&lt;ref name="NEH-history"/&gt;

The agency creates incentives for excellent work in the humanities by awarding grants that strengthen teaching and learning in the humanities in schools and colleges across the nation, facilitate research and original scholarship, provide opportunities for lifelong learning, preserve and provide access to cultural and educational resources and to strengthen the institutional base of the humanities. As part of its mandate to support humanities programs in every US state and territory, the agency supports a network of private, nonprofit affiliates, the [[list of state humanities councils|56 humanities councils in the states and territories of the United States]].

The ninth NEH Chair was [[Jim Leach]]. President Obama nominated the former Iowa congressman, a Republican, to chair the NEH on June 3, 2009;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/arts/04neh.html "Obama Names a Republican to Lead the Humanities Endowment"], ''[[New York Times]]'', June 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the Senate confirmed his appointment in August 2009.&lt;ref name="Landesman"&gt;Robin Pogrebin, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/rocco-landesman-confirmed-as-chairman-of-the-national-endowment-for-the-arts/ "Rocco Landesman Confirmed as Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts"], ''New York Times'', August 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Leach began his term as the NEH Chair on August 12, 2009 and stepped down in May 2013. Between November 2009 and May 2011, Leach conducted the American "Civility Tour" to call attention to the need to restore reason and civility back into politics, a goal that in his words was "central to the humanities." Leach visited each of the 50 states, speaking at venues ranging from university and museum lecture halls to hospitals for veterans, to support the return of non-emotive, civil exchange and rational consideration of other viewpoints. According to Leach, "Little is more important...than establishing an ethos of thoughtfulness and decency of expression in the public square. Words reflect emotion as well as meaning. They clarify—or cloud—thought and energize action, sometimes bringing out the better angels in our nature, sometimes lesser instincts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/29/AR2009112902014.html | title=E.J. Dionne Welcomes Jim Leach's Call for Civility | publisher=The Washington Post | date=30 November 2009 | accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the completion of Leach's Civility Tour, rallies for reasoning politics like [[Jon Stewart]]'s [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|Rally to Restore Sanity]] and grassroots initiatives for [[Pluralistic Rationalism|pluralistic rationalism]] in public discourse, have reflected Leach's call for civil, non-emotive and reasoning language between those with disparate religious or political ideologies.&lt;ref name="ICC3"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160202190225/http://www.twincities.com/2014/08/03/st-pauls-atheists-are-coming-out-of-the-closet/ "St. Paul's atheists are coming out of the closet," Bob Shaw, ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'', August 4, 2014]. Retrieved August 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tenth Chair of the NEH was [[William Drea Adams|William 'Bro' Adams]], who served from 2014 to 2017.

Before Adams's appointment, the NEH was headed by Acting Chair [[Carole M. Watson]]. Adams resigned his appointment on May 23, 2017, when he cited accomplishments under the "Common Good" initiative and the appointment of new administration officials.&lt;ref name="Adams-resignation"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2017-05-22 |title=NEH Chairman William D. Adams Announces Resignation |date=May 22, 2017  |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Endowment is directed by the [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH Chair]]. Advising the Chair is the National Council on the Humanities, a board of 26&amp;nbsp;distinguished private citizens who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.&lt;ref name="nch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/about/national-council-on-the-humanities | title=National Council on the Humanities | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council members serve staggered six-year terms.

===The NEH Chair===
The Endowment is directed by a [[Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities|Chair]], who has legal authority to approve all recommendations and award grants and cooperative agreements. The Chair is nominated by the President and confirmed with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The Chair's decisions are informed by recommendations from the National Council on the Humanities, peer-reviewers who are selected to read each project proposal submitted to the Endowment, as well as by the Endowment's staff.

===Major program offices===
The NEH has seven grant-making divisions and offices:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions | title=Information about the Divisions and Offices that Administer NEH Grant Programs | publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The Division of Preservation and Access''' awards grants to preserve, maintain, and improve access to primary sources in the humanities, in both digital and analog form.
* '''The Division of Public Programs''' supports projects that bring the humanities to large audiences through libraries and museums, television and radio, historic sites, and digital media.
* '''The Division of Research''' makes awards to support the publication of books in and outside the humanities.
* '''The Division of Education''' works to support and strengthen teaching of the humanities.
* '''The Office of Federal/State Partnership''' collaborates with 56 state and territory humanities councils to strengthen local programs.
* '''The Office of Challenge Grants''' administers grants intended to support centers and endowments through fundraising by humanities institutions to further long-term stability. This Office was abolished by the Trump Administration in 2017.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
* '''The Office of Digital Humanities''' advises on use of technology in the humanities and coordinates.

===Special initiatives===
These are special priorities of the endowment that indicate critical areas of the humanities as identified by the NEH Chair. They differ from the divisions of the endowment in that they do not sponsor or coordinate specific grant programs.

====Bridging Cultures initiative====
Bridging Cultures is an NEH initiative that explores ways the humanities promote understanding and mutual respect for people with diverse histories, cultures, and perspectives. Projects supported through this initiative focus on cultures globally as well as within the United States.&lt;ref name="bridging.cultures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions/bridging-cultures | title=About the Bridging Cultures Initiative | accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International projects might seek to enlarge Americans' understanding of other places and times, as well as other perspectives and intellectual traditions. American projects might explore the great variety of cultural influences on, and myriad subcultures within, American society. 

These projects might investigate how Americans have approached and attempted to surmount seemingly unbridgeable cultural divides or examine the ideals of civility and civic discourse. In connection with a focus on civic discourse, projects might explore the role of women in America's civic life as well as the civic role of women in other cultures and regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

====Standing Together====
This initiative, launched in 2014, marks a priority to make awards that promote understanding of the military experience and to support returning veterans.&lt;ref name="neh.standing.together"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/veterans/standing-together | title=NEH Veterans Initiative | accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====We the People====
''We the People'' was an NEH special funding stream initiated by NEH Chair Coles, using dedicated funds available to each Chair of the NEH, which was designed to encourage and enhance the teaching, study, and understanding of American history, culture, and democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wethepeople.gov/ | title=We the People | accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative supports projects and programs that explore significant events and themes in American nation's history, which advance knowledge of the principles that define America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ucsb.edu/thoreau/misc_awards.html |archivedate=2010-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302174451/http://www.library.ucsb.edu/thoreau/misc_awards.html |date=March 2, 2010 |title=The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NEH, the initiative led a renaissance in knowledge about American history and principles among all US citizens. The initiative was launched on Constitution Day, September 17, 2002 and active through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wethepeople.gov/about/index.html |title=About We the People |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185208/http://wethepeople.gov/about/index.html |archivedate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy projects==

==Awards==

===Jefferson Lecture===
{{Main article|Jefferson Lecture}}
Since 1972 the NEH has sponsored the [[Jefferson Lecture]] in the Humanities, which it describes as "the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities." The Jefferson Lecturer is selected each year by the National Council on the Humanities. The honoree delivers a lecture in Washington, D.C., during the spring, and receives an honorarium of $10,000. The stated purpose of the honor is to recognize "an individual who has made significant scholarly contributions in the humanities and who has the ability to communicate the knowledge and wisdom of the humanities in a broadly appealing way."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Humanities Medal and Charles Frankel Prize===
{{Main article|National Humanities Medal}}
The National Humanities Medal, inaugurated in 1997, honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities. Up to 12&amp;nbsp;medals can be awarded each year. From 1989 to 1996 the NEH awarded a similar prize known as the [[Charles Frankel]] Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/awards.html Awards and Honors] at NEH Website (retrieved January 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The new award, a bronze medallion, was designed by David Macaulay, the 1995 winner of the Frankel Prize.

==''Humanities'' magazine==
Starting in 1969, the NEH published a periodical called ''Humanities''; that original incarnation was discontinued in 1978. In 1980, ''Humanities'' magazine was relaunched ({{ISSN|0018-7526}}). It is published six times per year, with one cover article each year dedicated to profiling that year's Jefferson Lecturer. Most of its articles have some connection to NEH activities. The magazine's editor since 2007 has been journalist and author [[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/septemberoctober/ednote/editor%25E2%2580%2599s-note-septemberoctober-2007|title=Editor’s Note, September/October 2007|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 until her death in 2007, ''Humanities'' was edited by Mary Lou Beatty (who had previously been a high-ranking editor at the [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2007/marchapril/ednote/editors-note-marchapril-2007|title=Editor&amp;#039;s Note, March/April 2007|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/08/AR2007020802132.html|title=Mary Lou Beatty; Editor at NEH, Post|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|date=2007-02-09|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain anatomy==
[[File:Density of moral neuroscience studies fnint-07-00065-g001.jpg |thumb|600x600px |Areas of the brain related to moral processing and their corresponding citation density]]
The main brain regions that are involved in the regulation of moral cognition and behavior are those of the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[ventrolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], and [[amygdala]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Less pronounced areas that are involved in moral regulation include the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate gyrus]],&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Takahashi |first=Hidehiko |last2=Kato |first2=Motoichiro |last3=Matsuura |first3=Masato |last4=Mobbs |first4=Dean |last5=Suhara |first5=Tetsuya |last6=Okubo |first6=Yoshiro |date=2009-02-13 |title=When your gain is my pain and your pain is my gain: neural correlates of envy and schadenfreude |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5916 |pages=937–939 |doi=10.1126/science.1165604 |pmid=19213918 |bibcode=2009Sci...323..937T}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Posterior cingulate |posterior cingulate gyrus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Robertson |first=Diana |last2=Snarey |first2=John |last3=Ousley |first3=Opal |last4=Harenski |first4=Keith |last5=DuBois Bowman |first5=F. |last6=Gilkey |first6=Rick |last7=Kilts |first7=Clinton |date=2007-03-02 |title=The neural processing of moral sensitivity to issues of justice and care |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=755–766 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.08.014 |pmid=17174987|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/neuroethics_pubs/44 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insular cortex|anterior insula]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hsu |first=Ming |last2=Anen |first2=Cédric |last3=Quartz |first3=Steven R. |date=2008-05-23 |title=The right and the good: distributive justice and neural encoding of equity and efficiency |journal=Science |volume=320 |issue=5879 |pages=1092–1095 |doi=10.1126/science.1153651 |pmid=18467558 |bibcode=2008Sci...320.1092H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic reward pathway]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Alexandre |last2=Collette |first2=Fabienne |last3=Philippot |first3=Pierre |last4=van der Linden |first4=Martial |last5=Laureys |first5=Steven |last6=Delfiore |first6=Guy |last7=Degueldre |first7=Christian |last8=Maquet |first8=Pierre |last9=Luxen |first9=Andre |date=2003-04-01 |title=Neural correlates of "hot" and "cold" emotional processing: a multilevel approach to the functional anatomy of emotion |journal=NeuroImage |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=938–949 |pmid=12725769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of investigation==
To analyze the neuromoral circuit scientists perform experimental paradigms utilizing [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and tasks that assess [[moral reasoning]] and [[Moral Judgement Interview|judgment]]. One method includes the administration of [[Ethical dilemma|moral dilemmas]] to subjects, in the form of anecdotes, while their brain activity is measured by fMRI.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Another approach includes the presentation of emotionally charged moral or immoral scenes and images to subjects while their brain activity is measured by [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Moreover, measuring [[Biological neural network|neuronal assembly]] activity during personal and impersonal [[Ethical dilemma|moral dilemmas]] has also been a method of investigating morality at the brain level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, the pathological approach investigates tissue abnormalities in the neuromoral network and links them to potential cognitive and behavioral deficits.

==Functional order==
Normal functioning of the neuromoral network involves specific patterns of activity when performing moral tasks. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is the hub of the neuromoral circuit allowing for the processing of morally charged stimuli and the subsequent generation of states such as [[empathy]], [[Charity (practice)|charitableness]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moll |first=Jorge |last2=de Oliveira-Souza |first2=Ricardo |date=2007-08-01 |title=Moral judgments, emotions and the utilitarian brain |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=319–321 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2007.06.001 |pmid=17602852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Harenski |first=Carla L. |last2=Hamann |first2=Stephan |date=2006-03-01 |title=Neural correlates of regulating negative emotions related to moral violations |journal=NeuroImage |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=313–324 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.09.034 |pmid=16249098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Decety |first=Jean |last2=Jackson |first2=Philip L. |date=2004-06-01 |title=The functional architecture of human empathy |journal=Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=71–100 |doi=10.1177/1534582304267187 |pmid=15537986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex allows for the integration of those states, subsequent moral reasoning, and generation of the ability to override emotional states relating to morality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The orbitofrontal cortex allows for the processing of moral or immoral behaviors performed by others allowing for mapping and imitation of the observed behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shamay-Tsoory |first=Simone G. |last2=Aharon-Peretz |first2=Judith |last3=Perry |first3=Daniella |date=2009-03-01 |title=Two systems for empathy: a double dissociation between emotional and cognitive empathy in inferior frontal gyrus versus ventromedial prefrontal lesions |journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology |volume=132 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=617–627 |doi=10.1093/brain/awn279 |pmid=18971202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Iacoboni |first=Marco |last2=Mazziotta |first2=John C. |date=2007-09-01 |title=Mirror neuron system: basic findings and clinical applications |journal=Annals of Neurology |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=213–218 |doi=10.1002/ana.21198 |pmid=17721988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fabbri-Destro |first=Maddalena |last2=Rizzolatti |first2=Giacomo |date=2008-06-01 |title=Mirror neurons and mirror systems in monkeys and humans |journal=Physiology (Bethesda, Md.) |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=171–179 |doi=10.1152/physiol.00004.2008 |pmid=18556470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amygdala allows for sensory recognition of non-integrated emotional stimuli that are channeled to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for moral indexing and processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The mesolimbic reward pathway has been implicated with the generation of pleasurable feelings when a non-moral act is performed towards a hostile entity, a phenomenon called [[Schadenfreude]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The cingulate cortex allows for conflict regulation when performing an immoral action and the feeling of envy when self identified entities are overcome by non identified ones.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Normative''' generally means relating to an evaluative standard. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good or desirable or permissible and others as bad or undesirable or impermissible. A norm in this normative sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. Normative is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in this field try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grammar of Society:The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0521574907|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Norms in the Wild: How to Diagnose, Measure, and Change Social Norms|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780190622053|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Normative'' has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/227918828|title=Normativity|last=Jarvis.|first=Thomson, Judith|date=2008|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812696585|location=Chicago, Ill.|oclc=227918828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major developments in analytic philosophy has seen the reach of normativity spread to virtually all corners of the field, from ethics and the philosophy of action, to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. Saul Kripke famously showed that rules (including mathematical rules, such as the repetition of a decimal pattern) are normative in an important respect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862091562|title=Being realistic about reasons|last=Thomas,|first=Scanlon,|isbn=9780199678488|edition= First|location=Oxford|oclc=862091562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7998796|title=Wittgenstein on rules and private language : an elementary exposition|last=1940-|first=Kripke, Saul A.,|date=1982|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674954009|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=7998796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood, it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As Derek Parfit explains:

{{Quote|We can have reasons to believe something, to do something, to have some desire or aim, and to have many other attitudes and emotions, such as fear, regret, and hope. Reasons are given by facts, such as the fact that someone's finger-prints are on some gun, or that calling an ambulance would save someone's life. It is hard to explain the ''concept'' of a reason, or what the phrase 'a reason' means. Facts give us reasons, we might say, when they count in favour of our having some attitude, or our acting in some way. But 'counts in favour of' means roughly 'gives a reason for'. The concept of a reason is best explained by example. One example is the thought that we always have a reason to want to avoid being in agony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/744616054|title=On what matters Volume one|last=Derek.|first=Parfit,|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scheffler, Samuel, 1951-|isbn=9780191576706|location=Oxford|oclc=744616054}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Philosophy ==
{{main|Ethics}}
In [[philosophy]], ''normative'' statements make claims about how things should or [[Is-ought problem|ought]] to be, how to [[Value theory|value]] them, which things are [[goodness and value theory|good]] or bad, and which [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s are [[right]] or [[wrong]].  Normative claims are usually contrasted with [[Positive statement|positive]] (i.e. descriptive, [[explanation|explanatory]], or [[constative]]) claims when describing types of [[theory|theories]], [[belief]]s, or [[proposition]]s. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual statements that attempt to describe [[reality]].

For example, "children should eat vegetables", and "those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither" are normative claims. On the other hand, "vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins", and "a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both" are positive claims. Whether a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.

There are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be [[reason|rationally]] discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of [[practical reason]] extending from [[Aristotle]] through [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], which asserts that they can, and the tradition of [[emotivism]], which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content. &lt;!--last sentence/statement: i.e., objectivity vs. subjectivity(?)--&gt;

Normative statements and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]], as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. [[Thought]], [[belief]], [[emotion]], and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).

Much modern moral/ethical philosophy takes as its starting point the apparent variance between peoples and cultures regarding the ways they define what is considered to be appropriate/desirable/praiseworthy/valuable/good etc. (In other words, variance in how individuals, groups and societies define what is in accordance with their normative standards.) This has led philosophers such as [[A.J. Ayer]] and [[J.L. Mackie]] (for different reasons and in different ways) to cast doubt on the meaningfulness of normative statements. However, other philosophers, such as [[Christine Korsgaard]], have argued for a source of normative value which is independent of individuals' subjective morality and which consequently attains (a lesser or greater degree of) objectivity.

== Social sciences and economics ==
In the [[social sciences]], the term "normative" has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a [[sociological]] context, to the role of cultural '[[norm (social)|norms]]'; the shared values or institutions that [[structural functionalist]]s regard as constitutive of the [[social structure]] and [[social cohesion]]. These values and units of [[socialization]] thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that ''ought'' to (with respect to the [[norm (sociology)|norms]] implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that ''ought not'' occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially ''valued'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as "[[crime]]" or anti-social behaviour, see also [[normality (behavior)]]) the normative effects of popularly endorsed beliefs (such as "[[family values]]" or "[[common sense]]") push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological [[conservatism]].

[[Normative economics]] deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, valued) economic outcomes.

== International relations ==
In the academic discipline of [[International relations]], Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens in the ''Introduction'' to their 2008 &lt;ref&gt;''The Globalization of World Politics: An introduction to international relations'', New York, Oxford University Press {{ISBN|9780199297771}}, Fourth edition, pp.2-13&lt;/ref&gt; book make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of [[Tacit assumption|implicit assumption]]s and [[explicit assumption]]s that constitute a non-normative position, and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[Liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations)|Constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], political [[Idealism]] and political [[Globalization]].

== Law ==
{{See also|Normative jurisprudence}}
In [[law]], as an academic discipline, the term "normative" is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.

== Standards documents ==
Normative elements are defined in [[International Organization for Standardization]] Directives Part 2 as "elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions".  Provisions include "requirements", "recommendations" and "statements".  "Statements" include permissions, possibilities and capabilities.  A "requirement" is an "expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted."  It is not necessary to comply with recommendations and statements in order to comply with the standard; it is necessary to comply only with the requirements (that are denoted by the verbal form "shall").  There is much confusion between "normative" and "requirement", however the ISO terminology is supported by national standards bodies worldwide and is the legitimate description of these terms in the context of standards documents.

In [[Standardization|standard]]s terminology still used by some organisations, "normative" means "considered to be a [[wikt:prescriptive|prescriptive]] part of the standard". It characterises that part of the standard which describes what ''ought'' (see [[normative#Philosophy|philosophy]] above) to be done within the application of that standard. It is implicit that application of that standard will result in a ''valuable'' outcome (''ibid.''). For example, many standards have an introduction, preface, or summary that is considered non-normative, as well as a main body that is considered normative. "Compliance" is defined as "complies with the normative sections of the standard"; an object that complies with the normative sections but not the non-normative sections of a standard is still considered to be in compliance.

* Normative = prescriptive = how to comply
* Informative = descriptive = help with conceptual understanding

Typically, ''normative'' is contrasted with ''informative'' (referring to the standard's descriptive, explanatory or [[Positive science|positive]] content).  Informative data is supplemental information such as additional guidance, supplemental recommendations, tutorials, commentary as well as background, history, development, and relationship with other elements.  Informative data is not a requirement and doesn’t compel compliance.

The petals and sepals are above the ovary; such a flower is said to have an inferior ovary, or the flower is said to be epigynous.]]
[[File:Ovary (botany) (255 30) Tulip; cross-section.jpg|thumb|Cross section of ''[[Tulip]]'' ovary]]

In the [[flowering plant]]s, an '''ovary''' is a part of the female reproductive organ of the flower or [[gynoecium]]. Specifically, it is the part of the [[pistil]] which holds the [[ovule]](s) and is located above or below or at the point of connection with the base of the [[petals]] and [[sepals]]. The pistil may be made up of one [[carpel]] or of several fused carpels (e.g. dicarpel or tricarpel), and therefore the ovary can contain part of one carpel or parts of several fused carpels.  Above the ovary is the [[Style (botany)|style]] and the stigma, which is where the [[pollen]] lands and germinates to grow down through the style to the ovary, and, for each individual [[pollen grain]], to fertilize one individual ovule.  Some wind pollinated flowers have much reduced and modified ovaries.

== Fruits ==
A [[fruit]] is the ripened ovary or ovaries—together with [[seed]]s—from one or more flowers. The fruits of a plant are responsible for dispersing the seeds that contain the embryo and protecting the seeds as well. In many species, the fruit incorporates some surrounding tissues, or is dispersed with some non-fruit tissues.

== Parts of the ovary==
[[Locule]]s are chambers within the ovary of the flower and fruits. The locules contain the ovules (seeds), and may or may not be filled with fruit flesh. Depending on the number of locules in the ovary, fruits can be classified as uni-locular (unilocular), bi-locular, tri-locular or multi-locular. Some plants have [[septum|septa]] between the carpels; the number of locules present in a gynoecium may be equal to or less than the number of carpels, depending on whether septa are present.

The ovules are attached to parts of the interior ovary walls called the placentae. Placental areas occur in various positions, corresponding to various parts of the carpels that make up the ovary. See [[Ovule#Location within the plant]]. An obturator is present in the ovary of some plants, near the [[Micropyle (botany)|micropyle]] of each ovule. It is an outgrowth of the placenta, important in nourishing and guiding [[pollen tube]]s to the micropyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=2001  |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ovary of some types of fruit is [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscent]]; the ovary wall splits into sections called valves. There is no standard correspondence between the valves and the position of the septa; the valves may separate by splitting the septa (septicidal dehiscence) or by spitting between them (loculicidal dehiscence), or the ovary may open in other ways such as through pores or because a cap falls off.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Classification based on position ==
[[image:Ovary position.svg|300px|right|thumb|Ovary insertion: I superior II half-inferior III inferior. ''a'' androecium ''g'' gynoecium ''p'' petals ''s'' sepals ''r'' receptacle. The insertion point is where ''a'', ''p'', and ''s'' converge.]]

The terminology of the positions of ovaries is determined by the '''insertion point''', where the other floral parts ([[perianth]] and [[androecium]]) come together and attach to the surface of the ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Soltis |first1=Douglas E. |authorlink1=Douglas E. Soltis | last2=Fishbein | first2=Mark | last3=Kuzoff | first3=Robert K. | year=2003 | title=Evolution of Epigyny | journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences | volume=164 | issue=S5 | pages=S251–S264 | doi=10.1086/376876}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ovary is situated above the insertion point, it is superior; if below, inferior.

=== Superior ovary ===
A '''superior ovary''' is an ovary attached to the receptacle above the attachment of other floral parts.  A superior ovary is found in types of fleshy fruits such as [[Berry (botany)|true berries]], [[drupe]]s, etc.  A flower with this arrangement is described as '''hypogynous'''.  Examples of this ovary type include the legumes (beans and peas and their relatives).

=== Half-inferior ovary ===
A '''half-inferior ovary''' (also known as “half-superior”, “subinferior,” or “partially inferior,”) is embedded or surrounded by the receptacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Soltis |first1=Douglas E. |authorlink1=Douglas E. Soltis | last2=Hufford | first2=Larry | year=2002 | title=Ovary Position Diversity in Saxifragaceae | journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences | volume=163 | issue=2 | pages=277–293 | doi=10.1086/324528}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This occurs in flowers of the [[Lythraceae]] family, which includes the [[Crape Myrtle]]s. Such flowers are termed '''perigynous''' or '''half-epigynous'''. In some classifications, half-inferior ovaries are not recognized and are instead grouped with either the superior or inferior ovaries.

More specifically, a half-inferior ovary has nearly equal portions of ovary above and below the insertion point. Other varying degrees of inferiority can be described by other fractions. For instance, a "one-fifth inferior ovary" has approximately one fifth of its length under the insertion point. Likewise, only one quarter portion of a "three-quarters inferior ovary" is above the insertion.

=== Inferior ovary ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cucurbitaceae]] --&gt;
An '''inferior ovary''' lies below the attachment of other floral parts. A [[pome]] is a type of fleshy fruit that is often cited as an example, but close inspection of some pomes (such as ''[[Pyracantha]]'') will show that it is really a half-inferior ovary.  
Flowers with inferior ovaries are termed '''epigynous'''. Some examples of flowers with an inferior ovary are [[orchids]] (inferior capsule), ''[[Fuchsia]]'' (inferior berry), banana (inferior berry), [[Asteraceae]] (inferior achene-like fruit, called a [[Asteraceae#Fruits and seeds|cypsela]]) and the [[pepo (botany)|pepo]] of the squash, melon and gourd ([[Cucurbitaceae]]) family.

'''Place-based education''', sometimes called '''pedagogy of place''', '''place-based learning''', '''[[experiential education]]''', '''community-based education''', '''[[education for sustainability]]''', '''[[environmental education]]''' or more rarely, '''[[service learning]]''', is an educational philosophy.  The term was [https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/elfer_charles_j_201108_phd.pdf coined in the early 1990s] by Laurie Lane-Zucker of The [[Orion Society]] and Dr. John Elder of Middlebury College. Orion's early work in the area of place-based education was funded by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1996/05/29/36grant.h15.html?tkn=WVMFMa8sjs6Lnl2YCsgfSoxYe6eRxGRfaTlz|title=Grants - Education Week|date=1996-05-29|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although educators have used its principles for some time, the approach was developed initially by The Orion Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/education/item/3539/ |title=The Nature Literacy Series |publisher=Orion Magazine |date= |accessdate=2011-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918062932/http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/education/item/3539/ |archivedate=2011-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization, as well as Professor [[David Sobel]], Project Director at [[Antioch University New England]].

In his introduction to the first book specifically focused on the pedagogy, [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256984.Place_Based_Education Place-Based Education: Connecting Classrooms and Communities] ({{ISBN|978-0913098547}}), Lane-Zucker [http://yourmarkontheworld.com/place-based-education-entrepreneurship-investing-impact-economy/ describes the context within which place-based education was developed],

{{quote|In an increasingly globalized world, there are often pressures for communities and regions to subordinate themselves to the dominant economic models and to devalue their local cultural identity, traditions and history in preference to a flashily marketed homogeneity. Furthermore, at a time when industrial pollution, biodiversity/habitat loss, and aquifer depletion are becoming widespread and acute, such pressures often exacerbate the problems by encouraging unsustainable patterns of consumption and land use, and by weakening familial and community relationships that are deeply tied to the local environment. A process of disintegration occurs as basic connections to the land fray and communities become less resilient and less able to deal with the dislocations that globalization and ecological deterioration bring about. A community's health—human and more-than-human—suffers.

The path to a sustainable existence must start with a fundamental reimagining of the ethical, economic, political and spiritual foundations upon which society is based, and that this process needs to occur within the context of a deep local knowledge of place. The solutions to many of our ecological problems lie in an approach that celebrates, empowers and nurtures the cultural, artistic, historical and spiritual resources of each local community and region, and champions their ability to bring those resources to bear on the healing of nature and community.

Schools and other educational institutions can and should play a central role in this process, but for the most part they do not. Indeed, they have often contributed to the problem by educating young people to be, in David Orr's words, 'mobile, rootless and autistic toward their places.' A significant transformation of education might begin with the effort to learn how events and processes close to home relate to regional, national, and global forces and events, leading to a new understanding of ecological stewardship and community. This, I believe, supports the propagation of an enlightened localism—a local/global dialectic that is sensitive to broader ecological and social relationships at the same time as it strengthens and deepens peoples sense of community and land.

Place-based education might be characterized as the pedagogy of community, the reintegration of the individual into her homeground and the restoration of the essential links between a person and her place. Place-based education challenges the meaning of education by asking seemingly simple questions: Where am I? What is the nature of this place? What sustains this community? It often employs a process of re-storying, whereby students are asked to respond creatively to stories of their homeground so that, in time, they are able to position themselves, imaginatively and actually, within the continuum of nature and culture in that place. They become a part of the community, rather than a passive observer of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yourmarkontheworld.com/place-based-education-entrepreneurship-investing-impact-economy/|title=Place-based Education, Entrepreneurship and Investing for an "Impact Economy" {{!}} Your Mark On The World|date=2016-08-01|work=Your Mark On The World|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Place-based education seeks to help communities through employing students and school staff in solving community problems. Place-based education differs from conventional text and classroom-based education in that it understands students' local community as one of the primary resources for learning. Thus, place-based education promotes learning that is rooted in what is local—the unique history, environment, culture, economy, literature, and art of a particular place&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruraledu.org/site/c.beJMIZOCIrH/b.1073935/k.EBFA/Placebased_Learning.htm Rural Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929161138/http://www.ruraledu.org/site/c.beJMIZOCIrH/b.1073935/k.EBFA/Placebased_Learning.htm |date=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, in students' own "[[Location (geography)|place]]" or immediate schoolyard, neighborhood, town or community. According to this pedagogy, grade school students often lose what place-based educators call their "[[sense of place]]" through focusing too quickly or exclusively on national or global issues. This is not to say that international and domestic issues are peripheral to place-based education, but that students should first have a grounding in the history, culture and [[ecology]] of their surrounding environment before moving on to broader subjects.

Place-based education often involves [[hands-on learning]], [[project-based learning]], and is always related to something in the real world. Thus students embarking upon a unit about the [[Vietnam War]] might interview veterans of that war, collecting their stories for a radio-spot, newspaper article or educational brochure. In this case, the use of local people to support students' learning would not only lead to greater comprehension of the Vietnam War, but also to understanding more about the history of their community and the people in it.

Byron Fellowship is a place-based learning experience built around sustainable community development.

[[Wintergreen Studios]] is a year-round wilderness education and retreat centre in Southeastern Ontario offering workshops and meeting facilities. Wintergreen's environment and architecture have been designed to enable people to engage in mindful living and return to their homes and workplaces inspired and refreshed.

'''Regenerative cooling''', in the context of [[rocket]] engine design, is a configuration in which some or all of the [[propellant]] is passed through tubes, channels, or in a jacket around the [[combustion chamber]] or nozzle to cool the engine. This is effective because the fuel (and sometimes the oxidizer) are good coolants. The heated propellant is then fed into a special gas generator or injected directly into the main combustion chamber.

==History==
In 1857 [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]] introduced the concept of regenerative cooling.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Charles William Siemens, "Improvements in refrigerating and producing ice, and in apparatus or machinery for that purpose", British patent no. 2064 (filed: July 29, 1857).
*  [[Siemens cycle]]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 May 1898, [[James Dewar]] used regenerative cooling to become the first to statically liquefy hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  James Dewar (1898) [https://archive.org/stream/proceedings63royauoft#page/256/mode/2up "Preliminary note on the liquefacion of hydrogen and helium,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''63''' :  256-258.
*  {{cite web|title=Liquid Hydrogen as a Propulsion Fuel, 1945-1959|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/app-a1.htm|website=NASA  History program Office|publisher=History.nasa.gov|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of regenerative cooling was also mentioned in 1903 in an article by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsiolkovsky, Konstantin E. (1903) "Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами" (The exploration of cosmic space by means of reaction devices), ''Научное обозрение'' (Scientific Review) '''5''' :  44-75. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Goddard]] built the first regeneratively cooled engine in 1923, but rejected the scheme as too complex.&lt;ref&gt;Frank H. Winter, ''Rockets Into Space'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nyDsGkPqocC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A regeneratively cooled engine was built by the Italian researcher, [[Gaetano Arturo Crocco]] in 1930.  The first Soviet engines to employ the technique were [[Fridrikh Tsander]]'s OR-2 tested in March 1933 and the ORM-50, bench tested in November 1933 by [[Valentin Glushko]].  The first German engine of this type was also tested in March 1933 by Klaus Riedel in the [[Verein für Raumschiffahrt|VfR]]. The Austrian scientist [[Eugen Sänger]] was particularly famous for experiments with engine cooling starting in 1933; however, most of his experimental engines were water-cooled or cooled by an extra circuit of propellant.

The [[V-2 rocket]] engine, the most powerful of its time at 25 [[tonne-force|tons]] (245 [[kilonewton|kN]]) of thrust, was regeneratively cooled, in a design by [[Walter Thiel]], by fuel lines coiled around the outside of the combustion chamber.  This was an inefficient design that required the burning of diluted alcohol at low chamber pressure to avoid melting the engine.  The American [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]] engine used the same design.[[File:Roof of combustion chamber V2 rocket engine showing the double wall for regenerative cooling.jpg|thumb|Double walled construction of a V2 rocket engine.]]

A key innovation in regenerative cooling was the Soviet U-1250 engine designed by [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev]] in 1945.  Its combustion chamber was lined with a thin copper sheet supported by the corrugated steel wall of the chamber.  Fuel flowed through the corrugations and absorbed heat very efficiently.  This permitted more energetic fuels and higher chamber pressures, and it is the basic plan used in all Russian engines since.  Modern American engines solve this problem by lining the combustion chamber with [[Brazing|brazed]] copper or nickel alloy tubes (although recent engines like in the [[RS-68]] have started to use the Russian technique which is cheaper to construct). The American style of lining the engine with copper tubes is called the "spaghetti construction", and the concept is credited to Edward A. Neu at [[Reaction Motors]] Inc. in 1947.

==Heat flow and temperature==
The heat flow through the chamber wall is very high; 1-20 MW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not uncommon.

The amount of heat that can flow into the coolant is controlled by many factors including the temperature difference between the chamber and the coolant, the [[heat transfer coefficient]], the [[thermal conductivity]] of the chamber wall, the velocity in the coolant channels and the velocity of the gas flow in the chamber or the nozzle.

Two [[boundary layer]]s form: one in the hot gas in the chamber and the other in the coolant within the channels.

Very typically most of the temperature drop occurs in the gas boundary layer since gases are relatively poor conductors. This boundary layer can be destroyed however by [[combustion instability|combustion instabilities]], and wall failure can follow very soon afterwards.

The boundary layer within the coolant channels can also be disrupted if the coolant is at subcritical pressure and film boils; the gas then forms an insulating layer and the wall temperature climbs very rapidly and soon fails. However, if the coolant engages in [[nucleate boiling]] but does not form a film, this helps disrupt the coolant boundary layer and the gas bubbles formed rapidly collapse; this can triple the maximum heat flow. However, many modern engines with turbopumps use supercritical coolants, and these techniques can be seldom used.

Regenerative cooling is seldom used in isolation; film cooling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.umn.edu/labs/tcht/measurements/what.html |title=What is Film Cooling? |publisher=Me.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; curtain cooling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Nowicki |url=http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.space.tech/2005-01/0059.html |title=sci.space.tech: Curtain cooling with molten salt |publisher=Sci.tech-archive.net |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  transpiration cooling, [[radiation cooling]] are frequently employed as well.

==Mechanical considerations==
With regenerative cooling, the pressure in the cooling channels is significantly higher than the chamber pressure, hence the inner liner is under compression, while the outer wall of the engine is under significant [[hoop stress]]es.

The metal of the inner liner is greatly weakened by the high temperature, and also undergoes significant thermal expansion at the inner surface while the cold-side wall of the liner constrains the expansion. This sets up significant thermal stresses that can cause the inner surface to crack or [[Crazing|craze]] after multiple firings particularly at the throat.

In addition the thin inner liner requires mechanical support to withstand the compressive loading due to the propellant's pressure; this support is usually provided by the side walls of the cooling channels and the backing plate.

The inner liner is usually constructed of relatively high temperature, high thermal conductivity materials; traditionally copper or nickel based alloys have been used.

Several different manufacturing techniques can be used to create the complex geometry necessary for regenerative cooling. These include a corrugated metal sheet brazed between the inner and outer liner; hundreds of pipes brazed into the correct shape, or an inner liner with milled cooling channels and an outer liner around that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/JournalsOnline/PDFFiles/07484658_v19n6/aiaa/07484658/v19n6/s3.pdf?CFID=3391727&amp;CFTOKEN=38326472&amp;jsessionid=5c301cc251e346172939TR |title=History of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines in Russia, Formerly the Soviet Union |author=George P.

The geometry can also be created through direct metal [[3D printing]], as seen on some newer designs such as the [[SpaceX]] [[SuperDraco]] rocket engine.

In many historical societies, the position of [[kingship]] carries a [[Sacred|sacral]] meaning, that is, it is identical with that of a [[high priest]] and [[judge]]. The concept of [[theocracy]] is related, although a '''sacred king''' need not necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather, the temporal position has a religious significance.

== History ==
[[Sir James George Frazer]] identified - or invented - the concept of the sacred king in his study ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915), the title of which refers to the myth of the [[Rex Nemorensis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.bartleby.com/196/|title= The Golden Bough|last= Frazer|first= James George, Sir|publisher= New York: The Macmillan Co|year= 1922|isbn= |location= Bartleby.com|pages= |at= http://www.bartleby.com/196/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer gives numerous examples, cited below, and was an inspiration for the [[myth and ritual school]].&lt;ref&gt;R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the [[myth and ritual]], or myth-ritualist, theory" is disputed;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Myth: A Very Short Introduction|last= Segal|first= Robert A.|publisher= Oxford UP|year= 2004|isbn= |location= Oxford|pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common [[paradigms]], but not that one developed from the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Poetics of Myth|last= Meletinsky|first= Eleazar Moiseevich|publisher= Routledge|year= 2000|isbn= 0-415-92898-2|location= |pages= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Frazer, the notion has [[prehistoric religion|prehistoric roots]] and occurs worldwide, on [[Java]] as in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], with [[shaman]]-kings credited with [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rainmaking]] and assuring [[Fertile (disambiguation) | fertility]] and good fortune. The king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people, meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim in a [[human sacrifice]], either killed at the end of his term in the position, or sacrificed in a time of crisis (e.g. the [[Blót]] of [[Domalde]]).

The [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] flogged a newly-selected king (''[[Ashantehene]]'') before [[enthronement|enthroning]] him.

From the [[Ancient Near Eastern religion|Bronze Age in the Near East]], the enthronement and [[anointment]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] is a central religious ritual, reflected in the titles "[[Messiah]]" or "[[Christ]]", which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus [[Sargon of Akkad]] described himself as "deputy of [[Ishtar]]",{{cn|date=August 2017}} just as the modern [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Pope]] takes the role of the "[[Vicar of Christ]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Vicar of Christ|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings are styled as [[shepherd]]s from earliest times, e.g., the term applied to [[Ensí|Sumerian princes]] such as [[Lugalbanda]] in the 3rd millennium BCE. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of [[leadership]] and the responsibility to supply food and protection, as well as superiority.

As the mediator between the people and the divine, the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. [[Solomon]] or [[Gilgamesh]]) or vision (e.g. via [[oneiromancy]]).

== Study ==
Study of the concept was introduced by [[Sir James George Frazer]] in his influential book ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in [[Romanticism]] and [[Esotericism]] (e.g. [[Julius Evola]]) and some currents of [[Neopaganism]] ([[Theodism]]).
The school of [[Pan-Babylonianism]] derived much of the religion described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] from cults of sacral kingship in ancient [[Babylonia]].

The so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English "myth and ritual school" concentrated on anthropology and folklore, while the Scandinavian "Uppsala school" emphasized Semitological study.

=== Frazer's interpretation ===
A sacred king, according to the systematic interpretation of [[mythology]] developed by Frazer in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (published 1890), was a [[monarch|king]] who represented a [[solar deity]] in a periodically re-enacted [[fertility rite]]. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-[[Europe]]an, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the [[Goddess]] was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine [[John Barleycorn]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the [[winter solstice]] to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a "[[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]]". [[Osiris]], [[Adonis]], [[Dionysus]], [[Attis]] and many other familiar figures from [[Greek mythology]] and [[classical antiquity]] were re-interpreted in this mold. The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a [[sacrifice]], to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead.

Especially in Europe during Frazer's early twentieth century heyday, it launched a [[cottage industry]] of amateurs looking for "[[paganism|pagan]] survivals" in such things as traditional [[fair]]s, [[maypole]]s, and folk arts like [[Morris dance|morris dancing]]. It was widely influential in [[literature]], being alluded to by [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound]], and in [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'', among other works.

[[Robert Graves]] used Frazer's work in ''The Greek Myths'' and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and in the fictional ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]'' he depicted a future in which the institution of a sacrificial sacred King is revived. [[Margaret Murray]], the principal theorist of [[witchcraft]] as a "pagan survival," used Frazer's work to propose the thesis that many [[Kings of England]] who died as kings, most notably [[William II of England|William Rufus]], were secret pagans and [[witch]]es, whose deaths were the re-enactment of the [[human sacrifice]] that stood at the centre of Frazer's myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Divine King in England: a study in anthropology|last=Murray|first=Margaret Alice|publisher=London, Faber &amp; Faber|year=1954|isbn=9780404184285|location=British Library|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An idea used by [[fantasy writer]] [[Katherine Kurtz]] in her novel ''Lammas Night''.

Sinyangwe was born circa 1990.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He grew up in [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] neighborhood of [[Orlando, Florida]] and attended [[Winter Park High School]] in the [[International Baccalaureate|International Baccalaureat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e program.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordeiro|first1=Monivette|title=How an Orlando data scientist is helping #BlackLivesMatter make the case against police violence|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/how-an-orlando-data-scientist-is-helping-the-blacklivesmatter-movement-make-the-case-against-police-violence/Content?oid=2478826|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=Orlando Weekly|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has discussed the influence of his upbringing in Florida, where he was a black child often surrounded by white peers, on his eventual career trajectory; he was shaken and moved to action after the 2013 [[Trial of George Zimmerman|acquittal of George Zimmerman]] in the shooting death of [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin]] in [[Sanford, Florida]], where Sinyangwe had regularly attended soccer practice: "I was that kid. I could have been Trayvon. That’s why it hit me so personally and that’s why I realized that needed to be something that took the priority in terms of my focus."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sinyangwe graduated from [[Stanford University]], where he studied how race intersects with American politics, economics, and class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marusic|first1=Kristina|title=This Map Of Police Violence Aims To Create A Path To Justice|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2133351/map-police-violence/|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=MTV News|date=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Sinyangwe started his career at PolicyLink with the Promise Neighborhoods Institute.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHxqDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT476&amp;ots=ftZuIq_nxZ&amp;dq=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PT486#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Handbook of Developments in Digital Journalism Studies|last=Richardson|first=Allissa V.|date=2018-09-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781351982085|editor-last=Eldrige II|editor-first=Scott|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=28.

With other activists, Sinyangwe founded We the Protestors, an organization aimed at developing a set of digital tools to support [[Black Lives Matter]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3064214/meet-the-startup-building-the-digital-civil-rights-movement|title=Meet The Startup Building The Digital Civil Rights Movement|last=Peters|first=Adele|date=2016-10-03|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; We the Protestors projects include a database of police killings, Mapping Police Violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hellman|first1=Jaime|title=No clear picture on how many people are killed by police|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/Ali-Velshi-On-Target/articles/2015/5/28/No-data-on-how-many-killed-by-police-in-America.html|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=Al Jazeera America|date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a platform of policy solutions to end police violence called [[Campaign Zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/the-latest-numbers-on-police-killings-show-the-problem-1793853657|title=The latest numbers on police killings show the problem may be worse than we thought|last=Meyerson|first=Collier|work=Splinter|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/05/20/activist-samuel-sinyangwe-louisiana-mass-incarceration|title=Activist Samuel Sinyangwe Sheds Light On Louisiana’s Horrible Mass Incarceration Problem|last=Lawler|first=Opheli Garcia|date=May 20, 2017|work=The Fader|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinyangwe also serves as a data scientist for OurStates.org, a project focused on state legislatures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/981351/black-lives-matter-activists-turn-attention-to-statehouses.html|title=Black Lives Matter activists turn attention to statehouses|last=Whack|first=Errin Haines|date=April 3, 2017|website=Albuquerque Journal|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Mckesson and [[Brittany Packnett|Brittney Packnett]] founded the [[Resistance Manual]], an open-source project aimed at connecting anti-racist activists with activists focused on intersecting issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/deray-launches-resistance-manual-an-open-source-site-designed-to-take-on-trump/|title=DeRay and Stay Woke Activists Launch Resistance Manual, an Open-Source Site Designed To Take on Trump|last=Ellefson|first=Lindsey|date=January 17, 2017|website=Mediaite|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shade tree''' is a large tree whose primary role is to provide shade in the surrounding environment due to its spreading [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and [[crown (botany)|crown]], where it may give shelter from [[sunlight]] in the heat of the summer for people who seek recreational needs in [[urban parks]] and house [[Front yard|yard]]s, and thus, also protecting them from the sun's harmful [[UV rays]] and [[sunburn]]s. Therefore, some shade trees may be grown specifically for the comfort of the population due to their convenient shelter. 

Furthermore, shade trees are also effective in reducing the energy used in cooling homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/all-about-shade-trees All About Shade Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular shade trees==
Some of the most popular shade trees in [[temperate countries]] are [[oak]]s, [[Platanaceae|plane trees]], [[willow]]s, [[birch]]es, [[beech]]es, [[maple]]s, [[ash (tree)|ashes]], [[Tilia|lindens]], and [[elm]]s. In subtropical countries like Australia and India, [[figs]] are popular choices as shade trees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.specialitytrees.com.au/trees/categories/shade-tree-a5tx6 Shade Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tropical countries]], trees such as the [[African tulip tree]] and some [[Erythrina]] species are often planted as shade trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Products/AFDbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1756 AgroForestryTree Database - Species information] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113150200/http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Products/AFDbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1756 |date=2013-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species===
These trees are commonly grown, and/or used, as shade trees due to their protuberant size:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.winterhill.com.au/trees/shadetree/ Winterhill Tree Farm - Shade Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/factsheets/shade-trees/9429346 ABC - Gardening Australia - Shade Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/426/426-610/426-610_pdf.pdf Selecting Landscape Plants: Shade Trees] by Diane Relf, Extension Specialist, Horticulture, Bonnie Appleton, Extension Specialist, Horticulture, [[Virginia Tech]] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Planting==
There are a few factors to consider when choosing a shade tree: [[deciduous]]ness, coverage, longevity, and the ability of the roots to damage foundations. Shade trees can enhance the privacy of a [[back garden|garden]], [[patio]], or [[back yard]], by obstructing the view of outsiders.  A disadvantage is that in cool climates, an abundance of shade trees may lead to a dank environment in any nearby buildings or gardens. Shade trees must not be planted near chimneys as flying fire sparks can ignite tree branches which could cause rapidly expanding fires.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

Planting shade trees around a home can also reduce the energy that homeowners use in the summer months. Planting shade trees in locations near a home air conditioner can keep the air conditioner cooler which helps it run more efficiently, so less energy is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arborday.org/trees/climatechange/summerShade.cfm|title=How to Plant Trees to Conserve Energy for Summer Shade - Climate Change at arborday.org|website=www.arborday.org|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">{{for|the [[astrodynamics]] term|sphere of influence (astrodynamics)}}

The '''sphere of influence''' is a region around a [[supermassive black hole]] in which the [[gravitational potential]] of the black hole dominates the gravitational potential of the host [[galaxy]]. The radius of the sphere of influence is called the "(gravitational) influence radius".

There are two definitions in common use for the radius of the sphere of influence. The first&lt;ref name=Peebles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peebles|first=J.|title=Star Distribution Near a Collapsed Object|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=December 1972 | volume=178 | pages=371–376 | doi=10.1086/151797|bibcode = 1972ApJ...178..371P }}&lt;/ref&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;r_h = \frac{GM_{\rm BH}}{\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where M&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the black hole, ''σ'' is the stellar [[velocity dispersion]] of the host [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].
 
The second definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Merritt | first=David | authorlink=David Merritt |editor-first=Luis |editor-last=Ho |title=Coevolution of Black Holes and Galaxies | journal=Coevolution of Black Holes and Galaxies |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2004 |pages=263–275 |chapter=Single and Binary Black Holes and their Influence on Nuclear Structure | series=Carnegie Observatories Astrophysics Series | volume=1 | bibcode=2004cbhg.symp..263M | chapter-url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521824494#contributors|arxiv = astro-ph/0301257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the radius at which the enclosed mass in stars equals twice M&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

&lt;math&gt;M_\star(r&lt;r_h) = 2 M_{\rm BH} &lt;/math&gt;.

Which definition is most appropriate depends on the physical question that is being addressed. The first definition takes into account the bulge's overall effect on the motion of a star, since &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is determined in part by stars that have moved far from the black hole. The second definition compares the force from the black hole to the local force from the stars.

It is a minimum requirement that the sphere of influence be well [[Angular resolution|resolved]] in order that the mass of the black hole be determined dynamically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ferrarese | first = Laura | last2 = Ford | first2 = Holland

&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Team KART''' is a group of students  from [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; who like to explore the practical side of automotive engineering.

Team KART is officially a sponsored research project under the Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy Cell (SRIC) and the department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. The team designs, fabricates, manufactures and tests Formula Style race cars and represents IIT Kharagpur at various National and International events like Formula Student (UK), Formula Student Russia and Formula Design Challenge India.

==History==
Its foundation was laid in 2008. It was an outcome of efforts of  few enthusiastic founding members and faculty advisers. The team took a solid form with the support of Prof. PP Chakraborty (present Director, IIT Kharagpur) and Prof. Sunando Dasgupta (present Dean SRIC, IIT Kharagpur). Sidhartha Khastgir became the first team leader and steered the team through the difficult initial stages where the team faced shortage of funds and technical knowledge. Since then it has grown to become IIT Kharagpur’s largest student project encompassing around forty students from ten departments. Ganesh Kumar M. became the second team leader and held responsibility for three years and oversaw the development of K-1 and K-2.

To date the team has successfully made four cars - the KX-1, the K-1, the K-2 and the K-3. K-2 competed at Formula Student UK 2013. Several design oversights in K2 were fixed in K-2.2 by a new chassis and intake-exhaust system; which competed at Formula Design Challenge 2015. The latest car K-3 is a completely new car with many modifications and innovations. It will participate in Formula Student Russia.

==Formula Student==
Formula Student (FS) is Europe's most established educational motorsport competition, run by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] (IMechE).  Universities from across the globe are challenged to design and build a single-seat racing car in order to compete in static and dynamic events, which demonstrate their understanding and test the performance of the vehicle. The format of the event is such that it provides an ideal opportunity for the students to demonstrate and improve their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of a motorsport competition.

==Formula Bharat==
Formula Bharat is an engineering design competition in which students from colleges and universities all over India, compete with a life-size Formula-style vehicle in areas of engineering design, overall cost, marketability and dynamic performance. Being identical to the global student hosted in around eleven countries per year, the event encourages students to gain hands-on practical experience, while applying engineering theories studied in the classroom. It is hosted and managed by Mobility Engineering Consortium Pvt. Ltd., an organization dedicated towards hosting mobility-related competitions for students.

==Cars==
===KX-1===
The KX-1 was the team's first effort to build a car. The 'X' in the name stands for experiment as the car was the very first attempt of the completely novice team. The car was powered by a [[Honda CBR600RR]] engine which has henceforth powered all the cars prior to the K-3.[[File:Kartkx1.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;big&gt;KX-1&lt;/big&gt;|170x170px]]

The team participated at [[Formula Student]], UK 2010. The participation was however limited to static events. The team stood ninth in the cost report analysis, as the car was very cost effective in its design. The team was one of the six teams to be nominated for the [[Airbus]] Teamwork Award.

===K-1===
The K-1 was a major leap forward for the team. It was improved manifold from the first car. The car was powered by a Honda CBR600RR engine just like its predecessor.

The team participated at Formula Student, UK 2011 with the car. However the team was restricted to participate only in the static events as the car had failed to clear the stringent scrutiny tests before the dynamic events. But impressive performance in the static events saw team becoming one of the top three rookie teams at the event. The team again became one of the six teams to be nominated for the Airbus Teamwork Award.

===K-2===
With a new car, K-2, the team participated at Formula Student, UK 2013. The car was powered by a Honda CBR 600 engine just like its predecessors. There was significant improvement in the car, a new plenum had been designed and manufactured in–house in rapid prototyping for better intake. New and more efficient SLA suspensions were implemented.

It was the team's most successful visit yet with the team clearing all the six scrutinizing inspections namely tech, safety, chassis, noise, brake and tilt, as per the rules &amp; norms governed by the [[Motor Sports Association|MSA]] (Motor Sport Association) and [[SAE International|SAE]] (Society of Automotive Engineers). Out of the six Indian teams, Team KART were one among the two teams to qualify for the dynamic events. The team competed in the endurance test. The team managed to secure 43rd position in Business Presentation and 45th in Cost and Sustainability Design Report and stood 67th overall among 120 participating teams.

===K-2.2===
The K-2.2 was the upgraded and improved version of K2. The car was powered by a Honda CBR 600RR engine. A consequential improvement could be seen in the car. A new impact attenuator was added and the intake diffuser, throttle body and air filter had been changed. Another addition to the K2.2 was the new Scorpion Carbon fibre muffler, which was the first carbon fibre part of the car. The size of the radiator fan had also been increased for better performance.

The team participated in [[Formula Design Challenge]] 2015 and passed technical scrutiny. Although a seized engine prevented the team from taking part in the dynamic events, nonetheless it was a great learning experience for the whole team. The team bagged the first runners up position in Business Presentation and Cost Report, second in Business Plan Presentation &amp; second in Cost and Manufacturing Report.

'''The Burrard Street Journal''' (or BSJ) is an online satire news website based in [[Vancouver]], BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.burrardstreetjournal.com/about-burrard-street-journal/ | title= The Burrard Street Journal – (Burrard Street Football) | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site gained notoriety in August 2016 after a number of websites reported a BSJ article about then [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] moving to Canada as fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/obama-moving-to-canada-hoax | last= Silverman | first= Craig | date= 12 August 2016 | title= A Bunch Of Conservative Sites Fell For A Hoax Claiming Obama Will Move To Canada If Trump Wins | website= [[BuzzFeed]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.torontosun.com/2016/08/12/sorry-us-the-jokes-on-you-obama-wont-be-moving-to-canada-if-trump-wins | date= 12 August 2016 | title= Sorry U.S., the joke's on you: Obama won't be moving to Canada if Trump wins | website= [[Toronto Sun]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Burrard Street Journal articles and videos have been reported as real news. In July 2016, an article titled 'Trump Claims America Should Never Have Given Canada Its Independence'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url= https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/20/is-trump-trolling-the-white-house-press-corps | last= Marantz | first= Andrew | date= 20 March 2017 | title= Is Trump Trolling the White House Press Corps? | magazine= [[The New Yorker]] | accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shared over 9,000 times and in March 2016, an edited BSJ video reporting [[Donald Trump]] building a wall with Canada was shared over 50,000 times and has received 4.5 million views as of March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | date = 22 March 2016 | title = Breaking News: Donald J.

The '''University of Brasília''' ({{lang-pt|Universidade de Brasília}}, '''UnB''') is a [[federal government|federal]] [[public university|public]] [[university]] in [[Brasília]], the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Brazil]]. It was founded in 1960 and has since consistently been named among the top five Brazilian universities and the top twenty universities in [[South America]] by [[Times Higher Education]] (THE). 

It admits [[undergraduate]] and [[post-graduate]] students via a yearly [[vestibular]]{{cn|date=November 2018}} and through [[ENEM]] and is most renowned for its courses in [[economics]], [[international affairs]], [[law]] and [[political science]].

==History==
[[File:UNB.BR.JPG|thumb|left|University of Brasília library]]
[[File:ICC UnB.jpg|thumb|right|Central Institute of Sciences - ICC ("Minhocão")]]
The University of Brasilia Foundation was founded on December 15, 1961. Professor [[Darcy Ribeiro]], who became its first leader, was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of its creation. Architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] designed its main building, the 700 m long ''Instituto Central de Ciências'' (ICC), nicknamed ''Minhocão''.

The institution was created on April 21, 1962 by [[educator]] Anísio Teixeira and [[anthropology|anthropologist]] professor [[Darcy Ribeiro]]. As of 2010, it employed 1,757 faculty and 2,391 servants, and had over 30,000 [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] and [[undergraduate]] students. Each semester, the University of Brasília accepts nearly 2,000 incoming students for its 61 undergraduate programs. On the graduate level, the university offers 49 [[master's degrees]] and 27 [[doctoral]] programs.

==Academics==

The university was one of the first in Brazil to admit students via [[Programa de Avaliação Seriada]] (PAS), an alternative evaluation which tests [[high school]] students once a year bypassing [[vestibular]].

Each semester, the University of Brasília accepts nearly 2,000 incoming students from a pool of approximately 25,000 candidates for its 61 daytime or evening undergraduate programs. At the graduate level, the university offers 56 [[Master's degree|masters]] programs and 31 [[doctorate]] programs. It also offers advanced non-degree programs, many of them conducted in other Brazilian States, such as [[Bahia]], [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], [[Rondônia]], [[Goiás]] and [[Rio Grande do Norte]]. The Technological and Scientific Development National Council (CNPq) and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) support most of these courses, offering scholarships and research grants.

Distance education is an expanding activity in UnB, being managed by the Center for Open, Continuous and Long Distance Education (CEAD) and the School of Education. The United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) sponsors the Long Distance Education chair at UnB.&lt;ref name="rank2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unb.br|title=UnB - Universidade de Brasília|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Ranking==

Its programs in [[economics]], [[international relations]] and [[political science]] are ranked first among public universities in the country.

The University of Brasilia has been ranked one of the top five public universities in Brazil by [[Editora Abril]]'s ''Guia do Estudante''. It ranks eighth in the list of the best universities in the country.&lt;ref name="rank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guiadoestudante.abril.com.br/|title=Guia do Estudante|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{psychoanalysis}}
'''Wilhelm Stekel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃteːkəl|lang}}; 18 March 1868 – 25 June 1940) was an Austrian physician and [[psychologist]], who became one of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s earliest followers, and was once described as "Freud's most distinguished pupil".&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Wittels, ''Sigmund Freud: His Personality, His Teaching, &amp; His School'' (London 1924) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ernest Jones]], "Stekel may be accorded the honour, together with Freud, of having founded the first psycho-analytic society"; while he also described him as "a naturally gifted psychologist with an unusual flair for detecting repressed material."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (London 1964), p. 312 and p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; He later had a falling-out with Freud, who announced in November 1912 that "Stekel is going his own way".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for our Time''(London 1989) p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
His works are translated and published in many languages.

==Career==
Born in [[Boiany]], [[Bukovina]], he wrote a book called ''Auto-erotism: A Psychiatric Study of Onanism and Neurosis'', first published in English in 1950. He is also credited with coining the term ''[[paraphilia]]'' to replace ''perversion''.&lt;ref name="stekel1922"&gt;Stekel, Wilhelm (1930), Sexual Aberrations: The Phenomenon of Fetishism in Relation to Sex, translated from the 1922 original German edition by S. Parker. Liveright Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; He analysed, among others, the psychoanalysts [[Otto Gross]] and [[A. S. Neill]], as well as Freud's first biographer, [[Fritz Wittels]].  The latter paid tribute to "his strange ease in understanding" but commented, "The trouble with Stekel's analysis was that it almost invariably reached an impasse when the so-called [[negative transference]] grew stronger".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Timms ed., ''Freud and the Child Woman: The Memoirs of Fritz Wittels'' (London 1995), p. 113 and 115&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography was published in 1950.

==Contributions to psychoanalytic theory==
===Theory of neurosis===
Stekel made significant contributions to symbolism in dreams, "as successive editions of ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' attest, with their explicit acknowledgement of Freud's debt to Stekel":&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; "the works of Wilhelm Stekel and others...since taught me to form a truer estimate of the extent and importance of symbolism in dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Preface to the Third Edition", ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' (London 1991) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering obsessional doubts, Stekel said,&lt;blockquote&gt;
In anxiety the libido is transformed into organic and somatic symptoms; in doubt, the libido is transformed into intellectual symptoms. The more intellectual someone is, the greater will be the doubt component of the transformed forces. Doubt becomes pleasure sublimated as intellectual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Stekel, "The Doubt", ''Compulsion and Doubt'' (London: Peter Nevill, 1950), p. 92.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stekel wrote one of a set of three early "Psychoanalytic studies of psychical impotence" referred to approvingly by Freud: "Freud had written a preface to Stekel's book".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (London 1991) p. 248 and n&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this may be Stekel's "elaboration of the idea that everyone, and in particular neurotics, has a peculiar form of sexual gratification which is alone adequate".&lt;ref&gt;Wittels, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud credited Stekel as a potential forerunner when pondering the possibility that (for obsessional neurotics) "in the order of development hate is the precursor of love.  This is perhaps the meaning of an assertion by Stekel (1911 [''Die Sprache des Traumes''], 536), which at the time I found incomprehensible, to the effect that hate and not love is the primary emotional relation between men".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''on Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987), p. 143-4&lt;/ref&gt; The same work is credited by Otto Fenichel as establishing 'the symbolic significance of right and left...''right'' meaning ''correct'' and ''left'' meaning ''wrong'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, 'The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Less flatteringly, Fenichel also associated it with "a comparatively large school of pseudo analysis which held that the patient should be 'bombarded' with 'deep interpretations,'"&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; a backhanded tribute to the extent of Stekel's early following in the wake of his break with Freud.

===Contributions to the theory of fetishism and of perversion===
Stekel contrasted what he called "normal fetishes" from extreme interests: "They become pathological only when they have pushed the whole love object into the background and themselves appropriate the function of a love object, e.g., when a lover satisfies himself with the possession of a woman's shoe and considers the woman herself as secondary or even disturbing and superfluous (p. 3).&lt;ref name="stekel1922"/&gt;
Stekel also deals differently than Freud with the problem of perversion. A lot of perversions are defense mechanisms (Schutzbauten) of the moral “self”; they represent hidden forms of asceticism. To Freud, the primal sexual venting meant health, while neuroses were created because of repressing sexual drives. Stekel, on the other hand, points out the significance of the repressed religious “self” in neuroses and indicates that apart from the repressed sexuality type, there is also a repressed morality type. This type is created in the conditions of sexual licentiousness while being opposed to doing it at the same time.
In the latter instance, 'Stekel holds that fetichism is the patient's unconscious religion'.&lt;ref&gt;Wittels, ''Sigmund Freud'' p. 195n&lt;/ref&gt; "Normal" fetishes for Stekel contributed more broadly to choice of lifestyle: thus "choice of vocation was actually an attempt to solve mental conflicts through the displacement of them", so that doctors for Stekel were "voyeurs who have transferred their original sexual current into the art of diagnosis".&lt;ref&gt;H. Freeman, ''Seminars in Psychosexual Disorders'' (1998) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaining of Freud's tendency to indiscretion, [[Ernest Jones]] wrote that he had told him "the nature of Stekel's sexual perversion, which he should not have and which I have never repeated to anyone".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, p. 187n&lt;/ref&gt; Stekel's "elaboration of the idea that everyone, and in particular every neurotic, has a peculiar form of sexual gratification which is alone adequate"&lt;ref&gt;Wittels, ''Sigmund Freud'' p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; may thus have been grounded in personal experience.

On [[sado-masochism]], "Stekel has described the essence of the sadomasochistic act to be humiliation".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Griffin, ''Pornography and silence'' (London 1988) p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud's critique of Stekel's theory of the origin of phobias===
In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'', Freud wrote of the "high-sounding phrase, 'every fear is ultimately the fear of death'" — associated with Stekel (1908) — that it "has hardly any meaning, and at any rate cannot be justified",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987), p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; evidence perhaps (as with psychic impotence and love/hate) of his continuing engagement with the thought of his former associate.

===On technique===
Stekel "was also an innovator in technique...devis[ing] a form of short-term therapy called active analysis which has much in common with some modern form of counselling and therapy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/stekel-wilhelm Francis Clark-Lowes: Stekel, Wilhelm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===On aesthetics===
Stekel maintained that "in every child there slumbered a creative artist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://heksis.com/index1.html?http%3A%2F%2Fheksis.com%2Findex_pliki%2Fheksis_1_2010%2Fteksty_2_2010%2Fen%2Fwilhelm-stekel-en.htm Wilhelm Stekel, ''Poetry and Neurosis"'']&lt;/ref&gt; In connection with the psychoanalytic examination of the roots of art, however, he emphasised that "...the Freudian interpretation, no matter how far it be carried, never offers even the rudest criterion of 'artistic' excellence...we are investigating only the impulse which drives people to create".&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne K. Langer]], ''Philosophy in a New Key'' (USA 1974), pp. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt; Analyzing the dreams of artists and non-artists alike, Stekel pointed out that "at the level of symbol production the poet does not differ from the most prosaic soul...Is it not remarkable that the great poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and the unknown little woman...should have constructed such similar dreams?".&lt;ref&gt;Langer, p. 208n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Stekel committed suicide in London by taking an overdose of [[Aspirin]] "to end the pain of his [[prostate]] and the [[diabetis|diabetic]] [[gangrene]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Lester |title=Suicide and the Holocaust |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |year=2006 |page=63 |isbn=1594544271 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=R1nkj-xSzYgC&amp;pg=PA63 books.google]&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium]] on 29 June 1940. His ashes lie in section 3-V of the Garden of Remembrance but there is no memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Golders Green Crematorium guide notes&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married twice and left two children.&lt;ref name="nytdeath"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff report |date=June 28, 1940 |title=Wilhelm Stekel, Once Freud's Aide; Former Chief Assistant to the Psychoanalyst Wrote Works on Mental Maladies |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1940/06/28/archives/wilhelm-stekel-once-freuds-aide-former-chief-assistant-to-the.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stekel's autobiography was published posthumously, edited by his former personal assistant [[Emil Gutheil]] and his wife Hilda Binder Stekel.&lt;ref name="wertham1950"&gt;Wertham, Frederic (June 11, 1950). He Worked With Freud. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1969.&lt;ref name="nythildaobit"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff report |date=June 3, 1969 |title=Dr. Hilda B. Stekel |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/06/03/archives/dr-hilda-b-stekel.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A biographical account appeared in ''The Self-Marginalization of Wilhem Stekel'' (2007) by Jaap Bos and Leendert Groenendijk, which also includes his correspondence with Sigmund Freud. See also L. Mecacci, ''Freudian Slips: The Casualties of Psychoanalysis from the Wolf Man to Marilyn Monroe'', Vagabond Voices 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;101

==In popular culture==
* He is referenced in the episodes 22 and 26 of ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]''.
* A quote attributed to Stekel ("The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause.  The mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.") is referenced in ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' by [[J.D. Salinger]]. Cited by a character in the novel as a statement of Stekel's, it has sometimes been attributed to Salinger and may indeed be his paraphrase of a statement by the German writer [[Otto Ludwig (writer)|Otto Ludwig]] (1813-1865), which Stekel himself has quoted in his writings: "Das Höchste, wozu er sich erheben konnte, war, für etwas rühmlich zu sterben; jetzt erhebt er sich zu dem Größern, für etwas ruhmlos zu leben." Cf. [[q:Wilhelm Stekel#Misattributed]].
