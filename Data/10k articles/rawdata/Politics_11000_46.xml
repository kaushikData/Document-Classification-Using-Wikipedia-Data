      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3661">'''Adrian Leopold Molin''' (5 March 1880 - 10 August 1942) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[far-right]] writer and political activist.

==Early ideas==
Born in [[Varberg]], Molin attended the [[University of Gothenburg]] and received his doctorate from the institution in 1906.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Franklin Daniel Scott, ''Trans-Atlantica'', 1979, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined the right-wing ''Göteborgs Aftonblad'', then the ''Svenska Dagbladet'' before setting up his own paper in 1907, the ''Det nya Sverige'', which continued until 1926.&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; The young Molin was a disciple of [[Rudolf Kjellén]] and a leading figure in the so-called 'Young Right' movement.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bravo &amp; Sverker Sörlin, ''Narrating the Arctic'', 2002, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Ideologically he was highly [[Conservatism|conservative]] socially but also [[anti-capitalist]].&lt;ref&gt;Bravo &amp; Sörlin, ''Narrating the Arctic'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Molin flirted with [[corporatism]] by supporting an occupational franchise as well as some state intervention designed to bring the [[working class]] into a national consensus. He combined these ideas with a hatred of both [[socialism]] and the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', 1990, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fascism and Nazism==
His main political involvement was a founder and leading figure in the National Society Against Emigration, set up in 1907 to oppose the drain of Sweden's population to, mainly, the USA.&lt;ref&gt;George Malcolm Stephenson, ''The Religious Aspects of Swedish Immigration'', 1969, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity he advocated widespread home ownership and the settlement of northern Sweden to stem the flow of migrants from the country.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Daniel Scott, ''Scandinavia'', 1975, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported the building of traditional rural dwellings based on the use of indigenous architecture as part of his fascination with traditional ruralism.&lt;ref&gt;Hildor Arnold Barton, ''Sweden and visions of Norway'', 2002, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Heavily influenced by the philosopher [[Vitalis Norström]], he became highly pro-[[Germany]] and showed characteristics of an early form of [[fascism]].&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; 

During the 1920s and 1930s his ruralism began to develop along lines reminiscent of the [[blood and soil]] rhetoric of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;Rees, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right'', p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Soon Molin became a supporter of [[Nazism]] and hoped to apply its principles to Sweden, although he dismissed the indigenous Nazi leader [[Birger Furugård]] as a 'parody' of the ideology.&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; His own political activity was restricted to the [[National Youth League of Sweden]], where he became a leading voice on the far right, Nazi wing.&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; 

Near the end of his life Molin's enthusiasm for [[Adolf Hitler]] cooled as he became disillusioned with some of the excesses of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; However he retained his admiration for their [[anti-Semitism]], hierarchical society and especially the ruralism endorsed by the likes of [[Richard Walther Darré]].&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; It was these themes, as well as his desire for a union of Sweden and [[Norway]] as a defensive move against the [[Soviet Union]], that dominated his writings until his death in [[Lidingö]].&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt;

== Maryland ==
{{Main article|Maryland hospital payment system}}

Since the late 1970s, Maryland has operated an all-payer system for hospital services. An independent commission establishes the rate structure for each hospital. That eliminated hospital cost shifting across payers and spread more equitably the costs of uncompensated care and medical education and limited cost growth, but [[per capita]] Medicare hospital costs are among the country's highest.&lt;ref name=nejm1401&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1314868| title = Maryland's All-Payer Approach to Delivery-System Reform| year = 2014| last1 = Rajkumar | first1 = R. | last2 = Patel | first2 = A. | last3 = Murphy | first3 = K. | last4 = Colmers | first4 = J.

M. | journal = New England Journal of Medicine| pages = 140110110008004 | volume=370 | pmid=24410022}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the system eliminated price competition between hospitals and led them to divert high-cost patients to alternative settings, where prices remained unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pope|first1=Christopher|title=Legislating Low Prices: Cutting Costs or Care?|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/legislating-low-prices-cutting-costs-or-care|publisher=Heritage Foundation|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]'s participation in the system is authorized by the [[Social Security Act]] and is tied to a growth limit in payment per admission. The Medicare waiver created incentives to increase the volume of services. Medicare pays higher rates for hospital services in Maryland than it does under the national [[prospective payment system]]s.&lt;ref name=nejm1401/&gt;

On January 10, 2014, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) and the State announced a new model that will focus on overall per capita expenditures for hospital services as well as on improvements in the quality of care and population health outcomes. For 5 years beginning in 2014, Maryland will limit the growth of per capita hospital costs to the lesser of 3.58% or 0.5% less than the actual national growth rate for 2015 through 2018. The change is forecast to save Medicare at least $330 million. 3.58% is Maryland's historical 10-year growth rate of per capita gross state product.&lt;ref name=nejm1401/&gt;

The '''Australian Women's National League''' (AWNL) was an Australian political lobby group federation first established in 1904. It acted in many ways like a political party, with an extensive branch network and the capability to run its own candidates. It was a conservative organisation with four key declared objectives:

* Loyalty to the Throne;
* To counteract Socialist tendencies;
* To educate the Women of Victoria to realise their political responsibilities; and
* To Safeguard the Interests of the Home, Women and Children.

==Foundation==
The AWNL was supported in its foundation by the [[Victorian Employers' Federation]] and by employer bodies in other states, but it quickly became independent from those male dominated groups, and formed an anti-socialist alliance with the [[Farmer's League]] in 1905. The group aimed to espouse anti-socialist ideas to Australian women who had been given the right to vote in Australian federal elections in 1902. 

Leading Melbourne establishment figure [[Janet Clarke|Janet, Lady Clarke]], held a meeting at her home in August 1903 to discuss the formation of such a conservative women's movement. Months later in March 1904, Lady Clarke's sister [[Eva Hughes]] organised a meeting at the [[Melbourne Town Hall]]. It elected a provisional committee and elected Lady Clarke as its inaugural president

On 25 October 1907 the League conducted the first [[Pan-Australian Conference of Anti-Socialist Women's Organisations]]. The League played an important role in achieving [[women's suffrage]] (right to vote) throughout Australia. By 1908, it had 10,000 members in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] alone, and helped convince the male conservative members of parliament that women voters would not necessarily be left-wing in disposition. In 1909, Lady Clarke died and was succeeded as President by her sister Eva who stayed in charge until 1922.

The Liberal prime minister [[Alfred Deakin]] in 1912 described the lobby group as "fierce and unceasing" in their political demands. He continued "So far – singlehanded – I have beat them and kept them at bay, but how long can this last?"&lt;ref name="Fitzherbert" /&gt;

It was a very active organisation with many suburban and rural branches. It published a monthly journal ''The Woman''. It ran many campaigns, including for greater education in "domestic science." It organised Empire Day festivities in Melbourne for forty years and especially during [[World War I]] organised thousands of women to contribute to the war effort. In 1918 it launched "Baby Week" as an education campaign for families. It also conducted political education and training courses for its members to make them more effective campaigners.

==Peak of power==
At its peak in [[World War I]], the AWNL had 500 registered branches and more than 54,000 members across Australia. Using its massive membership base as a platform for achieving its objectives, it was very active in electoral politics, initially supporting male candidates and forming an important part of conservative political efforts across Australia. They employed women as paid political organisers, raised large amounts of funds and actively supported candidates that sometimes had to go through a preselection process to attract the League's support.

Some years after women had obtained the right to vote and to run for office, most of the first women candidates in Western Australia, [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and Victoria were members of the League. While they generally worked with conservative political parties, on occasion they did not. On one occasion when one of their favoured candidates in Queensland was not endorsed as they had demanded, they ran their own candidate, [[Irene Longman]] who became the first female member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland]] in 1929.

Actions such as these, the vast size of the League and its highly skilled political operatives made it one of the most effective and feared political organisations in Australian politics at the time. Male journalists at the time complained about the power of the group "Political godmothers rule UAP ([[United Australia Party]]) with haughty mien... the political fate of the electorate was controlled by women."&lt;ref name="Fitzherbert"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fitzherbert |first=Margaret |authorlink= |title= Liberal Women, Federation to 1949 |year=2004 |publisher=The Federation Press |location= |isbn=978-1-86287-460-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger with the Liberals==
In 1944, the AWNL actively supported the newly created [[Liberal Party of Australia]] and merged with it in 1945. The League's leaders at the time – including Dame [[Elizabeth Couchman]] and future senator [[Ivy Wedgwood]] – negotiated a tough deal with Sir [[Robert Menzies]] which ensured that women were equally represented at throughout the structures of the Liberal Party, long before the era of [[affirmative action]]. It was agreed that the Liberal Party's would reserve certain positions for women, that there would be a Woman Vice-President of the Party and also a [[Federal Women's Committee of the Liberal Party of Australia|Federal Women's Committee]], whose president would also sit on the Party's Federal Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/IMP0022b.htm|title=Couchman, Elizabeth May Ramsay - Woman - The Australian Women's Register|first=National Foundation for Australian Women and The University of|last=Melbourne|website=www.womenaustralia.info|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menzies regarded Couchman very highly and described "She would have been the best cabinet minister I could have wished for."&lt;ref name="Fitzherbert" /&gt;

Some argue that the League had a major impact on the Liberal Party's direction leading up to the election in 1949, which they won convincingly. In a highly usual move at the time Liberal advertising specifically made reference to women and women's issues. Images of men and women (and in some cases of women alone) were used in political advertising for the first time on a major scale. Their opponents in the [[Australian Labor Party]] were largely silent on women's issues.&lt;ref name="Fitzherbert" /&gt;

While the organisation formally resolved to merge with the Liberal Party, some preferred to retain an autonomous group which continued with considerably reduced members and activity for a time.

In 2004 the Prime Minister of Australia, [[John Howard]], spoke at a function commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the League, and paid tribute to its important role in the history of the Liberal Party and Australia.

'''Bosnian Movement of National Pride''' ({{lang-bs|Bosanski pokret nacionalnog ponosa}}, BPNP) is a nationalist political organization in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The organization was founded on 5 January 2009 by nationalists in [[Sarajevo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BPNP|title=The movement|url=http://www.bosanski-nacionalisti.org/stavovi.html|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abrašmedia|title=Rise of BPNP Nationalism|url=http://www.abrasmedia.info/content/neonacizam-u-bih-petorica-odr%C5%BEala-veliki-skup-bpnp-u-tuzli|website=abrasmedia.info|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BPNP|title=Statute of the movement|url=http://www.bosanski-nacionalisti.org/statut-pokreta.html|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement acts in the entirety of Bosnia and Herzegovina through branches in the cities where they exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BPNP|title=Branches|url=http://www.bosanski-nacionalisti.org/ogranci.html|accessdate=4 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206161200/http://www.bosanski-nacionalisti.org/ogranci.html|archivedate=6 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

==Goals and the program==
# ''Bosniaks' [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]'' – only people belonging to [[Europe]]an genetic and cultural heritage, [[Bosniaks]] included, can be the citizens of Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BPNP|title=Attitudes of the movement|url=http://www.bosanski-nacionalisti.org/english.html|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Bosnia must be ruled by Bosniaks'' – Bosniaks must not be subordinated to other constitutive peoples in Bosnia, and that will be reached by preventing non-Bosniaks of being on ruling positions.
# ''Bosnia must be ruled for the better well-being of [[Bosniaks]]'' – all political decisions must be based on what is the best for [[Bosniaks]]. All decisions that will make damage to Bosniaks must not be reached.
# ''Unique purpose'' – State's organization must be led by one modern policy that goes in benefit of Bosniaks as much as possible. The policy must be built on competence and responsibility, and its homework is to serve the population, not conversely. The system must maintain the motto: improvement, development and welfare of the entire nation.
# ''Total independence of the country'' – Cooperations in some fields are desirable with other countries, but any contract that would damage the independence of Bosnia even slightly is out of the question.
# ''Safe, secular state'' – Safety, individual and economic, must be one of the social basis. The state must be secular, so religion must be separated from the state, must be subordinated to the laws, reduce its influence in the public life, and prevent mixing state's authorities with religion.
# ''Freedom of speech and opinions'' – All questions must be free for discussions, science must be free, restriction of personal integrity through the state's control for persons that are not criminals must not exist.
# ''Natural resources in the hands of Bosniaks'' – Important natural resources under control of the Bosniaks, so that all profit can go back to the population, and not abroad and to private interests.
# ''National board and social justice'' – The dividing of classes must be replaced with class community where creativity and productive contribution are respected and no group of society can advance at the expense of the other one.
# ''Strict protection of animals and nature'' – Bosnia has a valuable and unique nature that must be kept safe and defended. Every way of destruction of the environment, as well as killing of the animals must be strictly prohibited. Food industry and other industries where animals are kept and used must be ethically sustainable.

==Symbols==

The logo of the movement resembles the coat of arms of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with some additions like the sword in the middle of the logo. They refer themselves also sometimes as the "National Front" which is basically a common used name for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BPNP|title=Symbolism of the movement|url=http://www.bosanski-nacionalisti.org/simbolika-pokreta.html|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes==

# BPNP advocates the establishment of a Bosniak national secular state in accordance with European practice where every nation is entitled to its own state. This right is, after all, confirmed with history of Bosnia and Bosniaks, which is over 1 000 years old. Accordingly, Bosnia is primarily a Bosniak state but it also belongs to all loyal citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=BPNP|title=The official program of the movement|url=http://www.bosanski-nacionalisti.org/program-engleski.html|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Every loyal citizen of Bosnia, regardless of his religious affiliation, is a member of a Bosniak nation. Accordingly, the movement totally rejects connection of Bosniaks with just one religious identity which was proven to be harmful for the national development and dignity.
# The symbol of Bosnia is coat of arms with [[Fleur-de-lis|six golden lilies]] of [[Monarch|King]] [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]]. That is also a symbol of Bosnian resistance to the Serbian aggression in the [[Bosnian War|War of Independence (1992–1995)]]. Any attempt of humiliation or degradation of the sacred emblem is a direct attack on national integrity of Bosnia and on the national pride. 
# The movement limits its activity inside the borders of Bosnia determined by [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, and [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878.
# The [[Bosnian language]], as the national language, should and must be the only official language in Bosnia. 
# Most properties in Bosnia should be in the hands of Bosniaks, as it is the only way to secure establishment of an economically strong nation. Bosnia belongs to Bosniaks in every sense: economic and national. Working class, as a base for prosperity, must have dignified life and it must be protected from exploitation.
# The name Bosnia "and [[Herzegovina]]" is not acceptable. Herzegovina never was a separate state or it was in the same level with Bosnia. Herzegovina has always been a part of Bosnia and we, as nationalists, are refusing to follow policy of national destruction of Bosnia and Bosniaks.
# We are against alliances and unions whose purpose is establishment and protection of the new world order ([[European Union|EU]] as continental union and [[NATO]] as a global army). Bosnia must be a free nation with its own army which is always ready to defend country's sovereignty. That opposes globalisation policy which is being forced by Zionist structures with just one purpose - creation of one world government which will allow the "gray eminence" to rule the world.
# We refuse the praxis of celebrating the official Day of Statehood, November 25, because it originates from the policy of dividing Bosnia into three quasi-ethnic groups ([[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]], [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] and [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]]). Day of Statehood that we promote is 29 August - the date of issuing the [[Charter of Ban Kulin]], that is also the oldest state's document and the oldest written document among Slavic-speaking countries.
# Ideologies that are not welcome in Bosnia are: [[Zionism]], [[Islamism]], [[Communism]] and [[Capitalism]]. The only ideology good for us is [[Bosnian nationalism]] because it secures national prosperity and social justice.
# A healthy nation can not exist without healthy families. With that in mind our struggle is partly focused on destroying every aspect of society which threatens family values with immoral actions. We are strongly opposed to the media that offer promiscuous behavior like homosexuality to the youth.

The '''British Youth Council''' (BYC) is a UK charity that works to empower young people and promote their interests. BYC, run by young people, exists to represent the views of young people to government and decision-makers at a local, national, European and international level; and to promote the increased participation of young people in society and public life. It is partly funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The British Youth Council was established by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] of the British Government in preparation for the first [[World Assembly of Youth]].  Its original aim was to unite young people in Britain against the forces of [[communism]] just after [[World War II]].

===1960-69===
In 1963, the Council gained independence from the British Government and became a UK charity championing the opinions of young people.

From the late 1960s, the Council expanded its work in connecting youth councils across the UK – a move championed by then staff member [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], former Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.

===1970-79===
In 1971, BYC organised the annual World Assembly of Youth event in Manchester where Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] was the keynote speaker.

In the late 1970s, the organisation elected David Hunt as chair (now member of the House of Lords) as well as [[Janet Paraskeva]] (now First Civil Service Commissioner) and [[Peter Mandelson]].

BYC published the "Youth Unemployment: Cause and Cures" report. They also attended the 11th World Festival on Youth in Cuba where motions were passed on the human rights records of the USSR and USA. Delegates include [[Trevor Phillips]], [[Paul Boateng]] and [[Charles Clarke|Charles Clarke MP]].

===1980-89===
In 1987 BYC Scotland closed due to funding cuts by the Government.   The British Youth Council also had its  Foreign Office grant withdrawn due to the changes in international relations. However, the  Council continued topromote local youth councils and was involved in the UK's signing of the  UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

===1990-99===
In the 1990s BYC worked with partners in campaigns to get young people registered to vote and on issues of young people's employment. They also worked in the field in youth policy and research, producing a number of journals and publications.

Notable publications during this decade include ‘Never Had it So Good: The Truth about being young in nineties Britain’ (1996), and the 1998 report  ‘State of the Young Nation’, which asked 1000 young people about their participation in society and their understanding of political processes.

Continuing increase in BYC’s research, consultation and policy work culminated in 2000 with the biggest consultation with young people that the Government had ever commissioned on areas such as education, employment and young people having their say. The conclusion, 'Listening to the Unheard', led the formulation of the European White Paper on Youth which BYC co-ordinated as the UK members of the [[European Youth Forum]].

===Today===
The organisation celebrated its 60th birthday in 2008 by engaging ten young people to make a documentary film about British youth culture over the last 60 years; in particular, how young people have been able to influence society and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;'Some Truth About Youth' documentary (2008), British Youth Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

According to its Annual Review 2008/09: “The BYC is led by young people, for young people aged 25 and under across the UK. We connect with our community of member organisations and network of Local Youth Councils to empower all young people, wherever they’re from, to have a say and be heard. Our take on training and volunteering and our powerful campaigns, both local and global, inspire young people to have a positive impact and make their voices count”&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;'Making Waves', The British Youth Council Annual Review 2008/09, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vision===
The British Youth Council’s vision is that all young people are respected, and able to influence and inform decisions which affect their lives or upon which they have strong opinions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Values===
The British Youth Council’s four values are recognition, equality, diversity and participation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Governance==
The British Youth Council Board of Trustees is made up of 12 young people aged 16–25. These annually elected trustees employ 14 staff and 10 full-time volunteers, and manage a body of young campaigners and media spokespeople. The organisation is a registered charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1123224}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a registered company limited by guarantee,&lt;ref&gt;Company no. 6226595. See also: [http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/56c7fbdb8662ad1d94df22478845831a/compdetails Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to enable the appointment of directors under 18 years old.

==Membership==

The  Council has over 250 members including national youth organisations, faith-based groups, and organisations representing minority groups of young people. In addition, the  Council supports a network of 620 youth councils and youth forums, also run by young people.

==Activities==

The British Youth Council assists young people  to represent  themselves through activities such as Young People in Parliament Events, having their voices heard by politicians and policy makers. It sets up initiatives that celebrate young people's achievements such as the Royal Society of Arts Young Leader Awards.With support from the House of Commons, the British Youth Council established the Youth Select Committee which, in 2013, held an inquiry into the national curriculum with 11 young panel Members.

The Council supports young people to find volunteering opportunities and other opportunities for young people through its website, its membership base and through newsletters like the BYC Project and its Online Action Network. 

It coordinates different youth-led networks such as the Local Youth Council Network, [[UK Youth Parliament]] &amp; [http://www.byc.org.uk/uk-work/young-mayor-network.aspx/ Young Mayors Network]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://byc.org.uk/about-us/our-youth-led-networks.aspx |accessdate=5 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727024248/http://www.byc.org.uk/about-us/our-youth-led-networks.aspx |archivedate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Women's Suffrage Association''', originally called the '''Toronto Women's Literary Guild''', was an organization based in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, that fought for women's rights.
[[File:Jessie Turnbull McEwen.jpg|thumb|left|First President in 1883]]

The Toronto Women's Literary Guild was established in 1877 to fight for women's rights and for improved working conditions. [[Jessie Turnbull]] and Dr. [[Emily Howard Stowe]], Canada's second licensed female physician, were founders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/turnbull_jessie_14E.html|title=Biography – TURNBULL, JESSIE – Volume XIV (1911-1920) – Dictionary of Canadian Biography|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guild had some success in improving access to higher education for women.
It was renamed the Canadian Women's Suffrage Association in 1883{{sfn|Dr. Emily Howard Stowe, Archives Canada}} with Jessie (McEwen) Turnbull as its first president.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Toronto-based association worked towards opening up education to women, and allowing women to advance as professionals, particularly as doctors.{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=50}}

After the association had been inactive for a while, the leaders founded the [[Dominion Women's Enfranchisement Association]] in 1889.{{sfn|Freeman|1989|p=50}}

[[File:Madonna à Nice 24.jpg|thumb|Madonna courted a number of controversies while performing throughout [[The MDNA Tour]]]]
American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] was embroiled with a number of controversy during [[The MDNA Tour]]. It was her ninth [[concert tour]], promoting her twelfth studio album, ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'' (2012). The tour has generated many newspaper headlines and news coverage for its use of fake firearms during performances, Madonna's nudity on stage, and her promotion of [[LGBT]] rights, [[freedom of speech]] and political issues.

Madonna was threatened with a lawsuit in [[France]] for using an image of [[French people|French]] [[far-right]] politician [[Marine Le Pen]] with a [[swastika]] on her forehead during a video interlude and also in [[Russia]] for her promotion of the rights of the LGBT community by giving free pink wristbands to people attending her concert.

==Political==
During the song "[[Nobody Knows Me]]" in her concert in [[Tel Aviv]] on May 31, 2012, during a morphing collage the face of [[French people|French]] [[Far-right politics|far-right]] politician and leader of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] [[Marine Le Pen]] appeared on the screen with a [[swastika]] superimposed on her forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/madonna/9310578/Marine-Le-Pen-threatens-to-sue-Madonna.html |title=Marine Le Pen threatens to sue Madonna|author= Samuel, Henry|date=June 4, 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343078357MASAKZHJFS?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/madonna/9310578/Marine-Le-Pen-threatens-to-sue-Madonna.html |archivedate=July 23, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffington"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/04/madonnas-marine-le-pen-swastika_n_1567891.html?ref=entertainment&amp;ir=Entertainment Madonna's Marine Le Pen Nazi Depiction Lands Singer In Hot Water], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Apr 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jdd"&gt;[http://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/Actualite/Quand-Madonna-lie-Marine-Le-Pen-Adolf-Hitler-et-une-croix-gammee-lors-son-MDNA-Tour-516444/ Quand Madonna lie Le Pen et Hitler], ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'', June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lefigaro"&gt;Alice Bosio, [http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2012/06/04/03006-20120604ARTFIG00528-madonna-compare-marine-le-pen-a-hitler-les-reactions.php Comparaison Le Pen-Hitler : Madonna fait polémique], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', Jun 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lacroix"&gt;[http://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/S-informer/France/Madonna-assimile-Le-Pen-a-Hitler-malheureux-selon-Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-_NG_-2012-06-04-814188 Madonna assimile Le Pen à Hitler, «malheureux» selon Najat Vallaud-Belkacem], ''[[La Croix]]'', June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The party threatened to sue Madonna should this happen during her concert in France on July 14, 2012, also known as [[Bastille Day]], the French [[National Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2154423/Madonna-attacked-Le-Pen-depicting-far-right-leader-Nazi-Israel-concert.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Madonna attacked by French National Marine leader Marine Le Pen after depicting her with swastika on face during Israeli concert|author=Allen, Peter |date=June 4, 2012 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl= http://www.freezepage.com/1343078433EJOXYAIAAL?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2154423/Madonna-attacked-Le-Pen-depicting-far-right-leader-Nazi-Israel-concert.html?ito%3Dfeeds-newsxml|archivedate=July 23, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Pen also accused Madonna of [[International child abduction|kidnapping]] her adopted children from [[Malawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/04/madonnas-marine-le-pen-swastika_n_1567891.html?ref=entertainment&amp;ir=Entertainment |title=Madonna's Marine Le Pen Nazi Depiction Lands Singer In Hot Water |date=June 4, 2012 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343078641JPKUVONDIY?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/04/madonnas-marine-le-pen-swastika_n_1567891.html?ref%3Dentertainment%26ir%3DEntertainment |archivedate=July 23, 2012 |first=Clare |last=Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] [[List of Government spokespeople of France|French government spokesperson]] [[Najat Vallaud-Belkacem]] has also expressed her disappointment because this gained Marine Le Pen a worldwide audience (Mrs Vallaud-Belkacem did not disagree on the message).

At the performance in Nice, France at the Stade Charles-Ehrmann, many of Le Pen's supporters had covered up The MDNA Tour announcement posters with Le Pen's campaign posters. It was even speculated that French far right was to attend the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madonnaunderground.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2797%3Afront-national-aanwezig-bij-mdna-in-nice&amp;catid=22%3Aalgemeen&amp;lang=en |title=Front National attending MDNA in Nice? |publisher=Madonnaunderground.nl |date=August 20, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Madonna removed the swastika from the video of "Nobody Knows Me" and replaced it with a question mark. A local party supporter Gael Nofri welcomed the change stating: "As far as I know, Madonna has never changed a video clip. This is proof that our arguments were valid. This is excellent news." Nevertheless, after that performance, Madonna has used the original video clip. Madonna later defended her use of the swastika image, stating she did it to raise awareness of ever growing intolerance towards religious minorities and immigrants (the National Front is [[Opposition to immigration|against immigration]].)

Madonna has been a strong supporter of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]. She urged fans to vote for Obama and claimed that he is a "Black Muslim" which was largely seen as offensive since Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past. Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim&amp;nbsp;— though I know that plenty of people in this country think he is. And what if he were? The point I was making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is&amp;nbsp;— nor should anyone else in America."&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/madonna-obama-black-muslim_n_1912400.html | title= Madonna: Obama Is 'A Black Muslim In The White House,' Deserves Votes (VIDEO) [UPDATE] |work=The Huffington Post |date=September 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience.  However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience.  Madonna tried to rectify the situation by saying to her audience, "I don't care who you vote for.  Do not take this great privilege for granted." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Donnelly|first=Matt|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-madonna-obama-boos-concert-new-orleans,0,2837761.story|title=Madonna booed (and cheered) after Obama endorsement in New Orleans|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her Los Angeles performance, Madonna dedicated her performance to [[Malala Yousafzai]], a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot by the [[Taliban]] for speaking out on her right to have an education. Madonna responded in the concert by saying "This made me cry. The 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot on a school bus for writing a blog ... who wrote a blog about how important education was to her. The Taliban stopped her bus and shot her ... Do you understand the sickness and absurdity of this?" Madonna went on to shout, "Support education! Support the people who support women!"  Madonna showed the audience a written tattoo on her back with Malala's name on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertram|first=Colin|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/entertainment/celebrity/Madonna-Offers-Onstage-Support-to-Malala-the-Pakistani-Teen-Shot-by-the-Taliban-173940881.html|title=Madonna Dedicates Song to "Malala," the Pakistani Teen Shot by Taliban Gunmen|publisher=NBC Chicago|date=October 12, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madonna 5, 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Madonna performing "[[Gang Bang (song)|Gang Bang]]" during the show's first segment, This performance received negative backlash due to the involvement of firearms]]
In the first section of the show, Madonna performs with fake firearms during the first three songs. She begins with  "[[Girl Gone Wild]]" holding a rifle and "breaks" the glass, of a confessional box, she later performs "[[Revolver (song)|Revolver]]" with female dancers dancing with automatic rifles. During the third song, "[[Gang Bang (song)|Gang Bang]]" she performed in a motel setting where she is seen shooting the male dancers who infiltrate her room with blood being splattered on the backdrops.&lt;ref name=perez&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilton|first=Perez|title=Madonna Kicks Off MDNA Tour!

Authorities previously warned the singer about use of guns for the concert in Edinburgh, before the events in [[Colorado]]. However, the order was reinforced after the tragedy occurred. Madonna continued the show in Scotland as planned, with the use of the props. During the concert, she expressed her joy for first concert in the country, saying she could be onstage for three hours. She then joked, "Due to your laws here they might pull the plug on me so if they cut us off suddenly, write to your local [[Member of parliament|MP]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2012/07/22/pop-superstar-madonna-ignores-gun-ban-as-she-plays-scots-gig-86908-23911281/ |title=Pop superstar Madonna ignores gun ban as she plays Scots gig |author=Lyons, Beverly|date=July 22, 2012 |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343079499GTIVONUSYZ?url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/2012/07/22/pop-superstar-madonna-ignores-gun-ban-as-she-plays-scots-gig-86908-23911281/ |archivedate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although threatened, Scottish police did not interrupt the show. Activist group, Mothers Against Guns, released a statement stating Madonna "should know better". They further stated the use of the props are in bad taste, even more so after the Colorado shootings. The singer's camp responded saying, "Madonna would rather cancel her show than censor her art. Her entire career, she has fought against people telling her what she can and cannot do. She’s not about to start listening to them now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/madonna-guns-concert-photos_n_1694766.html |title=Madonna &amp; Guns: Singer Brandishes Fake Pistols &amp; Machine Guns Despite Warnings, Recent Events (PHOTOS) |author=Makarechi, Kia |date=July 23, 2012 |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343079799NJKZPFOOWU?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/madonna-guns-concert-photos_n_1694766.html|archivedate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her concert in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], many fans felt the pop star was being "insensitive" to the community with the use of firearms in the first act. Many concert-goers tweeted the act was "too dark" and "[[Satanism|satanic]]", causing them to leave the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kdvr.com/2012/10/19/twitter-madonna-over-2-hours-late-to-denver-show-fakes-shooting-audience/ |title=Madonna over 2 hours late to Denver show, pretends to shoot audience |publisher=KDVR |date=October 19, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To comment on the story, Liz Rosenberg released the following statement: "It's like taking out the third act of Hamlet. Madonna does not make things pretty and tie them up with a bow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/colorado_fans_upset_after_madonna_cGylw7GtnWy1nKesR7h3rM |title=Colorado fans upset after Madonna uses guns during concert |work=New York Post |date=October 19, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the controversy in Denver, many fans felt Madonna would not return to the city to perform.

Three readers of the publication recreated the pose, photographed it, and sent it in to the publication to show their support for Madonna "as a positive role model for older women." While some initially claimed Madonna as "clingy" and "desperate", Sarah Angotti, also 53, counters, "I felt nervous when I pulled my bra down but that’s only natural&amp;nbsp;— Madonna probably did too. But then I felt empowered, it was an incredible feeling." She goes on to say about Madonna, "She looks incredible now&amp;nbsp;— better than a woman half her age and better than many of the young girls in the charts now" before commenting on the criticism of Madonna exposing her breast as a parent, "If she is a good mother that’s all that matters." Tina Shaw, also 53, argues Madonna "will not change" despite a double-standard between men and women, opining, "Women always seem to get the most flack when it comes to controversial situations. If it was a 53-year-old famous guy flashing his six-pack on stage, everyone would say, 'Wow, what a lad' but because it’s a woman everyone is saying, 'What an old bag'". Lastly, Sue Scadding, 53 as well, negates the controversy, pointing out that "there are topless women out on the beach every day and nobody bats an eyelid...I mean, it’s only a nipple for goodness sake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4371665/Madonna-was-right-to-bare-her-boob-at-53.html|title=Madonna was right to bare her boob at 53 |author=Williams, Stewart |date=June 11, 2012 |work=The Sun |accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1343081055QQXYPSKVBO?url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4371665/Madonna-was-right-to-bare-her-boob-at-53.html|archivedate=July 23, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==L'Olympia show==
Madonna's second show in Paris at [[L'Olympia]] was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews from fans and critics, with most of the criticism centering on the fact that the concert lasted only 45 minutes, even though the tickets had been sold at the same price as for the others full stage MDNA Tour shows and fans had not been alerted of the abbreviated format of the show. Responding to the criticism, Madonna's publicist declared that her past club shows "were never more than 45 minutes", adding that the concert was "planned as a heartfelt thank you to France which she expressed at the start of the show" and also, the show cost Madonna nearly $1 million to produce and keeping the prices at $100 involved a "tremendous effort".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/music/2012/07/28/madonna-booed-after-45-minute-paris-concert |title=Madonna booed after 45-minute Paris concert |work=Sunday Times (Johannesburg) |date=July 28, 2012 |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to TMZ, the riot at Madonna concert in Paris had nothing to do with her brief performance but with around 10 "fans" in the audience who overheard yelling about Marine Le Pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.tmz.com/article_head.ftl?id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmz.com%2F2012%2F07%2F29%2Fmadonna-france-concert-riot%2F |title=TMZ |publisher=M.tmz.com |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several French news outlets reported that the backlash against Madonna's performance was started by a considerable number of fans rather than an isolated group of Marine Le Pen supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/laparisienne/actu-people/madonna-conspuee-sur-le-web-apres-son-concert-a-l-olympia-27-07-2012-2104458.php|title=Madonna conspuée sur le Web après son concert à L'Olympia|date=July 27, 2012 |work=[[Le Parisien]]  |accessdate=July 27, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1338791671UPDVLAKGOI?url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/mdna-audience-bears-witness-to-madonnas-inner-turmoil |archivedate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2012/07/27/03006-20120727ARTFIG00530-madonna-sur-twitter-la-reine-est-morte.php|title=Madonna sur Twitter: "La Reine est Morte |date=July 27, 2012 |work=[[Le Figaro]] |accessdate=July 27, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1338791671UPDVLAKGOI?url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/mdna-audience-bears-witness-to-madonnas-inner-turmoil |archivedate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.fr/Loisirs/Musique/News/Madonna-huee-par-ses-fans-apres-son-concert-a-l-Olympia-2130804 |title=Madonna huée par ses fans après son concert à L'Olympia |work=Elle |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of speech==
[[File:Pussy Riot_- Denis Bochkarev 5.jpg|thumb|left|Madonna called for the release of Russian [[Feminism in Russia|feminist]] [[punk-rock]] band [[Pussy Riot]]]]
Madonna's Russian shows in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] were met with great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band [[Pussy Riot]], Madonna responded: "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always promoted freedom of expression and [[freedom of speech]] so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; that would be a tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/9458246/Madonna-calls-for-leniency-in-Pussy-Riot-trial-during-Russian-leg-of-world-tour.html |title=Video: Madonna calls for leniency in Pussy Riot trial during Russian leg of world tour |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=August 7, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her [[Moscow]] show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/08/madonna-pussy-riot-moscow-video |title=Madonna shows support for Pussy Riot at Moscow concert&amp;nbsp;– video |work=The Guardian |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Madonna later appeared on stage with a [[temporary tattoo]] that said "Pussy Riot" on her back in place of the usual "No Fear" slogan, and performed "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/08/08/madonna-supports-pussy-riot_n_1755804.html |title=Madonna Dons Pussy Riot's Trademark Balaclava To Show Support In Moscow, Russia (PICTURES) |work=The Huffington Post |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/madonna-dons-balaclava-in-moscow-to-show-support-for-anti-putin-punk-band-1.907178 |title=Madonna dons balaclava in Moscow to show support for jailed members of punk band Pussy Riot |publisher=Yahoo!|date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them [[Yoko Ono]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Peter Gabriel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbc-worldnews.net/2012/08/peter-gabriel-joins-madonna-paul-mccartney-in-backing-pussy-riot/ |publisher=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819214737/http://bbc-worldnews.net/2012/08/peter-gabriel-joins-madonna-paul-mccartney-in-backing-pussy-riot/|title=Peter Gabriel joins Madonna, Paul McCartney in backing Pussy Riot|date=August 1, 2012|accessdate=December 22, 2013|archivedate=August 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pussy Riot]] themselves tweeted: "DEAR MADONNA!

Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of [[gay rights]] and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website:

{{Quote|I'm a freedom fighter. My show. My songs. My work. My art, is all about freedom of expression. Freedom to choose to speak to act. Always with humanity and compassion. I will come to St. Petersburg to speak up for the gay community, to support the gay community and to give strength and inspiration to anyone who is or feels oppressed.

On August 18, [[Pussy Riot]] members were found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsh |first=Julia |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/fury_over_pussy_whippin_1vxUnTGTJYxhmK2syCfX0M |title=Russian punk trio Pussy Riot gets two years’ prison, igniting protests worldwide |work=New York Post |date=August 18, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Madonna wrote on her website in further support of the band: "I protest the conviction and sentencing of Pussy Riot to a penal colony for two years for a 40 second performance extolling their political opinions. Even if one disagrees with the location or how they chose to express themselves, the sentence is too harsh and in fact is inhumane. I call on all those who love freedom to condemn this unjust punishment. I urge artists around the world to speak up in protest against this travesty. They've spent enough time in jail. I call on ALL of Russia to let Pussy Riot go free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madonna.com/news/title/temp |title=&gt; News &gt; From Madonna Aug 18th, 2012 |publisher=Madonna.com |accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna also continued to back and defend Pussy Riot and preach for equality and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/33/50950/Arts--Culture/Music/Madonna-drops-swastika-from-France-concert,-backs-.aspx|title=Madonna drops swastika from France concert, backs Pussy Riot|publisher=Ahram Online|date=August 22, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her tour in Europe, Madonna returned to the United States to perform.  Madonna urged her U.S. fans to appreciate their freedom of speech and claimed, "I've seen some scary things. I've seen people being locked up and put in jail for speaking their minds, for being gay, for not practicing the right religion, for not dressing the proper way. Yeah, it's scary. But what it made me realize is how lucky I am to be living here in America. It doesn't mean that this is the perfect country. We have a long way to go." &lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;

==LGBT rights==
[[File:MDNAMasterpiece.jpg|thumb|Madonna's performance of "[[Masterpiece (Madonna song)|Masterpiece]]" was normally preceded by a speech.]]Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madonna.com/news/title/support-the-gay-lesbian-community-at-madonnas-st-petersburg-show |title=&gt; News &gt; Support the LGBT Community At Madonna's St. Petersburg Show |publisher=Madonna.com |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout. Madonna stopped in the middle of the show to speak on the issues at hand: "...I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant, but we can make a difference...we don't have to do it with violence, but love." She continued, noting [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, "I am here to say that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love." She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their "love and support of the gay community." She concluded, "for people quoting the [[Bible]], and using [[God]] as a defense mechanism: [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[Buddha]], and [[Moses]] preached this—it's in every Holy book—'love thy neighbor as thyself'. You can not use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly. So let's go out into the world, and spread this message of love, and live our lives without fear. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edward |first=Brett |url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/music/2012/08/10/madonna-transforms-st-petersburg-concert-unofficial-gay-pride |title=Madonna Transforms St Petersburg Concert into Unofficial Gay Pride Rally |work=The Advocate |date=August 10, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though her speech was met with much praise from the media, on August 17, it was announced that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting "homosexual propaganda" which was against the law, and allegedly "insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights" at the concert.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/madonna-sued-gay-rights-russia?newsfeed=true |title=Madonna sued over gay rights stance by Russian campaigners |work=The Guardian |date=August 17, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, "She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it. So we will speak in the language of money...maybe someone does not see the link but after Madonna's concert maybe some boy becomes gay, some girl becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a result and this big country cannot defend its borders—for me it causes moral suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Liza |last=Dobkina |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/08/17/anti-gay-activists-sue-madonna-over-hurt-feelings |title=Anti-gay activists sue Madonna over hurt feelings |work=Toronto Sun |date=August 17, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12 the claims were fully rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20121122/265459436.html|title=Madonna gay propaganda trial - live updates|work=RAPSI - Russian Legal Information Agency|accessdate=2017-11-24|date=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in Georgia''' had been an issue in the post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] decades. Before the 2003 [[Rose Revolution]], according to ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was among the most corrupt nations in all Eurasia.&lt;ref name=forpol&gt;{{cite web| last =Berglund| first =Christopher; Engvall, Johan | title =How Georgia Stamped Out Corruption on Campus| work =Foreign Policy | date =Sep 3, 2015| url =https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/03/how-georgia-stamped-out-corruption-on-campus/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of corruption abated dramatically, however, after the revolution. In 2010, [[Transparency International]] (TI) said that Georgia was “the best corruption-buster in the world.”&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web| title =Lessons from Georgia’s fight against graft| work =The Economist| date =Feb 7, 2012| url =https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/02/tbilisi%E2%80%99s-corruption-busters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low-level corruption has been virtually eliminated in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting Corruption in Public Services Chronicling Georgia’s Reforms|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/01/20/000356161_20120120010932/Rendered/PDF/664490PUB0EPI0065774B09780821394755.pdf|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Round of Monitoring Georgia Monitoring report|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/georgia/44997416.pdf|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 46th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017 results|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the [[World Bank]] called Georgia a “unique success” of the world in fighting corruption. [[Philippe Le Houérou]] said that “Georgia’s experience shows that the vicious cycle of endemic corruption can be broken and, with appropriate and decisive reforms, can be turned into a virtuous cycle.”&lt;ref name=bank&gt;{{cite web| title =Georgia’s Fight Against Corruption in Public Services Wins Praise| work =The World Bank| date =Jan 31, 2012| url =http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2012/01/31/georgias-fight-against-corruption-in-public-services-wins-praise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia is “the only post-Soviet state in the past decade to have made a breakthrough” in addressing corruption, according to ''Foreign Policy''.&lt;ref name=forpol/&gt;

Council of Europe's Group of States Against Corruption in its fourth evaluation round noted that Georgia has largely succeeded in eradicating petty corruption, however it is also argued that corruption has changed shape in Georgia in recent years. For example, a ‘clientelistic system’ has emerged where the country’s leadership ‘allocates resources in order to generate the loyalty and support it needs to stay in power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016806dc116|title=FOURTH EVALUATION ROUND on Georgia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transparency.ge/sites/default/files/post_attachments/georgia_national_integrity_nis_assessment_2015.pdf|title=Georgia National Integrity Assessment 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As recently as 2003, according to the World Bank, corruption was an everyday part of Georgian life, with citizens reporting bribery as a regular occurrence.&lt;ref name=bank/&gt; That changed with the 2003 [[Rose Revolution]], which ousted [[President Shevardnadze]], and which is widely considered a reaction to the corruption and poor governance under Shevardnadze.&lt;ref name="trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/Overview_of_corruption_in_Georgia.pdf|title=OVERVIEW OF CORRUPTION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION IN GEORGIA|work=Transparency International}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] won 96% of the vote in the 2004 elections, he instituted drastic anti-corruption reforms. This including firing the entire Ministry of Education staff.&lt;ref name=forpol/&gt; Georgia adopted the anti-corruption mechanisms of nations with successful anti-corruption efforts, such as [[Italy]]'s anti-[[Mafia]] efforts, and [[Germany|German]] police training.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; As part of the post-revolutionary effort to crack down on corruption, films showing the arrests of senior government officials on corruption charges were broadcast to the public in order to make clear the seriousness of the effort.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

In 2004, Georgia's corruption perception score improved more dramatically than that of any other country. In that year, 60% of respondents expected corruption levels to decrease during the next three years. In 2005, however, that figure dropped to 38%.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; The government's “zero-tolerance” policy has dramatically changed the situation, leaving the country tied with most advanced European nations in all governance indicator.&lt;ref name=bank/&gt; The country has routinely seen impressive results in varying governance indicators.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

While the Saakashvili government’s efforts all but eliminated petty corruption in the public sector, however, particularly in the police department, tax collection administration, customs bureau, public services, and education sectors.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;  some critics dispute the claim that corruption was eliminated, maintaining instead that there was a shift from “rampant petty bribery to more clientelistic forms of corruption.”&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Indeed, according to some sources, many forms of corruption have remained common in Georgia. For example, executive power, combined with a weak judiciary and media, make abuse of power at every level of government a possibility and allow top officials to operate with near impunity.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Moreover, while Transparency International Georgia's 2011 National Integrity System Assessment credited the post-2004 reforms with making the executive branch and law enforcement stronger and more efficient, as well as with strengthening the fight against petty bribery and certain other types of corruption, TI Georgia noted that some executive agencies were insufficiently accountable and transparent, that news media had not devoted enough resources to investigating corruption, and that the country's 2010 anti-corruption policy lacked a coherent framework based on a thorough analysis of the challenges. TI Georgia also charged the Anti-Corruption Council, created in 2008, with poor monitoring and evaluation of the plan’s implementation.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The World Bank has described Georgia's underground economy as the world's largest relative to the scale of the country's official economic activity.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

==Government==
Thanks to strong enforcement, low-level civil-service graft has all but disappeared since Saakashvili became president.&lt;ref name=biz&gt;{{cite web| title =Georgia Corruption Report| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be sure, some government funds, such as the president's funds, continue to operate with insufficient accountability.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;  Bonuses are paid by government agencies on an arbitrary basis.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; A 2011 report indicated that political leaders have used public resources to maintain their party's rule of the political system.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Also, strong patronage networks endure, and its common for public officials to blend their position with private enterprise.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Transparency International has identified the government’s influence on regulatory bodies as opening up opportunities for corruption. The National Communications Commission has been charged with selectively enforcing regulations, for example in awarding and denying broadcast licenses, and has not enforced the rule against government bodies with broadcast licences or government bodies that sponsors media entities.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Furthermore, the oversight of the public budget is weak, and as of 2011 the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and other government bodies had yet to institute internal auditing.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; TI Georgia has criticized the Ministry of Internal Affairs for excessive surveillance of private electronic communications and for placing its officers illegally in independent government agencies.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The legislature and judiciary, as well as the media and civil society, are weak in comparison to the executive.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Transparency and accountability are weaker in local Georgian governments than in the national government. Unsalaried city council members are exempt from integrity rules that apply to national officials.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

===Public procurement===
There is little corruption in the public procurement sector.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; Despite a highly transparent system procurement, certain exceptions and loopholes make no-bid state contracts possible. As of 2012, indeed, 45% of state contracts were awarded without a bidding process taking place.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Moreover, licenses in certain sectors have been awarded under less than fully competitive and transparent conditions. One such sector is mining. Another is media. For example, when the management rights for a TV broadcasting tower in [[Tbilisi]] were sold at auction, the winner of the auction, who had no background in telecommunications, was selected beforehand. Also, firms with ties to a former defense minister were granted exclusive rights to outdoor advertising in the capital and a license to run the national lottery. Also, some state-owned assets have been sold without competitive bidding, sometimes for less than market value. Similarly, in 2011, the Tbilisi City Hall awarded management rights to a public park to a firm owned by a City Council member.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

===Taxation===
There is relatively little corruption in the taxation system. Only rarely are companies asked to pay bribes or extra payments in connection with taxes.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;  Tax officials are, however, subject to a degree of executive interference. Supporters of opposition parties, for instance, have been known to be harassed by the tax police.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Customs===
Corruption is rare in the customs service. A 2014 report noted that Georgia had reduced the number of customs facilities and simplified the procedures for clearance, so that importing and exporting involve fewer documents and less expense than elsewhere in the region.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

===Bribery===
Before 2003, virtually any government transaction required some amount of bribe for processing. Nearly all bureaucrats and officials were said to abuse their power for personal gain.&lt;ref name=forpol/&gt; In 2013, the percentage of respondents to the Global Corruption Survey who said they had a bribe for public services was only 4%.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

In 2011, two businessmen from [[Israel]], Ron Fuchs and Ze'ev Frenkiel, were imprisoned for offering a bribe to the Prime Minister, but were pardoned later that year, supposedly for humanitarian reasons. On the same day that the pardon was made public, the Ministry of Justice announced a settlement with their firm, Tramex, that involved a $73 million reduction in an arbitration award against Georgia. The timing was viewed as suspicious, but the government insisted it was purely coincidental.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

===Elections===
Experts say that the government exerts “undue influence” on the electorate, with state officials inappropriately using official resources to influence voters.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; Before the 2012 parliamentary elections, campaign contributions by corporations were made illegal, but this move was viewed not as an anti-corruption measure but as a means of maintaining the ruling party's advantage. Indeed, the new rules were used largely to intimidate the opposition. Also, some contributions during the 2012 election cycle that were nominally made by individuals were in fact corporate donations in disguise. In addition, there are indications that campaign donations made by persons representing companies with government contracts were essentially kickbacks. Contribution disclosure rules were later introduced to address this issue, but the State Audit Office seems insufficiently able to willing to do its part to ensure compliance with the new rules.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

''The Economist'' complained in 2012 about new limits on political contributions that sought to curb the influence of Georgia's richest man and an opponent of the government, [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]].&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

===Police===
Police corruption is not a major problem in Georgia.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; Corruption among traffic police was a major problem before the Rose Revolution; after Saakashvili became president, 16,000 traffic police officers were fired quickly and unceremoniously.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

===Judiciary===
According to one respected source, corruption is not a major problem in the judicial sector  Transparency International has stated that while bribery is in fact rare in the Georgian judiciary, judges are widely viewed by the Georgian people as corrupt. In 2013, for example, 51% of respondents said the judiciary was corrupt or extremely corrupt.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; The Prosecutor’s Office no longer has the strong influence over the judiciary that it enjoyed before 2012.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

==Education==
After the recession of the early 1990s, professors were earning so little that they required bribes to get by. Usually they supplemented their income by charging “fees” for admissions exams, as a result of which applicants to [[Tbilisi State University]] could pay up to a $30,000 bribe to ensure admission and get the highest grades. This changed in 2002, when the World Bank instituted a National Assessment and Examinations Center that developed rigorous assessment examinations.&lt;ref name=forpol/&gt; Consequently, students who have taken the exams over the last decade, reported ''Foreign Policy'' in 2015, owe their success to their thorough education and not any patronage systems.&lt;ref name=forpol/&gt;

==Media==
The media are one sector in which opportunities for corruption have risen under Saakashvili. His regime has been behind the takeover of leading media by loyal business interests, as a result of which criticism of the authorities has “gradually disappeared” from TV, along with investigative programs.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

==Business==
The [[Business Anti-Corruption Portal]] has stated that corruption constitutes a low risk for companies looking to do business in Georgia and that it is easier to start a business than in almost any other nation, due to the increased transparency and efficiency in receiving licenses and permits.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt; Indeed, the business environment in Georgia has been greatly improved in recent years owing to the introduction of comparatively low income taxes and more liberal regulation. There are, however, several issues that companies have to deal with, such as the lack of judicial independence, the lack of enforcement of intellectual property rights, and selective enforcement of economic law.&lt;ref name=biz5&gt;{{cite web|title= Georgia Profile Corruption|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/georgia/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There continues to be an overlap between government and business interests. Many persons with close government ties have become very rich, many public officials have acquired sizable fortunes shortly after leaving government service, and some wealthy businessmen who have been elected to parliament have been able to use their position to benefit their firms. In addition, according to a 2013 report, the owners of some companies have been forced, on occasion, to make gifts to the government, or even relinquish ownership of the business. Also, the extensive process of privatizing state assets has been lacking in transparency, and has in many cases been conducted under “suspicious circumstances.”&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

It is believed that some firms have been awarded government contracts in return for campaign donations to the incumbent party, and have been discouraged for contributing to the opposition. As a result of such practices, the ruling party's campaign coffers have been 10 to 20 times larger than those of all other parties combined.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Transparency International has identified three “problematic” issues connection with doing business in Georgia: “the significant shadow economy, preferential treatment in contract awarding, and the lack of transparency in the wave of privatisation.”&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; In 2008, 52% of companies told the World Bank that they had been obliged to compete with unregistered companies for government contracts.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;  As of 2013, bribery was still a factor in the awarding of government contracts.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

===Timber industry===
Because of corruption, the rate of deforestation is very high.&lt;ref name=biz/&gt;

== Anti-corruption efforts ==
Economic reform and anti-corruption were placed at the top political agenda of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n government led by former President [[Mikheil Saakashvili|Saakashvili]]. Since 2004, Georgia had made tremendous progress in the clamp down on corruption and reinstatement of good governance. The total dissolution of the corrupt traffic police in 2004 and the establishment of the Anti-Corruption Interagency Council in 2008 were successful examples of the reform. Low-level corruption has been virtually eliminated in recent years. Both the OECD and the [[World Bank]] praised Georgia's unique success in combating corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting Corruption in Public Services Chronicling Georgia’s Reforms|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/01/20/000356161_20120120010932/Rendered/PDF/664490PUB0EPI0065774B09780821394755.pdf|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second Round of Monitoring Georgia Monitoring report|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/georgia/44997416.pdf|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, for example, attributed Georgia's success at fighting corruption to the following factors: “exercising strong political will; establishing credibility early; launching a frontal assault; attracting new staff; limiting the state’s role; adopting unconventional methods; coordinating closely; tailoring international experience to local conditions; harnessing technology; using communications strategically.”&lt;ref name=bank/&gt; The lesson of Georgia's success at fighting corruption, according to ''The Economist'', is that “[l]eadership and political will are all important,” as is “establishing early credibility.”&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; Ending corruption in Georgia was part of an almost-libertarian effort to minimize the size of the state, creating fewer opportunities for graft. The young and largely western-educated new staff of the government receives a high enough salary to dissuade the temptation of corruption.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

The Interagency Council for Combating Corruption, formed in 2008, consists of members of various government agencies, civil-society groups, and business associations, and is responsible for coordinating, strategizing, and monitoring the fight against corruption.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; The Ministry of Justice's effectiveness is considered questionable because of limited resources.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; The Internal Affairs Ministry's Anti-Corruption Department, formed in 2012, is responsible for fighting corruption.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The State Audit Office (SAO) is responsible for reviewing public spending, but it lacks resources to audit in sufficient depth and has been too closely tied to the political establishment. In 2012, the SAO did not enforce campaign-finance rules objectively. In fact the SAO's head and deputy head resigned from the SAO to run as ruling-party candidates for parliament in that year. On the other hand, the current SAO head has no links to the new ruling government.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The State Procurement and Competition Agency, which coordinates and monitors public contracts, has also been praised for its transparent approach to public procurement. Since 2013, Georgia has published online all public contracts, with a few exempted for national security reasons or because of specific exceptions, such as that applied to Georgian Railways. Critics of proposed procurement contracts can file appeals online.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

The improvement of law enforcement since 2004 has had a significant impact on anti-corruption efforts. According to the 2011 National Integrity System Assessment, law-enforcement agencies are among Georgia's strongest institutions, although the assessment also criticized these agencies' low transparency and accountability levels.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

Georgia's strong civil-society organizations, while underfunded and dependent almost totally on foreign aid, have played a role in encouraging anti-corruption reforms, such as promoting improvements in campaign-finance law, and in monitoring fulfillment of the country's international anti-corruption commitments.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt; TI Georgia has praised the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) for improving the system of asset disclosure.&lt;ref name=trans/&gt;

'''''La Dame Blanche''''' ([[French language|French]]; literally "The White Lady") was the codename for an underground intelligence network which operated in [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German-occupied Belgium]] during [[World War I]]. It took its name from a German legend which stated that the fall of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]] would be announced by the appearance of a woman wearing white.

==Network==
[[File:Walthère Dewé.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Walthère Dewé]]
The ''Dame Blanche'' network was founded in 1916 by [[Walthère Dewé]], an engineer working in a telegraph and telephone company in [[Brussels]]. The decision resulted from the arrest and execution of Dewé's cousin, Dieudonné Lambrecht, who had himself founded an intelligence network codenamed "Lambrecht". In order to save the group, Dewé took control and developed it under the name ''Dame Blanche''. 

The network was at first affiliated to the British military intelligence service Cameron Folkstone. After constant infiltration by German counter-espionage it reverted to [[MI6]] at [[Rotterdam]] where they were handled by [[Captain Henry Landau]]. After the end of the war, [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming]], head of MI6, estimated that ''Dame Blanche'' had supplied as much as 70 percent of all military intelligence collected by Allied intelligence services world-wide, not merely that from [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German-occupied Belgium]] and [[German occupation of north-east France during World War I|northern France]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruis, Edwin. ''Spynest. British and German Espionage from Neutral Holland 1914-1918''. Briscombe: The History Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, its 1,300 agents covered all of occupied Belgium, northern France and, through a collaboration with [[Louise de Bettignies]]' network, [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War I|occupied Luxembourg]]. The network was known for its high proportion of female members; women may have made up as much as 30 percent of its total personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] in [[World War II]], Dewé used the experience of the ''Dame Blanche'' network to start a new network, codenamed Clarence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Fabián Nsue Nguema''' is the most prominent human-rights [[lawyer]] in [[Equatorial Guinea]] which, under [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Teodoro Obiang]], has been referred to as one of the most repressive regimes in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinean rights lawyer Nsue 'missing'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20066094|work=BBC News|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of Equatorial Guinea's only legal opposition party, [[Popular Union of Equatorial Guinea|Unión Popular]] (UP), which frequently denounces human rights violations, and of which he has served as secretary-general. He has defended a number of political prisoners in trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Arbitrary detention of prominent human rights lawyer Mr Fabián Nsue Nguema|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/20385|work=Frontline Defenders|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Cease Politically Motivated Arrests - Opposition Figures and Their Lawyers Harassed Ahead of 2013 Elections|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201212071077.html;|work=All Africa|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pizano|first=Pedro|title=Nightmare Squared|url=http://humanrightsfoundation.org/HRF-Foreign-Policy-Nightmare-Squared-Pizano-Hancock-06-11-2012.php|work=Human Rights Foundation|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional activities==

Nsue has provided legal assistance in a number of high-profile cases.

==2004 coup case and disbarment==

Nsue represented a group of persons who were allegedly involved in an attempted coup in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Arbitrary detention of prominent human rights lawyer Mr Fabián Nsue Nguema|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/20385|work=Frontline Defenders|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; “There was no attempted coup d'etat in this country,” one of the defendants said during the November 2004 trial. “I had to tell these people what they wanted. It was the only way to stay alive.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confession extracted through torture: coup plot accused|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/17/1100574540164.html?from=storylhs|work=SMH|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[International Bar Association]] observer reported that the trial “fell far short of international fair trial standards.” The court ignored the defendant's allegations of torture; the government failed to notify defendants before trial of the charges against them, and denied them legal representation until three days before the trial began. The only evidence presented by the prosecution to support its charges were statements made by the defendants under duress. Nsue's request to visit the eight defendants sentenced in the case was rejected in April 2005 by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61567.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2005, he and a colleague at his law firm were disbarred for a year by the Bar Association of Equatorial Guinea, which charged them with unspecified acts of misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/fr/documents/afr24/011/2012/fr/|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This came in the wake of Nsue's defense of the accused coup plotters in March 2004. The Bar Association did not give Nsue prior notice of the charges against him or given an opportunity to defend himself against any charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61567.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The International Bar Association called the disbarment “purely political” and described the Bar Association's decision as having “reportedly [been] made in conjunction with the Government.” IBA Executive Director Mark Ellis said that the disbarment “and the manner in which this has been handled by the Bar Association in Equatorial Guinea is very worrying. This method of intimidation means that lawyers will be reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases for fear of being associated with their client. The administration of justice in Equatorial Guinea continues to be of grave concern to the IBA.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBA Concerned at Disbarment of Lawyer in Equatorial Guinea|url=http://www.ibanet.org/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleUid=A16D8CD8-CB0E-4723-9E44-2A3008A0B637|work=International Bar Association|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other professional activities==

Nsue represented [[Simon Mann]], a British citizen who was jailed in 2008 for plotting to overthrow the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinean rights lawyer Nsue 'missing'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20066094|work=BBC News|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Human Rights Foundation, Nsue “defended Weja Chicambo, a former prisoner of conscience and the founder of an 'illegal' opposition party.” 

He was also the defense lawyer for four UP members who were accused of having assaulted the Presidential Palace in February 2009, even though, according to the [[Human Rights Foundation]], “the four men were in exile in Benin when the attack occurred.” (The four men “were later tracked down, brought back to Equatorial Guinea, tortured, and executed,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinean rights lawyer Nsue 'missing'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20066094|work=BBC News|accessdate=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of his career, he has frequently been harassed by the government of Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Human Rights Lawyer ‘Disappeared’|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/24/equatorial-guinea-human-rights-lawyer-disappeared|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Nsue complained in May 2011 that he had been under investigation by unknown persons in recent weeks and that a total of four memory sticks had been taken from his office on two different occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOTICIAS ASODEGUE|url=http://www.asodegue.org/mayo1110.htm|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment in 2002==

In April 2002, according to [[Amnesty International]], he “was arrested as he was about to defend a group of political prisoners who were subsequently adopted as prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International. In July 2002, he was tried for defamation of President Obiang and sentenced to one year in prison.” He was confined for five months in Black Beach prison in Malabo, described by Human Rights Foundation as “a place with a reputation so grim that it earned Nsue's home country of Equatorial Guinea the nickname of 'the [[Auschwitz Concentration Camp|Auschwitz]] of Africa' back in the 1970s.” In prison, Nsue was tortured. Amnesty International designated him as a prisoner of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Document - Guinée équatoriale. Libération d'un défenseur des droits humains.

==Imprisonment in 2012==

Nsue's client [[Augustín Esono Ngoso]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Human Rights Lawyer ‘Disappeared’|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/24/equatorial-guinea-human-rights-lawyer-disappeared|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was arrested on or around October 16, 2012, allegedly because of his supposed ties to the non-governmental organisation Transparency International France, which had been investigating corruption on the part of Obiang and his son. Nsue immediately began trying to secure permission to see Esono. On October 22, police superintendent Liborio Mba told Nsue he could visit Esono at Black Beach. Around midday, Nsue went to the prison, but was not granted immediate access to his client. During the day he had phone contact with his wife, but he failed to return home that night, and the next day his wife contacted the investigative court and went to the prison, where she was turned away and told that her husband was not there, even though his car was still in the parking lot. 

“Fabian Nsue’s disappearance while visiting a prison is of grave concern,” said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at [[Human Rights Watch]]. “The government needs to urgently investigate the situation, determine whether he is being held in secret detention, contrary to national and international law, and publicly clarify his whereabouts.”

“Nsue’s career as a lawyer has been dedicated to fighting injustice and upholding the law, even in the face of harsh government repression,” said Tutu Alicante, executive director of [[EG Justice]], a [[United States|US]]-based group that advocates for human rights in Equatorial Guinea. “The authorities must fully respect his rights and clarify his whereabouts without delay.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Arbitrary detention of prominent human rights lawyer Mr Fabián Nsue Nguema|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/20385|work=Frontline Defenders|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Cease Politically Motivated Arrests - Opposition Figures and Their Lawyers Harassed Ahead of 2013 Elections|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201212071077.html;|work=All Africa|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pizano|first=Pedro|title=Nightmare Squared|url=http://humanrightsfoundation.org/HRF-Foreign-Policy-Nightmare-Squared-Pizano-Hancock-06-11-2012.php|work=Human Rights Foundation|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In fact he had been detained at the prison and held incomunicado there with no bed or bathroom, but was not tortured. On October 24, his wife was informed of this but was not allowed to see him. While in Black Beach prison, Nsue was told that Esono had implicated him in “an attempt to destabilise the country.” He was not given additional details about this claim. 

On October 25, Nsue and other detainees were moved to the Comisaria Central (Central Police Station) in Malabo, where he was held in a large cell with many other detainees and was free to move about. His wife was permitted to visit him daily and to take him food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Arbitrary detention of prominent human rights lawyer Mr Fabián Nsue Nguema|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/20385|work=Frontline Defenders|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Human Rights Lawyer ‘Disappeared’|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/24/equatorial-guinea-human-rights-lawyer-disappeared|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Document - Guinée équatoriale.

Nsue endured nine days of solitary confinement in a dark cell. He and three other detainees were released without charge on the evening of October 30. He was released in the presence of the United States Ambassador, who had lobbied for his freedom. Esono Nsogo remained imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fake|first=Steve|title=Equatorial Guinea Briefly Disappears Dissident|url=http://www.fpif.org/blog?q=Tag%3AFabian+Nsue+Nguema|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea: Human Rights Lawyer ‘Disappeared’|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/24/equatorial-guinea-human-rights-lawyer-disappeared|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Document - Guinée équatoriale.

==Comments about human rights in Equatorial Guinea==

Nsue told the Voice of America in 2008 that Equatorial Guinea is “a criminal state run mostly by greedy illiterates” and that “even though there has been international attention on the problem of human rights in Equatorial Guinea, he thinks the situation is getting worse.” Describing “weekly arbitrary arrests, indefinite detentions without trial, and dozens of political prisoners,” he complained that judges “do not have proper training or independence” and that “authorities use alleged coup attempts to crack down on basic freedoms even more.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Lawyers Struggle in Equatorial Guinea|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2008-05-12-voa31-66647877/557466.html|work=Voice of America|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Bahrain}}
The '''Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy''' ({{lang-ar|حركة حق حركة الحريات و الديمقراطية}}) is an opposition political organization in [[Bahrain]] founded in November 2005 with [[Hasan Mushaima]] as its secretary general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahrain. Political parties|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/bahrain-politics-parties.htm|publisher=Global Security|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of its leaders were previously in the leadership of the [[Al Wefaq]] society, but it also contains others, [[Ali Rabea]], a secular nationalist and former member of parliament previously associated with the [[National Democratic Action Society]], and [[Shaikh Isa Al Jowder]], a Sunni cleric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chanad.weblogs.us/?p=487 Shaikh Isa Al Jowder and the Haq movement] Chan'ad Bahraini.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Haq opposed participation in the parliamentary elections because it considers the 2002 [[Constitution of Bahrain]] to be illegal and unilaterally imposed by King [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifah]], replacing the 1973 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaq.org/en-US/15/ViewArticle/44/4/Default.aspx Haaq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721143138/http://www.haaq.org/en-US/15/ViewArticle/44/4/Default.aspx |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haq called on the [[United Nations]] on 15 November 2006 to investigate allegations that a secret government grouping has been conspiring to fuel sectarian tensions and rig the results of upcoming parliamentary and municipal elections. In a letter addressed to UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] and delivered to Sayed Aqa, the [[UN Development Programme]]'s (UNDP) Bahrain coordinator, Haq called for the forming of an international fact- finding committee to scrutinize the claims made in an August report by the [[Gulf Centre for Democratic Development]] (GCDD).

The 240-page report, dubbed [[Bandargate|Bandar Gate]] after its co-author [[Salah Al Bandar]] - a Briton of [[Sudan]]ese origin who was deported in September to Britain after its publication - alleged that a ring masterminded by a government minister was secretly planning to manipulate the demographic makeup of the country, through the selective granting of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rawstory.com/news/2006/Bahrain_opposition_calls_on_UN_to_i_11152006.html Bahrain opposition calls on UN to investigate "Bandargate" scandal] The Raw Story.

'''Heat therapy''', also called '''thermotherapy''', is the use of [[heat]] in [[therapy]], such as for [[pain relief]] and health. It can take the form of a hot cloth, [[hot water bottle]], [[ultrasound]], [[heating pad]], [[hydrocollator]] packs, [[whirlpool bath]]s, cordless [[Far infrared|FIR]] heat therapy wraps, and others. It can be beneficial to those with [[arthritis]] and stiff [[muscle]]s and injuries to the deep tissue of the skin.  Heat may be an effective self-care treatment for conditions like [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/cochrane/revabstr/AB002826.htm Thermotherapy] for treating [[rheumatoid arthritis]], from [[Cochrane Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat therapy is most commonly used for rehabilitation purposes.  The therapeutic effects of heat include increasing the extensibility of collagen tissues; decreasing joint stiffness; reducing pain; relieving muscle spasms; reducing inflammation, [[edema]], and aids in the post acute phase of healing; and increasing blood flow.  The increased blood flow to the affected area provides proteins, nutrients, and oxygen for better healing.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, William E.  Arnheim’s Principles of Athletic Training: a Competency Based Approach.  New York.  McGraw-Hill.  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
;Direct contact
Moist heat therapy has been believed to be more effective at warming tissues than dry heat, because water transfers heat more quickly than air.  Clinical studies do not support the popular belief that moist heat is more effective than dry heat. Moist heat results in the perception that the tissue is heated more deeply. In fact, recent studies indicate that vasodilation, the expansion of the blood capillaries (vessels) to allow more blood flow, is improved with dry heat therapy. Expansion of the blood capillaries is the primary objective of heat therapy. Heat therapy increases the effect on muscles, joints, and soft tissue.  Heat is typically applied by placing a warming device on the relevant body part.

Newer breeds of heat therapy devices combine a carbon fiber heater with a cordless rechargeable lithium battery and are built into the specific body wrap (''i.e.'', shoulder wrap or back wrap) for targeted heat therapy. Such devices can be used as alternatives to chemical or plugged-in heating pads, but have not been shown to improve the clinical benefit.  All devices primarily provide heat to promote vasodilation.

;Infrared radiation
Infrared radiation is a convenient system to heat parts of our body. It has the advantage over direct contact in that radiation can heat directly the area where the blood capillaries and neuron terminals are. When heat comes from a direct contact source it has to heat the external layer of the skin, and heat is transferred to the deeper layer by conduction. Since [[conduction (heat)|heat conduction]] needs a temperature gradient to proceed, and there is a maximum temperature that can be safely used (around 42&amp;nbsp;°C), this means lower temperature where warming is needed.

[[Infrared]] ('''IR''' for short) is the part of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] spectrum comprised between 0.78 μm and 1&amp;nbsp;mm [[wavelength]]. It is usually divided into three segments:

'''IR-A''', from 0.78 to 1.4 μm.&lt;br&gt;
'''IR-B''', from 1.4 to 3 μm.&lt;br&gt;
'''IR-C''', from 3 μm to 1&amp;nbsp;mm.

IR radiation is more useful than the visible radiation for heating our body, because we absorb most of it, compared to a strong reflection of visible light. Penetration depth of infrared radiation in our skin is dependent of wavelength. IR-A is the most penetrating, and reaches some millimeters, IR-B penetrates into the dermis (about 1&amp;nbsp;mm), and IR-C is mostly absorbed in the external layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)|url=http://www.icnirp.de/documents/infrared.pdf|title=ICNIRP Statement on Far Infrared Radiation Protection|publisher=Health Physics Society|accessdate=2011-02-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719043336/http://www.icnirp.de/documents/infrared.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason the [[infrared lamp]]s used for therapeutic purposes produce mainly IR-A radiation.

== Mechanism of action, and indications ==
Heat creates higher tissue temperatures, which produces [[vasodilation]] that increases the supply of oxygen and nutrients and the elimination of carbon dioxide and metabolic waste.&lt;ref name="Raj"&gt;Raj, P. Pritvi, Practical Management of Pain. Mosby. 2.000. {{ISBN|978-0-8151-2569-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat therapy is useful for [[muscle spasms]], [[myalgia]], [[fibromyalgia]], [[contracture]], [[bursitis]].&lt;ref name="Raj"/&gt;

Moist heat can be used on abscesses to help drain the abscess faster. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000863.htm|title=Skin abscess: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from 2005 showed heat therapy to be effective in treating leishmaniasis, a tropical parasitic skin infection. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reithinger|first=R.|last2=Mohsen|first2=M.|last3=Wahid|first3=M.|last4=Bismullah|first4=M.|last5=Quinnell|first5=R. J.|last6=Davies|first6=C. R.|last7=Kolaczinski|first7=J.|last8=David|first8=J. R.|date=2005-04-15|title=Efficacy of Thermotherapy to Treat Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Caused by Leishmania tropica in Kabul, Afghanistan: A Randomized, Controlled Trial|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/8/1148|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1148–1155|doi=10.1086/428736|issn=1058-4838|pmid=15791515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat therapy is also sometimes used in cancer treatment to augment the effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but it is not enough to kill cancer cells on its own. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/hyperthermia|title=Hyperthermia to Treat Cancer|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2016-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat therapy is contraindicated in case of [[acute injury]] and bleeding disorders (because of vasodilation), tissues with a severe lack of [[stimulus (physiology)|sensitivity]], scars&lt;ref name="Raj" /&gt; and in tissues with inadequate [[vascular]] supply (because of increased metabolic rate and demand which a tissue with poor blood supply may fail to meet resulting in ischemia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLcVBQAAQBAJ|title=Rheumatology Secrets|last=West|first=Sterling|date=2014-10-23|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323172875|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Heat therapy for deep-seated tissue can be treated with shortwave, microwave, and ultrasonic waves. This produces a high temperature that penetrates deeper. Shortwave produces a 27MHz current, microwaves use 915 and 2456 MHz, and ultrasound is an acoustic vibration of 1MHz. The way ultrasonic waves work is they selectively superimpose the incoming wave and increase the energy for absorption, and the significant part of the longitudinal compression gets converted into shear waves. When they are rapidly absorbed, the interface between soft tissue and bone is selectively heated. &lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Justus F. “Thermotherapy.” AccessScience. McGraw-Hill Education, 2014. Web. 2 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==For headaches==

Heat therapy can be used for the treatment of [[headache]]s and [[migraine]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2013}} Many people who suffer from chronic headaches also suffer from tight muscles in their neck and upper back. The application of constant heat to the back/upper back area can help to release the tension associated with headache pain. In order to achieve heat therapy for headaches, many use microwaveable pads{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for claim|date=November 2013}} which can often overheat,  potentially leading to injury, and lose their heat after a few minutes. Some new products use heated water, running through pads, to maintain a constant temperature, allowing headache sufferers to use hands-free heat therapy in the treatment of their headache pain.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for claim, sounds like advertising|date=November 2013}}

==Therapeutic Benefits==
Thermotherapy increase the extensibility of collagen tissues. Using heat, it can relieve the stiffness in joints in different cases. Shortwave and Microwave heat application may reduce muscle spasms, and selective heating with microwaves can accelerate absorption of hematomas. This will, in turn, allow the stiff muscle to stretch. Ultrasounds are not absorbed significantly in homogenous muscle. Heat therapy using hyperthermia has been used to treat cancer in combination with ionizing radiation. &lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Justus F. “Thermotherapy.” AccessScience. McGraw-Hill Education, 2014. Web. 3 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10008">The '''''honours of war''''' are a set of privileges that are granted to a defeated army during the [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] ceremony.  The honours symbolize the valor of the defeated army, and grew into a custom during the age of [[early modern warfare]].  Typically a surrendering garrison was permitted to march out with drums beating and flags flying, after which they would become prisoners of war.

When ''full honours of war'' are granted, the defeated army may march out with its flags flying, drums beating, and bayonets fixed.&lt;ref name=greenspan1969&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenspan|first1=Morris|title=The Soldier's Guide to the Laws of War|date=1969|publisher=Public Affairs Press|location=Washington, DC|page=10|quote=Permission to withdraw with "honors of war," includes the right to march with colors displayed, drums beating, bayonets fixed and swords drawn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[matchlock]] era, [[musket]]men would light their matches on both ends and place musketballs in their mouths.&lt;ref name="wright1934"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=John W.|title=Sieges and Customs of War at the Opening of the Eighteenth Century|journal=The American Historical Review|date=July 1934|volume=39|issue=4|pages=629–644|jstor=1839311|doi=10.1086/ahr/39.4.629}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the defeated army marches past, its band can play a tune of its own choice, customarily an enemy tune.&lt;ref name=tuchman2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuchman|first1=Barbara W.|title=The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution|date=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=9780307798572|quote=He asked for the honors of war to be granted to his garrison in the ceremony of surrender. Among these were the right to attend the ceremony with flags flying and the right to march to music of their choice. For some Byzantine reason of European custom, the right of the capitulators to play the national airs or anthems of the victor was considered to imply that they had put up a good fight.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no requirement that the defeated army select an enemy tune, and the British army at the [[Battles of Saratoga]] (1777) marched out to the tune of [[The British Grenadiers]].&lt;ref name=oshaughnessy2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Shaughnessy|first1=Andrew|title=The Men Who Lost America: British Command during the Revolutionary War and the Preservation of the Empire|date=2013|publisher=Oneworld Publications|page=158|quote=The band played the "British Grenadiers," a favorite of the British army in America, "which not long before was so animating, yet then it seemed by its last feeble effort as if almost ashamed to be heard on such an occasion."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the march-past, the defeated army will stack its arms and turn over any government property to the victor. However, officers may keep their sidearms and personal baggage. The defeated army may also take a couple of cannons with them, along with a symbolic supply of ammunition.&lt;ref name="wright1934"/&gt;&lt;ref name=quebec1759&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles of Capitulation Demanded by Mr. de Ramsay, the King's Lieutenant, commanding the high and low Towns of Quebec|url=http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.42695/6?r=0&amp;s=1|date=18 September 1759|quote=The Garrison of the town, composed of Land forces, marines and sailors, shall march out with their arms and bagage, drums beating, matches lighted, with two pieces of french cannon, and twelve rounds for each piece; and shall be embarked as conveniently as possible, to be sent to the first port in France.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Fred|title=Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766|date=2007|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|isbn=9780307425393|page=153|quote=Montcalm, as a professional officer exquisitely sensitive to the etiquette of surrender, judged that the brief British defense had been insufficient to merit magnanimity.

== Denial of honours ==

It is common for commanders to withhold the honours of war in retaliation for some other incident. The American defenders had been refused the honours of war when they surrendered after the [[Siege of Charleston]] (1780). When negotiating the surrender of a British army at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] a year later, American General George Washington insisted: "The same Honors will be granted to the Surrendering Army as were granted to the Garrison of Charles Town."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Washington on General Cornwallis' Surrender at Yorktown|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/amrev/peace/yorktown.html|website=The American Revolution, 1763-1783|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the British had to march with flags furled and muskets shouldered, and the surrender articles insisted that the band play "a British or German march."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surrender of the British General Cornwallis to the Americans, October 19, 1781|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/war-for-independence/resources/surrender-british-general-cornwallis-americans-october|website=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|quote=Article 3 states that: “the garrison of York will march out to a place to be appointed in front of the posts, at two o’clock precisely, with shouldered arms, colors cased, and drums beating a British or German march. They are then to ground their arms, and return to their encampments, where they will remain until they are dispatched to the places of their destination.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The honours of war are considered to be a symbolic recognition of a valiant defense.&lt;ref name=steele1990/&gt; Therefore, a victorious general may also refuse to grant the honours of war if he feels that the enemy has given up too easily. For example, after the British commander was killed by a cannonball at the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)]], his replacement quickly decided to surrender. The French [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|General Montcalm]] refused to grant honours of war to the British because he felt that they had not put up enough of a fight.&lt;ref name=anderson2007/&gt;

== History ==

The honours of war became traditional in the age of [[early modern warfare]], when sieges were more common, and logistical challenges made it difficult to corner a defeated enemy after a battlefield victory.&lt;ref name="wright1934"/&gt; However, the practice continued into the age of [[industrial warfare]]. After the [[Siege of Metz (1870)]], the Prussians offered honours of war to the capitulating French army, but the French general [[François Achille Bazaine|Bazaine]] refused to accept them.&lt;ref name="howard2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Michael|title=The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870–1871|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136753060|quote=Finally Bazaine completed the shame of his army by refusing even the honours of war which the Prussians spontaneously offered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[World War II]], the Germans granted the honours of war to the defeated French garrison at the [[Siege of Lille (1940)]],&lt;ref name="keegan1990"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=The Second World War|date=1990|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=014011341X|quote=So, too, shortly would the divisions of the French First Army which were encircled at Lille and running out of ammunition. So bravely had they fought that, when they marched out to surrender on 30 May, the Germans rendered them the honours of war, playing them into captivity with the music of a military band.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fermer|first1=Douglas|title=Three German Invasions of France: The Summer Campaigns of 1870, 1914, and 1940|date=2013|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Military|location=Barnsley|isbn=9781781593547|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British granted the honours of war to the defeated Italian army at the [[Battle of Amba Alagi (1941)]].&lt;ref name="fuller1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=J.F.C.|title=The Second World War, 1939-45 : a strategical and tactical history|date=1993|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|isbn=9780306805066|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The honours of war remain part of the [[Law of war|laws of war]], although terms such as the retention of cannons have become obsolete. The 2015 Law of War Manual from the [[United States Department of Defense]] specifies that:

{{quote|text=Capitulations agreed upon between belligerents must take into account the rules of military honor.

Conditions involving unnecessary disgrace or ignominy should not be insisted upon. Capitulations may include the right of the capitulating forces to surrender with colors displayed or other indications of professional respect for the capitulating forces. For example, it may be appropriate to allow surrendering officers to keep their side arms.&lt;ref name="dod2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Office of General Counsel, Department of Defense|title=Department of Defense Law of War Manual|date=June 2015|page=842|url=http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/Law-of-War-Manual-June-2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''In re Summers''''', 325 U.S. 561 (1945), is a 5-to-4 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] which held that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourtheenth]] amendment freedoms of a [[conscientious objector]] were not infringed when a state [[bar association]] declined to admit him to the practice of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=In re Summers|325|561|1945}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Illinois Constitution]] required&lt;ref&gt;This provision has subsequently been removed.&lt;/ref&gt; citizens to serve in the state militia in time of war, and all lawyers admitted to the bar were required to uphold the state constitution.&lt;ref name="Sheffer160"&gt;Sheffer, ''God Versus Caesar: Belief, Worship, and Proselytizing Under the First Amendment,'' 1999, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Petitioner [[Clyde Summers]] could not uphold that constitutional requirement due to his religious beliefs, and the Supreme Court upheld the [[Denial of request|denial]] of his license of practice.&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schultz, West, and MacLean, ''Encyclopedia of Religion in American Politics,'' 1999, p. 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Clyde Summers entered the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] at the age of 16, earning a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Accounting]] in 1939 and a [[Juris Doctor]] (''[[cum laude]]'') in 1942.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/business/12summers.html Greenhouse, Steven. "Clyde Summers, Advocate of Labor Union Democracy, Is Dead at 91." ''New York Times.'' November 11, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph47"&gt;Joseph, ''Black Mondays: Worst Decisions of the Supreme Court,'' 1987, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; While an undergraduate and law student, Summers became active in the [[Wesley Foundation|Methodist Student Movement]] and a believer in the [[social gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, "Present at the Creation: Clyde Summers and the Field of Union Democracy Law," ''Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal,'' 2010, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] entered World War II on December 8, 1941.  Summers, opposed to the use of force, declared himself a [[conscientious objector]].&lt;ref name="Shearer"&gt;Shearer, ''Home Front Heroes,'' 2007, p. 790.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Summers sought admission to the [[Illinois State Bar Association]], a prerequisite to the practice of law in the state of Illinois.  The [[bar association]] admitted he was of high moral character and exhibited excellent knowledge of the law, but in January 1943 denied him admission due to his conscientious objector status.&lt;ref&gt;Konvitz, ''Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly,'' 2003, p. 224-225; ''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 564.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 12 of the Illinois constitution required citizens to serve in the state militia in time of war, and all lawyers admitted to the bar were required to uphold the state constitution.&lt;ref name="Sheffer160"/&gt; However, Illinois had not drafted citizens into its state militia since 1864, Article 12 prohibited the drafting of conscientious objectors into the militia during peacetime, and the article permitted conscientious objectors to engage in work of significant national importance during war in lieu of military service.&lt;ref name="Sheffer160"/&gt; Nonetheless, Summers could not uphold the relevant constitutional requirement due to his religious beliefs, the bar association said.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

With representation by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]],&lt;ref&gt;Kutulas, ''The American Civil Liberties Union and the Making of Modern Liberalism: 1930-1960,'' 2006, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Summers sued, alleging that the bar association's actions had infringed his First and Fourteenth amendment rights. The [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] held that 1) The courts had no jurisdiction over the issue, and thus no "case or controversy" existed under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Cases and controversies|Article Three of the Constitution]]; and 2) The bar association had not discriminated against Summers on the basis of his religion but rather on the basis of his ability to uphold the military service section of the Illinois state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 564-565.&lt;/ref&gt;

Summers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and which granted [[certiorari]].

== Opinion of the Court ==

=== Majority ===
[[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Stanley Forman Reed]] wrote the decision for the majority, joined by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Harlan F. Stone|Stone]] and Associate Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]].

Reed first reviewed the case proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 562-565.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the "case or controversy" aspect of the issue, Reed concluded that the admission of a lawyer to the bar was "a ministerial act which is performed by virtue of the judicial power, such as the appointment of a clerk or bailiff or the specification of the requirements of eligibility or the course of study for applicants for admission to the bar, rather than a judicial proceeding."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 565-566.&lt;/ref&gt; However, under ''[[Osborn v. Bank of the United States]]'', 22 U.S. 738 (1824), because the judicial power is invoked, this allows a case to arise.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 566-567.&lt;/ref&gt; But was there a controversy?  For a controversy to exist, Reed said, it must follow the rule laid down in ''[[Muskrat v. United States]]'', 219 U.S. 346 (1911), which held that there must be actual disagreement and merely a hypothetical or potential disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 567.&lt;/ref&gt; The record in ''In re Summers'' was incomplete and the response for petition of certiorari from the Illinois Supreme Court was oddly formed, leaving the issue of a controversy muddied.  But the majority concluded that since the bar association committee had formed at the request of the Illinois Supreme Court and that court had acted on Summers' petition for relief, a true controversy existed.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 567-568.&lt;/ref&gt; Without discussion, Reed furthermore asserted that denial of the right to practice law is a controversy, and a denial of that right by a state court triggers federal jurisdiction under Article Three of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 568-569.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addressing Summers' conscientious objector claim, Reed denigrated Summers as a "religionist."&lt;ref name="Sheffer160"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 570.&lt;/ref&gt; Reed next asserted that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to federal rights, not to purely state-guaranteed rights such as the right to practice law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 571.&lt;/ref&gt; But were Summers' First Amendment rights implicated?  The majority concluded they were not. Reed asserted that the Illinois Supreme Court had not discriminated against Summers on the basis of his religion, but rather on his ability to uphold the Illinois Constitution's requirement that he serve in the militia:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
:It is said that the action of the Supreme Court of Illinois is contrary to the principles of that portion of the First Amendment which guarantees the free exercise of religion. Of course, under our Constitutional system, men could not be excluded from the practice of law, or indeed from following any other calling, simply because they belong to any of our religious groups, whether Protestant, Catholic, Quaker, or Jewish, assuming it conceivable that any state of the Union would draw such a religious line. We cannot say that any such purpose to discriminate motivated the action of the Illinois Supreme Court.
Reed reviewed Summers' beliefs, noting that he had been certified a conscientious objector by the federal government, his beliefs were religiously founded, and his beliefs were sincerely held.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt; But the Illinois Supreme Court had held that Summers would not serve in the militia if drafted, a claim which Summers had failed to challenge.&lt;ref name="Summers572"&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 572.&lt;/ref&gt;

But these [[Pacifism|pacifist]] religious beliefs were not protected by the First Amendment, Reed said. Relying on ''[[Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California]]'', 293 U.S. 245 (1934), he declared conscientious objection a "grace of Congressional recognition" and noted that the state of Illinois recognized no such rights.&lt;ref name="Summers572" /&gt;

The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court was affirmed.&lt;ref name="Summers573"&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 573.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissent ===
Associate Justice [[Hugo Black]] wrote a dissent, in which he was joined by Associate Justices [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]].

Black bluntly phrased the issue in terms starkly different than the majority's: "It has denied him a license on the ground that his present religious beliefs disqualify him for membership in the legal profession."&lt;ref name="Summers573" /&gt; Black reviewed Summers' qualifications for the bar, which were exceptionally high and otherwise undisputed.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 574.&lt;/ref&gt; He also reviewed the foundation for Summers' deep religious convictions and opposition to the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 574-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black found the majority's distinction between upholding the Illinois Constitution and discriminating against Summers' religious beliefs "circuitous".&lt;ref name="Summers576"/&gt; The Illinois Constitution, he said, would discriminate against entire religions, and could lead to the inescapable conclusion that the state could bar a conscientious objector from a wide range of constitutional protections merely by refusing to grant these protections to nonresistors.  He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 575.&lt;/ref&gt;
:I cannot believe that a state statute would be consistent with our constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion if it specifically denied the right to practice law to all members of one of our great religious groups, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And it is obvious that the same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force.
Black concluded that the Illinois Constitution's requirement was essentially a "test oath," an oath designed to test one's loyalty before any illegal act had actually occurred.  But, relying on ''[[Cummings v. Missouri]]'', 71 U.S. 277 (1867) and ''[[Ex parte Garland]]'', 71 U.S. 333 (1866), Black said that test oaths were anathema to the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Summers576"&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 576.&lt;/ref&gt; "This feeling was made manifest in Article VI of the Constitution, which provides that 'no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.'"&lt;ref name="Summers576" /&gt; Illinois has the power to draft its citizens, and to punish them for refusing to serve in its militia, Black said, but it does not have the right to assume beforehand that Summers would take the bar association oath in bad faith and fail to fulfill it at some indeterminate time in the future.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 576-577.&lt;/ref&gt; This thinking had been rejected by Associate Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] in his dissent in ''[[United States v. Schwimmer]]'', 279 U.S. 644 (1929), and by Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] in his dissent in ''[[United States v. Macintosh]]'', 283 U.S. 605 (1931), and Black embraced their views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Finally, Black noted that Illinois had not imposed a draft since 1864 and that the majority was engaging in mere speculation about imposing one in the future. There was no violation of the oath, and no actual inability to uphold the state constitution, Black concluded. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[T]&lt;/nowiki&gt;he probability that Illinois would ever call the petitioner to serve in a war has little more reality than an imaginary quantity in mathematics. I cannot agree that a state can lawfully bar from a semi-public position a well qualified man of good character solely because he entertains a religious belief which might prompt him at some time in the future to violate a law which has not yet been and may never be enacted."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 577-578.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black would have overturned the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Summers'', 325 U.S. at 578.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent developments ==
Chief Justice Stone cast the deciding vote in the case.&lt;ref name="Sheffer160"/&gt; Although his vote contradicted the vast majority of his previous "freedom of religion" votes and decisions, Stone's reasons for deciding against free exercise in this case are not recorded.&lt;ref name="Sheffer160" /&gt;
===Legacy===
The Court's ruling in ''In re Summers'' has been sharply criticized. Despite Justice Reed's stated respect for Summers' religious beliefs, Reed denigrated him as a "religionist" (someone whose beliefs are not thought through and imfirmly held).&lt;ref name="Sheffer160"/&gt; Reed also imposed his own theology on the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian Bible]], openly criticizing Summers for misinterpreting its tenets and for practicing (rather than merely reading) it.&lt;ref name="Sheffer160"/&gt; One historian has said that "Justice Stanley Reed's majority opinion &lt;nowiki&gt;[is]&lt;/nowiki&gt; lacking in anay analysis of the serious constitutional issue involved".&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, ''The Price of Rights: The Courts, the Welfare State, and Civil Liberties,'' 2003, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; A legal scholar has said that Reed's decision is "merely" that Illinois had the right to interpret its oath however it chose.&lt;ref&gt;Konvitz, ''Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly,'' 2003, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissents of Holmes in ''Schwimmer'', Hughes in ''Macintosh'', and Black in ''In re Summers'' have since become the majority view of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Konvitz225"&gt;Konvitz, ''Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly,'' 2003, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Schwimmer'' and ''Macintosh'' were overruled in ''[[Girouard v. United States]]'', 328 U.S. 61 (1946).&lt;ref name="Konvitz225" /&gt; But even though the cases which formed the basis of the decision in ''In re Summers'' were disavowed, the Court reaffirmed ''Summers'' in 1950 in ''[[American Communications Association v. Douds]]'', 339 U.S. 382 (1950).&lt;ref&gt;Konvitz, ''Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly,'' 2003, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; ''In re Summers'' became the basis for the Court to uphold a number of loyalty oath cases during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Walker153"&gt;Walker, ''In Defense of American Liberties: A History of the ACLU,'' 1999, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Minority Front''' is a [[political party]] in [[South Africa]]. Though the party aims to represent all minorities of South Africa, its support comes mainly from South Africa's [[Indian South Africans|Indian community]]. Its largest base of political strength is in the province of [[KwaZulu-Natal]], especially the city of [[Durban]] which is the cultural and demographic centre of South Africa's Indian community. It was led by the charismatic [[Amichand Rajbansi]] until his death in December 2011.

==History==

It was formed as a successor to the [[National People's Party (South Africa, 1981)|National People's Party]], which was an important party led by Rajbansi in the Indian-only [[South African House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] in the [[Tricameral Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/rajbansi-bombastic-thick-skinned-and-controversial-1.1205795|title=Rajbansi: Bombastic, thick-skinned and controversial - IOL News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Rajbansi's widow, Shameen Thakur-Rajbansi, was appointed as leader in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/f9f7128049d97375b029b1339fa56bea/Shameen-Thakur-Rajbansi-appointed-new-MF-leader-20121901 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230912/http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/f9f7128049d97375b029b1339fa56bea/Shameen-Thakur-Rajbansi-appointed-new-MF-leader-20121901 |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A leadership and family battle erupted when an attempt was made to replace Thakur-Rajbansi as leader, with Amichand Rajbansi's son, Vimal, and first wife, Asha Devi Rajbansi, asking her to step down, and a breakaway conference (not recognized by the IEC) elected [[Royith Bhoola|Roy Bhoola]], who Thakur-Rajbansi had attempted to remove from public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepost.co.za/minority-front-factions-causes-friction-1.1371623|title=The Post|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/rajbansi-is-ousted-as-head-of-minority-front-1.1425642|title=Rajbansi is ousted as head of Minority Front - IOL News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thakur-Rajbansi was declared the undisputed leader in December 2013 after the parties settled their disputes in a confidential agreement.&lt;ref name="iol.co.za"/&gt;

'''Molad: The Center for the Renewal of Israeli Democracy''' (מולד) is a progressive Israeli [[think tank]] established in 2012 in [[Jerusalem]]. The Center's website describes it as "dedicated to the fundamental political and social issues of Israeli life".&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.molad.org/en/about/molad/ |title=About |publisher=Molad |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and mission==
Molad was created in 2012, and its work is divided into three content categories: security and state, [[citizenship]], and [[socio-economics]].&lt;ref name=about /&gt; Its founders are [[Avraham Burg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/molad_the_center_for_the_renewal_of_democracy|title=Molad: The Center for the Renewal of Democracy|publisher=[[NGO Monitor]]|date=16 November 2014|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dror Eydar|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_opinion.php?id=8633|title=It's not all about the money|date=6 June 2014|work=[[Israel HaYom]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Assaf Sharon and Avner Inbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molad.org/about/molad/|title=History|publisher=Molad |accessdate= January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its executive director is Liat Schlesinger, and its academic director is Dr. Assaf Sharon.

According to a 2012 article in ''[[Haaretz]]'', Molad is "committed to leftist renewal" in Israel and believes that "the left must present reliable, comprehensible policy on key issues, a policy aimed at reviving the left as a credible, viable political force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Verter|first=Yossi|title=Reviving the Israeli left is a ten year project, says think tank|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/reviving-the-israeli-left-is-a-ten-year-project-says-think-tank-1.456919 |publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=November 7, 2013|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its political views are progressive.

Since its founding, the Center's senior fellows have included high-profile Israeli academics and politicians including Professor of Law Chaim Gans,

Molad partnered with the [[Center for American Progress]] in organizing a symposium addressing U.S. and Israeli foreign policy and regional security in the Middle East, on 1 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/articles/195352/center-for-american-progress-partners-with-liberal/|title=Center for American Progress Partners With Liberal Israeli Think Tank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.583416 |title=Netanyahu prefers status quo to working for peace, analysts say}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molad is opposed to Israeli settlements in the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=670186 Israel finance minister suspends settlement funds]&lt;/ref&gt; One Molad representative has called the settlement movement a geographical failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mikhael Manekin on the Future of the Israeli Left at J Street|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRhelt1R5Yc=|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another stated that the reversibility of the settlements is highly possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Remnick|first=David|title=The Party Faithful|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/21/130121fa_fact_remnick?currentPage=all |work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=November 13, 2013|date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produced a 2012 report concluding that Israel does not have a "Hasbara", or "PR", problem, but that its image is instead harmed by poor policy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravid|first=Barak|title=Think tank: Israel’s poor international image not the fault of failed Hasbara|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/think-tank-israel-s-poor-international-image-not-the-fault-of-failed-hasbara.premium-1.490718|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=November 7, 2013|date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pillar|first=Paul|title=It’s the Policy, Not the Salesmanship|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/paul-pillar/its-the-policy-not-the-salesmanship-7923 |newspaper=[[The National Interest]]|accessdate=November 21, 2013|date=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, Molad published another report recommending the revival of the [[Arab Peace Initiative]]. It supported [[Chuck Hagel]]'s nomination for U.S. Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armbruster|first=Ben|title=Israeli Think Tank Defends Hagel Against Neocon Smears|url=http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/01/09/1424181/molad-hagel/ |publisher=[[ThinkProgress]]|accessdate=November 7, 2013|date=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization published a report in June 2013 which states that the proposed Basic Law declaring Israel the "nation-state of the Jewish people" is “both illegitimate and dangerous” and “undermines the original values of Zionism.” According to the report:  "It is illegitimate because its formulators and backers are attempting to… decide on issues of profound controversy regarding identity, culture, and society."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.molad.org/en/researches/basic-law-Israel-nation-state-of-the-Jewish-people&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Revolutionary Army''' ('''NRA'''), sometimes shortened to '''Revolutionary Army''' (革命軍) before 1928, and as '''National Army''' (國軍) after 1928, was the military arm of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party) from 1925 until 1947 in the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]]. It also became the [[regular army]] of the ROC during the KMT's period of [[Dang Guo|party rule]] beginning in 1928. It was renamed the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] after the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|1947 Constitution]], which instituted [[civilian control of the military]].

Originally organized with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aid as a means for the KMT to unify China during the [[Warlord Era]], the National Revolutionary Army fought major engagements in the [[Northern Expedition]] against the Chinese [[Beiyang Army]] warlords, in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937&amp;ndash;1945) against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and in the [[Chinese Civil War]] against the [[People's Liberation Army]].

During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the armed forces of the [[Communist Party of China]] were nominally incorporated into the National Revolutionary Army (while retaining separate commands), but broke away to form the People's Liberation Army shortly after the end of the war. With the promulgation of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 1947 and the formal end of the KMT party-state, the National Revolutionary Army was renamed the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]], with the bulk of its forces forming the [[Republic of China Army]], which retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]] in 1949.

==History==
[[Image:Chiang1926.jpg|thumb|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, emerged from the Northern Expedition as the leader of China.]]
[[Image:Kmtarmy.JPG|thumb|200px|The NRA during World War II]]
The NRA was founded by the KMT in 1925 as the military force destined to unite China in the [[Northern Expedition]]. Organized with the help of the [[Comintern]] and guided under the doctrine of the [[Three Principles of the People]], the distinction among party, state and army was often blurred. A large number of the Army's officers passed through the [[Whampoa Military Academy]], and the first commandant, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], became commander-in-chief of the Army in 1925 before launching the successful Northern Expedition. Other prominent commanders included [[Du Yuming]] and [[Chen Cheng]]. The end of the Northern Expedition in 1928 is often taken as the date when China's Warlord era ended, though smaller-scale warlord activity continued for years afterwards.

In 1927, after the dissolution of the [[First United Front (China)|First United Front]] between the Nationalists and the Communists, the ruling KMT purged its leftist members and largely eliminated Soviet influence from its ranks. Chiang Kai-shek then turned to [[Germany]], historically a great military power, for the reorganization and modernization of the National Revolutionary Army. The [[Weimar Republic]] sent advisors to China, but because of the restrictions imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] they could not serve in military capacities. Chiang initially requested famous generals such as [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] and [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] as advisors; the Weimar Republic government turned him down, however, fearing that they were too famous, would invite the ire of the Allies and that it would result in the loss of national prestige for such renowned figures to work, essentially, as [[mercenary|mercenaries]].

When [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor]] in 1933 and disavowed the Treaty, the anti-communist [[Nazi Party]] and the anti-communist KMT were soon engaged in close cooperation. with Germany training Chinese troops and expanding Chinese infrastructure, while China opened its markets and natural resources to Germany. [[Max Bauer]] was the first advisor to China.

In 1934 Gen. [[Hans von Seeckt]], acting as advisor to Chiang, proposed an ''"80 Division Plan"'' for reforming the entire Chinese army into 80 divisions of highly trained, well-equipped troops organised along German lines. The plan was never fully realised, as the eternally bickering [[warlord]]s could not agree upon which divisions were to be merged and disbanded. Furthermore, since embezzlement and fraud were commonplace, especially in understrength divisions (the state of most of the divisions), reforming the military structure would threaten divisional commanders' "take". Therefore, by July 1937 only eight infantry divisions had completed reorganization and training. These were the [[3rd Infantry Division (National Revolutionary Army)|3rd]], [[6th Infantry Division (National Revolutionary Army)|6th]], [[9th Infantry Division (National Revolutionary Army)|9th]], [[14th Infantry Division (National Revolutionary Army)|14th]], [[36th Infantry Division (National Revolutionary Army)|36th]], [[87th Infantry Division (National Revolutionary Army)|87th]], [[88th Division (National Revolutionary Army)|88th]], and the [[Training Division (National Revolutionary Army)|Training Division]].

For a time, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Communist forces fought as a nominal part of the National Revolutionary Army, forming the [[Eighth Route Army]] and the [[New Fourth Army]] units, but this co-operation later fell apart. Throughout the Chinese Civil War the National Revolutionary Army experienced major problems with desertion, with many soldiers switching sides to fight for the Communists.

Troops in India and Burma during World War II included the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force (Burma)]], the [[Chinese Army in India]] and [[Y Force]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Charles F. Romanus and Riley Sunderland, [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-CBI-Mission/][[United States Army in World War II]]&lt;span&gt;: China-Burma-India Theater&lt;/span&gt;, United States Army, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

After the drafting and implementation of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] in 1947, the National Revolutionary Army was renamed as the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://totallyhistory.com/national-revolutionary-army/|title=National Revolutionary Army Summary - China's Military in WWII|date=2013-06-07|work=Totally History|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[Image:Countermand concession.jpg|thumb|left|250px|National Revolutionary Army soldiers marched into the British concessions in [[Hankou District|Hankou]] during the [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]].]]
At the apex of the NRA was the National Military Council, also translated as [[Military Affairs Commission]]. Chaired by Chiang Kai-Shek, it directed the staffs and commands. It included from 1937 the Chief of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]], General [[He Yingqin]], the General Staff, the War Ministry, the military regions, air and naval forces, air defence and garrison commanders, and support services.

The NRA throughout its lifespan recruited approximately 4,300,000 regulars, in 370 Standard Divisions (正式師), 46 New Divisions (新編師), 12 Cavalry Divisions (騎兵師), eight New Cavalry Divisions (新編騎兵師), 66 Temporary Divisions (暫編師), and 13 Reserve Divisions (預備師), for a grand total of 515 [[division (military)|division]]s. However, many divisions were formed from two or more other divisions, and were not active at the same time.

Also, New Divisions were created to replace Standard Divisions lost early in the war and were issued the old division's number. Therefore, the number of divisions in active service at any given time is much smaller than this. The average NRA division had 5,000–6,000 troops; an average army division had 10,000–15,000 troops, the equivalent of a Japanese division. Not even the [[German-trained divisions]] were on par in terms of manpower with a German or Japanese division, having only 10,000 men.

The United States Army's campaign brochure on the China Defensive campaign of 1942–45 said:&lt;ref&gt;United States Army, [http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/72-38/72-38.htm China Defensive 4 July 1942 - 4 May 1945], p.5&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The NRA only had small number of armoured vehicles and mechanised troops. At the beginning of the war in 1937 the armour were organized in three Armoured Battalions, equipped with tanks and armoured cars from various countries. After these battalions were mostly destroyed in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] and [[Battle of Nanjing]]. The newly provided tanks, armoured cars, and trucks from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Italy]] made it possible to create the only mechanized division in the army, the [[200th Division (National Revolutionary Army)|200th Division]]. This Division eventually ceased to be a mechanized unit after the June 1938 reorganization of Divisions. The armoured and artillery Regiments were placed under direct command of [[Chinese 5th Corps|5th Corps]] and the 200th Division became a motorized Infantry Division within the same Corps. This Corps fought battles in [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]] in 1939–1940 and in the [[Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road]] in 1942 reducing the armored units due to losses and mechanical breakdown of the vehicles. On paper China had 3.8 million men under arms in 1941. They were organized into 246 "front-line" divisions, with another 70 divisions assigned to rear areas. Perhaps as many as forty Chinese divisions had been equipped with European-manufactured weapons and trained by foreign, particularly German and Soviet, advisers. The rest of the units were under strength and generally untrained. Overall, the Nationalist Army impressed most Western military observers as more reminiscent of a 19th- than a 20th-century army.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Late in the [[Burma Campaign]] the NRA Army there had an armored battalion equipped with Sherman tanks.

Despite the poor reviews given by European observers to the European-trained Divisions, the Muslim Divisions of the National Revolutionary Army, trained in China (not by westerners) and led by [[Ma Clique]] Muslim generals, frightened the European observers with their appearance and fighting skills in battle. Europeans like Sven Hedin and Georg Vasel were in awe of the appearance Chinese Muslim NRA divisions made and their ferocious combat abilities. They were trained in harsh, brutal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=sven+hedin+ma+chung-ying&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KziGbXektN&amp;sig=zvle_1dkzNnOTGb7rgxp4Xhf_wo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FGdTTMzhB4GB8gbc_aTEBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=sven%20hedin%20ma%20chung-ying&amp;f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911-1949|author=Andrew D.

The division was lacking in technology and manpower, but badly damanged the superior Russian force.

The Muslim divisions of the army controlled by Muslim Gen. [[Ma Hongkui]] were reported by western observers to be tough and disciplined despite having diabetes. Ma Hongkui personally drilled with his troops, and engaged in sword fencing during training.&lt;ref name="LIFE Nov 1, 1948 Ma Hung-Kwei"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Ma-Hung-kwei&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v62VTIzPJsKqlAem5P2kCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#|title=LIFE|first=Time|last=Inc|date=1 November 1948|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the leaders of many of the warlord and provincial armies joined with the KMT and were appointed as officers and generals, their troops joined the NRA. These armies were renamed as NRA divisions. The entire Ma Clique armies were absorbed into the NRA. When the Muslim Ma Clique General [[Ma Qi]] joined the KMT, the [[Ninghai Army]] was renamed the National Revolutionary Army 26th Division.

The unit organisation of the NRA is as follows: (Note that a unit is not necessarily subordinate to one immediately above it; several army regiments can be found under an army group, for example.)
The commander-in-chief of the NRA from 1925 to 1947 was [[Generalissimo]] Chiang Kai-shek.

The Corps became the basic tactical unit of the NRA having strength nearly equivalent to an allied Division.

===Penal Battalions===
During the [[Chinese Civil War]] the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) was known to have used penal battalions from 1945 to 1949. A unit made up of deserters and those accused of cowardice, the penal battalion was giving such tasks as scouting ahead of the main forces to check for ambushes, crossing rivers and torrents to see whether they were fordable, and walking across unmapped minefields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Osprey Guide to...The Chinese Civil War 1945-1949|last=Lynch|first=Michael|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2010|isbn=978 1 4728 1025 0|location=|pages=Kindle Locations 878-880|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conscription===

The military was formed through bloody and inhumane [[conscription]] campaigns . These are described by [[Rudolph Rummel]] as:&lt;blockquote&gt;
This was a deadly affair in which men were kidnapped for the army, rounded up indiscriminately by press-gangs or army units among those on the roads or in the towns and villages, or otherwise gathered together. Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps like Buchenwald.3 Probably 3,081,000 died during the Sino-Japanese War; likely another 1,131,000 during the Civil War--4,212,000 dead in total.&lt;ref name=Rummel&gt;{{cite web|last1=R.J.Rummel|title=CHINA'S BLOODY CENTURY|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CHINA.CHAP1.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{See also|Development of Chinese armoured forces (1927&amp;ndash;45)|Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937–1945)|List of World War II firearms of China}}
Chinese weapons were mainly produced for the National Revolutionary Army in the [[Hanyang Arsenal|Hanyang]], Guangdong and [[Taiyuan Arsenal]]s.
[[File:KMTcadet.jpg|thumb|A Chinese Nationalist Army soldier equipped with a [[Stahlhelm|German M35 helmet]] and a [[ZB vz. 26]].]]
[[File:Cecil Beaton Photographs- General IB2789C.jpg|thumb|German-equipped Chinese troops practicing a march at the [[Chinese Military Academy]] at [[Chengtu]] in 1944.]]
For regular provincial Chinese divisions the standard rifles were the [[Hanyang 88]] (copy of [[Gewehr 88]]). Central army divisions were typically equipped with the [[Chiang Kai-shek rifle]] (copy of [[Gewehr 98|Mauser Standard Model]]) and Czechoslovakian [[vz. 24]]. However, for most of the German-trained divisions, the standard firearms were German-made [[8 mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[Gewehr 98]] and [[Karabiner 98k]]. The standard [[light machine gun]] was a local copy of the Czech [[8 mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[Brno ZB26]]. There were also Belgian and French light machine guns. Provincial units generally did not possess any machine guns, while Central Army units had one LMG per platoon on average. The German-trained divisions ideally had 1 LMG per squad. Surprisingly, the NRA did not purchase any [[MG 34|Maschinengewehr 34]]s from [[Germany]], but did produce its own copies of them. [[Heavy machine gun]]s were mainly locally-made Type 24 [[water-cooled]] [[Maxim gun]]s (which were the Chinese copies of the German [[MG08]]), and Type 30 [[M1917 Browning machine gun]]s chambered for the standard 8mm Mauser round. On average, every Central Army [[battalion]] would get one heavy machine gun (about a third to half of what actual German divisions got during [[World War II]]). The standard sidearm for NCOs and officers was the [[7 mm caliber|7.63 mm]] [[Mauser C96]] [[semi-automatic pistol]], or [[full-automatic]] [[Mauser M1932]]/M712 [[machine pistol]]. These full-automatic versions were used as substitutes for submachine guns (such as the [[MP 18]]) and rifles that were in short supply within the Chinese army prior to the end of World War II. Throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War, particularly in the early years, the NRA also extensively used captured Japanese weapons and equipment. as their own were in short supply. Some élite units also used Lend-Lease US equipment as the war progressed.

Generally speaking, the regular provincial army divisions did not possess any artillery. However, some Central Army divisions were equipped with 37&amp;nbsp;mm [[PaK 35/36]] [[anti-tank gun]]s, and/or [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s from [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]], Madsen, and [[Solothurn]]. Each of these infantry divisions ideally had 6 [[France|French]] Brandt 81&amp;nbsp;mm mortars and 6 [[Solothurn]] 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[autocannon]]s. Some independent brigades and artillery regiments were equipped with [[Bofors]] [[72 mm L/14]], or [[Krupp]] 72&amp;nbsp;mm [[L/29]] [[mountain guns]] and there were 24 [[Rheinmetall]] 150&amp;nbsp;mm [[15 cm sFH 18|L/32 sFH 18]] [[howitzer]]s (bought in 1934) and 24 [[Krupp]] 150&amp;nbsp;mm [[15 cm sFH 18|L/30 sFH 18]] [[howitzers]] (bought in 1936). At the start of the war, the NRA and the Tax Police Regiment had three tank battalions armed with German [[Panzer I]] light tanks and [[L3/33|CV-33]] tankettes. After defeat in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] the remaining tanks, together with several hundred [[T-26]] and [[BT-5]] tanks acquired from the Soviet Union were reorganised into the 200th Division.

Infantry uniforms were basically redesigned [[Zhongshan suit]]s. [[Puttee]]s were standard for soldiers and officers alike, since the primary mode of movement for NRA troops was by foot. Troops were also issued sewn field caps. The helmets were the most distinguishing characteristic of these divisions. From the moment German [[Stahlhelm#M1935.2F1940|M35]] helmets (standard issue for the Wehrmacht until late in the European theatre) rolled off the production lines in 1935, and until 1936, the NRA imported 315,000 of these helmets, each with the [[Blue Sky with a White Sun]] emblem of the ROC on the sides. These helmets were worn by both elite German-trained divisions and regular Central Army divisions. Other helmets included the French [[Adrian helmet]], the British [[Brodie helmet]] and later the American [[M1 helmet]]. Other equipment included straw shoes for soldiers (cloth shoes for Central Army), leather shoes for officers and leather boots for high-ranking officers. Every soldier was issued ammunition for his weapon, along with ammunition pouches or harness, a [[hip flask|water flask]], [[combat knife|combat knives]], food bag, and a [[gas mask]].

Spears and swords in addition to rifles were used by the Muslim Ma Clique sections of the National Revolutionary Army, who were renowned for their fine cavalry.&lt;ref name="LIFE Nov 1, 1948 Ma Hung-Kwei"/&gt; The Muslims had an assortment of rifles, German, British, Russian and others.

'''Nationalist Youth of Catalonia''' (''Joventut Nacionalista de Catalunya'', '''JNC''') is the [[youth organisation]] of the [[Catalan European Democratic Party]] (PDeCAT), founded in 1980 as the youth group of [[Democratic Convergence of Catalonia]] (CDC). Sergi Miquel (also a [[PDeCAT]] member of [[Congreso de los Diputados|Congress]] for [[Girona (Congress of Deputies constituency)|Girona]] is the general secretary since 2015.

==History==
[[File:Manifestació de la Joventut Nacionalista de Catalunya (JNC) a Barcelona per l'Onze de Setembre.jpg|thumb|JNC demostration in the [[National Day of Catalonia]] (2005).]]

The organization gradually evolved to [[Catalan independence|independentist]] positions, which also influenced the political orientation of [[Democratic Convergence of Catalonia|CDC]]&lt;ref&gt;Martín i Berbois, Josep Lluís. ''Joventut Nacionalista de Catalunya. Escola de Patriotes''. [[Girona]]: Afers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Background ==
According to a report by the ''[[Die Weltwoche|Weltwoche]]'', Blancho grew up in [[Biel/Bienne|Biel]] as a nonbeliever in a family of liberal thought.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2010-14/artikel/artikel-2010-14-bin-laden-in-biel.html|title=Bin Laden in Biel|last=Weltwoche|first=|date=|website=www.weltwoche.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After secondary school, he first began an apprenticeship in print production. He converted to Islam at the age of 16. He left the apprenticeship, continued high school and studied law and Islamic studies at the [[University of Bern]] in 2007.

In 2004, Blancho founded the company "Alquds Food GmbH", importing food especially from Tunisia. The company was liquidated in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://be.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-112.024.812&amp;loeschung=20070920#|title=ALQUDS FOOD GmbH|last=AG|first=Powerneting|website=Handelsregisteramt des Kantons Bern|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he founded with Abdul Hamid Al-Fayek the food import and export company "A &amp; B Tradex GmbH", which was then liquidated in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://be.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-113.069.817&amp;loeschung=20130926#|title=A &amp; B Tradex GmbH|last=AG|first=Powerneting|website=Commercial register of canton Bern|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blancho is fluent in German, French and Arabic. He is ''[[de facto]]'' polygamous, in spite of the ban of polygamy in Swiss law. He married officially a Yemeni woman and then got married with a woman of Kosovo according to [[Islamic Law|Islamic law.]] According to sources close to ICCS, he has at least a third wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.schweizamwochenende.ch/nachrichten/islamischer-zentralrat-hat-zuege-einer-sex-sekte-131064158|title=Islamischer Zentralrat hat «Züge einer Sex-Sekte»|work=Schweiz am Wochenende|access-date=2018-07-06|language=de-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blancho follows a Salafist form of Islam, which excludes a modern interpretation of the scriptures. He described lapidating as "an element, a value of my religion". Since 2003, Nicolas Blancho has been known for his fight to introduce the [[Sharia law]] in Switzerland.

Blancho is founder and chairman of the ICCS, together with Qaasim Illi, who was condemned in 2005 for pornography (coprophilia) and anti-semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/porno-urteil-gegen-qaasim-illi-35-veroeffentlicht-izrs-prueft-klage-gegen-weltwoche-id4943917.html|title=«Kaviar»-Urteil gegen Qaasim Illi (34) veröffentlicht: IZRS prüft Porno-Klage gegen «Weltwoche»|last=Sahli|first=Michael|access-date=2018-07-06|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Blancho accumulated many debts, for a total amount of 200,000 Swiss francs, according to a press article published in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/sonntagszeitung/nicolas-blancho-ignoriert-die-strafbefehle/story/13464944|title=Nicolas Blancho ignoriert die Strafbefehle|work=tagesanzeiger.ch/|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount comprises the debts of his bankrupt companies, but also unpaid tax bills, health insurance premiums, contributions to social insurance and car repair bills.

According to politician Henri-Charles Beuchat, it is highly probable that Blancho receives social assistance from the municipality of Bern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.20min.ch/schweiz/bern/story/Stadtrat-glaubt--dass-Blancho-Sozialhilfe-bezieht-27448480|title=Stadtrat glaubt, dass Blancho Sozialhilfe bezieht|last=www.20min.ch|first=www.20minuten.ch, 20 Minuten, 20 Min,|work=20 Minuten|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
The press characterises Blancho, much like the members Islamic Central Council of Switzerland, as a minority of dangerous radicalised Islamists&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Other newspaper articles highlight his links with terrorism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Nicolas-Blancho-Spuren-fuehren-zu-alQaida/story/19838860|title=Nicolas Blancho: Spuren führen zu al-Qaida|work=tagesanzeiger.ch/|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bielertagblatt.ch/nachrichten/biel/bieler-radikaler-packt-aus|title=Bieler Radikaler packt aus|website=www.bielertagblatt.ch|language=de|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public prosecutor of Switzerland opened an investigation in November 2016 against Blancho and Qaasim Illi following the publication of a video [[Jihadism|jihadist]] propaganda. Another recording suggests he supports the Islamic State group.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In May 2018, the Federal Court of Switzerland confirmed a decision of the police of Bern not to allow Blancho to carry a gun. “There were concrete indications the complainant himself could jeopardize third parties”, said a lower court in Bern, where Blancho appealed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-swiss-handgun/swiss-islamic-leader-facing-propaganda-charges-refused-gun-permit-idUSKBN1I922U|title=Swiss Islamic leader, facing propaganda charges, refused gun permit|last=Miller|first=John|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Le Temps'', the Swiss [[Swiss intelligence agencies#Federal Intelligence Service|Federal Intelligence Service]] (FIS) is investigating the links between Blancho and Islamists based in Qatar deemed close to [[al-Qaeda]], such as [[Abdulrahman al-Nuaimi]] and Ali Abdullah al-Suwaidi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2018|title=Les services secrets suisses ciblent des islamistes pro-Qatar|url=https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/services-secrets-suisses-ciblent-islamistes-proqatar|journal=Le Temps|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blancho is financially supported by Qatar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He heads the Swiss associations Aziz Aid and Qoranona with Abdulaziz Abdulrahman H.A. Al-Thani, a senior member of the Qatari ruling family, the [[House of Al Thani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://be.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml;jsessionid=80898720d4b1e9bf023e9d320ac1?uid=CHE-150.534.592#%20et%20https://be.chregister.ch/cr-portal/auszug/auszug.xhtml?uid=CHE-482.784.835#|title=Aziz Aid|last=AG|first=Powerneting|website=Commercial register of canton Bern|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003 July 10, 11:43 (Thursday)|title=In-House Views on Potential Hamas Targets|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/03DOHA1748_a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a YouTube interview, Blancho also thanks the [[Foundation Sheikh Thani Ibn Abdullah for Humanitarian Services|Sheikh Thani Bin Abdullah Foundation for Humanitarian Services]] for its financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=مؤسسة راف RAF Foundation|title=كلمة الشيخ / عبدالله نيكولاس ( مهرجانات بشائر الرحمة ) {{!}}RaF Foundation|date=2014-07-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTx5gW7tsZ4|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7282">The '''PMU 18 scandal''' is a multi-million [[United States dollar|dollar]] [[political corruption]] scandal that involved accusations of [[embezzlement]], [[bribery]], [[nepotism]], and [[gambling]] at the [[Vietnam]]ese [[Ministry of Transport (Vietnam)|Ministry of Transport]] (''Bộ Giao thông Vận tải'', GTVT) at the beginning of 2006. The scandal received extensive press coverage in Vietnam, a rarity in the [[one-party state]].  It generated a great public outcry in Vietnam and controversy in other countries and at organizations that provided [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) to the country. Due to the scandal, Transport Minister [[Đào Đình Bình]] was forced to resign and his deputy was arrested. The scandal became a major issue leading up to the [[Tenth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam]], when the government leadership was being reviewed.

In the aftermath of the scandal, the Vietnamese government clamped down on journalists reporting on the case.  Two prominent journalists were tried and convicted of "abusing democratic freedoms" and propagating "false information".  Two police officers involved in the case were also convicted of "disclosing work secrets".

==PMU 18 ==
{{see also|Foreign aid to Vietnam}}
'''Project Management Unit 18''' (PMU-18) is a bureau within the transportation ministry for road construction and other infrastructure projects. It has a budget of 2 billion [[USD]], which includes funds from overseas donors, notably [[Japan]], the [[European Union]], [[Australia]] and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name="BBC crisis"&gt;{{cite news|first=Clare|last=Harkey|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4917466.stm|title=Crisis dogs Vietnam congress|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2006-04-18|accessdate=2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The scandal==
In early January 2006, [[:vi:Bùi Tiến Dũng]], Executive Director of PMU-18, was detained, and it was announced that 1.8 million dollars had been embezzled to gamble on [[Football (soccer)|football]] matches. He was also accused of using the payouts to pay for [[prostitution|prostitutes]].  The police found files inside the unit's computers revealing that over 200 employees at the unit had participated in the gambling. He is also under investigation over the procurement of [[luxury vehicle]]s for other government officials.&lt;ref name="BBC crisis" /&gt;

Deputy Transport Minister Nguyễn Việt Tiến, a former head of PMU-18, was soon also detained and his home was searched.&lt;ref name="BBC Vietnam"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4874600.stm|title=Vietnam ministry hit by scandal|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-04-04|accessdate=2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal affected many high-ranking officials.  It was revealed that Bùi Tiến Dũng attempted to bribe officials after his arrest.  People in the Prime Minister's office were investigated and the General Secretary's son-in-law was also implicated.  A vice chief of police was implicated and withdrew his name from the list of delegates to the National Congress.

In early April 2006, Transport Minister Đào Đình Bình resigned, accepting responsibility for the embezzlement of millions of dollars of state money by his staff.&lt;ref name="BBC Vietnam" /&gt;  This took place days before the opening of the [[Tenth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam]].

In March 2008, charges against Nguyễn Việt Tiến were dropped and his Communist Party membership was later reinstated.

===Role of the press===
The scandal is notable in that the press was initially allowed to report on the issue in great depth.  Several years earlier, such topics were taboo in the Vietnamese press, as the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] keeps a tight grip on the media.  Major newspapers openly ridiculed the officials involved and called for their resignations.  Some observers attribute this to internal conflicts within the party between reformers and hardliners.  Others see this as a normal occurrence before every National Congress and expect things to return to normal after the Congress ends.&lt;ref name="BBC báo chí"&gt;{{Link language|vi}}&lt;!--Vietnamese--&gt; {{cite news|first=Hoàng|last=Dương|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/story/2006/04/060417_vietpress_precongress.shtml|title=Báo chí Việt Nam trước đại hội X|publisher=[[BBC World Service]]|date=2006-04-17|accessdate=2006-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2007, police questioned dozens of journalists who covered the case for the sources of certain published information.  In May 2008, two reporters were arrested for "abuse of power for personal gain" while reporting about the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/05/13/asia/AS-GEN-Vietnam-Journalists-Arrested.php|date=2008-05-13|accessdate=2008-05-13|title=Vietnam arrests two journalists for alleged false reports on soccer gambling scandal|author=The Associated Press|publisher=International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, several senior police officers involved with the case, including the [[major general]] in charge, were indicted for revealing certain information about the case to the press.  The arrests unleashed a torrent of protests from journalists and bloggers in Vietnam, leading to a highly unusual confrontation between the state-controlled press and the communist government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ipZAswsTSnDKx8wPIvh03LOWmjAwD90L923G0 |title=Vietnam media decry reporters' arrests |author=Ben Stocking |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-05-14 |publisher=The Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519134628/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ipZAswsTSnDKx8wPIvh03LOWmjAwD90L923G0 |archivedate=May 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several days later, the newspapers were silent on the topic, and newspapers that continued to report it reportedly received warnings from the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7437343.stm|title=Focus on Vietnam's press freedom|author=Nga Pham|publisher=BBC Vietnamese|date=2008-06-06|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, the journalists were convicted of "abusing democratic freedoms" and propagating "false informations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7673374.stm|date=2008-10-16|accessdate=2008-10-17|title=Vietnamese media trial condemned|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the police officers were convicted of "disclosing work secret".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9329">'''Party funding in Israel''' covers all funds which are raised and spent to influence political competition between Israeli parties, especially the campaigns for national ([[Knesset]]) and municipal elections as well as the routine operation of party organizations. Ever since the [[Yishuv]]. the pre-state formation of Jewish life in [[Eretz Israel]], political parties have been the foremost organizations of the polity.&lt;ref&gt;Arian, Asher: ''The Second Republic. Politics in Israel'', Chatham NJ: Chatham House, 1998, pp. 4-5, 14-14, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spending on politics ==
Although it is widely believed that Israel is "the most expensive democracy per voter in the world" &lt;ref&gt;Arian, Asher: ''The Second Republic. Politics in Israel'', Chatham NJ: Chatham House, 1998, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; authors rarely provide summaries of the overall expenses for party competition. In 1960 Alexander Heard mentioned more than US-$5.00 per voter.&lt;ref&gt;Heard, Alexander: ''The Costs of Democracy'', Chapel Hill NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1960, pp. 373-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold Heidenheiomer (1963) allocated an index value of 20.50 &lt;ref&gt;Heidenheimer, Arnold: 'Comparative Party Finance - Notes on Practices and Towards a Theory', in: ''Journal of Politics'', vol. 25, no. 4, 1963, pp. 798-799.&lt;/ref&gt; (both the highest values in their sample). In 1984 Howard Penniman reported US-$4.34 per citizen (much lower than Venezuela's US-$20.35).&lt;ref&gt;Penniman, Howard R.: 'U.S. Elections: Really a Bargain', in: ''Public Opinion'', vol. 7, no., 1984, pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on data for the 1990s a German study ranked Israel together with Austria, Italy and Japan among the top spenders on party politics.&lt;ref&gt;'Ist unsere Demokratie zu teuer?' In: Einblicke. Nr. 39, 2004, S. 24; see PDF [http://www.presse.uni-oldenburg.de/einblicke/39/5nassmacher.pdf] (Accessed 13 March 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the period between 1973 and 1992, Mendilow assumes a relative decline of ongoing expenses as compared to the escalation of campaign spending.&lt;ref&gt;Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Public Party Funding and the Schemes of Mice and Men', in: ''Party Politics'', vol. 2, no. 3, 1996, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1973 and 1984, current operations of parties amounted to US-$2.8 and US-$7.0 million.&lt;ref&gt;Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel. Experience and Experimentation', in: Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): ''Comparative Political Finance in the 1980s'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; If the legal spending limit was equal to actual campaign spending, US-$26 million per year were needed for current operations in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchheim, Chaim/ Rosevitch, Shimon: 'The Financing of Elections and Parties', in: Elazar, Daniel J./ Sandler, Shmuel (eds.): ''Who's the Boss in Israel. Israel at the Polls, 1988-89'', Detroit: Wayne State University, 1992, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both in election and non-elections years, parties incur different kinds of expenditure. During non-election periods, most party funds are spent on salaries for paid party workers and expenses for permanent offices. Over time, the outlay for public meetings in Israel has declined, whereas the importance of advertising and media has grown considerably. However, on election day, Israeli parties continue to spend on taxis to bring voters to the polls and to pay for party workers' food and time. "Such expenses can amount to between 25 and 33 per cent of campaign expenses."&lt;ref&gt;Peretz, Don/ Doron, Gideon: ''The Government and Politics of Israel'', Boulder CO: Westview Press, 3rd ed., 1997, p. 128; see also Gutman, Emanuel: 'Israel', in: ''Journal of Politics'', vol. 25, no. 4, 1963, p. 713-714.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of revenue ==
Party membership used to be a major source of funding when a high percentage of the adult population were members of a political party. However, just like in other democracies) party membership has decreased. In 1969 still 18 per cent of the citizens retained a membership, in 1990 there were roughly just 7 per cent left.&lt;ref&gt;Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel. Experience and Experimentation', in: Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): ''Comparative Political Finance in the 1980s'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, pp. 146-147; Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Public Party Funding and the Schemes of Mice and Men', in: ''Party Politics'', vol. 2, no. 3, 1996, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; The share of party income from membership was less than 10 per cent of the total then.&lt;ref&gt;Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Public Party Funding and Party Transformation in Multi-Party Systems', in: ''Comparative Political Studies'', vol. 25, no. 1, 1992, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Individual contributions to general elections are permitted as long as they originate from donors who are Israeli citizens and residents above the age of eighteen," provided the donation does not exceed NIS 50,000 and it is not anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Levush, Ruth: ''Campaign Finance: Israel'', Washington DC: Library of Congress, 2009, p. 3; available at: [https://www.loc.gov/law/help/campaign-finance/israel.php].&lt;/ref&gt; A report in ''Haaretz'' contends that somehow non-residents made political contributions in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;'Who are the biggest contributors to politics in Israel? Many live in New York and Miami', in: ''Haaretz'', 6 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Israel had started to provide public funding for party activity. This source of revenue has increased its importance ever since. Between 1975 and 1984, public subsidies had covered about 85 per cent of declared annual routine expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel. Experience and Experimentation', in: Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): ''Comparative Political Finance in the 1980s'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation of money in politics ==
Public law stipulates a variety of rules for the flow of money in politics. Israeli laws restrict both donations and expenses. Most of the rules concern political parties. However, as candidates run their own campaigns in party primaries, these under surveillance for 30 days, too. For candidates in primaries donations by foreign individuals are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;For details see Levush, Ruth: ''Campaign Finance: Israel'', Washington DC: Library of Congress, 2009, available at: [https://www.loc.gov/law/help/campaign-finance/israel.php].&lt;/ref&gt; Applicable are the Political Parties (Financing) Law, 5733-1973, and the Parties Law, 5752-1992.&lt;ref&gt;The text of these laws is available in: ''Party Financing and Elections Financing in Israel'', Background Material Prepared at the Request of the Secretary General of the Knesset, July 21, 2003, pp. 11-28 PDF file [https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/me00636.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Gilding''' is an [[Australian people|Australian]] environmentalist, consultant, and author. Gilding, a former [[executive director]] of [[Greenpeace International]], and a Fellow at [[Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership|University of Cambridge’s Institute for Sustainability Leadership]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/About-Us/Our-Team/Fellows.aspx Fellows of the University of Cambridge’s Institute for Sustainability Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt; is the author of ''The Great Disruption: Why the Climate Crisis Will Bring On the End of Shopping and the Birth of a New World'' (2011). In 2012, Gilding delivered a presentation on the thesis of his book at the 2012 [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] titled ''The Earth is Full'', which earned him press attention. He lives in southern [[Tasmania]] with his wife and children.

==Career==

Gilding started his career as an activist in his early teens, focusing on [[South Africa]]n ''[[apartheid]]'' and [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] land rights. While serving in the [[Australian Air Force]], he also became involved in the [[nuclear disarmament]] movement. According to an interview on ''[[AlterNet]]'', Gilding's experience in anti-nuclear politics led to a greater awareness of environmental issues and led him to join [[Greenpeace]] in the 1980s, becoming involved in [[direct action]]s against corporate polluters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/155968/system_failure%3A_we_are_approaching_the_end_of_society_as_we_know_it_--_and_that_may_be_a_good_thing System Failure: We Are Approaching the End of Society As We Know It -- And That May Be a Good Thing], ''AlterNet'', 21 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1989 and 1994, Gilding served as the [[executive director]] of [[Greenpeace Australia]] and, later, [[Greenpeace International]].

Gilding serves on the advisory board of [[The Climate Mobilization]], a grassroots advocacy group calling for a global economic mobilization against climate change on the scale of the American [[home front during World War II]], with the goal of 100% clean energy and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Board|url=http://www.theclimatemobilization.org/advisory_board|website=The Climate Mobilization|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Great Disruption''==

{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

In ''The Great Disruption'', Gilding posits that the [[2007-2012 global financial crisis|ongoing financial crisis]] is a symptom of human civilization growing beyond Earth's ability to support it, and is tied to the threat posed by [[climate change]] and other forms of [[environmental degradation]]. Because of this, Gilding calls for an end to the whole concept of exponential [[economic growth]], which he blames for the consumption and waste that has led to both the economic and ecological crises facing mankind and modern civilization.

Furthermore, in a departure from many environmental writers — such as [[James Lovelock]], [[Clive Hamilton]], [[Richard Heinberg]] and [[James Howard Kunstler]]  — Gilding argues that people will work together through the climate crisis and that humanity as a whole will eventually act in time to save civilization, ''albeit'' too late to prevent catastrophic consequences; Gilding bases this argument on the ingenuity of past generations in the midst of crisis, particularly [[World War II]]. Gilding also believes that the global economy will fully embrace [[sustainable energy]] when societies fully accept the reality of climate change and abandon [[fossil fuel]] resources.

'''People's Liberation Army, Nepal''' ({{lang-ne|जनमुक्ति सेना, नेपाल}}) was the armed wing of the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] (CPN(M)). The PLA was founded in 2002, in the midst of the [[Nepal Civil War]] initiated by the Maoists in 1996. The chief commander of the PLA during the war was [[Prachanda]] (Pushpa Kamal Dahal). On September 12, 2008, [[Nanda Kishor Pun]] was appointed new chief commander of the PLA, as Prachanda had become [[Prime Minister of Nepal]]. This move was in line with a pledge issued by the CPN(M), issued prior to the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008|2008 Constituent Assembly election]], that their members elected to the Assembly would leave their PLA positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/305/Nation/12129 Nepali Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906101304/http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/305/Nation/12129 |date=2008-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/12/content_9959508.htm Xinhuanet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the PLA soldiers stay in cantoments. The CPA stipulates that PLA and the [[Royal Nepal Army]] should be integrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiss.org/whats-new/iiss-in-the-press/press-coverage-2007/september-2007/nepal-army--contributions-to-un-peacekeeping/]&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Dahal claims the PLA-NA integrations will be completed by six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kantipuronline.com/kolnews.php?nid=159405 Kantipuronline]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of military tactics==

After the negotiations with Government of the [[King of Nepal|king]] broke down, CPN(M) decided changing their strategy. Meanwhile Maoist senior leader [[C.P. Gajurel]] was arrested on August 20, 2003 at [[Chennai International Airport]]. In January and February 2004 CPN(M) suffered a big setback and lost more than 80 armies attacking different regions of [[Nepal]]. There was a pressure from international side, the human rights organization for the brutal killings and kidnappings of civil countrymen during the insurgency. Issuing a press statement on March 16, 2004 Chairman Prachanda said, "Our party has been committed to the fundamental norms of human rights and the [[Geneva convention]] since the start of the people’s war. Anyone who without prejudice judges the facts of the eight years can find our People’s Liberation Army has been showing respectful behaviour, treatment to the injured and releasing the prisoners of the war in good condition."

During this period the party changed their military tactics, strategic offence. The PLA was immediately instructed to coverage at Thawang in [[Rolpa]] to prepare for a major offensive. The foremost responsibility was provided to the Western command of the PLA. The People’s Liberation Army from the brigades at Mangalsen, Gorahi-Satbaria, Lise-Gam and Basu Memorial were in Thawang by 8 March. All the PLA men were introduced with the war strategy and instructed for a major attack, the one in the last years of history of the people’s war. The responsibility of executing the plan was entitled to Diwakar, a senior Maoist leader which was believed to be worked out by chairman Prachanda. Between March 8 and 11, PLA commanders Diwakar and Pasang (current commander-in-chief of PLA) built sand models to illustrate the war strategy.

On March 12, the armed forces began moving towards the east with nearly about 3000 combatants. With a heavy preparation of arms, lodging, medicine, the PLA were into their destination. From Rolpa, the PLA made their way to [[Baglung]] through [[Rukum]]. Commander Pasang was in regular contact with chairman [[Prachanda]]. Before reaching Beni, the headquarters of [[Myagdi district]], the PLA was given a final briefing about the war operation. The PLA attacked at 11 pm, March 20. The battle lasted throughout the night till 10 am, the next day. The [[Royal Nepal Army]] claimed killing of about 500 Maoist combattants. But opposing the claim, a statement released by Comrade Biplav claimed the killing of about 120 RNA and 26 policemen. 33 people include RNA soldiers, policemen and CDO with Deputy Superintendent of Police was taken prisoners by the PLA. CPN(M) proposed the releasing of their senior leaders Matrika Yadav, [[Suresh Ale Magar]], Tilak Sharma and others in account of releasing the prisoners.

Chairman Prachanda vowed to continue the people’s war. He highlighted the attacking of PLA to the army barracks. Describing that the attack as a successful operation, chairman Prachanda claimed that it had blown away the myths about the RNA being trained with foreign forces was invincible.

==Size==

According to UNMIN, the PLA has around 19,600 confirmed fighters residing in different cantonments over the past 3 years. The ones who were found to be unqualified during the verification process have been removed from the cantonments recently under an agreement of UNMIN (United Nations Mission in Nepal) peronnel, the Nepalese government and [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|the party]].

==Legal provision for PLA, Nepal==

#As per the commitments expressed in the joint letter sent to the UN by the Government of Nepal and CPN(M) on August 9, the PLA would remain in the temporary camps. The United Nations would monitor and verify them.
#All arms and munitions would be securely stored in the camps except those needed for providing security of the camp after the PLA are in cantonments.
#Once the PLA are in the camps, the Government of Nepal will take responsibility of providing ration and other facilities to them.
#The interim cabinet will form a special committee to carry out monitoring, integration and rehabilitation of the Maoist insurgents.
#Efforts will be made to make arrangements for the security of the Maoist leaders as per the agreement with the government of Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/302/Nation/12129 nepalitimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725094816/http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/302/Nation/12129 |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barrier in the integration==

The Nepali Maoist party's ambitious plan to fuse its People’s Liberation army with the latter's arch enemy, the Nepal Army, has come unstuck yet again with the opposition party refusing to toe the former rebels' line. Prime Minister [[Prachanda]], who till two months ago was also the supreme commander of the guerrilla People's Liberation Army, had announced that a special committee would be formed to begin the controversial reintegration process. However, the panel could not be formed as the opposition, former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala's [[Nepali Congress]] raised the voice of dissentt the meeting of four major parties shooting down the Maoist proposal that the committee should be headed by a Maoist representative.

NC leaders have also begun protests against what they say is a move by the Maoists to appoint [[Nanda Kishor Pun]] 'Pasang', the chief of PLA after Prachanda stepped down, as the chief of the re-shuffled army. Due to the infighting among the two biggest parties, Prachanda, for the second time Thursday, put off the scheduled cabinet meeting that was to have announced the formation of the committee. More homework and parleys among the parties need to be done, the embattled Maoist chief told the news media. The merger of the PLA with the Nepal Army remains one of the biggest blocks in the ongoing peace process in Nepal.

Over 50,000 PLA fighters are leading a grim life in cantonments for nearly two years, hoping for eventual state recognition by being included in the state army. The merger was a key condition of the peace pact signed by the Maoists in 2006, which paved the way for their relinquishing [arms and the restoration of peace in insurgency-racked Nepal.
The NC, which was the ruling party in 2006, had agreed to the condition. Now however, smarting under a poll defeat, it has begun opposing the integration, saying the PLA was a political motivated that could not be trusted to be non-partisan. The army is also opposing the merger. The army chief, Gen. Rukmangud Katawal, has said that the army would accept only those who met international recruitment norms. The Nepalese army showed a disagreement to the Maoist proposal since long back, when this issue of merger was put forward. CPN(M) clearly denies a complete peace process without the integration of the two forces and creating a ‘new’ national army.

The integration process was started in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, DB. Army Integration in Nepal.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6597">'''Production sharing agreements''' (PSAs{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}) are a common type of contract signed between a government and a resource extraction [[company]] (or group of companies) concerning how much of the [[natural resource|resource]] (usually [[petroleum|oil]]) extracted from the country each will receive.

== Description ==
Production sharing agreements were first used in Bolivia in the early 1950s, although their first implementation similar to today's was in Indonesia in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Russian-Ukrainian Legal Group [http://www.rulg.com/documents/The_Concept_of_Production_Sharing.htm The Concept of Production Sharing]&lt;/ref&gt; Today they are often used in the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. 

In production sharing agreements the country's government awards the execution of exploration and production activities to an oil company. The oil company bears the mineral and financial risk of the initiative and explores, develops and ultimately produces the field as required. When successful, the company is permitted to use the money from produced oil to recover capital and operational expenditures, known as "cost oil". The remaining money is known as "profit oil", and is split between the government and the company. In most of the production sharing agreements, changes in international oil prices or production rate affect the company's share of production.

Production sharing agreements can be beneficial to governments of countries that lack the expertise and/or capital to develop their resources and wish to attract foreign companies to do so. They can be very profitable agreements for the oil companies involved, but often involve considerable risk.

==Cost stop and excess oil==
The amount of costs recoverable is often limited to an amount called "cost stop". If the costs incurred by the company are bigger than the cost stop, the company is entitled to recover only the costs limited to the cost stop. When the costs incurred are smaller than the cost stop, the difference between the costs and the cost stop is called "excess oil". Usually, but not necessarily, the excess oil is shared between the government and the company according to the same rules of the profit oil. If the recoverable costs are higher than the cost stop the contract is defined as ''saturated''.

The cost stop gives to the government the guarantee the recover part of the production (as long the price of the crude produced is higher than the cost stop), especially during the first years of production when the costs are higher. Since the beginning of the 80's all major contracts include invariable a clause of cost stop. The cost stop can be a fixed amount, but in most case it is a percentage of the cost of the crude.

==Risk sharing contracts==
First implemented in Malaysia, the [[risk sharing contracts]] (RSC) departs from the production sharing contract (PSC) first introduced in 1976 and most recently revised last year as the [[enhanced oil recovery]] (EOR) PSC which ramps up recovery rate from 26% to 40%. As a performance-based agreement, it is developed in Malaysia for the Malaysian people and private partners to both benefit from successfully and viably monetizing these marginal fields. At the [[Center for Energy Sustainability and Economics]]' Production Optimisation Week Asia Forum in Malaysia on 27 July 2011, Finance Deputy Minister YB. Sen. Dato' Ir. [[Donald Lim Siang Chai]] expounded that the trail-blazing RSC calls for optimal delivery of production targets and allows for knowledge transfer from [[joint venture]]s between foreign and local players in the development of Malaysia’s 106 marginal fields, which cumulatively contain 580 million [[Barrel of oil equivalent|barrels of oil equivalent]] (BOE) in today’s high-demand, low-resource energy market.&lt;ref&gt;DEPUTY MINISTER YB. SEN. DATO’ IR. DONALD LIM SIANG CHAI, [http://www.think-energy.org/newsite/index.php/articles/11-oil-and-gas/32-opening-speech-by-deputy-minister-yb-sen-dato-ir-donald-lim-siang-chai "Opening Speech by DEPUTY MINISTER YB. SEN. DATO’ IR. DONALD LIM SIANG CHAI"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415224913/http://www.think-energy.org/newsite/index.php/articles/11-oil-and-gas/32-opening-speech-by-deputy-minister-yb-sen-dato-ir-donald-lim-siang-chai |date=2013-04-15 }}, Opening Ceremony Speech, Center for Energy Sustainability and Economics, July 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framework for Marginal Fields Risk Service Contracts===
Performance-based agreements like the Berantai RSC have a tighter focus on production and recovery rates as compared with production sharing contracts favoured by oil majors. This emphasis on optimising production capacities in marginal fields can be extended to contracts governing recovery of main oilfields in an industry of rapidly depleting resources. Currently, Petronas’ recovery factor is about 26% for main oilfields, which can be further improved with optimised production techniques and knowledge exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldvest-ap.com/index.php/marginal-field-investment-opportunities/risk-service-contract-framework/ "Risk Service Contract Framework"], web, Worldvest Asia Pacific, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  

* Marginal Fields are located within a producing block and its main product is oil;
* The IOC provides technical, financial, managerial or commercial services to the state from exploration through production;
* Risk service contracts – the IOC bears all the exploration costs;
* [[Petronas]] retains ownership of oil;
* The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is estimated at between 7% – 20% subject to terms and conditions – more attractive ROI than a PSC regime;
* Contractor receives fee payment commencing from first production and throughout the duration of the contract
* Fee is subject to taxes – but to incentivise investment in marginal fields Malaysia has reduced tax for from 38% to 25%, to improve commercial viability of investment projects;

According to think tank, Arc Media Global, while efficient, the RSC is essentially a contract that significantly increases an operator’s risks of exposure.

The '''Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act''', Act No 55 of 1949, was an [[apartheid]] law in [[South Africa]] that prohibited marriages between "Europeans" and "non-Europeans". It was among the first pieces of apartheid legislation to be passed following the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party's]] rise to power in 1948. Subsequent legislation, especially the [[Population Registration Act|Population Registration]] and [[Immorality Act]]s of 1950, facilitated its implementation by requiring all individuals living in South Africa to register as a member of one of four officially defined racial groups and prohibiting extramarital sexual relationships between people of different races.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prohibition_of_Mixed_Marriages_Act,_1949&amp;action=edit Edit]

== History of Mixed-Race Marriages in South Africa ==
Mixed race relationships occurred in South Africa as far back as 1652, and often took place between Dutch colonizers and indigenous South African women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van den Berghe|first=Pierre L.|date=1960|title=Miscegenation in South Africa|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4390778|journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|volume=1|issue=4|pages=68–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed marriages did not become completely taboo until the rise of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JACOBSON|first=CARDELL K.|last2=AMOATENG|first2=ACHEAMPONG YAW|last3=HEATON|first3=TIM B.|date=2004|title=Inter-racial Marriages in South Africa|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41603948|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|volume=35|issue=3|pages=443–458}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the years immediately preceding the passing of this Act, mixed marriages accounted for just a small fraction of all marriages in South Africa, and occurred almost evenly between the four defined racial groups ([[Black South African|Black]], [[Coloureds|Coloured]], [[White South Africans|White]], and [[Asian South Africans|Asiatic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sofer|first=Cyril|date=1949|title=Some Aspects of Inter-Racial Marriages in South Africa, 1925-46|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1156969|journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute|volume=19|issue=3|pages=187–203|doi=10.2307/1156969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Enforcement of the act was left to the police, who often followed people to their homes to ensure they were not in violation and raided the homes of those believed to be in a mixed marriage. The act applied to all mixed marriages between South Africans, so even marriages which took place in another country were not recognized within South Africa.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/prohibition-of-mixed-marriages-act,-act-no-55-of-1949|title=Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, Act No 55 of 1949|last=kyle|date=2016-02-22|work=South African History Online|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment for people found to be in a mixed marriage involved arrest and a jail sentence. Anyone who knowingly officiated a marriage that violated the act was also subject to a punishment: a fine was imposed  not exceeding 50 [[South African pound|pounds]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Anyone who was found to have lied to an officiant was '''also''' subject to the legal punishment for perjury.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Some of the social consequences of entering into a mixed-race marriage included being ostracized from or ridiculed by one's family and community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One example is a white South African sex worker named Ethal, who indicated that she  felt more accepted by her peers when she was a sex worker than when she married an black African man.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legislative history==
The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act of 1968 updated the original legislation to invalidate interracial marriages involving a South African citizen that were contracted in other countries.

The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was repealed by the [[Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985]], which was passed during the presidency of [[P. W. Botha]].&lt;ref name="back"&gt;{{cite book|title=South Africa: no turning back|first=Shaun|last=Johnson|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1989|isbn=0-253-35395-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7027">A '''protective distribution system''' ('''PDS'''), also called ''protected distribution system'', is a US government term for wireline or [[fiber-optics]] [[telecommunication]] system that includes terminals and adequate [[acoustical]], [[electrical]], [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], and physical safeguards to permit its use for the unencrypted [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[classified information]].  At one time these systems were called "'''approved circuits'''".

A complete protected distribution system includes the subscriber and [[terminal equipment]] and the interconnecting lines.

==Description==
The purpose of a PDS is to deter, detect and/or make difficult physical access to the communication lines carrying [[national security]] information.
A specification called the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction (NSTISSI) 7003 was issued in December 1996 by the [[Committee on National Security Systems]].&lt;ref name="spec"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Protective distribution system |work= National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Instruction number 7003 |date= December 13, 1996 |publisher= Committee on National Security Systems |url= http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/nstissi_7003.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060713051217/http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/nstissi_7003.pdf |archivedate= July 13, 2006 |accessdate= October 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Approval authority, standards, and guidance for the design, installation, and maintenance for PDS are provided by NSTISSI 7003 to U.S. government departments and agencies and their contractors and vendors. This instruction describes the requirements for all PDS installations within the U.S. and for low and medium threat locations outside the U.S.
PDS is commonly used to protect [[SIPRNet]] and [[JWICS]] networks.
The document superseded one numbered NASCI 4009 on Protected Distribution Systems, dated December 30, 1981, and part of a document called NACSEM 5203, that covered guidelines for facility design, using the designations "red" and "black".&lt;ref name="spec" /&gt;

There are two types of PDS: hardened distribution systems and simple distribution systems. 

==Hardened distribution ==
Hardened distribution PDSs provide significant physical protection and can be implemented in three forms:  hardened carrier PDSs, alarmed carrier PDSs and continuously viewed carrier PDSs.

===Hardened carrier===
In a hardened carrier PDS, the data cables are installed in a carrier constructed of electrical metallic tubing ([[Electrical conduit|EMT]]), ferrous conduit or pipe, or rigid sheet steel ducting. All of the connections in a Hardened Carrier System are permanently sealed completely around all surfaces with welds, epoxy or other such sealants. If the hardened carrier is buried under ground, to secure cables running between buildings for example, the carrier containing the cables is encased in concrete.

With a hardened [[carrier system]], detection is accomplished via human inspections that are required to be performed periodically. Therefore, hardened carriers are installed below ceilings or above flooring so they can be visually inspected to ensure that no intrusions have occurred. These periodic [[visual inspection]]s (PVIs) occur at a frequency dependent upon the level of threat to the environment, the security classification of the data, and the access control to the area.

=== Alarmed carrier ===
As an alternative to conducting human visual inspections, an alarmed carrier PDS may be constructed to automate the inspection process through electronic monitoring with an alarm system. In an Alarmed Carrier PDS, the carrier system is “alarmed” with specialized optical fibers deployed within the conduit for the purpose of sensing acoustic vibrations that usually occur when an intrusion is being attempted on the conduit in order to gain access to the cables.

Alarmed carrier PDS offers several advantages over hardened carrier PDS:

#Provides continuous monitoring 24/7/365
#Eliminates the requirement for periodic visual inspections
#Allows the carrier to be hidden above the ceiling or below the floor, since periodic visual inspections are not required
#Eliminates the need for the welding and epoxying of the connections
#Eliminates the requirement for concrete encasement outdoors 
#Eliminates the need to lock down [[manhole cover]]s
#Enables rapid redeployment for evolving network arrangements

Legacy alarmed carrier systems monitor the carrier containing the cables being protected. More advanced systems monitor the fibers within, or intrinsic to, the cables being protected to turn those cables into sensors, which detect intrusion attempts.

Depending on the [[government]] organization, utilizing an alarmed carrier PDS in conjunction with interlocking armored cable may, in some cases, allow for the elimination of the carrier systems altogether. In these instances, the cables being protected can be installed in existing conveyance (wire basket, ladder rack) or suspended cabling (on D-rings, J-Hooks, etc.).

=== Continuously viewed carrier ===
A Continuously Viewed Carrier PDS is one that is under continuous observation, 24 hours per day (including when operational). Such circuits may be grouped together, but should be separated from all non-continuously viewed circuits ensuring an open field of view. Standing orders should include the requirement to investigate any attempt to disturb the PDS. Appropriate security personnel should investigate the area of attempted penetration within 15 minutes of discovery. This type of hardened carrier is not used for Top Secret or special category information for non-U.S. UAA.{{clarify|date=July 2013}}&lt;!-- What is UAA? --&gt;
UAA is an Uncontrolled Access Area (UAA).  Like definitions include Controlled Access Area (CAA) and Restricted Access Area (RAA). A Secure Room (SR) offers the highest degree of protection.

Therefore from the least protected (least secure) to the most protected is as follows:

UAA
RAA
CAA
SR

== Simple distribution ==

Simple distribution PDSs are afforded a reduced level of physical security protection as compared to a hardened distribution PDS. They use a simple carrier system and the following means are acceptable under NSTISSI 7003: 
#The data cables should be installed in a carrier
#The carrier can be constructed of any material (e.g., wood, PVT, EMT, ferrous conduit)
#The joints and access points should be secured and be controlled by personnel cleared to the highest level of data handled by the PDS
#The carrier is to be inspected in accordance with the requirements of NSTISSI 7003

'''Reflation''' is the act of [[economic stimulus|stimulating]] the [[economy]] by increasing the [[money supply]] or by reducing [[taxes]], seeking to bring the economy (specifically price level) back ''up'' to the long-term trend, following a dip in the [[business cycle]]. It is the opposite of [[disinflation]], which seeks to return the economy back ''down'' to the long-term trend.

Reflation, which can be considered a form of [[inflation]] (increase in the price level), is contrasted with inflation (narrowly speaking) in that "bad" inflation is inflation ''above'' the long-term trend line, while reflation is a recovery of the price level when it has fallen ''below'' the trend line. For example, if inflation had been running at a 3% rate, but for one year it falls to 0%, the following year would need 6% inflation (actually 6.09% due to compounding) to catch back up to the long-term trend. This higher than normal inflation is considered reflation, since it is a return to trend, not exceeding the long-term trend.

This distinction is predicated on a theory of [[economic growth]] where there is long-term growth in the economy and price level, which is widely accepted in economics. Just as [[disinflation]] is considered an acceptable antidote to high inflation, reflation is considered to be an antidote to [[deflation]] (which, unlike inflation, is considered bad regardless of its magnitude).

== Policy ==
{{see|Economic stimulus}}
It can refer to an [[economic policy]] whereby a government uses fiscal or monetary stimulus in order to expand a country's output.  This can possibly be achieved by methods that include reducing tax, changing the money supply, or even adjusting [[interest rate]]s.

Originally it was used to describe a recovery of price to a previous desirable level after a fall caused by a recession. Today it also (in addition to the above) describes the first phase in the recovery of an economy which is beginning to experience increasing prices at the end of a slump. With rising prices, employment, output and income also increase till the economy reaches the level of [[full employment]].

The '''Regency Act 1830''' (1 Will.4 c.2) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed to cater for the event that [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] died while the next person in line to the throne was not yet aged 18. It provided for a [[Regency (government)|regency]] until the new monarch reached the age of 18, and also would have enabled a posthumous child of King William IV to replace [[Queen Victoria]] on the throne. However, the Act never came into force, because William was not survived by a legitimate child and Victoria became queen at the age of 18 in 1837.

==Reason for the Act==
When William IV became king in June 1830 he had no legitimate children who could inherit the throne on his death. Aged 64, he was the oldest person to ascend the British, English, Scottish or Irish thrones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashley|first=Mike|title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings &amp; Queens|year=1999|publisher=Robinson|location=London|isbn=1-84119-096-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next younger brother, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward]], had died in 1820 and so the next person in line to the throne was Edward's 11-year-old daughter, [[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria]]. Therefore, it was necessary to pass a law to provide for the government of the United Kingdom in case Victoria became queen while still under age, or in case William had a child who ascended while under 18. Parliament also decided to change the law about what would happen if William's wife, [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], gave birth to his child after he died and Victoria had already become queen.

==Provisions of the Act==

===Summary===
The Act stated that if Victoria became queen while still a minor, then her mother, [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Duchess of Kent]],&lt;!-- it should be "the Duchess of Kent", because "The Duchess of Kent" means the current Duchess of Kent --&gt; would become regent until Victoria was 18. However, if William had a legitimate son or daughter then that person would become king or queen instead of Victoria, and its mother, Queen Adelaide, would be regent. In either case, whoever was regent would exercise all the powers of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]], except that the regent was prohibited from giving [[royal assent]] to a bill to change the line of succession to the throne, or a bill to repeal or alter the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] or the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]].

If William was not survived by a legitimate child when he died, and Victoria became queen, but then afterwards Adelaide gave birth to William's child, the Act stipulated that William's child was to immediately and automatically become monarch, replacing Victoria. If this happened then Adelaide would become regent until the new monarch was 18.

Whoever was monarch was prohibited from marrying without the regent's permission until they were 18. Anyone who married the monarch without permission, or who assisted in the marriage, would be guilty of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]].

If the regent married a Roman Catholic, married a foreigner without permission, or left the United Kingdom, then she would forfeit her office.

===Detail===

The Act consisted of 12 sections:

*'''Section 1''' vested the regency in Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent, if Victoria became queen while under 18, with the title "Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". The regent was to have all the powers of a monarch, except those prohibited by section 10. The regency would end when Victoria became 18 or if Queen Adelaide gave birth to a child of King William after his death.
*'''Section 2''' required the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] to proclaim Victoria's accession to the throne, and modified the [[oath of allegiance]] by adding to the end the words "Saving the Rights of any Issue of His late Majesty King William the Fourth which may be born of His late Majesty's Consort". This version of the oath was to be used "until Parliament shall otherwise order".
*'''Sections 3, 4 and 5''' were to apply if, after King William's death, Queen Adelaide gave birth to his child. In that event, she was to become regent, the Privy Council was to proclaim the accession of the new sovereign "without delay", both Houses of Parliament were to assemble, and the laws concerning the [[demise of the Crown]] were to apply as though Queen Victoria had died and the new monarch was her [[Inheritance|heir]].
*'''Section 6''' stated that any official act done without the consent and authority of the regent was to be "absolutely null and void".
*'''Sections 7 and 8''' required the regent to take an oath of office and an oath to maintain the "true Protestant Religion", within one calendar month of becoming regent. At the same time, the regent was also to make a declaration against [[transubstantiation]], the invocation of saints, and mass (this declaration was prescribed in a 1678 Act, the [[Test Act]],&lt;ref&gt;30 Car.2 stat.2 c.1: "An Act for the more effectual preserving the King's Person and Government, by disabling Papists from sitting in either House of Parliament." (1678))&lt;/ref&gt; as a means of barring Roman Catholics from entering Parliament). She was to produce a certificate verifying that she had received the [[eucharist]] in a royal chapel, signed by the priest who had administered it. The oaths, declaration and certificate were to be registered in the books of the Privy Council.
*'''Section 9''' made it unlawful for the new monarch to marry while under age, unless the regent gave written consent. An unlawful marriage was to be null and void, and the person marrying the monarch would be guilty of treason, which was then punishable with death and posthumous [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|quartering]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Treason Act 1814]] (54 Geo. III c. 146)&lt;/ref&gt; Also any person "acting, aiding, abetting, or concerned in obtaining, procuring, or bringing about any such Marriage" would also be guilty of treason.
*'''Section 10''' prohibited the regent from giving [[royal assent]] to a bill to change the line of succession to the throne as established by the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]], or to repeal or alter the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] or the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]].
*'''Section 11''' disqualified the Duchess of Kent from becoming regent if, in William's lifetime, she married a Catholic or a person "other than a natural-born Subject" without William's consent. After William's death, if either she or his widow married a Catholic or a person other than a natural-born subject without the consent of both Houses of Parliament, or left the United Kingdom, then their regency was to end.
*'''Section 12''' stated that if Queen Adelaide died and King William remarried, then the Act was to expire.

The '''Royal Border Guard''' ({{sq|Roja Mbretnore e Kufinit}}) was a border protection force of the [[Royal Albanian Army]] responsible for protecting Albania's territorial borders from smuggling activities and foreign interference.&lt;ref&gt;[https://telegrafi.com/si-erdhi-misioni-guardia-di-finanza-ne-shqiperi-per-te-ngritur-rojet-mbretnore-te-kufinit-ne-vitin-1929 Si erdhi misioni i “Guardia di Finanza” në Shqipëri për të ngritur “Rojet Mbretnore të Kufinit”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shortly after the establishment of Albania's borders was officially recognised at the Ambassadors Conference in Paris on 30 July 1926, the need for a border protection force suddenly emerged. The Royal Border Guard was created on 25 February 1929&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asp.gov.al/index.php/en/profili/148-historiku-i-kufirit-dhe-migracionit Historiku i Kufirit dhe Migracionit]&lt;/ref&gt;. It was a military-financial organization which was tasked with stopping, suppressing and preventing smuggling and criminal activity along the country's newly formed borders. Its operations continued until 7 April 1939, the day Albania was invaded by [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Fascist Italian Forces]].

==Structure==
The force consisted of five battalions (commanders listed as of April 7, 1939):
*Border Battalion Korçë (Capt. Rexhep Radomira) 
*Border Battalion Delvine (Capt. Haxhi Gilagoli) 
*Border Battalion Durrës (Capt. Shaban Tirana) 
*Border Battalion Shkodër (Cpt. Hamdi Jusufi) 
*Instruction Battalion Korçë ( Col. Preng Pervizi)

The Border Guard had a statutory strength of 91 officers, 222 NCOs and around 1,500 men, in 14 companies of 48 platoons subdivided into 119 squads, and probably had more or less that strength on the eve of the invasion. The Guard was more of a fiscal or customs police than a military arm, and was incorporated into the Italian ''[[Guardia di Finanza]]'' after the invasion.

The '''Slovene Union''' ({{lang-sl|Slovenska skupnost}}, {{lang-it|Unione Slovena}}, SSk) is a [[centrism|centrist]] [[List of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]] representing the [[Slovene minority in Italy|Slovene minority]] in the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region. Its Slovenian language name means literally "Slovene Community", but the denomination "Slovene Union" is used in other languages.

The party was founded in the 1960s to represent the [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] Slovenes in the Italian [[Julian March]] (provinces of [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]] and [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]]). It the 1970s and 1980s, it extended its presence also to [[Venetian Slovenia]] and [[Canale Valley]] in the [[Province of Udine]]. It has been considered to be close to the [[Catholic Church]] and has drawn its support from various Slovene Catholic institutions in Italy, such as the [[Hermagoras Society]] and the [[Council of Slovene Organizations]].

Since 2007, the SSk is affiliated to the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (PD). The relation between the two parties is regulated by an "agreement of federation", which guarantees the full autonomy of the SSk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gruppopd.fvg.it/sloveno.php |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425164747/http://www.gruppopd.fvg.it/sloveno.php |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The SSk was founded in 1962 with the merger of several Slovene [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] political organizations that had functioned since 1945 in the Italian part of the [[Julian March]] (Venezia Giulia), that is in the provinces [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]] and [[Province of Trieste|Trieste]] (until 1954 Zone A of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]]). These organizations included the Slovene Christian Social Union (''Slovenska krščansko socialna zveza'', SKSZ), led by [[Engelbert Besednjak]] and [[Avgust Sfiligoj]]; the [[liberalism|liberal]] Slovene Democratic Union (''Slovenska demokratska zveza'', SDZ), led by [[Josip Agneletto]] and [[Andrej Uršič]]; and the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] Group of Independent Slovenes (''Skupina neodvisnih Slovencev'', SNS), led by [[Josip Ferfolja]], [[Frane Tončič]] and [[Dušan Rybář]]. All these groups shared an [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] ideology, they were opposed to [[Italian nationalism]] and [[centralisation|centralism]], as well as to the [[Communist state|Communist regime]] of the nearby [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Coming from different ideological background, but sharing similar programs, these groups soon established a close collaboration, creating many joint lists in municipal and provincial elections. Between 1947 and 1954, a unitary action was hindered by the fact that the Slovene minority was split into two separate political realities, one in the Republic of Italy and the other in the [[Free Territory of Trieste]].

The SSk has taken part in nearly all general, regional and municipal elections in Friuli-Venezia Giulia since the [[Italian general election, 1963|1963 general election]]. Beginning from the late 1960s, it frequently formed alliances with [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]. Since its foundation, the SSk has maintained close relations with the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] and the [[Valdostan Union]]. In the [[Italian general election, 1992|1992 general election]] the SSk formed a joint list with the Valdostan Union, the [[Citizens' Union for South Tyrol|Union for South Tyrol]], the [[Sardinian Action Party]], and some smaller regional parties; this effort produced a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] and one in the [[Senate of the Republic (Italy)|Senate of the Republic]], but none of them was for the SSk.

Since the beginning of the so-called [[Second Italian Republic|Italian Second Republic]], the SSk has been in alliance with [[centre-left]] coalitions, such as [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|The Olive Tree]], and had been an associate party of the [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]], [[Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy]], and finally the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].

==Popular support and representation==
The party has been represented in the Regional Council from 1975 through 1993, and then again since 2003. In the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional election, 2013|2013 regional election]] the SSk won 1.4% of the vote (4.7% in the [[Province of Trieste]] and 2.8% in the [[Province of Gorizia]]), resulting in the re-election of its regional councillor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elezioni2008.regione.fvg.it/elezReg.html Regione Autonoma Friuli Venezia Giulia - Elezioni 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515153600/http://elezioni2008.regione.fvg.it/elezReg.html |date=2008-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party is particularly strong in rural areas on the border with [[Slovenia]] in the Provinces of Trieste and Gorizia. In the 2013 regional election it was the most voted party in the municipalities of [[Monrupino]] (55.9%), [[San Floriano del Collio]] (53.1%) and [[Savogna d'Isonzo]] (42.0%), and had a good showing also in [[San Dorligo della Valle]] (22.5%), [[Sgonico]] (22.2%), [[Doberdò del Lago]] (19.8%) and [[Duino-Aurisina]] (17.1%). Since the 2000s, the party has gathered some support also in the [[Province of Udine]], especially in the so-called [[Venetian Slovenia]]: in 2013 it garnered 19.4% of the vote in [[Drenchia]], 10.8% in [[Malborghetto Valbruna]], and 7.5% in [[Resia, Friuli|Resia]]. In big cities, the party reached 5.3% in [[Gorizia]] and 3.2% in [[Trieste]]. In the municipal and provincial elections of 2011, the candidates of the Slovene Union ran on the list of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], except for the Provincial Council of Trieste, where they ran separately and gained 3.4% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amministrative2011.regione.fvg.it/000313_Prov/Liste/000007.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518231301/http://amministrative2011.regione.fvg.it/000313_Prov/Liste/000007.html |archivedate=2011-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
The party has an official newspaper, called ''Skupnost'' ("Community"). The weekly journal ''[[Novi glas]]'' ("The New Voice"), published in [[Gorizia]] by the [[Hermagoras Society]] is also generally supportive of the party's program, policies and ideology, although it is sometimes critical towards its actions.

==Prominent members==
Several public figures of the [[Slovene minority in Italy]] have been public supporters of the Slovene Union, including the authors [[Boris Pahor]] and [[Alojz Rebula]], historian [[Jože Pirjevec]], journalist, editor and historian [[Ivo Jevnikar]] and others.

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of gender''' is a prominent subfield of [[sociology]]. Social interaction directly correlated with sociology regarding social structure. One of the most important social structures is [[Social status|status]]. This is determined based on position that an individual possesses which effects how he/she will be treated by society. One of the most important statuses an individual claims is gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qjjbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=gender+roles+in+marriage#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20roles%20in%20marriage&amp;f=false|title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|last=Lindsey|first=Linda L.|date=2015-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317348085|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discourse and the academic literature generally use the term ''[[gender]]'' for the perceived or projected ([[Gender identity|self-identified]]) [[masculinity]] or [[femininity]] of a person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Introduction==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
The term ''gender role'' was coined by [[John Money]] in a seminal 1955 paper where he defined it as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |url= |journal=Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp. |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=301–19 |doi= |pmid=13260820 |quote=By the term, gender role, we mean all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to sexuality in the sense of eroticism. Gender role is appraised in relation to the following: general mannerisms, deportment and demeanor, play preferences and recreational interests; spontaneous topics of talk in unprompted conversation and casual comment; content of dreams, daydreams, and fantasies; replies to oblique inquiries and projective tests; evidence of erotic practices and, finally, the person's own replies to direct inquiry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's gender is complex, encompassing countless characteristics of appearance, speech, movement and other factors not solely limited to [[biological sex]]. Societies tend to have [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] [[gender systems]] in which everyone is categorized as [[male]] or [[female]]. Some societies include a [[third gender]] role; for instance, the Native American [[Two-Spirit]] people and the [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]]s of India. There is debate over the extent to which gender is a [[social construct]] or a [[Sex differences in humans|biological construct .]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0465077144|location=New York|pages=|via=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In feminist theory==
{{Main|Feminist theory|Feminist sociology}}

During the 1970s, there was no consensus about how the terms were to be applied. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'', the author uses "innate gender" and  "learned sex roles", but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed. By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted traits.

Liberal feminism is the belief that individuals should be free to develop their own talents and pursue their interests. Individuals seek to expand equality by removing the barriers in society. Socialist feminism thinks that capitalism strengthens patriarchy by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few. The traditional family structure should be replaced by a collective revolution. In Radical feminism, they believe that patriarchy is so deeply rooted in society that even a sociological revolution would not end it; Society must eliminate gender itself.

==Other languages==
In English, both ''sex'' and ''gender'' are used in contexts where they could not be substituted (sexual intercourse; anal sex; safe sex; sex worker; sex slave). Other languages, like [[German language|German]], use the same word ''Geschlecht'' to refer both to grammatical gender and to biological sex, making the distinction between ''sex'' and ''gender'' advocated by some anthropologists difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loan-word ''gender'' to achieve this distinction. Sometimes 'Geschlechtsidentität' is used as gender (although it literally means ''gender identity'') and 'Geschlecht' as sex (translation of [[Judith Butler]]'s ''[[Gender Trouble]]''). More common is the use of modifiers: ''biologisches Geschlecht'' for ''sex'', ''Geschlechtsidentität'' for ''gender identity'' and ''Geschlechterrolle'' for ''gender role'' etc.

==U.S. media==

Media criticism is a reflection of the gender inequality in society through print, advertisements, television and music.  Media influences and reinforces the idea of [[The Beauty Myth]] as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book, The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, which refers to unrealistic standards of beauty for women.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Naomi. The Beauty Myth: how images of beauty are used against women. N.p.: Perennial, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the mainstream media perpetuates the idea of hetero-masculinity by portraying men as dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael. Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men . New York : HarperCollins, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that the media objectifies and oppresses women, and men who don't fall into the heteronormative category.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, S. (1999). "Never Just Pictures" in Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oppression ===

Through the media, men are taught to be ultra-masculine by being desensitized, violent, and physically strong.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. (2002) 8 Reasons Why Eminem's Popularity is a Disaster for Women.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of media that often portray the ultra-masculine figure are advertisements, specifically beer commercials.  These forms encourage men to oppress other men if they do not fit the ideals of heteromasculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Strate, L. (2004) "Beer Commercials: A manual for masculinity" in Kimmel, M. S., &amp; Messner (Eds.), M. A. Men's Lives (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. pp. 533-543.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objectification of women ===
{{See also|Sexualisation}}

Objectification of women refers to instances in the media in which women may be viewed as, or directly compared to, insentient objects that can be acquired and/or possessed. This can be examined in the context of advertisements, where objects may be anthropomorphized and given feminine qualities or aspects of the female form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/objectify.|title=Definition of OBJECTIFY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some studies indicate that widespread objectification of women in the media may have significant repercussions on society, such as low self-esteem and/or eating disorders among women.&lt;ref&gt;Greening, Kacey D. "The Objectification and Dismemberment of Women in the Media." Undergraduate Research Journal for the Human Sciences (2004): n. pag. URC. Web. 8 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.kon.org/urc/v5/greening.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and socialization==
{{See also|Socialization#Gender socialization}}
Socialization theory offers a straightforward account of the acquisition of gendered identities. Infants are seen as blank slates, waiting to be written down on by their environment. Through their interactions with people close to them and exposure to the values of their society, infants learn what sex is attributed to them and what roles they are expected to learn. Reinforcement (through rewarding gender-appropriate behavior and punishing what may seem as deviant behavior) socializes children into their genders.&lt;ref name="thorne"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Play: Girls and Boys in School|author=Thorne, Barrie|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8135-1923-3|location=New Brunswick, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents, for example, are far more likely to engage with their sons in rough physical play than they are with their daughters, and it has been argued that long-term consequences may follow (in this case, a head start for boys in the development of physical violence and aggressiveness.)&lt;ref&gt;Mcdonald, K. and R.D. Park (1986). Parent-child physical play, Sex Roles, Vol.15, pp.367-378&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents and family can influence the way that a child develops their view of gender. These types of influences can include parental attitudes and difference of treatment regarding male and female children. Researcher Susan Witt claims that parents also expose children to gender from the time they are born via specific toys, colors, and names associated with genders in the binary. Witt suggests that parental attitudes about gender can differ from male to female children and that these attitudes develop quickly after a child's birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witt|first1=Susan|title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles|journal=Adolesncence|date=Summer 1997|volume=32|issue=126|pages=253–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Susan Grieshaber, in "Constructing the Gendered Infant", suggests that attitudes regarding pregnancy change after parents find out the sex of their child, subsequently changing parental attitudes towards the unborn child. According to Grieshaber's theory, once parents determine the sex of their unborn child, they assume a gender while planning for the child's arrival. Because of this, Grieshaber claims that infants are born into a gendered world where they never know anything other than the gender traits that are assumed due to their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Early Childhood|last=Yelland|first=Nicola|last2=Grieshaber|first2=Susan|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=0-415-15409-X|location=New York, New York|pages=15–35|chapter=Constructing the Gendered Infant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Kara Smith utilizes similar theory throughout the analysis of her pregnancy journals kept throughout her second pregnancy. Smith concluded that her attitude towards her child changed after learning that her child’s sex was male. Smith's claim is reflected in changes in tone of voice when talking to the unborn child as well as differences in physical touch of her stomach throughout the rest of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kara|date=2005|title=Prebirth Gender Talk: A Case Study in Prenatal Socialization|url=|journal=Women and Language|volume=28|pages=49–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory of gender socialization, discussed by Susan McHale, is that the gender roles and attitudes of older siblings can impact the gender roles adopted by younger children. Throughout the findings of McHale's study, it is maintained that parents still have the most familial influence on childhood socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McHale|first=Susan|date=2001|title=Sibling Influences on Gender Development in Middle Childhood and Early Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/H_Helms_Sibling_2001.pdf|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=37|pages=115–125|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.1.115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time children reach the age of three, many will have acquired a firm sense of themselves as male or female, a gender identity that remains throughout life. In addition, many pre-schoolers develop a firm awareness of [[gender stereotypes]], insisting that certain activities or items of clothing are not for girls and others not for boys. Yet gender identity does not automatically follow from biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|date=2000|title=The Five Sexes, Revisited|url=|journal=The Sciences|volume=40|issue=4|pages=18–23|via=|doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.2000.tb03504.x|pmid=12569934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paradoxes of Gender|last=Lorber|first=Judith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-300-06497-1|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults respond differently to communicative efforts of boys and girls. A study of infants aged 13 months found that when boys demand attention - by behaving aggressively, or crying, whining or screaming - they tended to get it. By contrast, adults tended to respond to girls only when they used language, gestures, or gentle touches; girls who used attention-seeking techniques were likely ignored. There was little difference in the communicative patterns at the start of the study, but by the age of two, the girls have become more talkative and boys more assertive in their communicative techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fagot | first1 = B.I | year = 1985 | title = Differential reactions to assertive and communicative acts by toddler boys and girls | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 6| pages = 1499–505 | doi=10.2307/1130468| pmid = 4075871 | jstor = 1130468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms that are taught throughout childhood are influential in an individual's life because the ideas about gender that are typically taught by parents in early years are reinforced outside of the home.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A study done by Dr. Mick Cunningham states that the normative behaviors and attitudes that children observe can influence the way that these children grow up to structure their own households in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=Mick|date=April 2001|title=Parental Influences on the Gendered Division of Housework|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=66|issue=2|pages=184|doi=10.2307/2657414|via=|jstor=2657414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normative gender roles can be reinforced outside of the household, adding power to these hegemonic ideas about gender. An analysis of children’s books in the twenty-first century, by Janice McCabe, suggests that this particular avenue of children’s media symbolically annihilates females, representing them about half as often as that of males. Underrepresentation such as this can affect children and their views of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|date=2011|title=Gender in Twentieth- Century Children's Books|url=|journal=Gender and Sociology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1177/0891243211398358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children’s TV networks, such as Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network have demonstrated a disproportional representation of males and females on their respective shows in a study done by Beth Hentges and Kim Case. According to Hentges and Case, there are less female characters across all three children’s networks; however, there is more propagation of stereotypical gendered behavior on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon than that of Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hentges|first=Beth|last2=Case|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=Gender Representation on Disney Channel, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon Broadcasts in the United States|url=|journal=Journal of Children and Media|volume=7|issue=3|pages=319–333|doi=10.1080/17482798.2012.729150|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atypical Household Influence on Gender Socialization ===

Some children are raised in atypical households that challenge normative gender roles. In Jada Tidwell's study, she observes the play of children who come from households with lesbian feminist mothers (both single mothers and couples). Tidwell's observations consisted of both individual play as well as play integrated with the mothers. As a result of these observations, Tidwell asserts that atypical environments can affect children’s lives and ideas. According to Tidwell, households that challenge hegemonic cultural ideas ultimately give children a different perspective of gender than those of children raised in heterosexual, two parent households. In the families studied by Jada Tidwell, children reported ideas that both endorsed and challenged stereotypical gender roles at times.&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, Jada Annette. “Gender Development in Children with Atypical Parental Socialization: An Example of Lesbian Feminist Mothers.” ''Georgia State University,'' US: ProQuest Information &amp; Learning, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In a different study, Abbie Goldberg observed toddlers from various types of households and how these children engaged in play. Goldberg's findings suggest that children whose parents are of the same gender tend to play in ways that are less adherent to stereotypical gender roles than children from heterosexual households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Abbie|date=November 2012|title=Gender- Typed Play Behavior in Early Childhood: Adopted Children with Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Parents|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=67|issue=9–10|pages=503–515|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0198-3|pmid=23420542|pmc=3572788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Witt, in her article “Parental Influence on Children’s Socialization to Gender Roles’, advocates for androgynous gender roles in parenting, arguing that environments are more open minded about gender and encouraging to both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Gender and psychoanalysis==
One of the most influential of the psychoanalytic theories of gender identity is the perspective developed in the book The Reproduction of Mothering. Its author, Nancy Chodorow, traces the implications for emotional development by linking them with the way mothers usually care for their infants in their formative years, while fathers are more emotionally distant. The development of an identity takes place as the infant gets more and more separated from his/her mother, with whom the infant is initially psychically merged. This process however operates differently for boys and girls. Girls can separate gradually, maintain a continuous sense of relationship with the mother, who is after all experienced as alike. For boys, on the other hand, separating from the mother, who is experienced as different, involves repressing the feminine aspects of themselves and rejecting their tenderness that was central to that early relationship. Boys' sense of maleness, according to Chodorow, is achieved at a great emotional cost.&lt;ref&gt;Chodorow, N. (1978). ''The Reproduction of Mothering'', Berkeley, CA, and London, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, men grow up to have a more autonomous sense of self, and to be more independent, more instrumental and competitive in their dealings with others. They are also more likely to have difficulty expressing their emotions and to be anxious about intimacy. Women, on the other hand, have more ability and more need to sustain relationship with others.; they have greater empathy with others. They have difficulty however in maintaining the boundaries of an independent and autonomous self.

Chodorow however believes that these patterns aren't inevitable. Changes in the social arrangements for care of children such as dual parenting, which would involve fathers in emotional intimacy with their children, can break the cycle.

==Gender and the division of labor==
Before industrialization, economic activity, which centered around agricultural work, crafts and so on, was organized by households. Household members, whether male or female, young or old, contributed to the family's livelihood. Although women might do some types of work and men others, depending on region and class, the distinction between men as breadwinners and women as housewives didn't characterize pre-industrial divisions of labor.

Industrialization shifted much productive activity to factories, shops and offices. This separation of work from home signaled a profound change in gender relations and gender discourse. The home came to be understood not as the site of a family enterprise, but as a refuge from the world of work. Women were defined as the keepers of the home, as it was seen as their nature to create harmony and virtue rather than services and goods. Preindustrial society relied on gendered roles in the workforce to create equilibrium between men and women. Men were assigned the hunter role while women were assigned the domestic roles. Men were expected to supply food and shelter for the family while women were the caretakers for the children and their household. As centuries passed, this continued and created a divide in gendered roles in labor. Women remained dependent on men to provide, this dependence led to male roles being more valued in society which still remains in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Gender in conversation==
Some research has found that, in classroom settings, male students tend to talk more, and longer, than female students. This was determined to be particularly noticeable when the instructor is male.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985&gt;{{cite web |last=Krupnick |first=Catherine G. |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58474/krupnick.html |title=Women and Men in the Classroom: Inequality and Its Remedies |work=On Teaching and Learning, Volume 1 |year=1985 |accessdate=3013-06-23 |publisher=Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results were found previously in hospitals by Erving Goffman in 1961, university discussion groups by Elizabeth Aries in 1972, and in corporate settings by Rosabeth Kanter in 1977.&lt;ref name=krupnick-1985/&gt;

=== Gender in the workplace ===
Women and men experience different types of mobility within the workplace. Women tend to experience a [[glass ceiling]], an invisible barrier that prevents them from moving up the corporate ladder. Men in jobs traditionally held by women, such as nursing, elementary school teaching, and social work, experience a "glass escalator" effect in which they are able to quickly ascend the job hierarchy to become managers and principals.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Christine L., "The Glass Escalator: The Hidden Advantages for Men in the "Female" Professions", Social Problems, 39(3), pp. 253-267&lt;/ref&gt; There also tends to be a [[gender pay gap]] between men and women, with women earning 77% as much as men.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}
 
One cause of the gender pay gap may be due to [[occupational segregation]], which pushes men and women towards gender-specific forms of employment, rather than pay discrimination. Another cause is the [[double burden]], a phenomenon in which women perform most of the unpaid childcare and household work despite being otherwise employed for pay. A third cause is [[occupational sexism]], one part of which favors men for promotions due to their traditional breadwinner status.&lt;ref&gt;Coltrane, Scott. 1997. Family Man: Fatherhood, Housework, and Gender Equity. Oxford University Press, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 class action lawsuit, [[Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.]], charged Wal-Mart with sexist hiring and promotion practices.

In addition, the emergence of [[transgender]] individuals in the workplace has begun to disrupt the gender binary of male and female.  By creating a hybrid gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;Connel, C. "Doing, Undoing, or Redoing Gender?: Learning from the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople."  Gender &amp; Society, 24(1), 31-55&lt;/ref&gt; the transgender community suggests notions of movement toward [[postgenderism]].{{peacock term|date=June 2013}}

== Intersectionality ==
[[Intersectionality]] is a [[Neo-Marxist]] concept stemming from a [[critical theory]] social analysis of [[class (social)|class]], [[race (human classification)|race]], and [[gender]]. The theory of intersectionality argues that forms of "inequality, oppression, and privilege" are shaped by interconnected axes of identity, and are mutually reinforced by social interactions and by social, political, and economic structures, such as capitalism, patriarchy, and institutionalized heteronormativity.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"&gt;Candace West and Sarah Fenstermaker, "Doing Difference," Gender and Society 9, no. 1 (Feb 1995): 8-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of Intersectionality argues that race, class, gender, and other markers of identity are social constructions.&lt;ref&gt;West, C. Z. (1987). Doing Gender. Gender and Society, 1 (2), 125-151.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory argues against the assumption that systems of power relations are normative and can hold individuals accountable for their own character and efforts.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

West &amp; Fenstermaker in their 1995 article ''[[Doing Difference]]'' offer that models that conceive gender, race and class as distinct axes are highly limiting in their understanding of the whole experience or identity of an individual. For example, they critique the additive model, in which the whole will never be greater (or lesser) than the sum of it parts. By analyzing each identity marker as an individual characteristic, we ignore the effect of the interconnection of these markers.&lt;ref name="Sarah Fenstermaker 1995"/&gt;

Additional sociologists have written about the intersectionality of class, race, and gender. Joan Acker outlines four gendered processes of intersectionality. The first includes procedures that create hierarchies based on gender and race. Another is the process in which social images and ideas condone gendered institutions. The third is a process of interaction between individuals and groups that, through communication, creates gender. The fourth is the internal labeling of the self and others to gendered personas.&lt;ref&gt;Acker, J. (1992). From Sex Roles to Gendered Institutions. Contemporary Sociology, 21 (5), 565-569.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evelyn Nakano Glenn]] critiques both the patriarchy model of gender, which ignores racial differences among oppressed women, and the internal colonialism model, which focuses on minority populations in general, ignoring gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, E. N. (1985). Racial Ethnic Women's Labor: The Intersection of Race, Gender and Class Oppression. Review of Radical Political Economics, 17 (85), 86-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embodiment==

Embodiment may be defined as the ways in which cultural ideals of gender in a given society create expectations for and influence the form of our bodies. There is a bidirectional relationship between biology and culture; by embodying societally determined [[gender roles]] we reinforce cultural ideals and simultaneously shape, both temporarily and permanently, our bodies, which then perpetuates the cultural ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Connel, R.W. 2002. ''Gender: Short Introductions.'' Malden: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is actually more variation in body type within the male and female sexes than there is between the two sexes, embodiment exaggerates the perceived bodily differences between gender categories.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. ''The Gendered Society.'' New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social embodiment, for both men and women, is variable across cultures and over time. Examples of women embodying [[gender norms]] across cultures include [[foot binding]] practices in Chinese culture, [[neck rings]] in African and Asian cultures, and [[corsets]] in Western cultures. Another interesting phenomenon has been the practice of wearing [[high heels]], which shifted from a masculine fashion to a feminine fashion over time. In the United States, the ideal body image and dimensions have changed for both women and men, with the body ideal [[female body shape]] becoming progressively slimmer and the body ideal for men becoming progressively larger.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Susan. 1999. "Never Just Pictures" in ''Twilight Zones: The Hidden Life of Cultural Images from Plato to O.J.'' University of California Press, pp. 107-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

These differences are epitomized in the example of children's toys; [[G.I. Joe]] dolls depict the physical ideals for boys and [[Barbie]] dolls embody the ideals for girls. [[The Beauty Myth]], as discussed in [[Naomi Wolf]]'s book The Beauty Myth: How Images of Beauty Are Used Against Women, refers to the unattainable standard of beauty for women, which sustains [[consumer culture]]. In contrast, men's bodies are also "dictated" by cultural ideals of gender, as is evident in consumer culture—especially beer commercials—in which men are portrayed as outdoorsy, tough, strong, and "manly."&lt;ref&gt;Buysse, J.A.M. and Embser-Herbert, M.S. "Construction of Gender in Sport: An Analysis of Intercollegiate Media Guide Cover Photographs." ''Gender and Society'', 18 (1), 2004, pp. 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==

Sexuality encompasses both sexual behavior and sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Pepper, and Virginia Rutter. 1998. The Gender of Sexuality. Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Heteronormativity]] structures social life so that [[Heterosexuality]] is always assumed, expected, ordinary and privileged. Its pervasiveness makes it difficult for people to imagine other ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Stevi. 2006. Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: The complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity. Feminist Theory 7:105-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media works to glorify heterosexuality, which in turn lends to its pervasiveness and to its power.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"&gt;Martin, K.A., &amp; Kayzak, E. (2009). Hetero-Romantic Love and Heterosexiness in Children's G-Rated Films. Gender and Society, 23(3), 315-336.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ordinary and exceptional constructions of heterosexuality work to normalize heterosexuality; thus, it becomes difficult to imagine anything other than this form of social relationship or anyone outside of these bonds.&lt;ref name="Martin, K.A. 2009"/&gt;

There is a common perception of heterosexuality as the "natural" emotional and sensual inclination for [[Human sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence. Signs, 5(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, marital heterosexuality occupies the largely invisible core of normative and desirable sexuality, while all other sexualities are marginalized and considered perverse and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2008). State of our Unions: Marriage Promotion and the Contested Power of Heterosexuality. Gender &amp; Society, 23(1), 27-48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale called the [[Kinsey Scale]], which challenges the common perception of [[Human sexuality]] as strictly binary and directly linked to [[Gender]]. [[Drag queens]] are an example of "troubling" gender, complicating the understanding of sexuality in our society by causing people to think outside the binary of male/female.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, J. and Jasper, J.M. (eds). The Contexts Reader. New York: W.W. Norton, 2008. Pp. 247-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich Engels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engels|first1=Friedrich|title=Origin  of the Family, Private Property, and the State|date=1884|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/origin_family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that in hunter-gatherer societies the activities of men and women, although different, had the same importance. As technological advances let to productive surplus, social equality and communal sharing gave way to private property and ultimately class hierarchy. With the rise of agriculture, men gained significant power over women. With surplus wealth to pass on to their heirs, upper class men wanted to ensure their sons were indeed theirs, which led them to control the sexuality of women. The desire to control property brought about monogamous marriage and family. Women were taught to remain virgins until marriage and remain faithful to their husbands thereafter, and to build their lives around bearing and raising one man's children.

==Masculinity==

[[Masculinity]] is a performed gender identity. Contrary to popular perception{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, it is not the same as [[sex]] or [[sexual orientation]]. The contents and practices of masculinity are socially constructed and reproduced through daily interaction, especially on a more micro scale.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists West &amp; Zimmerman emphasized that gender is maintained through accountability. Men are expected to perform masculinity to the point that it is naturalized. Thus, a man's status depends on his performance. It is important to note, however, that masculinity can be performed by any sex.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinity and Crime"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krienert | first = Jessie L. | title = Masculinity and crime: a quantitative exploration of Messerschmidt's hypothesis | journal = [[Electronic Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | publisher = [[International Consortium for the Advancement of Academic Publication|ICAAP]] | date = July 2003 | url = http://www.sociology.org/content/vol7.2/01_krienert.html | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guyland&gt;{{cite book |last=Kimmel|first=Michael | author-link = Michael Kimmel |title= Guyland: The Perilous World Where Boys Become Men |year=2008 |publisher= [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-06-083135-6  |url= https://archive.org/details/guylandperilousw00kimm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doing Difference"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Fenstermaker | first2 = Sarah | title = Doing difference | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&amp;ndash;37 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124395009001002 | date = February 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/089124395009001002 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant form of masculinity in a society is known as [[hegemonic masculinity]]. Men are constantly performing this to prove their status as men.&lt;ref name="hegemonic"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829&amp;ndash;859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv| postscript = .}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not really possible to reach it, especially as peers are in constant surveillance of each other, looking for flaws in their performance.&lt;ref name="hegemonic" /&gt; Hegemonic masculinity is constructed in opposition to [[femininity]] and is dominant to all other gender identities (including alternative masculinities). Men are [[socialization|socialized]] from birth to perform it, especially through behavior and symbolism. One of the prominent behaviors is aggression in order to protect one's reputation. An example of symbols used would be clothing.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Undoing Gender"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Connell | first = Catherine | title = Doing, undoing, or redoing gender?

Sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] describes three cultures that support masculinity (especially in young men) in his 2008 book, ''Guyland'':
* The Culture of Entitlement: Men are raised to feel they deserve something. They feel entitled to power, sex and women.
* The Culture of Silence: Men are not to talk to outsiders (those not embedded in the cultures of masculinity) about drinking, bullying, rape, or any performance of masculinity by their peers that they may get in trouble for. If they do talk, they will be seen as unmanly traitors.
* The Culture of Protection: Communities do not hold men responsible for questionable and illegal actions. Many turn a blind eye, assuming their boys would never do that. Others write off dangerous acts as "boys will be boys".&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt;

Some of the prominent attitudes and behaviors of western hegemonic masculinity are: power, sexual dominance and activity, wealth, aggression, independence, and lack of emotion. Less extreme sexual harassment is often seen as normal behavior.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender" /&gt; Exemplifying [[control theory]], the norms of masculinity are so rigidly ingrained that men find little room to escape and end up constantly reproducing them.

Hegemonic masculinity is often reproduced and reinforced through media and culture. "Media representations of men…often glorify men's use of physical force, a daring demeanor, virility, and emotional distance." Contemporary [[rap music]] is a striking example of masculinity on display. Rappers boast about their sexual conquests of women (emphasizing [[heterosexuality]] as well), wealth, power and violence.&lt;ref name="Rap Music"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Weitzer | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Kubrin | first2 = Charis E. | author-link1 = Ronald Weitzer | author-link2 = Charis E.

==Gender and violence==

Gender-based [[violence]] is the physical, [[Human sexuality|sexual]] or emotional harm or suffering enacted upon an individual as contextualized by societal [[gender]] norms. Violence affects the lives of millions worldwide, in all socio-economic and educational classes. It cuts across cultural and religious barriers, impeding the right of many to participate fully in society. Violence is about power, control, and domination. Systems of inequality and [[oppression]] interact positioning certain groups as particularly vulnerable to violence. Gendered violence takes place within a socially constructed power dynamic in which one ideology ([[masculinity]]) dominates another ([[femininity]]). What it means to be a woman in society is influenced and ascribed by the media, which acts a "powerful educational force". The media glamorizes [[violence against women]] cultivating a "toxic cultural environment" in which women are institutionally positioned as inferior and worthy objects of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Killing Us Softly 3: Advertising's Image of Women. Dir. Jean Kilbourne. Perf., 2000. DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are disproportionally the offenders, and women disproportionally the victims. Those that commit violent crimes are overwhelmingly male—[[rape]] (98%), armed [[robbery]] (92%), drunk driving (90%), [[murder]] (88%), aggravated assault (87%), arson (86%), and family violence (83%).&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. 2011. The Gendered Society. New York: Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Michael Kimmel]], [[hegemonic masculinity]] creates a culture of entitlement, silence, and protection, which effectively normalizes violence against women and silences victims of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kimmel, Michael S. Guyland: the Perilous World Where Boys Become Men. New York: Harpercollins, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence]] defines three social arenas in which violence commonly takes place (1) in the family—including [[domestic violence]], [[infanticide]], and traditional practices such as  [[female genital mutilation]], [[foot binding]], and [[bride burning]]; (2) in the community—including rape, sexual assault, [[sexual harassment]], and commercialized violence such as [[sexual slavery]], labor exploitation, female migrant workers; and (3) by the State—including violence against women in detention, and in situations of armed conflict such as [[systematic war rape]].&lt;ref&gt;"Women and Violence." Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.un.org/rights/dpi1772e.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address and end gendered violence, solutions must address both the root causes and interpersonal manifestations of gender roles and power relations in order to ensure a balance of power at all levels of society.

==Globalization and gender==

[[Globalization]] refers to the increasingly global relationships of culture, people and economic activity. Globalization impacts female equality on a large and international scale, both negatively and positively.  With continuous changes in international relations, the perception of [[feminism]] in Western and Nonwestern societies is frequently revised.  It is important to be wary of Western bias in sociological accounts of global feminism, as Modern [[Western society]] is not always due credit for feminist reform in other cultures and countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ferree, Myra Marx. 2006. "Globalization and Feminism: Opportunities and Obstacles for Activism in the Global Arena" in Ferree, M.M. &amp; Tripp, A.M. (Eds.) Global Feminism: Transnational women's activism, organizing, and human rights. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist sentiments – or a push for gender equality – emerge as a result of the nation-specific circumstances, not according to the exported beliefs of Western society.  Advances in female equality and status are often not the result of national groups or corporations, but of individuals and small groups.

One of the results of globalization is the increased use of female factory workers in nonwestern countries.  In Mexico, the female worker is ideal because she is seen as docile and inexpensive labor.  Stereotypical feminine traits such as beauty, domesticity, and docility are exaggerated and exploited for the production of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Salzinger, L. 2003. Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories. Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;  These gender traits then frame the behavior of the women beyond the occupational realm.  Despite increasing feminism, the lack of economic and [[social mobility]] prevents women in many nations from having equal status in society.

One of the solutions to erasing gender inequalities globally, is to provide resources and funds to impoverished women who will in turn use them for [[education]] as well as business ventures.  The [[global economy]] could benefit drastically from incorporating educated women into the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|title=The Women’s Crusade|first1=Nicholas|last1=Kristof|first2=Sheryl|last2=WuDunn|date=17 August 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third gender ==
Throughout history, and around the world, the idea of a [[third gender]] has existed. In Native American culture, the [[Two-spirit|two spiririt]] had gender roles different from men and women. The [[muxe]] of southern Mexico are males who identify as neither male or female. In Samoa the [[Fa'afafine]] are biological males who identify as females. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] are biological males who identify as women. They are considered outsiders in their communities and have formed their own language. In the United States, the concept of a third gender is beginning to gain traction. California now allows for drivers licenses to have the gender "non-binary", see [[genderqueer]].

'''Solitary Watch''' is a web-based project aimed at bringing the widespread use of solitary confinement into the light of the public square. Its mission is to provide the public—as well as practicing attorneys, legal scholars, law enforcement and corrections officers, policymakers, educators, advocates, people in prison and their families—with the first centralized source of unfolding news, original reporting, firsthand accounts, and background research on [[Solitary_confinement#United_States|solitary confinement in the United States]].&lt;ref name="swcom"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://solitarywatch.com/about/| title=About Solitary Watch| accessdate=2011-06-18| publisher=Solitary Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In December 2009, Solitary Watch launched its website. Overseen by journalist [[James Ridgeway]] and writer/editor [[Jean Casella]], the website features original reporting, an archive of resources and information, and the "Voices from Solitary" Project which collects firsthand stories from men and women who have served time in solitary confinement. Within its first nine months, the website attracted over 100,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="swcom"/&gt; Articles posted on the website have been picked up by many major news outlets, including [[CounterPunch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.counterpunch.org/casella01032011.html| title=Bradley Manning, Solitary Confinement and Selective Outrage| accessdate=2011-06-18| publisher=[[CounterPunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al Jazeera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/03/201137125936219469.html| title=Cruel and Unusual: US Solitary Confinement| accessdate=2011-06-18| publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bruck]] is involved with the project.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''''Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making''''' is a book about [[global governance]] by American author [[David Rothkopf]], released in March 2008 by publisher [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]. The book claims that the world population of 6 billion people is subject to the immense influence of an elite (i.e. The Superclass) of six thousand individuals.

Until the late 20th century, governments of the [[great power]]s provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the [[Pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) and entrepreneurs ([[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]], [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]]). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout — fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication — rules.  Further, the [[nation-state]]'s power has diminished shrinking politicians to minority [[power broker (term)|power broker]] status.  Leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the [[U.S. Congress]]), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He proposes that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.

'''The Green Deal''' was a UK government policy initiative that gives homeowners, landlords and tenants the opportunity to pay for energy efficient home improvements through the savings on their energy bills. At the heart of the Green Deal is the rule that savings on bills will exceed the cost of the work. By meeting this 'Golden Rule', consumers will be able to receive energy savings for free. Consumers will then pay back the cost of such improvements through the expected savings in their energy bills. There were 45 different types of improvements available under the Green Deal, ranging from loft and cavity wall insulation, innovative hot water systems and condensing boilers to more costly measures such as solar thermal energy or solid wall insulation.

This was a unique financial structure with no [[debtor]], instead the burden stayed with the property no matter the tenant.  This means new tenants or owners become liable for the payments for the energy efficiency improvements, requiring new legislation in English law.  Government estimates say that a typical three bedroom semi-detached house could save £270 a year from solid wall insulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-2269557/Should-Green-Deal-loan.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was hoped the Green Deal would lead to the renovation of the UK's housing stock with an estimated 14 million homes seeing energy efficiency improvements ranging from; [[double glazing]], [[cavity wall insulation|cavity wall]] and loft insulation through to gas and oil boilers, and renewable technologies such as solar PV, solar thermal and heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greendeal.co.uk|title=The Green Deal?|publisher=Greendeal.co.uk|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was given a 'soft' launch by the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] on 1 October 2012 to permit improvements for energy saving measures for properties in Great Britain and was officially launched in January 2013. Following this, the first Green Deal Plans were available from 28 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greendealcertified.com/press-certified/634-decc-commits-to-autumn-launch-of-green-deal.html|title=DECC commits to Autumn launch of Green Deal|publisher=Greendealcertified.com|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registers of Green Deal Installers, Green Deal Assessors, Green Deal Advisers and Green Deal Providers became active at the launch in October 2012. In its first six months 38,259 Green Deal assessments had taken place. However, only four Green Deals had been taken out &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23081896|title=Only four people sign up for flagship Green Deal|date=27 June 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the finance not available until Green Deal Plans formalised on 28 January 2013.

Green Deals  were repaid at a rate no more than 6.92% fixed rate unsecured over the life, up to 25 years - this lower rate and duration are unprecedented in high street finance or available loans. The finance were mistakenly compared to home loans of similar duration, but had limited periods of fixed rates of 5 years or less, and secured against the house.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21226042|title='Energy efficiency' Green Deal launched by government|date=28 January 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surveys found little awareness among the general public for the Green Deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/23/not-heard-green-deal-poll | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Adam | last=Vaughan | title=Four out of five people have not heard of green deal, poll finds | date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mistakenly perceived high interest rates and charges of the scheme were heavily criticised.

Lack of demand for the Green Deal was partly due to the ECO grant programme, which gave homeowners substantial grants in competition to the Grean Deal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/21/renewable-energy-heating-grants|title=Renewable energy heating grants available for UK households|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|date=2011-07-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This left the energy efficiency industry struggling, the lack of demand has led one company, Domestic &amp; General Insulation, to completely withdraw from the market and will likely lay off 600 staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/2353736/up-to-600-jobs-at-risk-at-leading-insulation-company&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 a second Green Deal was launched, as grants rather than the loans which had underpinned the original scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27759217 | work=BBC News | title=New Green Deal is very generous, says energy secretary | date=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May, the Government announced the new Green Deal Home Improvement Fund (GDHIF), a new energy efficiency incentive available to households in England and Wales for taking measures to improve the energy efficiency in their homes. The households will be eligible to claim up to £7,600 for improving their homes. The Incentive went live on 9 June 2014.

While the Department of Energy and Climate Change reached its target for the schemes to improve 1 million homes by March 2015, it also made the decision in July 2015  following the election of Conservative Government The Energy Secretary [[Amber Rudd]] announced the Green Deal would be scrapped &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/household-energy-efficieny-schemes-15-16/|title=Household Energy Efficiency Schemes inquiry|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There was no opposition to the scheme being scrapped but there was concern that there was no replacement scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-33638903 | work=BBC News | title=Green Deal funding to end, government announces | date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total 15,000 Green Deals had been issued. Former Climate Change Minister [[Greg Barker]] stated he was confident that the private sector would pick up the slack from the withdrawal of Government funding&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/23/uk-ceases-financing-of-green-deal&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it worked==
Homeowner would make energy-saving improvements to your home or business without having to pay all the costs up front through the Green Deal. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205173301/https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures|title=Green Deal: energy saving for your home or business - GOV.UK|date=2013-02-05|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First,  an assessment by a government registered assessor of the property to see what improvements  can be made and how much it could save on energy bills.

Secondly, homeowner would choose a Green Deal provider to carry out the work. Only work that would reduce the energy bill highlighted by the assessor would qualify. 

Thirdly, A Green Deal plan is signed. This is a contract between homeowner and the provider stating what work will be done and how much it will cost. The provider will then arrange for a Green Deal installer to do the work. The funding for these measures is then issued by The Green Deal Finance Company ([http://www.tgdfc.org/ GDFC])

Lastly, once the work was complete, the homeowner or tenant would pay off the cost in instalments through their electricity bill. 

Gemserv has been contracted as the scheme administrators for the Green Deal Oversight and Registration Body (GD ORB), alongside its role of operating the Microgeneration Certification Scheme(MCS) and the Biomass Suppliers List (BSL). The GD ORB manages scheme administrative functions, such as maintaining the public registers of authorised participants and participant helpdesk; as well as working alongside industry and government to further develop and share best practice in operational processes, and raising awareness about consumer protection issues.

==Criticism==
The Green Deal was included in the [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom|Energy Act 2011]] and came into force on 1 October 2012. DECC announced a list of pioneer Green Deal providers in April 2012. Twenty two providers, including three of the biggest six energy companies and [[B&amp;Q]], (the only high street name) have signed a declaration stating they intend to become Green Deal Providers, once DECC had appointed the Green Deal Oversight Body. Other expected providers such as [[Tesco]], [[Marks and Spencer]] and the other three major energy companies were missing from the list.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/04/green-deal-home-insulation-tesco?newsfeed=true|title=M&amp;S and Tesco missing from list of first green deal providers|last=Cuff|first=Madeleine|date=2012-04-04|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fears of low take up of the Green Deal has led Government to budget £200 million to encourage early uptake.&lt;ref name="guardian1" /&gt; The policy caused a rift in the Coalition Government in April 2012. Senior Conservative ministers, including [[Eric Pickles]] ( Communities and Local Government Secretary), called for the scheme to be scrapped as it could cost the so-called "squeezed" middle, thousands of pounds.&lt;ref name="carrington1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/16/green-deal-energy-efficiency-conservatory|title=Green deal plot reveals new levels of idiocy from Tory climate sceptics|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=2012-04-16|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hennessy1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/greenpolitics/9204987/Top-Tories-try-to-torpedo-Green-Deal.html|title=Top Tories try to torpedo Green Deal|last=Hennessy|first=Patrick|date=2012-04-14|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The building industry has raised concern about the lack of stimulus to drive demand for the uptake of the Green Deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2029771/greg-barker-clashes-industry-coalitions-green-deal-plans |title=Greg Barker clashes with building industry over coalition's Green Deal plans - 01 Mar 2011 - News from |publisher=BusinessGreen |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other  worries include its limited projected coverage to consumer protection, its treatment of non-domestic buildings and lack of competition among suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endsreport.com/32634/green-deal-proposals-for-home-upgrades-still-lack-credibility|title=Green Deal proposals for home upgrades still lack credibility|publisher=Endsreport.com|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government has confirmed the Green Deal for business has been put on hold for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endsreport.com/33581/green-deal-delayed-for-commercial-buildings|title=Green Deal delayed for Commercial Buildings|publisher=Endsreport.com|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been doubts cast over whether the central tenet of the scheme - the so-called "[[Golden Rule]]" whereby the cost of repayments never outweighs the savings on the bill - will actually be successfully implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2118394/industry-warns-rocky-road-green-deal-success |title=Industry warns of rocky road to Green Deal success - 20 Oct 2011 - News from |publisher=BusinessGreen |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Juliette Jowit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/nov/24/green-deal-is-not-a-good-deal |title=Green Deal is not a good deal for all homeowners &amp;#124; Juliette Jowit &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2010-11-24|accessdate=2012-02-12 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While The Green Deal is primarily concerned with buildings' energy efficiency, it is often associated with reducing carbon emissions, and mitigating climate change.  However, the effects of [[Jevons Paradox]], and cash savings being spent on other products and services with associated carbon footprint, means that The Green Deal may not reduce carbon emissions, unless there is a corresponding supply-side constraint, keeping coal, oil and gas underground.

The choice of Gemserv as the certification body has also provoked criticism as it is owned by the 6 largest energy companies in the UK and so will act as a barrier to small businesses being certified and thus benefiting from the green deal. This would undermine DECC objective of promoting green growth with the scheme.

[[David Cameron]] has defended the Green Deal, stating that despite the lack of interest from the general public and a slow take-up, the policy was never intended to start with a big bang, but rather to build slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/16/david-cameron-green-deal-homeowners | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Damian | last=Carrington | title=David Cameron briefed on concerns over green deal for homeowners | date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the government has invested heavily in generating early uptake by consumers.

There have also been issues with conmen posing as Green Deal assessors. Trading standards officers have reported that cold callers are posing as Green Deal assessors while charging "administration fees"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22470012 | work=BBC News | title=Warning over conmen posing as Green Deal assessors | date=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel Poverty===
The scheme has faced heavy criticism that it will do nothing to combat the rising levels of fuel poverty in the UK. As with the closure of the [[Warmfront]] scheme the UK no longer has any policies specifically targeted at lowering fuel poverty. The Government's impact assessment estimates that the Green Deal will lead to 125,000 to 250,000 households being lifted out of fuel poverty by 2023.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/critics-say-coalitions-green-deal-is-no-solution-to-curse-of-fuel-poverty-8477931.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Simon | last=Read | title=Critics say Coalition's Green Deal is no solution to curse of fuel poverty | date=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interest Rate===
The 7% interest rate of the Green Deal Plan has been extensively criticized since it was revealed at the scheme's launch, as it is higher than available high street  home-loans. Although the Green Deal Plan was a fixed rate for the life of the energy improvement (up to 25 years) and unsecured, it was compared to secured home loans of similar life but only short periods of fixed interest rate. This hysteria led to some Green Deal providers such as [[RWE npower|Npower]] raising concerns about the high rates, adding that, unless they were reduced, the scheme would fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/9838241/Green-Deal-provider-Npower-warns-schemes-interest-rates-are-too-high.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Emily | last=Gosden | title=Green Deal provider Npower warns scheme's interest rates are too high | date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high interest rate has raised concerns that the Green Deal will not meet its golden rule.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/household-bills/9839987/Green-Deal-99-for-a-flawed-assessment.html|title=Green Deal: £99 for a 'flawed' assessment|last=Gammell|first=Kara|date=31 January 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortgageability questions===
If you move into a property with a Green Deal, the landlord or seller must show you a copy of the Energy Performance Certificate - this will explain what improvements have been made and how much you’ll need to repay. The person who pays the electricity bill pays the money back - so if you’re a tenant in a rented property, you’ll be paying back the costs, not the landlord. This is because the tenant can expect to benefit from lower energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406034504/https://www.gov.uk/green-deal-energy-saving-measures/moving-into-a-property-with-a-green-deal|title=Green Deal: energy saving for your home or business - GOV.UK|date=2013-04-06|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council of Mortgage Lenders have issued guidelines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cml.org.uk/cml/policy/issues/6709 |title=CML Guidelines|publisher=cml.org.uk |accessdate=30 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have stated "Lenders will make their own individual commercial decisions in response to the Green Deal, and these may vary." 

Buro Happold, in a report on the Green Deal, suggested there should also be more information on its wider implications, such as how it impacts fuel poverty, property value and re-saleability. The researchers also warn that the as yet unknown impact on the resale value of homes from refurbishments and Green Deal debts attached to the property could deter uptake.&lt;ref name="endsreport.com"&gt;http://www.endsreport.com/38729/investors-needs-likely-to-compromise-green-deal&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk of overheating===
Research studies by Prof Chris Goodier of Loughborough University and Prof Li Shao of the University of Reading highlighted potential risks of overheating in dwellings via over insulting households&lt;ref&gt;Green Deal 'could lead to deadly summer overheating' by Brian Wheeler, Political reporter, BBC News, 8 July 2013, last updated at 14:47 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23180965&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Green Deal had two measures built in to ensure this would not occur, firstly, the "Golden Rule" and secondly, each measure must be assessed through [[Energy Performance Certificate (United Kingdom)|Energy Performance Certificate]].

==The Green Deal Home Improvement Fund (GDHIF)==

The Green Deal Home Improvement Fund (GDHIF) is a new incentive scheme open to all householders in England and Wales wanting to improve the energy efficiency of their homes&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change DECC]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The scheme allows Householders to choose one or both of the two core offers available and may also be eligible to claim up to £7,600 as a bundled package. The policy closed to new applications on 24 July 2014&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/applications-to-the-green-deal-home-improvement-fund-close&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Core Offer 1'''

Up to £1,000 for installing two energy saving improvements from the list of 12 eligible measures below:
# Condensing mains gas boiler
# Fan assisted storage heaters
# Flue gas heat recovery
# Replacement warm-air unit
# Waste water heat recovery
# Cavity wall insulation
# Flat roof insulation
# Floor insulation
# Room in a roof insulation
# Double/triple glazing (replacing single glazing)
# Secondary glazing
# Energy efficient replacement doors

'''Core Offer 2'''

Up to 75% of the total cost of the installation of internal or external solid wall insulation, up to a maximum value of £6,000, making this high carbon saving improvement much more affordable.

'''Core Offer 3'''

Householders can also claim a refund of up to £100 for a Green Deal Assessment Report (GDAR) that is less than 24 months old when they do work in this scheme.

'''Core Offer 4'''

An additional bonus of up to £500 for homebuyers who have bought a home in the last 12 months prior to application.

'''Requirements'''

To be eligible for the GDHIF scheme offers householders must satisfy the following incentive criteria:
* Customers must apply for the voucher before the work starts
* Measures must be recommended in an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) or GDAR carried out in the last 24 months
* The GDHIF can work with Green Deal Finance which could be used to help to pay for some of the costs of installation
* Customers will not be eligible for the GDHIF incentive if they receive ECO or other central Government funding, on the energy saving improvements applied for under GDHIF

This scheme closed on 24 July, due to overwhelming demand. In October 2014 however, the Government announced an additional £100m of funding would be made available for the GDHIF phase 2 although further details are yet to be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegreenage.co.uk/green-deal-home-improvement-fund/&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Green Deal Finance Company ==
The Green Deal Finance Company (TGDFC) was a £14 billion industry led consortium with over 50 members from across the industry, both public and private sector. The Company was incorporated in March 2012 as a not-for-profit mutual limited by guarantee. It is a national aggregator designed to make finance available to all accredited Green Deal Providers on an equal and open basis. By operating at a national level, it intends to minimise the operating and administration costs of Green Deals and will aim to access the cheapest sources of finance in the market at the highest possible credit rating. It  worked closely with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Green Investment Bank, together with a number of Local Authorities, with a view to maximising its assistance to the Green Deal market &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718115625/http://thegreendealfinancecompany.com/|title=Wayback Machine|date=2013-07-18|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{voting}}
A '''ticket''' refers to a single [[election]] choice which fills more than one [[political]] office or seat.  For example, in [[Guyana]], the candidates for [[President of Guyana|President]] and [[National Assembly of Guyana|Parliament]] run on the same "ticket", because they are elected together on a single [[ballot]] [[question]] — as a vote for a given [[Party-list proportional representation|party-list]] in the Parliamentary election counts as a vote for the party's corresponding presidential candidate — rather than separately.

A ticket can also refer to a [[political party]].  In this case, the candidates for a given party are said to be running on the party's ticket.  "Straight party voting" (most common in some [[U.S. states]]) is voting for the entire party ticket, including every office for which the party has a candidate running.  Particularly in the era of mechanical [[voting machine]]s, it was possible to accomplish this in many jurisdictions by the use of a "party lever" which automatically cast a vote for each member of the party by the activation of a single lever. Ticket Splitters are people who vote for candidates from more than one [[political party]] when they vote for public offices, voting on the basis of individual personalities and records instead of on the basis of party loyalties.

While a ticket usually does refer to a political party, they are not legally the same.  In rare cases, members of a political party can run against their party's official candidate by running with a rival party's ticket label or creating a new ticket under an independent or ''ad hoc'' party label depending on the jurisdiction's election laws.  Depending on the party's rules, these rogue members may retain the membership of their original party. Thus two individuals from one political party can oppose each other under different tickets.  This was the case for [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] politician [[James Soong]], who withdrew from the [[Kuomingtang]] and ran against its official candidate, [[Lien Chan]], for election as President in [[Taiwan presidential election, 2000|the 2000 elections]]; In the subsequent election in [[Taiwan presidential election, 2004|2004]], Soong ran as Lien's running mate.

Political party factions may also sponsor tickets in [[primary election]]s.  When that occurs, several candidates, usually one for each office for which the party's nomination is being contested in the primary, endorse one another and may make joint appearances and share [[advertising]] with the goal of securing the party's nomination for the office each is seeking for all ticket members.  This system was frequently seen in the "[[Solid South]]" era in the [[Southern United States]] when there was no effective [[two party system]] and victory in the Democratic Party primary was considered to be "[[tantamount to election]]".

[[Image:Mass Republican ticket.jpg|left|thumb|Republican Party ticket from 1865 gubernatorial election in Massachusetts.  The Republican candidate, [[Alexander H. Bullock]], defeated Democratic challenger [[Darius N. Couch]].]]
[[Image:ElectoralTicketFlyer.jpg|center|thumb|Flyer for 2008 Democratic Party ticket in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey]].  Even though "ticket" is no longer a physical reality in voting, parties still push the notion of voting for them in every race on the ballot.]]

A new and more aggressive phase of anti-religious persecution in the Soviet Union began in the mid-1970s after a more tolerant period following [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s downfall in 1964.

[[Yuri Andropov]] headed the campaign in the 1970s when it began to rise.

This new persecution was following upon the 1975 amendments to the 1929 anti-religious legislation and the [[25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|25th party congress]]. The CC resolution in 1979 would play a key role in this period as well. The intensification of anti-religious activities had continued since the early 1970s; between 1971-1975 over 30 doctoral and 400 magisterial dissertations were defended on the subjects of atheism and criticism of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 there was a conference in [[Leningrad]] dedicated to 'The Topical Problems of the History of [[Religion]] and [[Atheism]] in the Light of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist Scholarship]]'.

This persecution, like other anti-religious campaigns in the USSR's history, was used as a tool to eliminate religion in order to create the ideal atheist society that Marxism–Leninism had as a goal.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1994), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Khrushchev's campaign==

After Khrushchev left office, the anti-religious campaign led under him was criticized. The same anti-religious periodicals that had participated in the campaign criticized the articles of past contributors.

The anti-religious propaganda in those years was criticized for failing to understand that causes of religious of belief as well as similarly failing to understand that religion did not simply survive as a legacy of the past but that it continued to attract new people to it. It was criticized for reducing religion to simply a mass of swindling of credulous fools and failing to acknowledge the notion of faith. It was criticized for misrepresenting religious societies as being composed of evil and immoral people who were working against the Soviet Union. It was also criticized for misrepresenting believers as mentally handicapped enemies who were worthy of all contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was criticized for being counter-productive, immoral (by telling lies about believers and encouraging hatred for them thereby) and for being false. The propaganda had not adequately explained why people really practiced religion nor had it given an accurate portrayal of what occurred. Many criticized it for having done more harm than good, because rather than eliminating religious belief, it instead simply pushed it underground where the state would have more difficulty trying to control it. The persecution had also attracted popular sympathy for believers, both in the USSR and abroad, as well as to increase interest in religious faith among non-believers.

There were calls that atheism should not be forced down upon people, but rather should be accepted voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 111"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-religious propaganda after Khrushchev employed a more moderate tone.

==Anti-religious propaganda==

The official line that believers’ feelings should not be insulted continued to be widely violated in practice. The antireligious propaganda after Khrushchev was still very much influenced by the policy set down by the 21st CPSU congress in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Chumachenko, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet press began to sound an alarm in 1972 on account of Communist party and [[Komsomol]] members who were not only participating in religious rites, but even initiating them.

The volume of anti-religious literature grew in the 1970s, partly due to a hardening general line towards religion formed as a result of more people turning to religion. The press and special conferences complained about the insufficiency of atheistic propaganda. The anti-religious education in the school system was accused of laxity.

Faculties and departments were created for training atheist lecturers in the regions of Moscow, Leningrad, Lipetsk, Gorky and in the [[Tatar ASSR]]; permanent seminars existed for the same purpose in Ukraine, Moldavia and Lithuania. All of the state work, however, was found insufficient to counter the influence of religion, especially among youth, who were believed to be finding the atheistic material unconvincing and of low quality. In some areas, such as Uzbekistan, the quality of the propaganda allegedly declined. The establishment was troubled by the growing indifference and apathy among the youth for atheism as well as anti-religious propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orthodox Church|The church]] was seen as an increasing threat, especially with regard to its historic claims of developing the Russian nation. At the same time, the anti-religious propaganda came to increasingly distinguish between the supposed loyal majority of believers and the enemies of the state who occupied the fringes of religion.

The atheistic journal 'Problems of Scientific Atheism' (Voprosy nauchnogo ateizma) in the late 1970s began to question the explanation that the perseverance of religious beliefs in the USSR was simply a survival of the pre-revolutionary past. This was because the vast majority of believers were born and raised after the October revolution, as well as the fact that religion had showed surprising vitality despite the decades of efforts to stamp it out. The number of believers who were well-educated Soviet citizens (rather than uneducated and backward) was also a challenge for old theories of religion being a result of intellectual ignorance. The journal criticized the old Marxist notion that religion would die away with the disappearance of a class society.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 122"/&gt;

In the post-Khrushchev years, the leading anti-religious periodical ‘Science and Religion’ adopted a new approach wherein it adopted a dialogue with believers by printing portions of letters to the periodical and then responding to them. Typically the periodical preferred to print believers’ letters that contained assertions that were easier to argue against. For example, a believer might write a letter that argued God must have existed [[Appeal to majority|because many people believed in Him and they couldn’t all have been wrong]], and the periodical would then respond by noting that there were many cases in history wherein many people believed something that was discovered to be false, such as a flat Earth or even the pagan religions that came before Christianity.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 110"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among justifications used for not printing everything believers’ wrote included the argument that believers would not print atheist material in their publications, that by doing so it would help disseminate religious propaganda and also because believers wrote things that bordered on criticism of the state. The publications that believers were permitted to print were limited to be far smaller in circulation than the atheistic propaganda, and the material that was permitted to be printed by believers was also often dictated by the state.

The atheistic side possessed almost a monopoly on the media and it had relative impunity to tell lies, which believers were not permitted to expose.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 111"/&gt;

There continued to be criticisms of the mass of anti-religious propagandists employed by the USSR for being uneducated about religion and failing to produce effective arguments that convinced believers. However, the volume and quality of more serious critical studies of theology, church history and believers greatly increased after Khrushchev, although it retained much bias. Primitive clichés, insults and name-calling that had been regurgitated over and over again for decades continued to be the main method of anti-religious propaganda. A critical problem with the more serious studies was that by doing serious critiques of religion, this could be interpreted as admitting religion's respectability, which was not a view that the Ideological Commission of the CPSU Central Committee was willing to tolerate.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 111"/&gt;

There was a Marxist hypothesis that prehistoric primitive humans possessed no religion that was advocated as truth. The atheist propaganda argued that people turned to religion as a result of some tragedy in life, loneliness or lack of compassion from others.

The anti-religious propaganda was fond of depicting kind, compassionate and good atheists, while contrasting them with believers who were depicted as fanatical, intolerant and heartless (e.g. for breaking up marriages when one partner was a non-believer). They were blamed for counterfeiting miracles and promoting anti-Sovietism. The teachings of Christianity were partly blamed for this by allegations that their teaching of humility deprived people of courage and freedom.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 112"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, a female Christian writing to propagandist Osipov claimed that there was more intolerance and drinking than in previous years, and she blamed the state for provoking this.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 112"/&gt;

A growing interest among the Russian population in its national culture and history, including iconography and religious art, growing nationalism coupled with renewed interest in Orthodoxy as "Russia's church",&lt;ref name="wallace"&gt;Daniel.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of conversions to Christianity that began with interests in these topics, prompted the Soviet media to argue that culture and religion were not linked, and that religion had bastardized Russian art and culture. The media further argued that the religious art of previous ages (including the work of Andrei Rublev or Theopanes the Greek) was simply expressing humanistic and secular concepts through the only way that such things were permitted to be depicted.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 112"/&gt; ‘Science and Religion’ printed pictures of religious artwork which they interpreted according to secular values.

The atheist press also criticized museum guides in religious buildings that had been converted to museums, for giving uncritical theological dimensions to what they presented, such as explaining the theology of icons and their function in the Orthodox church, explaining the theological symbolism of the liturgy, the purpose of monastic life and for uncritically explaining the lives of the saints. The press called on them to explain ‘the class character’ of religion and give secular explanations of religious art and that they should emphasize the negative aspects of church history and not the positive.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 114"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the atheist press often published stories about episodes in Russian history that portrayed believers and the Church in a negative light in order to emphasize the point that Christian morals are deficient and that the Church is immoral.

Scientific means were used to support atheism by placing holy water under a microscope and determining it to be identical to normal water, the corpses of saints were exhumed to show that they did in fact experience deterioration, while exhibits at atheist museums showed Noah's ark to be impossible even in concept due to the fact that the number of different animal species on the earth could not fit within the dimensions in Genesis.&lt;ref name="froese2004"&gt;Froese (2004), pp. 35-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The press avoided attacking the Church establishment, but directed the blunt of its attacks against actively evangelizing believers and on banned religions.

The anti-religious propaganda tried to depict a connection between religious dissent and foreign intelligence services as well as with anti-communist Russian émigré organizations such as NTS. Caches of religious literature confiscated by Soviet customs officials reportedly were subversive and were alleged to be widely accepted among believers. Marxist ideology held that religion was intrinsically hostile to communism, and therefore believers could not be trusted to be sensitive to the ideological threat posed from the West. They even may have felt affinities for the West, and cooperation between the Vatican or other western Christian establishments with the CIA, or the radio messages by Orthodox priests broadcast through Voice of America, also influenced the interpretation to see believers as untrustworthy. Believers were in this manner depicted as the ‘weak link’ in the Soviet defense line.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 116"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-religious propaganda cited cases of conflicts in schools involving religion, which were always blamed on the believers for continuing to hold on to religion (e.g. a schoolchild who committed suicide due to the labeling and contempt against him as a believer in the education system, and the press blamed this on his parents and priest for fostering religion in him, thus incurring the contempt). It also claimed that believers made poorer students and were less successful in academic pursuits than atheists.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 119"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors at theological schools, and all clergy as well as laity working for the Department of External Ecclesiastical Relations of the Church were taxed similarly to all Soviet employees in recognition of their contribution to a positive Soviet image abroad.

P. Kurochkin, one of the leading Soviet religiologists, argued that eliminating religion should be accompanied by a replacement with communist morality, otherwise the deprival of religion will simply be replaced with moral decline, consumerism and lechery.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 113"/&gt;

==Revived interest in religion==

Furov, the CRA, vice-chairman wrote a report ca. 1975 (smuggled to the west 1979&lt;ref name="altnurme"&gt;Altnurme (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) wherein he claimed the existence of ‘irrefutable evidence’ of a decline in religion in the USSR. His evidence was a decrease in Orthodox clergy from 8252 in 1961 to 5994 in 1974 (he did not cite the pre-Khruschev figure of 30,000 in 1958). In his conclusion that this was a natural decline he did not take account for the masses of priests who were de-registered, imprisoned, executed, etc. The CRA had also during this period prevented more clergy from being registered or enrolling at seminaries.&lt;ref name="anderson1991"&gt;Anderson (1991), pp. 689-710.&lt;/ref&gt; Furov's report provided a great deal of information about the church.&lt;ref name="altnurme"/&gt; He cited cases of people prevented from attending theological institutes including people who would have been greatly embarrassing to the state had they become clergy (e.g. children of highly placed Soviet leaders).&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 166"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; With the slow erosion of the Church's institutional strength, the extinction of the Church as an institution seemed possible.&lt;ref name="davisxvii"&gt;Davis, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 4% of parents attended church in 1970 and many of them did not bring their children with them.&lt;ref name="froese2004"/&gt;

There were rumours in the late 1970s that a comprehensive scientific study was done by Pisarov that blatantly contradicted the official figures of people abandoning religion, but was never published for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Soviet youth turned to religion,&lt;ref name="tchepournaya"&gt;Tchepournaya (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and concern was expressed over this attraction, which was believed by Soviet authorities to be caused by the art, architecture and music of the Church, as well as that the church's separation from political and material power by the state had removed previously negative associations with religion. This view held that the youth saw the church as preserving a cultural-historical role that had been now purified from its ugly past.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long period the Soviet press refused to report on this growth of religion among the youth and claims of it occurring were brushed aside as false. Readers’ letters to atheist journals that stressed the reader's concern over this growth contradicted these claims. In the 1970s a special irregular publication called ‘The World of Man’ issued by the Komsomol monthly ‘The Young Guard’ (Molodaia guardiia) was created as an answer to this threat. In this journal, religion was compared with Nazism by stressing the religious components of Nazism, and it re-interpreted Russian history through distortions such as claiming that Pushkin was an atheist and claiming such things as that Gogol's mind was harmed by religious influence. It answered letters from young Komsomol who stated things like that they didn’t think there was any harm in their Komsomol friends getting married in a church, and in response the publication decried the influence of religion penetrating the lives of Soviet youth. This propaganda alleged that the growing interest among youth was a plan of Western ideological subversion, Western broadcasts and Western religious organizations that smuggled religious literature into the USSR.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 117"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the June 1983 CPSU Central Committee Plenum, General Secretary KU Chernenko declared that the West was trying to cultivate religiosity in the USSR as a method of subversion.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 117"/&gt;

A notable example of some of the press campaign directed in response to this phenomenon was the story of Sasha Karpov published in ‘Science and Religion’. The story was designed to show that young educated Soviets who became religious were hypocrites looking for fame and distinction in originality in society, without possessing any qualities that would give them the same prestige in normal Soviet life.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Sasha's mother was described as a biology teacher at a rural school, who was cold and had no warmth or interest in her children. Sasha's divorced father was an alcoholic who also did not care for his children. After Sasha's mother retired from teaching she retired to a village with a functioning Orthodox church and became a pious laywoman, telling her children that she had always been a believer, but just never didn’t mention it (‘Science and Religion’ failed to mention that she would have lost her teaching job if she had mentioned it). Sasha, left on his own, then decides he wants to prove himself and he attempts singing, writing poetry, and studying to become a teacher. His artistic skill proves to be poor and the latter career frightens him with its hard work and modest life, and so he instead becomes a singing hippy. He comes across a priest eventually who hires him as a church reader and singer. Six months later he then leaves the priest, but not before he gets the priest's list of acquaintances in Moscow. One of such acquaintances he travels to, and finds a couple of young physicists (husband and wife) with an apartment full of icons and Russian artifacts. They like Sasha and consider him a seeker of Truth, and he adopts their religious habits (e.g. Crossing themselves facing the icons, praying before meals, etc.) Eventually he decides to join a monastery where he is told his voice and musical talent will let him do choral singing as his monastic duty. The article stressed that Sasha wore his cassock whenever he went to visit friends and relatives in Moscow in order to shock and impress them, and that everything in life is turned into a fraud through such choices.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 119"/&gt;

Young people, especially if they were educated, were actively persecuted for practicing religion, and especially if they did so openly, or participated in Christian study groups or choirs. People who were part of such groups could be arrested and even placed in [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|"psychiatric prisons"]].&lt;ref name="tchepournaya"/&gt; Placing the religious youth in psychiatric hospitals was based on the principle that any person who had gone through the atheistic education from kindergarten to university and yet remained religious (or even worse, if he converted), could be considered to have a kind of psychological disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th Komsomol congress in 1982 ordered all local committees 'to perfect that atheistic upbringing of the young generation, to profoundly expose the anti-scientific essence of religious ideology and morals'. It also called for a 'fuller use of the cinema, the theatre, institutions of culture and libraries for the scientific-atheistic propaganda' and to 'improve individual atheistic work with children and teenagers, especially with those stemming from religious families; recruit young teachers, pioneer and Komsomol workers for this work... Educate militant atheists, form active atheistic public opinion, do no leave without an exacting reprimand every case of the Komsomol members' participation in religious rites'.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official journals in 1982 raised more alarm about growing apathy towards Marxism and ideology among Soviet youth. This was blamed on 'bourgeois philosophers' who charged the Marxist–Leninist ideology with responsibility for bad science, and who blamed the state for violating freedom of research and academic autonomy.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 124"&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal 'Voprosy filisofi' on the sixtieth anniversary of Lenin's 1922 article 'On the Importance of Militant Materialism' even claimed that the state's antireligious struggle was still quite weak and needed improvement.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 124"/&gt;

The state's allowance of expansions to existing seminaries bore fruit, and by the early 1980s, the student population at these institutions had grown to 2300 day and extramural students (it had been 800 in 1964).&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet Statistics from the late 1960s claimed that more people were leaving the Orthodox Church to join other sects than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; There were Orthodox Christians who also formed independent communities that were separated from the official hierarchy.&lt;ref name="tchepournaya"/&gt;

==Illegal religions==

Several religions had been completely outlawed and practicing members of them could be arrested if caught. These included Eastern Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Russian Jehovists, Buddhists (Buriats and Kalmuks were permitted to be Buddhists but no one else), Pentecostals and the unofficial or ‘Initiative’ Baptists (Baptists who had broken from the Baptist community in 1962 because they did not accept state control of their church).  Any religion that was not registered with the Soviet government was automatically considered illegal and the state could pursue a policy of open persecution of these groups (for other religions it was a hidden policy using other guises). Lack of registration resulted both from the Soviet government refusing to register certain groups and also as a result of certain groups refusing to be registered as well as to then accept some degree of Communist influence through registration.

The Soviet government had an official policy that the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] would not be persecuted if they registered with the state. At the same time Soviet propaganda constantly maligned the group as a subversive organization. A large amount of space in the anti-religious press was devoted to attacking Jehovah's Witnesses and Jehovists during the course of 1983-1985, which suggests growth in the movement in these years. At least fifteen of their activists were arrested in 1984, of which seven received prison sentences.

The Russian Jehovists were a sect similar to the Jehovah's Witnesses, founded by Russian artillery Captain, NS Il’insky in the 19th century. It was characterized by its radical condemnation of all state power as the kingdom of Satan, which was a message that attracted many people in the USSR, leading to the growth in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early history of the state, Buddhist communities had tried to reform their religion in the face of Communism. Prominent Buddhists proclaimed that Buddha lived in Lenin, and that Buddha in Lenin had founded Communism.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt;
After Khrushchev, Buddhists were subjected to a wave of attacks after some Eastern bloc intellectuals converted to Buddhism. In 1972 a leading Buddhist and Tibetan scholar in the USSR, [[Bidia Dandaron]], was arrested and sentenced to five years’ hard labour. He was a secret Buddhist monk, lama and teacher and was hated by the regime for converting a number of intellectuals to Buddhism. He was charged in the press for supposedly organizing drunken orgies under the guise of religious meetings, taking bribes, cultivating adoration of himself and corrupting youth. Several of his associates and students were arrested with him. Dandaron had already spent almost twenty years in prison under Stalin, and most of the charges were thrown out in court, however, he was still given his sentence of five years. The judge at his trial claimed "If it were in my power I would send all religious believers to Kolyma". Four of his students who were active research scholars and teachers were sent to psychiatric institutions and eight other students of his lost their employment.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 156"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu groups in Kranoiarsk in Siberia were disbanded in 1981–1982, and their leader, E. Tretiakov, was sent to prison for ‘parasitism’.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 156"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramet, pp. 261–265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Soviet intellectuals found their way to Christianity by first experimenting with Eastern religions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

One of the leaders of the unofficial Baptists had a campaign of character assassination against him in the press after a supposed adulterous love affair he had in Siberia, which also played upon the conclusion that the underground Baptists as a whole were immoral lechers (the press never mentioned the reason why he was in Siberia, however; he was in an administrative exile).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Persecution was stepped up in the 1970s against the Initiative Baptists. The official Baptist church was treated comparatively well, with allowance of genuine debates in its congresses, and allowance to vote against decisions or candidates promoted by the state (even succeeding once in electing their own candidate instead). The official baptists were allowed to open many new churches (exceeding per capita numbers for the Orthodox). This preferential treatment was designed to strike at the baptists who had broken off in order to give them the message that there was no point in remaining in opposition.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 113"/&gt;

The Initiative Baptists had a position that they would accept state registration but only if it did not involve control of their religion. The Soviet government refused to accept these terms, and the group was persecuted. Initiative Baptists who tried to give religious instruction to children or organize youth groups were arrested. Eugene Pushkov, an initiative Baptist, was arrested for these and other reason in 1980, and after his release in 1983, he was asked to cooperate with the KGB as an informer, but he refused, which led to his re-arrest shortly thereafter and a sentence of four years, which he appealed, and after hearing his appeal, he was given an eight-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Baptists were arrested under charges of breaking the laws against performance of religious activities outside of officially recognized church structures. 202 baptists were arrested for this reason in mid-1967, of which 190 were sentenced to imprisonment. The number of initiative Baptists in the camps went from 79 in 1979, to 120 in 1981, to 165 in 1982 and to over 200 in 1984. Many of the buildings they used for prayers were destroyed. In one instance, in Chervotsy in the western Ukraine, a huge tent was raised by Initiative Baptists, which was visited by the militia. The militia forbade people to come to the tent, stating that there were land mines placed in the tent, and the tent was soon after destroyed.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 161"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malicious sadism was present in some of these closures for the Initiative Baptists as it was also present for closures for other religions. For example, in the city of Issyk in Alma-Ata province, the local government suggested to the local initiative Baptist group in 1974 that they should build a permanent house of worship, the community happily did this. In 1976, the authorities then ordered the believers to wreck the building they had constructed, which they refused to do. The state then took the opportunity to arrest the minister for breaking the law and then confiscated the building.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 161"/&gt;

The Baptists ran an illegal press called the ''Khristianin Publishers''. One of their presses was found by KGB near Riga in October 1974 and those who ran it were sentenced to long terms of hard labour. Their underground publishing continued, however, and they boasted of having published nearly half a million Gospels in ten years.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 184"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifty of their members were imprisoned in 1981, and seventy-three in 1982. A total of 165 of their members were in prison and camps by the end of 1982.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 184"/&gt;

The Baptists ran illegal children and youth camps for many years. The state made great efforts at trying to eliminate religious instruction to minors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

George Vins, the former Council Secretary of the Initiative Baptists was imprisoned and expelled to the United States in 1979. After he left, it was alleged that he was sending instructions from the USA back through the USSR to protest Soviet legislation. P. Rumachik, another Initiative Baptist leader, was released from prison in 1977, and was alleged to have been caught by the KGB in 1980 for running clandestine printing shops. The Initiative Baptists ran underground printing presses, which greatly irritated the state. Rumachik was linked with Vins, and sentenced to five years’ hard labour. This affair was further linked to an Initiative Baptist pastor named Dimitry Miniakov who was arrested in 1978 for supposed collaboration with the Germans in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentecostals had merged with the Baptists in 1945, but when the split in the Baptists occurred in 1961-62, many Pentecostals left the official church and did not join the initiative Baptists. They became more prominent in the 1960s and 1970s, and in some areas they successfully achieved registration with the CRA, but about half of their community refused to register because of their refusal to accept Soviet bans on spreading religion to youth or children, bans on prayer meetings, as well as bans on preaching, missionary and charity work as well the practice of their key religious rites. The renegades suffered fines and arrests for breaking these rules, and they were also persecuted for refusing to take part in the Soviet military except in engineering or medical corps. They were subject to many raids and their religious literature was confiscated. In 1971 there was an incident in Chernogorsk where they were dispersed with a firehose. A number of people of German background belonged to this sect, and some of them attempted to emigrate, but were persecuted for attempting to do so. A group of such Pentecostal were tried in April 1985 for going on a hunger strike until they were allowed entry to West Germany, and their leader was sentenced to five years in a labour camp.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extremist religious group broken off from the Ukrainian Rite Catholics called Pukutnyky had appeared in the mid-1950s and was illegal. It was attacked in the press for supposedly counterfeiting signs from God that declared the end of the world, as well as for terrorizing people who left their sect by burning their houses.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 114"/&gt;

Eastern Rite Catholics (Uniates) had been outlawed in the USSR since 1946.&lt;ref name="altnurme"/&gt; After they were made illegal at that time, seven of their bishops and two thousand of their priests who refused to discontinue their tradition were sent to concentration camps or imprisoned. These churches continued to exist underground up to the fall of the Soviet Union. The state was officially opposed to these groups because of their strong association with nationalist identities. The state mercilessly persecuted them, and constantly raided their places of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Many eastern-rite catholic clergy were released in the 1950s following Stalin's death. Problems with regard to strong resistance to the state on account national identification with religion were found among Muslims in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1994), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="froese2005"&gt;Froese (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 at the Fifth Congress of the Seventh Day Adventists in Russia, the leaders of the Adventist community declared Lenin's socialism a blessing and that Lenin was a leader chosen by God; they also proclaimed their full support and dedication to Marxism. After this congress, there was a significant split in the Adventist community when a portion of the community formed what was called the ‘True and Free’ Adventists. This breakdown was further amplified in 1928 at their congress when the leaders of the official Adventists declared it the duty of Adventists to serve in the Red Army and to bear arms. The breakaway group became subject to continual and vicious persecutions down to the fall of communism. Its leader, VA Shelkov served three sentences in prisons totally 23 years prior to his fourth and final sentence in 1979 during, which imprisonment he died. Shelkov was an excellent organizer of his underground community, and the sect continued to survive as well as to print bibles or other religious tracts, despite constant raids and imprisonments. A wave of arrests of this group occurred in 1978–1979, when the authorities unsuccessfully conducted a national search to find their printing press. The community did not have any religious buildings, but gathered in private quarters for prayers on Saturdays, which allowed this sect to keep itself hidden more easily.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muslims==

Soviet scholars estimated that 10 to 25% of the traditional Muslim minority in the USSR were still active believers, but this was contradicted by Western observers and Soviet Islamic leaders who claimed that almost all of the traditional Muslim minority were active believers.&lt;ref name="derwinski"&gt;Derwinski.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 an investigation into mosque attendance in the [[Kazakh SSR]] revealed that 10% of worshippers were Komsomol members.&lt;ref name="froese2005"/&gt; A further study in 1985 found that 14 percent of the Uzbek Communist Party and 56 percent of the Tajik Communist Party were believing Muslims.&lt;ref name="froese2005"/&gt;

A considerable amount of reconciliation existed between Muslims in the USSR and the state.&lt;ref name="froese2005"/&gt; There was support for the Soviet system in the Muslim community for adopting laws dictated by Allah through Muhammad, even though the government were atheists.&lt;ref name="froese2005"/&gt;

Circumcisions, like Christian baptisms, were often done in secret.&lt;ref name="froese2005"/&gt;

Sufi groups had been outlawed, and the state organized 4 bodies to oversee Islamic activities in the USSR. Three of these were for Sunni Muslims (based in Makhachkala, Tashkent and Ufa) and the fourth was for Shi'ite Muslims (based in Baku). These bodies reported directly to the CRA. A Madrasah in Bukhara as well as an Islamic Institute in Tashkent were permitted to exist and trained Islamic clergy. In great contrast to other faiths in the USSR, the Muslim clergy could leave the country in order to receive training.&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt;

An example of Soviet perspective on Islam is what is written in a Soviet grammar book that had the following answers to a series of questions on Islamic practices:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Q: What does the Mullah do?

A: The Mullah reads the Qur'an and when someone dies he reads prayers.

Q: What does he read about in the Qur'an?

A: We do not know.

Q: Does he himself understand what he reads?

A: No.

Q: Does he read the prayers for nothing?

A: No, he gets money for this.&lt;ref name="froese2004"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1984 there were 1100 mosques functioning in the country, which fell far below the requirements of the population.&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt;

Like other religions, large amounts of illegal underground activities took place among Muslims who operated underground presses, organized unofficial Islamic communities&lt;ref name="froese2005"/&gt; and pilgrimages to local holy places. The Hajj to Mecca was nearly impossible for most Soviet Muslims, and only a handful (around 60) were officially permitted to go each year and they were tasked beforehand with presenting a positive Soviet image abroad.&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt;

Problems with regard to strong resistance to the state on account national identification with religion were found among Muslims in Central Asia.&lt;ref name="froese2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="anderson1994"&gt;Anderson (1994), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The clear ethnic linkage between Islam and certain ethnic groupings made it difficult for the state to wipe out the religion due to their attacks provoking nationalist feelings among the ethnic groupings.&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt;

The state tried to showcase its (supposedly) positive treatment of Muslims in propaganda campaigns in the third world in order to gain support for Soviet interests. The events of the revolution in Iran in the late 1970s as well as the growing Islamic opposition to the USSR in the war in Afghanistan, led to the USSR launching a new crackdown on Islam in its last decade, with arrests of Muslims who attempted to disseminate religious literature.&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt;

Following the collapse of communism, in many Muslim areas the collapse was celebrated and Muslim leaders tried to educate the population about Islam.&lt;ref name="froese2005"/&gt;

==Orthodox sects==

Old Believer sects (Orthodox who had split from the Orthodox church in the 17th century) were still treated as anti-social and criminal institutions. Many distortions of them still occurred in the official press after Khrushchev. A sect called Skrytniki (concealers) led by Khristofor Zyrianov was accused of engaging in mass suicides through self-immolation in the woods of Northern Russia in the pre-war period. Zyrianov had been suspected of this at the time and was oddly given a brief sentence of administrative exile in 1932 (which may make the allegations to be probably untrue, since if he really did this, he would have been shot).&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 115"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

A novel was published in ‘Science and Religion’ supposedly based on a true story that concerned an Old Believer sect called the ‘True Orthodox Wanderers’. In the story, a young Moscow Komsomol girl comes under the influence of a regular Moscow Orthodox priest who sends her to an underground Siberian skete with a pious woman. There, the girls is taught to do future missionary work and to take secret monastic vows. She is treated to severe fasting, hatred of the world, despotic exploitation, banning of all literature but the bible and some theological tracts, living in a cellar without seeing the sun, absence of smiles or friendliness, and rudeness. This atmosphere was presented as an accurate depiction of life in the Old Believer sects. Eventually the girl is rescued by her Sherlock Holmes-like and heroic Komsomol friends.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 115"/&gt;

Often the official propaganda failed to make a distinction between these sects and the regular Orthodox church. This may have been deliberate in order to tie up the Orthodox with the supposed crimes of the sects.

The Old believers attempted to have many churches reopened, but they were unsuccessful. There was a Samizdat report in 1969 that an Old Believer priest was murdered by the KGB for refusing to work for them.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 152"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholics==

Before the war, Catholic areas in the Ukraine and in Belarus stubbornly defended their faith in the 1930s and the anti-religious institutions complained of the great influence that Catholic priests had over the local people.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Roman Catholics in the USSR lived in areas that had been annexed during World War II, which meant that most of them escaped much of the pre-war persecutions. This meant that the Catholic Church had proportionally more functioning churches and seminaries that could be attacked in the post-war persecutions than the Orthodox church. In Lithuania two of the three seminaries were closed, and the clergy was reduced from 1500 to 735 serving 628 churches.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 152"/&gt;

Organized persecutions developed against the Roman Catholic Church in Lithuania. Priests were harassed and imprisoned for catechesis to children, since this was considered organized religious instruction to minors (banned in 1918). Lithuanian bishops, Steponavichus and Sladkiavichus were exiled. Teachers could be fired for their religious views, and many catholic churches were demolished. The church of St Kazimir was turned into a museum of atheism, the Vilnius cathedral became an art gallery, the church of the Resurrection in Kaunas became a radio-making factory, and the Jesuit Cathedral in Kaunas became a sports hall. The Klaipeda cathedral, which had been built after many years of petitioning in 1961, was closed and confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities in Lithuania, as in other parts of the country, also resisted attempts to reverse Khrushchev's acts against religion. A church in the village of Zhaleyi, which was closed in 1963, was turned into a flour mill in 1978. The local miller, however, refused to work in it, and the mill was forced to be run only four hours a week. Petitioners failed to achieve results when they asked to re-opened.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 154"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state encountered a major problem in its campaign in Lithuania, however, because like in Poland, there was a strong national identification of the Lithuanians with the Roman Catholic Church and the persecutions received national resistance as well as publicity. Thousands of Lithuanians protested the antireligious campaign in their country. A petition of 148,149 signatures was printed as a book that was sent to Brezhnev.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 152-153.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, a petition was signed by 554 of the over 700 Roman Catholic priests in Lithuania, and the state reacted very cautiously by arresting and sentencing only a few priests among the signatories.

Roman Catholicism in the Western Ukraine also put up a strong resistance to Soviet attempts to curtail it.&lt;ref name="anderson1994"/&gt;

A lack of such an atmosphere in Russia in defence of the Orthodox church allowed for the regime to pursue less tolerant positions there.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 152-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas where Catholics were only a small minority such as in Belarus or Moldova, the state found it much easier to attack their community. In Moldova, every catholic church was closed except for a small chapel in Kishinev. The priest in this church was forced to only use German or Polish during the masses, which deprived it of seeking potential converts among the local population. He was also denied permission to visit the rural communities. In the largest of such communities in Rashkovo, the church was wrecked on Christmas Day 1977 by a detachment of militia, and the religious activists who were guarding the church were temporarily arrested.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 154"/&gt;

Roman Catholic Bishops in Lithuania were denied the right to visit the Vatican in 1986 and Pope John Paul II was not allowed to visit Lithuania in 1987 on the 600th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of union between Lithuania and Poland which led to Lithuania's conversion.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jews==

By the 1980s the number of legally authorized synagogues in the Soviet Union had dropped to 50 and rabbinical training had long been stopped.&lt;ref name=bulletin86&gt;Religion in Eastern Europe." Department of State Bulletin 86 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samizdat==

In order to print their own material, believers often used ‘samizdat’ (do-it-yourself press), which became increasingly widespread in the later years of the USSR. Samizdat was illegal publishing of works carried out by religious groups, dissidents, and many others who wanted to avoid the official censors.

For believers this often took the form of some text from the scriptures, prayers or writings of the church fathers, which were handwritten with an attached instruction to make nine more copies and to send these copies to other addressees, or else God would punish them (and those addressees would then copy and send another nine, and so on). The state employed historical revisionism of its history, and therefore accounts of the state's crimes had to be printed in Samizdat.&lt;ref name="haskins"&gt;Haskins (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most popular of samizdat letters contained excerpts from the book of revelations.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 110"/&gt;

These letters were known about by the state (who sometimes even produced fake samizdat that was spread among believers in order to sow distrust among them) and they were viciously attacked by the atheist press, for supposedly containing all sorts of evil anti-soviet and hateful writings, as well as for being used in an inhuman manner (e.g. The journal ‘Science and Religion’ reported many supposed situations where the letters arrived in the middle of a family tragedy wherein they could duplicate the letters but in agony they try to fulfill the instruction out of fear of divine punishment by getting a child to do it, who therefore becomes traumatized by being exposed to religious propaganda).&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 111"/&gt;

Attempts to import religious literature from the West were treated as anti-Soviet subversion. Jehovah's Witness literature was treated likewise.

In April 1982 five young Orthodox Christians were arrested in Moscow for having illegally possessed a Xeroxing machine that they used to print thousands of religious books and brochures, which they allegedly sold for a profit. It was disproved in court that they had made profit from the enterprise, but they were sentenced to 4 and 3 year sentences. Further searches of their associates revealed more caches of religious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 184-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative measures==

Two new decrees issued by the RSFSR Supreme Soviet on 18 March 1966 (219 and 220) assigned penalties of fines for people who organized religious meetings for youth and children or for failing to register a religious community, and also assigned a penalty of imprisonment for people who repeatedly violated this law.&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s most of the human rights movements in the Soviet Union developed under the slogan of defence of Soviet legality and demanded that Soviet officials respect their own laws (since the acts used in the persecutions were often technically illegal under Soviet law). Internal instructions were used as a basis for much of the persecutions, however, and they usually trumped Soviet law in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 the Council for Religious Affairs (CRA) was given an official legal supervision role&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt; over the church (prior to this it had unofficial control).&lt;ref name="anderson1991"/&gt; Every parish was placed at the disposal of the CRA, which alone had the power to grant registration.&lt;ref name="anderson1991"/&gt; It was illegal for a religious community to practice their faith without CRA approval (including public prayers, meeting together, etc.) Until a religious community was registered was the CRA, it could not practice its faith. In order to be registered it needed to submit a petition to the local government which would then send it to the CRA with its own comments and recommendations within a period of no longer than one month. The CRA, however, could take as much time as it chose before it came to the decision of registering a parish. This greatly weakened the church, which earlier had only needed to deal with local government with which it had the power to appeal. The new policy was designed to more greatly strangle the Church. This was accompanied by intimidation, blackmail and threat to the clergy, and as a whole it was meant to demoralize the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

This legislation did, however, strengthen the church by admitting the Church's legal status to build and own secular buildings for residence or administrative use, or for the production of articles necessary for the given religious cult.

The Soviet Constitution of 1977 was sometimes interpreted by authorities as containing a requirement for parents to raise their children as atheists.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; This had been preceded by the new family legislation in 1968 and the laws on national education in 1973. These laws maintained that it was the duty of parents to raise their children as communists and atheists. The family code allowed for courts to deprive parents of their rights over their children if they failed in this task,&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt; and the constitution implied this as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; These legal restrictions were only enforced selectively when the authorities chose to do so.

The 1977 constitution in Article 124 also replaced the terminology 'freedom of antireligious propaganda' (from the old constitution) with the new phrase 'freedom of atheistic propaganda'.&lt;ref&gt;Ramet, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; This was interpreted as a difference between a negative approach of destroying religion and a positive approach of replacing it with an atheistic culture.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 122"&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPSU Central Committee in 1979 called for the implementation of concrete measures for the escalation of atheistic education, and to 'raise the responsibility of communists and Komsomol members in the struggle against religious superstitions'.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as signal to intensify anti-religious propaganda by CP organizations, the mass media, higher and secondary schools, as well as institutions of culture and scientific research.

The Moscow Patriarchate successfully applied pressure in order to get revision of some of the anti-religious legislation. In January 1981, the clergy were requalified in their tax status from being taxed as a private commercial enterprise (as they were before) to being taxed as equal to that of medical private practice or private educators. This new legislation also gave the clergy equal property and inheritance rights as well as the privileges that were granted to citizens if they were war veterans. The parish lay organization of 20 persons who owned the parish was granted the status of a legal person with its appropriate rights and the ability to make contracts (the church had been deprived of this status by Lenin in 1918). For the first time in many years, religious societies could legally own their houses of worship. There was still some ambiguity left in this legislation, however, which allowed room for re-interpretation if the state wished to halt 'uncontrolled' dissemination of building new churches.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CC issued another resolution in 1983 that promised for ideological work against religion to be the top priority of party committees on all level.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 125"&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious societies were given control over their own bank accounts in 1985.

This legislation in the 1980s marked a new attitude of acceptance towards religion by a state that decided that best it could do was simply to minimize the harmful impact of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; While the state tried to intensify persecution during the 1980s, the church came to see this increasingly as merely rearguard attacks by an ideologically bankrupt, but still physically powerful, enemy,. The top party leaders refrained from direct involvement in the new offensive, perhaps due to an uncertainty over their potential success and a desire to have some manoeuvrabality according to a desire to avoid antagonizing believers too much on the eve of the millennial anniversary of Russia's conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 125"/&gt;

Religious bodies could still be heavily infiltrated by state agents, due to the power of local governments to reject elected parish officials and install their own people in the lay organization that owned the parish, which meant that even if they had ownership over their churches, it was still effectively in the state's hands. The largest gain of this new legislation, however, was that children of ten years of age and over could actively participate in religious ritual (e.g. service as acolytes, psalmists, in choirs) and that children of any age could be present inside a church during services as well as receive communion.

==Psychiatric abuse==

Soviet psychiatric practice considered that highly educated people who became religious believers at a mature age, especially if they came from atheist families, suffered from a psychotic disorder. This diagnosis was especially used for monks or nuns as well as for well-educated preachers. This practice allowed for popular monks and nuns (or other believers) who otherwise could not be plausibly charged with any other crime, to be removed and sent to psychiatric facilities.&lt;ref name=bulletin86/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramet, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="regels.org"&gt;[http://www.regels.org/humanright.htm Letters from Moscow], Gleb Yakunin and Lev Regelson.&lt;/ref&gt; Since their faith was considered to be a mental disorder, people who were given this treatment were given immediate release if they renounced their faith in God and therefore had become "cured".&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt;

Particular cases of this that are known include:

The religious nationalist [[:ru:Шиманов, Геннадий Михайлович|Gennady Shimanov]] was interred for two and half months in 1962 in a psychiatric hospital that administered insulin shock therapy to cure him of his religious belief. He was interred again in 1969 for a few weeks after which he was released as a result of public attention of his incarceration.&lt;ref name="suslov"&gt;Suslov (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr Iosif Mikhailov of Ufa who was sent to the [[Kazan]] psycho-prison in 1972 and remained there for up to at least the last years of communism.

Valeria (Makeev), a nun at the same facility from 1978 up to at least the last years of communism. She was initially accused of black-marketing (for selling religious articles to believers), but when the case for this failed to materialize, she was instead diagnosed as psychotic.

Fr Lev Konin was sent to psycho-prison several times before he was expelled to the West in 1979. He had contacts with Leningrad students and had spoken at an unofficial religio-philosophic seminar of young Soviet intellectuals in Leningrad.

Yurii Belov, a student of history and literature, was sent to the Sychevcka psycho-prison and was told in 1974 by a representative of the central Moscow Serbsky Institute of Forensic Medicine: ‘In our view religious convictions are a form of pathology, hence our use of drugs’.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 33-year-old doctor, Olga Skrebets with a PhD in medical sciences, was diagnosed with an early stage of [[schizophrenia]] and sent to a hospital in Kiev in 1971 after she had withdrawn from CPSU membership for religious reason.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 180"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 44-year-old Baptist, Alexander Yankovich, had engaged in unofficial writing and duplication of religious literature from 1957 to 1976. In 1976 he was arrested and declared insane.

Evgenii Martynov, a thirty-five-year-old Pentecostal civil engineer was sent to the Cherniakhovski psycho-prison in 1978.

Vasilii Shipilov, an Orthodox layman, was sentenced to ten years’ hard labour in 1939 at the age of 17 for being a student at an underground seminary. In 1949, after his release, he roamed Siberia and proclaimed the Kingdom of God as well as criticized Stalin's abuses. He was soon rearrested and declared insane. He spent most of the period between 1950-1979 in psycho-prisons, where he was subject to constant beatings and mockery of his religion.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 180"/&gt;

A twenty-year-old history student named Galliamov was baptized when he was eighteen and had spent the summer of 1978 as a pilgrim at the few remaining monasteries. He was diagnosed a ‘psychopath of mixed type’ and subjected to high doses of neuroleptics, causing him nausea, high fever and heart attacks. He was released after two months and warned by the doctor to stop visiting monasteries or else his condition might evolve into schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 180-181"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 180-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most blatant of such cases occurred in 1976 to 25-year-old Moscow intellectual, Alexander Argentov, a neophyte Orthodox Christian from an atheistic family. He had founded the Moscow-based religio-philosophic seminar in 1974, headed by Alexander Ogorodnikov (a graduate student of cinematography that was expelled from the institute along with others for trying to produce a film about religious life among Soviet youth). This seminar declared itself the successor of the religio-philosophic societies of Moscow and Leningrad that had been dispersed in the 1920s. The seminar began to be harassed in earnest in 1976 after it had grown considerably and shown much vitality, as well as established itself in Ufa (Bashkiria), Leningrad, L’vov (Ukraine), Minsk and Grodno (Belarus). Argentov and others were arrested and locked up in psychiatric institutions. Argentov's religious belief was diagnosed as a psychotic disorder.&lt;ref name="suslov"/&gt; Powerful neuroleptics were administered to him for two months before he was released after wide publicity and protests of his case which reached outside the USSR.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 180-181"/&gt;

==Activities==

There were no radical revisions of official state policies after Khrushchev (much of his campaign was carried out under secret unpublished instructions anyway). Most of the closed churches would remain closed and none of the closed seminaries or monasteries would be reopened. Believers tried unsuccessfully to reopen many churches. In the late 1970s and into the 1980s the state did begin to allow more churches to be built and reopened.

Those convinced of religious crimes in the Soviet Union were given especially harsh treatments and were classed (along with political dissidents) as "especially dangerous state criminals", which disqualified them from amnesty or leniency. Religious crimes such as circulating a petition or organizing religious classes for children could be punished with strict terms in concentration camps (assault, robbery and rape had lesser sentences in the USSR) and could not be considered for parole without a formal confession.&lt;ref name="derwinski"/&gt;

In the entire region of Sakha-Yakutia (about half the size of the continental United States) there was only one functioning church left open after Khrushchev until the fall of communism, which meant that many believers needed to travel up to 2000 kilometres in order to get the nearest church.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are examples of situations known to history of these activities. In the city of Chernigov, the cathedral was closed in 1973 and only a small wooden church remained. The believers had been petitioning for a new church since 1963, but never received anything until the fall of communism. In the city of Gorky, there were only three small churches remaining to serve an estimated population of 100,000 believers&lt;ref name="anderson1991"/&gt; (out of 40 pre-1917, when the population of Gorky was 1/15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; what it was in the 1970s). The believers had been petitioning for some churches to reopened since 1967, and the petitioners were subject to professional demotions, and their demands were ignored. In the town of Naro Fominsk in the Moscow Province petitions began in 1968 to open a church. There had been no church in the vicinity of the town since the 1930s. Their petitions were ignored and given negative replies. The local atheist press claimed that no new church could be given since the existing church was going to be transformed into a museum and the press claimed there were not enough practicing Christians in the city to merit it (there were in fact 1443 signatories to the petition). The atheist press also claimed that this petition was being issued by evil people who were trying to heat up religious fanaticism and gain a cushy job at a new church. The believers presented their case in court, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notorious church closure occurred in 1968 in the rural town of Kolyvan in the vicinity of Novosibirsk. The church of Alexander Nevsky in that town was built in the 18th century and was one of the oldest architectural monuments in the region. The local CRA plenipotentiary, Nikolaev, had been boasting for years that he would turn the church into a museum. The local fire department requested that a special water reservoir should be built next to the church to protect it from fire, and the church council complied with this request, by digging the reservoir. Shortly afterwards, the local militia declared this to be an illegal construction and confiscated the building materials from the church council so that they could not complete building the reservoir. Then the Soviet government declared the church to be unsafe due to a lack of a water reservoir, and ordered the church to be closed. In 1974, the historic church was dismantled and its pieces were sold. The local community tried to continue having services without a priest in the watchman's house in the church yard, but this was met with harassment and short arrests of the organizers. Nikolaeve eventually agreed to give them a twenty square-metre basement to hold services for their congregation of 200.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 147"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notorious closure occurred in 1979 in the town of Rechitsa in Belarus. The church was too small for the congregation and they requested to enlarge it. They received permission and began to do construction at their own expense. Once they finished the expansion, the building was declared a fire hazard and closed, militia guards were placed in front of it to prevent believers from using it.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 147"/&gt;

An 18th-century church in the village of Mshany in Lvov diocese was closed in March 1978 and turned into grain storage. In 1979, believers surrounded the church and tried to physically prevent grain from being stored in the church. The militia was dispatched to disperse them and one woman was arrested. The believers launched unsuccessful petitions on behalf of the church.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 147"/&gt;

In the village of Znosychy near Rovno in Volhynia, there was a church that had been deprived of a priest for several years, and which had been taken care of by its congregation who also gathered there for prayers. In 1977 the authorities tried to demolish the church but were stopped by resistance from the local community, and instead they tried to store grain inside the church. In response, the local village went on strike, and the authorities decided to remove the grain. On 25 April 1979 the entire population of Znosychy was ordered to work in an adjacent village, while the children were locked up in school, and during this time the church was demolished. Afterwards, believers began to gather at the site of the former church for prayers and pilgrims would come to the village. The authorities responded by putting up patrols and barriers around the village to prevent visitors. The believers also began to decorate pine trees around the church and pray under them. The authorities responded by cutting down the trees.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two other villages in Rovno, the local population tried to reopen churches closed under Khrushchev. In one of these in 1973, while the believers were at work, the authorities dismantled the domes and stored grain in the church. The population protested furiously and the grain was removed. In 1978, after years of complaints, an official commission arrived to investigate, but they were told that believers were a tiny minority in the area by the local authorities and the commission left. In the other village, in 1973 the believers made vain appeals to re-open their churches, but they were told in reply to go to another town for services. In the autumn of 1978, a CRA representative came and promised to give them their church back, and in the meantime the local authorities asked the villagers to sign a pledge not to let their pigs roam the village streets. The villagers signed the document without reading it, and it turned out to be pledge that no one wanted a church in the village. The document was then used by the district authorities to justify their refusal to accept any more pleas to reopen the church.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many more examples beyond these exist.

In 1983 at least over 300 of all religions were in some sort of imprisonment solely for practicing their faith. Other estimates are far higher and this figure does not include the masses of believers who were subject to administrative harassment and persecutions from day to day. These figures of course are little in comparison, however, with what occurred earlier in the USSR's history.

These persecutions could result from acts of charity (which were still illegal according to the 1929 legislation). Such illegal acts of charity could include bishops who secretly gave money to poorer parishes that could not pay for their repairs, clergy and parish staff who gave money to poor parishioners, giving money to parishioners who suffered loss of homes from fires, or believers giving public dinners to people, including pilgrims.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 164"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

They could result from group pilgrimages to holy places (which was also still illegal). These pilgrimages were subjected to very brutal attacks by militia and Komsomol voluntary aides leading to physical injuries and the state claimed that they were organized by either fanatic believers or opportunists trying to make income.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 164"/&gt;

Persecutions could also result from either worship or performance of religious rites in private dwellings, or doing it in churches without reporting them to the state. There was official pressure against people getting baptism and there were often practical difficulties of obtaining a baptism in areas without churches.&lt;ref name=lane44&gt;Lane, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Few couples had traditional Christian marriage ceremonies.&lt;ref name=lane44/&gt; Religious rites were sometimes done secretly in order to protect believers from harassment at work or in school, since the record books that churches had to keep were regularly inspected by the KGB.  The state reported that such activities were done by priests who were trying to earn extra income from unrecorded donations. This paradigm was cited by Feodosii, the former bishop of Poltava in his 1977 letter to Brezhnev where he stated that most adults who converted to Orthodoxy went to retired priests for baptisms, because they could perform baptisms without having to enter the names of the newly baptized into the registry. The provincial CRA official found out about this and demanded that every baptismal candidate be reported, after which CRA agents would attempt to create many problems at the candidate's place of work or study in order to dissuade him from receiving baptism. The Bishop refused to cooperate with this.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Komsomol was still engaged in vandalism of churches and harassment of believers during this period (as it was during the 1930s when it was also criticized for laxity).

Priests and bishops who did not completely subordinate themselves to the state and/or who engaged in religious activities outside of the routine performance of religious rites, were considered to be enemies of the state. Bishops criticized for 'high religious activity' were moved around the country. The Council for Religious Affairs claimed to have gained control of the Patriarch's Synod, which was forced to co-ordinate its sessions and decisions with the CRA.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1987 pg 113"&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread persecution of clergy under Khrushchev was replaced with a more selective persecution of simply the most dedicated priests, especially if they attracted young people, or offered pastoral guidance. The CRA had a policy to appoint priests who were not wanted, and the state continued to find means to shut down churches. At the same time, however, the CRA claimed that the church's position was improving under newly passed legislation.

The church hierarchy could have no disciplinary powers. While the state allowed for freedom of sermons and homilies, this freedom was limited in that they could only be of an 'exclusively religious character' (in practice this meant that clergymen who preached against atheism and the state ideology were not protected).&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt; All of the anti-religious legislation was designed to make the church as passive as possible.&lt;ref name="anderson1991"/&gt; Lukewarm clergy were tolerated while clergy with a missionary zeal could be deregistered.  This was in accordance both with Lenin's teaching that immoral or even criminal priests should be preferred over active and popular ones, and it was also in accordance with a secret 1974 CRA resolution ‘On the State of Supervision over the Activities of the Theological Educational Establishments of the Russian Orthodox Church’ in which it was resolved to study seminary candidates, to take measures to prevent ‘fanatical’ (i.e. actively religious) people from entering seminaries as teachers or students, to elevate the sense of citizenship among teachers and students, as well as to enhance political education for teachers and students so as to give them ‘profound patriotic convictions’.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 166"/&gt;

A massive number of cases could be cited of clergy who were persecuted for being dedicated priests. Examples include:

Vasilii Boiko, a young Kiev priest, lost his position as the choir director at the Virgin Mary Protection church in Kiev for organizing a youth choir, consisting of recent converts and reverts. The choir was disbanded and he was sent as a reader to a provincial church.

Zdriliuk, a young Kiev engineer and convert to Orthodoxy, was privately ordained a priest after passing theological examinations. Three years after his ordination he was de-registered following a police search of his house that revealed a cache of religious literature as well as his distribution of such literature to believers.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 170-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paganism was reported to have re-appeared in areas where the church had been eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 115-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases of less preferential treatment occurred in the cases of believers who had greater educational or professional levels. Party members, administrative personnel of the high and middle executive categories, teachers and professors of all types, army officers and personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and other such people would incur direct persecution for baptizing their children. Often they had to find priests who would agree to do perform the sacrament secretly.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants and workers rarely suffered the same degree of consequences for engaging in religious activities. The uneducated and elderly in the post-Khrushchev years were generally left alone.

Almost no new clerical ordinations were allowed in the Ukraine during this period. There were bans on home-educated candidates as well. Unsuccessful candidates to seminaries anywhere in the country could face all sorts of harassment and persecution.

Archbishop Feodosii reported in his account that he refused to cooperate with the local plenipotentiary when the latter wanted to close churches, and after this he was transferred to the north-Russian diocese of Vologda where there was only 17 open churches. The Archbishop listed a number of direct and indirect persecutions employed by the CRA almost daily. Included among such things were methods like him being attacked for sending priests to replace sick priests during a Sunday liturgy without permission, and temporarily depriving the replacement priest of registration. Attempts to replace structures falling into dilapidation with better ones resulted in the new brick structures being torn down by militia and komsomol. The Bishop was criticized for supporting petitions to Moscow. He also cited CRA pressure to raise peace fund contributions and historical monuments contribution, from 36,210 roubles in 1968 to 161,328 roubles in 1976 (while the diocese only received 124,296 roubles in donation). Parishes had to increase their donations in order to meet this, and eventually the diocese fell into debt. This resulted in more parishes being closed for lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harassment of pilgrims and monasteries increased in the early 1980s.

==Notable atrocities and victims==

Two priests named Nikolai Eshliman and [[Gleb Yakunin]] received worldwide fame after issuing a brave memoranda to the Soviet government and to Patriarch Alexii in 1965, which protested the persecution, the forced closure of churches and the inactivity of the Patriarchs and bishops in defending the church. Shortly afterwards the atheist press conducted a campaign of character assassination. They claimed that Yakunin had become a priest for purely pecuniary reasons. Yakunin and Eshliman had, like many other Christian evangelists in the USSR, attempted to acquire illegal religious publications, including from the west. This fact allowed the state to then brand the men as well laity connected with them as criminals, black-marketeers and even being connected with Western intelligence services (who were allegedly sending religious and theological literature into the USSR for purposes of ideological subversion).&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 116"/&gt;

On 15 November 1966, the church of the Holy Trinity was demolished in Leningrad.

A notable case was reported in Samizdat documents concerning Vladimir Rusak (a.k.a. Vladimir Stepanov), a Russian Orthodox deacon and a graduate of the Moscow Theological Academy who had worked as one of the editors of the Journal of Moscow Patriarchate. In 1980 he complete a manuscript about the history of the Russian church under the Soviet Union, which was critical of the state. His immediate superior, Archbishop Pitirim, discovered this and ordered him to destroy it, but he refused, and he was sent to [[Vitebsk]] in Belarus to serve a church there. On 28 March 1982 he gave a sermon at a Passion service on the Passion of Christ and the suffering of the church in the world, and he claimed that a persecuted Church was spiritually stronger and closer to God than a triumphant Church, and in this context he condemned the post-Constantine legacy of national and state churches, and he praised the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] for having once again raised persecution against the Church, which therefore purified the Church of all but those who were truly dedicated to it. In the same sermon he discussed the persecutions of the state and condemned the hierarchy for disowning the martyrs, to whom he claimed the Church owed its survival. He told the parishioners not to lose heart in the wake of the atheist persecution, and that one should not expect both an easy life on earth and a reward in heaven. After this sermon, he was de-registered and sent to a monastery, and his superiors said they could do nothing to help because of KGB pressure upon them. He was recommended to get a secular job, because there was no longer any position in the church that would be allowed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr Dimitry Dudko was a popular preacher and catechist in Moscow,&lt;ref name="regels.org"/&gt; who prepared hundreds of adults for baptism. He began to hold question-and-answer sessions instead of regular sermons at this church, and this made him very popular among people but very unpopular among the authorities. He was one of the most influential religious dissidents of the time.&lt;ref name="suslov"/&gt; Under their pressure he was forced to be removed in 1973 to the rural parish of Kabanovo, eighty kilometres outside of Moscow. Foreigners who visited his church in Moscow could not go to that area, but many people began flocking to his new church. In December 1975 the local soviet forced the church council to dismiss Fr. Dimitry from this parish, and thereafter he was transferred to another rural parish in the vicinity of Moscow. At that parish he began to create a well-knit church community and published a mimeographed bulletin (the first time this was used in Russia since the 1920s). In his writings and sermons he attacked atheism and blamed it for moral decline and rising alcoholism. In January 1980 he was arrested and within six months he appeared on state TV with a speech of apology wherein he condemned his past behaviour. The state magnanimously forgave him and allowed him to return to his pastoral duties, and much of his previous following deserted him.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr Vasilii Romaniuk of the village of Kosmach in the [[Carpathians]] was criticized for organizing illegal carol-singing youth groups and visiting believers’ homes during Christmas-time. The CRA claimed that he was trying to earn extra money through donations. Four years after this, he was arrested and given 10 years in jail, a labour camp and enforced internal exile for appending his signature on behalf of a Ukrainian nationalist named Valentyn Moroz. He has been sentenced in 1944 to ten years of hard labour in Siberia. He attended pastoral courses and was ordained a deacon in 1959, but the local CROCA plenipotentiary refused to allow him ordination to the priesthood. In 1964, he became a priest, and acquired a good reputation among believers as well as a bad reputation among the authorities, the latter of which harassed him continually. He was forced to change six parishes, before being arrested in 1972 for the aforementioned crime involving Moroz.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr Pavel Adelgeim was arrested in December 1969 in [[Kagan, Uzbekistan|Kagan]] in Uzbekistan where he served as rector of the only local Orthodox church. He was accused of having attracted children and teenagers to the church. He was also accused of being a sadist who beat his wife and the young girls who came to his church. He had produced writings that criticized the legal status of religion in the USSR, criticizing the official ideology, and he had also had contacts with Eshliman and Yakunin. He was sentenced to three years hard labour, and he lost one of his legs during his time in the camp. After his release he became priest in the Uzbek town of Fergana. The previous pastor of the church he came to had been expelled by the parishioners for corruption with parish finances, inappropriate observation of religious rituals and other problems. The CRA, however, thought that this priest should remain and the more popular Fr Pavel was deprived of his registration in order to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 172-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gleb Yakunin]], a famous priest who had gathered information on persecutions that he sent to Western journalists and churches in the West,&lt;ref name="wallace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="regels.org"/&gt; was arrested in 1979 for anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda; he was sentenced to five years in a strict regime labour camp followed by another five years of internal exile. His position on the unofficial committee that was sending these reports was inherited by Fr Vasilii Fonchenkov and Fr Nikolai Gainov, the latter of whom lost his teaching position at the Moscow theological academy and was soon after transferred to a rural parish outside of Moscow, which made his work on the committee impossible. This committee, while organized by Orthodox priests, sent reports on behalf of all Christians in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr Alexandr Pivovarov, a very popular and dedicated Siberian priest, was arrested in 1983 and given a three and a half year sentence for distributing free religious literature, which he had acquired from secret Christian printers who were also arrested and sentenced.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr Pavel (Lysak) was expelled from the Moscow Theological Academy at the Trinity St Sergius Monastery in 1975. He was also deprived of residence rights in Moscow province, where many of his spiritual children lived. Soviet law allowed him to visit Moscow on three-day visits, and he took full advantage of this, but neighbours of the apartment that he lived at in Moscow were intimidated by the KGB to denounce him in such a way that he could be found guilty of breaking the law, and in 1984 he was arrested and sentenced to ten months in a labour camp.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 175"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most appalling cases was reported to have occurred in the summer of 1983 in the Caucasus sixty kilometres outside of Sukhumi where an unregistered monastic community was discovered and dispersed. Eighteen of the monks, however, hid themselves in a narrow cave and continued their community. The authorities brought barrels filled with an incendiary mixture, dumped them at the mouth of the cave and set them on fire, so that the eighteen were burned to death.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 175"/&gt;

Fr Nikolai Ivasiuk, in the city of Chardzhou in Turkmenistan, was found murdered on 17 December 1978. His hair was torn out, his eyes were removed, his body had been burned and there were knife wounds as well as carvings on him. The previous night believers reported having seen a car pull up with six militiamen leaving the car and entering the house. The murderers were not found in any following investigation.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 178"&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vilnius in Lithuania, a very popular Catholic priest named [[Bronius Laurinavičius]] was reportedly thrown by four men onto a thoroughfare where he was killed by an approaching truck. Less than a year later, a lay dissident activist, Valeri Smolkin was told by the KGB to emigrate or else he would share Bronius’ fate.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 178"/&gt;

In October 1981 at the Holy Virgin Protection Convent in Kiev, on the patronal feast day when there were masses of pilgrims, there was a police raid.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 175-176.&lt;/ref&gt; This convent was often subject to such harassment and administrative fines, and police raids often came to capture overnight pilgrims.

The famous [[Pskov Monastery of the Caves]] was successfully infiltrated by the KGB when their informer Gavriil became abbot of the monastery after the death of his predecessor. Gavriil then began throwing out pilgrims, harassing revered monks for giving counsel or hearing confession, and he forbade group prayers. The Patriarch received many complaints about him and ordered his removal, but the Soviet Government rescinded the order and insisted he remain in place. Gavriil in 1983 was reported for having conducted violent beatings of the monks and pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trinity St Sergius Lavra in [[Zagorsk]] had forty of their monks expelled between 1975-1980. These monks were popular among pilgrims as spiritual advisors and confessors, which led to their expulsion.&lt;ref name="Pospielovsky 1988 pg 178"/&gt;

Of all of the monastic communities, however, the [[Pochaev Lavra]] continued to suffer some of the worst persecutions to be reported. The Soviets had granted permits to very few novices to enter this monastery in order to keep down the number of the monks. In 1979 the monastery launched a petition to request the return of the land that had been confiscated under Khruschev, as well as to let it accept more novices. The confiscated land had been turned into a museum of atheism and a polyclinic. The authorities responded to this petition by launching more searches and expulsions of pilgrims as well as the expulsion of ten novices. The highly revered spiritual father Amvrosii was expelled in 1981, and his library, which contained samizdat and religious literature, was investigated by the KGB. This was followed by the arrest of more monks, one of whom, Archimandrite Alimpi, was beaten to death, and another named Pitirim became mentally ill as a result of beatings.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aforementioned Argentov seminar continued to be harassed after its leadership was sent to psychiatric institutions. The new chairman Alexander Ogordnikov was forced to resign his janitor's job after it was discovered he had used his janitor's hut for seminar meetings. The authorities prevented him from getting a new job, and in 1979 he was arrested and sentenced to one year's hard labour for parasitism. While he was still at the camp at the end of his term, he was re-tried and accused of anti-Soviet propaganda; he was sentenced to an additional six years’ hard labour followed by another five years of internal exile.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The seminar increased in popularity and numbers, however. It expanded to [[Kazan]], [[Odessa]] and [[Smolensk]] after Ogordonikov's arrest. In February 1979 there was a joint conference of the Leningrad and Moscow seminars. The regime reacted with various forms of unofficial harassment, including a severe anonymous beating of one of its members. This was followed by numerous KGB warnings, raids, termination of jobs and temporary arrests of the whole membership. Tat’iana Shchipkova, a professor of French and Latin at the Smolensk Pedagogical Institute and the seminar's representative in Smolensk, lost her teaching position in July 1978 and several who had attended the seminar who were students were expelled. She was deprived of her doctoral degree by the end of August 1978 on political grounds. In January 1980 she was sentenced to three years’ hard labour after she had slapped a Komsomol member on the face during a raid of a seminar meeting. Other notables arrests included Sergei Ermolaev and Igor Poliakov who were sentenced respectively to four and three-and-a-half-years’ hard labour in September 1979 for shouting anti-Soviet slogans. In April 1980, member Viktor Popkov and Vladimir Burtsev were sentenced to eighteen months’ hard labour for allegedly counterfeiting documents. Shortly afterwards, seminar leader Vladimir Proesh was sentenced to five years’ hard labour in strict regime camps followed by three years of internal exile. Just before his term ended, he was given an additional three years’ labour camp in October 1983. This long series of arrests resulted in the seminar being effectively shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 182-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 53-year-old writer and journalist, Zoia Krakhmal’nikova was a former member of the Soviet Union of Writers. She had converted to Orthodoxy as an adult and published religious samizdat. She published excerpts of the writings of the Church Fathers as well as modern Orthodox theologians, articles by converts, excerpts from the lives of the saints, and post-1917 Russian religious writing. There was very little political element in her writing beyond short biographical notes of people who had been killed by the Soviets. She was arrested and tried on 4 August 1982 and put on trial on 1 April 1983 after a long series of investigations. She was sentenced to one year in prison, followed by five years of internal exile under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

A baptist named Valerii Barinov wrote and recorded a Christian rock opera entitled ‘The Trumpet Call’ around 1982. In January 1983, he and his friend Sergei Timokhin sent a petition to be able to give legal religious concerts. In response, the Soviet press launched a campaign of character assassination. In March 1984, the two were detained in [[Murmansk]] and accused of trying to cross the border to Scandinavia. Barinov was sentenced to two and a half years’ hard labour. Barinov declared a hunger strike and requested either emigration or to be declared innocent. The authorities force-fed him. He was released in September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, 'The Trumpet Call' was translated into English and re-recorded by British bass guitarist [[Dave Markee]] under the moniker The Dave Markee Band. The album was released in the U.S. on Fortress Records, a division of the Christian rock label [[Refuge Records]].&lt;ref&gt;liner notes, The Trumpet Call by The Dave Markee Band 1985, Fortress Records R84012&lt;/ref&gt; As of this writing, clips from that recording are available for listening at YouTube's web site.

==The millennium==

In the years leading up to the 1988 millennial anniversary of Russia's conversion to Christianity, the church and the state fought over the meaning of the event and the role of the Church in Russia's history as well as culture. The state returned some of the most valued of religious sites in the country to the Church as a gesture of goodwill (such as the ancient monastery of St Daniel in Moscow that had been used as a juvenile prison, a warehouse and a factory, with the church sanctuaries deliberately used as public lavatories; the church would pay 5 millions roubles to rebuild it).&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

A campaign ran through the media that the Church had no legitimate claim to being the source or champion of Russian culture and the development as well as survival of the Russian nation. This was a painful subject for Soviet propaganda, due to the USSR's own poor historical record as well as its wholesale destruction of cultural monuments, churches, monasteries and other elements of Russia's heritage.&lt;ref name="haskins"/&gt; The media, however, nevertheless presented the Soviet state as a champion of the preservation of old cultural and historical monuments, and condemned acts of vandalism against them. The media accused the Church of capitalizing on the anniversary in order to attract attention.

Soviet writers and academics tried to downplay the old thesis that the Slavs had little culture prior to Christianization, and they tried to promote the pagan culture of the country before Christianization as already developed. The 988 date was also downplayed by claiming that the Christianization of the country occurred over a few centuries and that that date was simply when Prince Vladimir forcibly baptized the Kievites. It was also downplayed by inventing (out of thin air) that the city of Kiev had its 1500th anniversary which was celebrated in 1980-82.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; They blamed Christianity for freezing Russian culture and that Christianity destroyed the cultural heritage of antiquity. The pre-Christian Kievan state was presented as a world power that benefitted little from Byzantium's influences. Ivan the Terrible was presented as inspired by Christian theology. It was denied that Christianity had introduced monogamy. The role of monasticism in Russia's history was belittled and blackened.

They blamed the Church for a reactionary role in the development of secular culture. The church was also criticized for an alleged lack of patriotism as well as collaboration with invaders of Russia. Russian history was re-written accordingly in order to fit this argument with regard to the Tatars, Poles and Germans. Good facts in favour of the Church were ignored, while largely only the negative facts were emphasized. The church was accused of misinforming people of the past, and church historians and theologians could be held criminally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church's role in history was admitted to be significant, but only in that it was used to strengthen the oppressing classes by teaching the masses to be docile. It was admitted to be progressive only in that it helped progress the supposedly feudal society of Kievan Russia as long as feudalism was a progressive force.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1987), pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==

By 1987 the number of functioning churches in the Soviet Union had fallen to 6893 and the number of functioning monasteries to just 18.

The Church and the government remained on unfriendly terms until up to the fall of communism. In practice, the most important aspect of this conflict was that openly religious people could not join the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which meant that they could not hold any political office. However, among the general population, large numbers remained religious. In 1987 in the [[Russian SFSR]], between 40% and 50% of newborn babies (depending on the region) were baptized and over 60% of all deceased received Christian funeral services.

Arrests and persecution of believers continued under Gorbachev, although some who had been arrested previously were released. The volume of antireligious propaganda did not decrease under Gorbachev in contrast to the general Soviet literary and cultural scene. This received reprimands from the party ideological department as well as a counter-campaign in the antireligious press wherein such writers were criticized.

Gorbachev's government reversed the pattern of his predecessors, however, with regard to creating a fund to protect and restore historical monuments including religious monuments and to educate the nation in a spirit of love and respect for its national history and culture.&lt;ref name="haskins"/&gt;  At the chair of this fund, a practicing Christian was placed and he was permitted to defend Christian culture and the positive role of the Church in the nation's history. Historic accounts of the state's many crimes against religious believers were allowed to be openly published in the final years of the USSR.&lt;ref name="haskins"/&gt; Another breakthrough that occurred in the final years was the allowance of Christians to respond to atheist attacks in the press, and some Christian writers took the opportunity to criticize the atheist propagandists in the national media. In the national media some articles were printed that argued the decline of Soviet society resulted from a loss of the traditional family, which was held together by Christian ethics and traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Pospielovsky (1988), pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt; He also adopted a new religious policy in the last years of the Soviet regime as a result of his own pragmatism, the need for international support and his desire to gain more supporters.&lt;ref name="davisxvii"/&gt;

{{For|the building|Seat of the Universal House of Justice}}

The '''Universal House of Justice''' ({{lang-fa|بیت‌العدل اعظم}}) is the nine-member supreme ruling body of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. It was envisioned by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, as an institution that could legislate on issues not already addressed in the Bahá'í writings, providing flexibility for the Bahá'í Faith to adapt to changing conditions.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=346-350}} It was first elected in 1963, and subsequently every five years, by delegates consisting of the members of Bahá'í [[Spiritual Assembly|National Spiritual Assemblies]] throughout the world.

The Universal House of Justice, as the head of the religion, has provided direction to the worldwide Bahá'í community primarily through a series of multi-year plans, as well as through annual messages delivered during the [[Ridván]] festival. The messages have focused on increasing the number of [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]], translating Bahá'í literature, establishing Bahá'í Centres, completing [[Bahá'í House of Worship|Bahá'í Houses of Worship]], holding international conferences, and developing educational systems to enhance literacy, the role of women, spirituality for children and youth, family life, social and economic development, and communal worship.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=348}} The Universal House of Justice has also played a role in responding to systemic persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran by garnering worldwide media attention.

The books and documents published by the Universal House of Justice are considered authoritative and its legislative decisions are considered infallible by Bahá'ís.{{sfn|UHJ|1996|p=84}}{{sfn|Schaefer|2000}} While empowered to legislate on matters that are not explicitly stated in the Baha'i holy writings, the Universal House of Justice has, since its inception, limited its exercise of this function. 

The [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#Seat of the Universal House of Justice|Seat of the Universal House of Justice]] and its members reside in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]], on the slope of [[Mount Carmel]].{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=346-350}} The most recent election was 29 April 2018.{{sfn|Bahá'í International Community|2018}} Although all other elected and appointed roles in the Bahá'í Faith are open to men and women, membership on the Universal House of Justice is male-only, providing an exception to the basic Bahá'í principal of the [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality|equality of men and women]]. The Bahá'í writings do not give a reason for this exception, but that the reason will become clear with time.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=359}}

==History==
[[Image:firstUHJ.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Original members of the first Universal House of Justice, 1963.]]
Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, in his book the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' first ordains the institution of the House of Justice and defines its functions. The institution's responsibilities are also expanded on and referred to in several other of Bahá'u'lláh's writings including in his ''[[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh]]''.  In those writings Bahá'u'lláh writes that the Universal House of Justice would assume authority over the religion, and would consider matters that had not been covered by himself; he stated that the members of the institution would be assured of divine inspiration, and have the regard for all peoples and safe-guard their honour.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=346-350}}

Later, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], Bahá'u'lláh's son and successor, in his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]], elaborated on its functioning, its composition and outlined the method for its election. He wrote that the Universal House of Justice would be under Bahá'u'lláh's protection, that it would be freed of error, and that obedience to it would be obligatory.  `Abdu'l-Bahá first used the term "Universal House of Justice" to distinguish the supreme body from those local 'Houses of Justice' to be established in each community, and the secondary 'Houses of Justice' (current Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly|national spiritual assemblies]]).  He also stated that the institution's decisions could be by majority vote, but that unanimous decisions were preferred, and that it would be elected by the members of the secondary Houses of Justice.  He also confirmed Bahá'u'lláh's statements that its membership would be confined to men, and that the reason behind this decision would become apparent in the future.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=346-350}}

While both `Abdu'l-Bahá and [[Shoghi Effendi]], heads of the religion after Bahá'u'lláh, considered establishing the Universal House of Justice, they both declined to do so.  Shoghi Effendi's reason was due to his belief in the weakness of the existing Bahá'í institutions — there were a very limited number of national spiritual assemblies and local spiritual assemblies.  Thus during his lifetime, Shoghi Effendi prepared for the election of the Universal House of Justice, by establishing a strong administrative structure at the local and national levels. In 1951 when there were 9 national spiritual assemblies, [[Shoghi Effendi]] appointed members to the [[International Bahá'í Council]], and described it as an embryonic international House of Justice. After Shoghi Effendi's unexpected death in 1957, the [[Hands of the Cause]] directed the affairs of the religion and announced that the election of the Universal House of Justice would occur in 1963 at the end of the [[Ten Year Crusade]], an international teaching plan instituted by Shoghi Effendi.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=346-350}}

In 1961 the International Bahá'í Council was changed to an elected body, with members of all National Spiritual Assemblies voting for its members. Then in April 1963 the first Universal House of Justice was elected, six years after the passing of Shoghi Effendi, by 56 national spiritual assemblies.  The date of the election coincided with the completion of the Ten Year Crusade and also with the first centenary anniversary of the [[Ridván|public declaration]] of Bahá'u'lláh in the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]] in April 1863.  Since then the Universal House of Justice has acted as the head of the religion; in 1972 it published its constitution.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=346-350}}{{sfn|UHJ|1972}}

==Election process==
The Universal House of Justice is elected through secret ballot and plurality vote in a three-stage election by adult Bahá'ís throughout the world.  The House of Justice is elected without nominations or campaigning and all adult male members of the Bahá'í Faith are eligible for election to the House.{{sfn|World|1995}} The body is elected every five years during a convention of the members of the various [[National Spiritual Assembly|National or Regional Spiritual Assemblies]] (NSAs) across the world. Each member of the various NSAs, who were themselves elected by the Bahá'ís of their country, votes for nine adult male Bahá'ís. [[Absentee ballot]]s are mailed or carried by delegates. The nine people who have the most votes are elected onto the Universal House of Justice. Women are not eligible for election to the Universal House of Justice. `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that the wisdom for this will become clear in the future, and that women and men are spiritually equal.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=346-350}} For more on this issue see [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality]].

The most recent full election was on 29 April 2018.{{sfn|Bahá'í International Community|2018}}. 

==Responsibilities==
[[Image:Baha'i arc from archives.jpg|thumb|250px|Seat of the Universal House of Justice]]
The Universal House of Justice today guides the growth and development of the global Bahá'í community. The general functions of the Universal Houses of Justice, as stated by Bahá'u'lláh include to promulgate the cause of God, to preserve the law, to administer social affairs, to educate the people's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s, to guarantee the education of children, to make the world prosperous, and to care of the elderly and the ill who are in poverty.{{sfn|Momen|1989}} According to its constitution, the Universal House of Justice itself states that "The provenance, the authority, the duties, the sphere of action of the Universal House of Justice all derive from the revealed Word of Bahá'u'lláh which, together with the interpretations and expositions of `Abdu'l-Bahá and of Shoghi Effendi ... constitute the binding terms of reference of the Universal House of Justice and are its bedrock foundation."{{sfn|UHJ|1972}} Some of the powers and duties according to the constitution include:{{sfn|Momen|1989}}
*Promoting the spiritual qualities that characterize Bahá'í life individually and collectively
*Preserving the [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í sacred texts]]
*Defending and protecting the global Bahá'í community from repression and [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution]]
*Preserving and developing the world [[Bahá'í World Centre|spiritual and administrative centre]] of the Bahá'í Faith
*Encouraging the growth and maturation of the Bahá'í community and [[Bahá'í administration|administration]]
*Safeguarding individual personal rights, freedoms and initiatives
*Applying Bahá'í principles and laws
*Developing, abrogating and changing laws that are not recorded in the Bahá'í sacred texts, according to the requirements of the time
*Pronouncing sanctions against violations of [[Bahá'í laws|Bahá'í law]]
*Adjudicating and arbitrating of disputes referred to it
*Administrating all religious funds and endowments such as [[Huqúqu'lláh]] that are entrusted to its care

Furthermore, the Universal House of Justice is instructed by Bahá'u'lláh to exert a positive influence on the general welfare of humankind, to promote a permanent peace among the nations of the world, ensure the "training of peoples, the up building of nations, the protection of man and the safeguarding of his honour".{{sfn|Momen|1989}}{{sfn|Bahá'u'lláh|1994|p=125}} The Universal House of Justice is supported by the elected national and local governing bodies of the Bahá'í Faith, (the [[National Spiritual Assembly|National Spiritual Assemblies]] and [[Local Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] respectively). It has, furthermore, created several appointed institutions to support its work around the world;  among these are the [[Institution of the Counsellors|Continental Board of Counsellors]] and the [[International Teaching Centre]].

===Jurisdiction===
[[File:Seat_of_the_Universal_House_of_Justice_IMG_0888.JPG|thumb|250px|Seat of the Universal House of Justice]]

The Universal House of Justice is also given the responsibility of adapting the Bahá'í Faith as society progresses, and is thus given the power to legislate on matters not explicitly covered in the Bahá'í sacred texts.  While the Universal House of Justice is authorized to change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change, it cannot dissolve or change any of the laws which are explicitly written in the sacred texts.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=346-350}}{{sfn|Momen|1989}} Shoghi Effendi has written:
{{quote|... the Universal House of Justice has been invested with the function of legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the teachings.... whose exclusive right and prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgement on such laws and ordinances as Bahá'u'lláh has not expressly revealed.... Neither [[Shoghi Effendi|the Guardian of the Faith]] nor any institution apart from the International House of Justice can ever usurp this vital and essential power or encroach upon that sacred right.{{sfn|Effendi|1938|pp=150-153}} }}

In the same book, Shoghi Effendi mentions that certain issues were left intentionally for the House of Justice to apply and legislate on as time progressed:
{{quote|Severed from the no less essential institution of the Universal House of Justice this same [[Bahá'í administration|System]] of the [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will of 'Abdu'l-Bahá]] would be paralyzed in its action and would be powerless to fill in those gaps which the Author of the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]] has deliberately left in the body of His legislative and administrative ordinances.{{sfn|Effendi|1938|p=148}} }}

==Publications==

While being empowered to legislate on matters, the Universal House of Justice has, since its inception in 1963, been limited in its exercise of this function.  Instead it has generally provided guidance to Bahá'ís around the world; this guidance has generally been through the form of letters and messages, much like Shoghi Effendi's communications. Many of these letters have been published in compilations and are regarded as divinely empowered and authoritative; its legislative decisions are considered infallible to Bahá'ís.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=350}}{{sfn|Schaefer|2000}} The letters cover a range of subjects including teaching, [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayer]], family life, education and Bahá'í administration.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=350}} Each year on the first day of [[Ridván]] (which may be on April 20 or 21 depending on the dating of [[Bahá'í Naw-Rúz|Naw-Rúz]]) the Universal House of Justice addresses a message to the worldwide Bahá’í community, known as Ridván messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ridván Messages |url=http://universalhouseofjustice.bahai.org/ridvan-messages/ |publisher=Bahá’í International Community |accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution has also collected and published extracts from the writings of the [[Báb]], Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá. In 1992 they published the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], Bahá'u'lláh's book of laws in [[English language|English]], and further translations have since been published.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=350}}  During these endeavours, they established departments of research and archives at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]], and, as of 1983, have collected over 60,000 letters of Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi.  These collected works have been used as a base in the deliberations of the Universal House of Justice.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=350}}

Members are entered in the table under the year when they were first elected. Starting with the first election in 1963, regular elections of the entire membership have occurred every five years, and there have been five by-elections, noted in the table with ''italics'', in 1982, 1987, 2000, 2005 and 2010.  All members have continued to serve after re-election in subsequent conventions.  Amoz Gibson, [[Charles Wolcott]], and [[Adib Taherzadeh]] died while in office while the other former members were allowed to retire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12083">The '''Wage Earner’s Suffrage League''' was a suffrage organization founded in [[New York City|New York]] in 1911 that sought to bridge politics and labor towards the end goal of achieving women’s suffrage and ultimately disbanded in 1912.&lt;ref name="Orleck 1995, p. 95"&gt;Orleck 1995, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wage Earner’s League is an example of a predominately female led effort to bring working women into the suffrage movement to gain political momentum and influence.

==Background==
The Wage Earner’s Suffrage League was a result of the differing opinions within the Socialist Party and the lack of representation of working women within the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA).&lt;ref&gt;Tax 1980, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Following hostilities amongst members, the [[Socialist Party USA|Socialist Party]] leaders convened in a party conference in December 1909 seeking a rapprochement between suffragism and Socialism. One of the issues discussed was the path of involvement Socialist suffragist should take.&lt;ref name="Orleck 1995, p. 95"/&gt; The National American Woman Suffrage Association was proving to be an atmosphere uncongenial to working women, while members such as Leonora O’Reilly and Rose Schneiderman injected new vigor into organizing and sought to break from its traditions.&lt;ref name="Tax 1980, p. 171"&gt;Tax 1980, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;  Socialist suffragists represented by Rose Schneiderman and Leonora O’Reilly pressed for the Socialist party to allow working women to freely choose their potential supporters outside of the Socialist Party. Opposing the view of [[Rose Schneiderman|Schneiderman]] and [[Leonora O'Reilly|O'Reilly]], several other Socialist suffragists called for Socialist-controlled suffrage work.&lt;ref name="Orleck 1995, p. 95-96"&gt;Orleck 1995, p. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to political alliances, the faction within the Socialist Party headed by Schneiderman and O’Reilly was defeated at the party conference in 1909 as it was decided to pursue suffrage from within the framework of [[Socialist Party USA|Socialist Party]].&lt;ref name="Orleck 1995, p. 96"&gt;Orleck 1995, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Following their defeat at the [[Socialist Party USA|Socialist Party]] conference in 1909, utilizing the assistance of [[Mary Ritter Beard]] of the [[National Woman's Party]], [[Rose Schneiderman]] and [[Leonora O'Reilly]] withdrew to form a separate suffrage organization run by, and for, factory workers seeking to enable working women to utilize the political resources of their choosing. [[Rose Schneiderman]] and [[Leonora O'Reilly]] officially founded the Wage Earner’s League for Woman Suffrage on March 22, 1911 in [[New York City]]. This organization sought to utilize the support of the mainstream suffrage movement in a pragmatic effort to attain the vote for women.&lt;ref name="Orleck 1995, p. 96"/&gt;  Among the organization’s cofounders were waistmakers [[Clara Lemlich]] and Mollie Schepps, and laundry worker [[Margaret Hinchey]]. The oldest of the founders, [[Leonora O'Reilly]], was elected the president of the Wage Earner’s League while the famed organizer of the [[New York shirtwaist strike of 1909]], [[Clara Lemlich]], was elected its vice president and would serve as the organization’s chief organizer.&lt;ref name="Tax 1980, p. 171"/&gt;

==Organizational Practices and Goals==
The Wage Earner’s Suffrage League prioritized giving a political voice to wage-earning women and sought to keep organizational control firmly within their hands, while also reaching out to immigrants and non-wage-earning women. The league’s founders agreed upon the principle framework of allowing only workers to become full voting members, ensuring the league would be for, and ran by, workers. Although it restricted full membership solely to workers, the Wage Earners Suffrage League did not reject the participation of other women altogether. Although it did not reject their participation, it did restrict their membership capacity, not allowing them to hold any sway in regard to the shaping of the league’s campaigns, literature, or speeches. Resulting from the league’s leaders heavy focus upon factories and immigrant neighborhoods as grounds for its outreach, the organization’s membership was decidedly working-class.&lt;ref name="Orleck 1995, p. 95-96"/&gt;  While the majority of the league’s membership was from within the working-class, its small amount of non-working-class members provided most of the financial support that constituted the league’s budget. These non-working class members were termed not as members, but allies, and were permitted to attend the league’s meetings and assist with the league’s work.&lt;ref name="Tax 1980, p. 171"/&gt;  The Wage Earner’s Suffrage League chose was an affiliate with the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]]. The Wage Earner’s Suffrage League identified itself as the labor wing of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]].

==Early Outreach and Reaction==
The league proved successful in spreading its message to unaffiliated working women, due in part to the league’s leaders targeting the same women workers they were unionizing and also to the ability of chief organizer [[Clara Lemlich]], who was a skilled and passionate speaker, and often recited her speeches in Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Orleck 1995, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wage Earner’s Suffrage League targeted both housewives ad wage-earning women through leaflets and pamphlets it distributed. These leaflets utilized rhetoric characterized by directness. Leaflets asked direct questions such as “Why are you paid less than a man? Why do you work in a firetrap? Why are your hours so long? Because you are a woman and have no vote. Votes make the law. Votes enforce the law. The law controls conditions. Women who want better conditions must vote.” The rhetoric utilized by the league framed suffrage as the key to the solving the issues facing wage-earning women.&lt;ref&gt;Tax 1980, p. 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the league’s first year, [[Leonora O'Reilly]], [[Clara Lemlich]], and Mollie Schepps spoke on a regular basis outside factories, as the shifts of workers were changing. The Wage Earner’s Suffrage League also passed out handbills in a direct outreach to working-class housewives seeking to publicize Suffrage Week from September 1–9, 1911. This handbill asked women questions such as, “Would you ensure child welfare for all children everywhere or only your own at home? Do you want pure food from cow to kitchen or in the kitchen only? Don’t you think equal pay for all women who toil should be a given rather than a privilege?”&lt;ref&gt;Orelck 1995, p. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction to the league’s distributed items, such as leaflets or handbills, is unknown due to the lack of any recorded responses. The league did not have the financial support to print more than an occasional leaflet or handbill, and this financial limitation led the league to rely not on printed materials, but on spoken word through its passionate orators. The league relied upon funding not only from its internal allies, but also the financial support of the middle class group the College Equal Suffrage League. The league held its meetings mainly outdoors and relied heavily on crowded New York street corners as its primary organizing tool. The league’s leaders, O’Reilly, Lemlich, and Schepps, also spoke at night in worker neighborhoods in an effort to target housewives returning from their shopping. The league made conscious efforts to reach out to wage-earning women as much as housewives, resulting in a general increase in pro-suffrage enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Orelck 1995, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooper Union Rally==
The Wage Earner’s Suffrage League’s largest public effort was that of the rally held at [[Cooper Union]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Tax 1995, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The league staged a protest of the New York State legislature’s failure to issue a formal endorsement of women’s suffrage during the state legislature’s suffrage debate. [[Mary Ritter Beard]] of the National Woman’s Party had suggested that [[Leonora O'Reilly|O'Reilly]] gather the leaders of the Wage Warner’s Suffrage League and respond to the statements made against suffrage. The league seized the opportunity to generate widespread interest and support, leafleting the factory districts in the weeks leading up to the rally.  [[Mary Ritter Beard|Mary Beard's]] suggestion resulted in the 
rally not being structured as speakers delivering speeches, but rather as several prominent wage-earning women issuing a direct and formal response to the arguments presented by state senators speaking out against suffrage. On the night of April 22, 1912 [[Cooper Union]] filled with an overflowing crowd of thousands, composed almost entirely of wage-earning women.&lt;ref&gt;Tax 1995, p. 172-174.&lt;/ref&gt;  The speakers at the [[Cooper Union]] rally reinforced the need for women’s independence in their individual responses. These responses centered upon statements made by senators regarding the protection of women from the vote, citing the need to preserve marital harmony, female morality, and femininity.&lt;ref name="Jewish Women's Archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage Earners' League for Woman Suffrage holds first mass rally.|url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/apr/22/1912/welfws|website=Jewish Women's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mollie Schepps recounted the treatment striking waistmakers received from the [[New York City]] police and judges, emphasizing its brutality and attacked the notion that equal wages between the sexes would erode the sanctity of marriage. [[Clara Lemlich]] attacked the notion that the vote was a burden and sought to respond to the notion that it would corrupt female morality.[[Rose Schneiderman]] issued a speech expanding upon varying notions of femininity and utilized a class-based approach to recommend that working women define femininity on their own terms. These speeches made by [[Rose Schneiderman|Schneiderman]], [[Clara Lemlich|Lemlich]], and Schepps combined to offer a working class critique of female behavior presented through a growing perception of industrial feminism.&lt;ref name="Jewish Women's Archive" /&gt; Each speech sought to break down the argument of those opposing suffrage in an effort to highlight their manipulation of class and gender to oppress women. The Wage Earner’s Suffrage League presented the solution to ending this manipulation, framed as the vote, as they recommended that only suffrage could bring women full independence and allow them access to political power.&lt;ref&gt;Orelck 1995, p. 102-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissipation==
There are no further records of the Wage Earner’s Suffrage League’s existence following the rally at [[Cooper Union]] on April 22, 1912. According to historian Annelise Orleck, the dissipation of the league is believed to have come as a result of a combination of factors ranging from the organization lacking a full-time organizer, funding drying up, the firing of [[Clara Lemlich]], and the departure of [[Rose Schneiderman]] to work for another suffrage organization in the summer of 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Orelck 1995, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its short existence, the Wage Earner’s Suffrage League sought to bring the suffrage movement and the labor movement together in an effort to give working women educative lessons through their political participation.
