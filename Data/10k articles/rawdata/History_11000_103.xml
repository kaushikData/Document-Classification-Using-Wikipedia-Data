'''Adolfo de Castro''' (died October 1898 in [[Cádiz]], [[Spain]]) was a Spanish historian and member of the [[Real Academia de la Historia]] of [[Madrid]]. He lived in Cadiz and died there in 1898.

==Biography==
Castro wrote the first short history of the Jews in Spain, based on careful studies. His history was so impartial and dispassionate that he found it necessary to assure his readers (p.&amp;nbsp;8): "Escribo esta historia sin pasion, ni artificio, como de cosas que nada me tocan. Ni soi judio, ni vengo de judaizantes" (I write this history dispassionately and without craft, as concerning things that do not touch me. I am not a Jew, nor am I of Jewish descent.) Castro's book was published under the title, ''Historia de los Judios en España, desde los Tiempos de su Establecimiento hasta Principios del Presente Siglo'', Cádiz, 1847. It was translated into English by Rev. Edward D.G.M. Kirwan, Cambridge, John Deighton, 1851.

Unlike [[José Amador de los Ríos]], who after him, treated the history of the Jews in Spain, Castro condemned the [[Inquisition]]: "Pues los monarcas bien podran regir con las leyes de la fuerza los cuerpos de sus vasallos; pero no podrán sujetar los animos" (For monarchs can indeed command by forcible laws the bodies of their subjects, but cannot subdue their souls).

==Legend==
The legend of Asena tells of a young boy who survived a battle; a female wolf finds the injured child and nurses him back to health. The she-wolf, impregnated by the boy, escapes her enemies by crossing the Western Sea to a cave near the [[Qocho]] mountains and a city of the [[Tocharians]], giving birth to ten half-wolf, half-human boys. Of these, Ashina becomes their leader and establishes the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina clan]], which ruled over the Göktürk and other [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[nomadic empire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Findley, Carter Vaughin. ''The Turks in World History''. Oxford University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-517726-6}}. Page 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roxburgh, D. J. (ed.) ''Turks, A Journey of a Thousand Years''. Royal Academy of Arts, London, 2005. Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

These first Turks migrated to the Altai region, where they were known as expert [[blacksmith]]s, akin to the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher I. Beckwith, Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present, Princeton University Press, 2011, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era==
With the rise of [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish]] [[ethnic nationalism]] in the 1930s, the veneration of figures of Turkic Mythology, such as {{ill|Bozkurt (mythology)|lt=Bozkurt|tr|Bozkurt (mitoloji)}}, Asena and [[Ergenekon]] was resurgent.&lt;ref name="Arman"/&gt; The symbol of Asena is embossed on the stage of the personal theater of the first President of Turkey, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], at his residence in Ankara;&lt;ref name="Arman"&gt;Murat Arman, "The Sources of Banality In Transforming Turkish Nationalism", ''CEU Political Science Journal'', issue: 2 (2007), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; the Atatürk referenced the motif in speech, such as that of 13 February 1931,''[[Türk Ocağı]]'', in [[Malatya]].'&lt;ref&gt;''Atatürk'ün Söylev ve Demeçleri II'', Atatürk Kültür, Dil ve Tarih Yüksek Kurumu Atatürk Araştırma Merkezi, 1989, p. 301, Turkish text: ''Demiryollarını kullanacak olan Türk milleti menşeindeki ilk sanatkarlığına, demirciliğinin eserini tekrar göstermiş olmakla müftehir olacaktır.'' {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Önder, ''Atatürk'ün Yurt Gezileri'', Türkiye İş Bankası, 1975, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mj0BAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Demiryollar%C4%B1n%C4%B1+kullanacak+olan+T%C3%BCrk+Milleti,+do%C4%9Fusundaki+ilk+sanatk%C3%A2rl%C4%B1%C4%9F%C4%B1n%C4%B1n,+demircili%C4%9Finin+eserini+tekrar+g%C3%B6stermi%C5%9F+olmakla+..%22&amp;dq=%22Demiryollar%C4%B1n%C4%B1+kullanacak+olan+T%C3%BCrk+Milleti,+do%C4%9Fusundaki+ilk+sanatk%C3%A2rl%C4%B1%C4%9F%C4%B1n%C4%B1n,+demircili%C4%9Finin+eserini+tekrar+g%C3%B6stermi%C5%9F+olmakla+..%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IdL3ULreEciXkwX5mYHoCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ p. 268].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4021">The '''Bavarian Forest Club''' ({{lang-de|Bayerische Wald-Verein}}), or '''BWV''', is a club that promotes culture, local history and folklore, nature and landscape conservation, and walking in the [[Bavarian Forest]] in [[Germany]]. It has its head office in [[Zwiesel]] and is registered in the register of clubs and societies in the district office at [[Deggendorf]] (VR 10158).

== History ==
The founder of the club was Anton Niederleuthner, senior judge in [[Passau]]. The foundation of the club in 1883 goes back to his meeting with foresters in [[Bodenmais]]. The Bavarian Forest Club was founded in Deggendorf Town Hall on 25 November 1883. The Bodenmais townsman, Bartholomäus Stölzl, was appointed as its first chairman. On 6 June 1885, Niederleuthner founded the Passau Branch, the club's first local branch. On 22 August he was elected the first president and made Passau the base of the club. He managed the club for over 20 years and founded over 40 other local branches. The club emblem used today goes back to Niederleuthner.

A club magazine, ''Der Bayerwald'', was also launched. Its editor in the 1930s was the Nazi,  [[Eugen Hubrich]].

The main goals of the club were the development of the Bavarian Forest as a hiking and holiday area, the creation of a dense network of hiking trails and the construction of refuge huts. Later they  concentrated on the maintenance and waymarking of trails, the conservation of refuge huts and viewing towers as well as measures such as the protection of the ''[[Schachten]]'', the historical grazing areas of the highlands. Until the founding of the [[Bavarian Forest Nature Park]] in 1967 and the [[Bavarian Forest National Park]] in 1970, the Bavarian Forest Club was the only major institution that placed the culture and nature of the Bavarian Forest at the centre of its activities.

== Today ==
In 2016, the club comprised 60 branches and had about 20,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayerischer-wald-verein.de/&lt;/ref&gt;. The individual branches own important buildings and refuge huts. For example, [[Kollnburg Castle]] and [[Neunußberg Castle]] are owned by the [[Viechtach]] branch, and the ''Lusenschutzhaus'' by the [[Grafenau, Bavaria|Grafenau]] branch. Important annual events include the ''Bayerwaldtag'' (Bavarian Forest Day) and the art exhibition, ''Zwieseler Buntspecht'', in Zwiesel. On the [[Oberbreitenau]] a youth education centre has been created in the Landshut House named after the [[Landshut]] branch.

On 26 October 2008, the club celebrated its 125th anniversary in the festival hall of the old town hall of Deggendorf. Minister of State, Josef Miller, gave the speech at the spot where the Bavarian Forest Club was founded on 25 November 1883.

Since early 2016, the club has become a member of the [[German Hiking Association]], to which it had already previously belonged until its departure on 31 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mittelbayerische.de/region/cham/gemeinden/cham/reibungslose-wahl-beim-wald-verein-22798-art1335449.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher Wanderverband (publ.): "125 Jahre Wandern und mehr", Michael Imhof Verlag, Petersberg, 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-86568-221-5}}, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim,  the ''Interessensgemeinschaft Bayerischer Wald'', consisting of the [[Dreiburgenland]] and [[Ruderting]]-[[Neukirchen vorm Wald|Neukirchen]] branches, was a member of the German Hiking Association from June 2008 to the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ruderting-neukirchen.de/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123183255/http://www.ruderting-neukirchen.de/ |archive-date=2016-01-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bill Bunbury''' (born 7 October 1940, in [[Glastonbury]], England) is a former radio broadcaster and producer for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], and an accomplished historian and writer.

==Early life==
Bunbury was born in [[Glastonbury]], England in 1940, to an Australian father and an English mother.&lt;ref name=simper&gt;{{cite news |first=Errol |last=Simper |title=RN's quiet achiever brought the past to life |publisher=''[[The Australian]]'' |date=2007-03-22 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with an honours degree from the [[University of Durham]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/tv/quest/txt/s1496073.htm |title=How the Quest Was Won: Bill Bunbury |accessdate=2008-09-04 |date=2005-11-18 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; then decided to visit his father's homeland, Australia. He worked as a farmhand on his cousin's farm in [[Broomehill]] for 2 months before moving to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], where he taught English at [[Guildford Grammar School]].&lt;ref name=malan&gt;{{cite news |first=Andre |last=Malan |title=Bunbury's history |publisher=''[[The West Australian]]'' |date=2003-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A visit to the school by an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] television crew introduced Bunbury to ABC producer Roger Penny. Penny recommended Bill to apply for an ABC position and  he joined the ABC'S Education in May 1969.&lt;ref name=simper/&gt;

==Career==
Bunbury's first couple of years at the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] consisted of radio work. He moved to television shortly afterwards to present a children's program called ''Here in the West''.&lt;ref name=malan/&gt; Later, while making a film series about significant communities, he came across the experience of  Group Settlers in Denmark, Western Australia in the 1920s. Unable to get funds for a TV production he recorded a 30 minute radio documentary THEY SAID YOU'D OWN YOUR OWN FARM  Its unexpected popularity prompted Bunbury to 
move full time to radio, travelling around Western Australia recording  series called LIVING HISTORY. 

In 1985, historian and broadcaster [[Tim Bowden]] founded  the ABC's social history unit, and invited Bill to join the unit.   He had already produced a Background Briefing on the death of John Pat in the Pilbara  and 
then produced ''Hindsight', ''Verbatim'', ''Street Stories'' and ''Encounter''. He retired from the ABC in 2007. Bunbury said, "I wanted to go while I was still doing good work. I think I've quit while I was, hopefully, still winning races. I think maybe some [journalists] retire too early. Perhaps some go on [working] too long. You try to pick the right time."&lt;ref name=simper/&gt;

 He has subsequently worked with Community Arts WA, producing radio features which assist Aboriginal communities to tell their own stories and has also presented VoicePrints for the Perth International Arts Festival'
Bunbury's documentary series covered such topics as [[Cyclone Tracy]], Australia's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], and the granting of equal wages to Aboriginal stockmen in 1966.&lt;ref name=simper/&gt; His work had a strong focus on [[Indigenous Australian]] history. Bunbury won several awards for his radio programmes and series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/history/hindsight/presenter.htm |title=Radio National: Hindsight Presenters |accessdate=2008-09-04 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the NSW Premier's Media Prize in 1996 for his six part series UNFINISHED BUSINESS,- RECONCILIATION &amp; THE REPUBLIC, the New York Radio Festival Gold medal for Best History Documentary,   "Timber for Gold", Gold Mining and Timber ] in [[Kalgoorlie]], and the  [[UN]] Australia Peace Prize for "The War Rages On",  Australians in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=simper/&gt;

His interest in oral history and recording of people's memories has created a vast resource in the Western Australian state library, [[Battye Library]], of recorded interviews with people from various documentaries and programmes. Journalist Andre Malan has described this as Bunbury's legacy, "a priceless archive of the State's rich oral history that would otherwise have been lost forever".&lt;ref name=malan/&gt;

Bunbury has published extensively with the [[Fremantle Press]], and is currently Adjunct Professor of History and Media at [[Murdoch University]] where he was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Literature in 2008 for services to broadcasting and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fremantlepress.com.au/authors/319/Bill+Bunbury |title=Fremantle Press: Authors: Bill Bunbury |accessdate=2008-09-04 |publisher=[[Fremantle Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Bill Bunbury was awarded an Order of Australia for his services to broadcasting  and Aboriginal communities.

==Personal life==
Bunbury and his wife,Jenny now live in [[Margaret River, Western Australia|Margaret River]]. They have two daughters, Alison and Kate and two grandsons, Sam and Jack.&lt;ref name=malan/&gt; On January 26 2017, Australia Day, Bill Bunbury was awarded the Order Of Australia for services to the broadcast media and the Indigenous people of Australia.

== History ==
[[File:Carter G Woodson portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Carter G. Woodson]] (1875–1950)]]

=== Negro History Week (1926) ===

The precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926 in the United States, when historian [[Carter G. Woodson]] and the [[Association for the Study of Negro Life and History]] announced the second week of February to be "Negro History Week".&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Daryl Michael Scott, [http://www.asalh.org/blackhistorymonthorigins.html "The Origins of Black History Month,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214045303/http://www.asalh.org/blackhistorymonthorigins.html |date=February 14, 2013 }} Association for the Study of African American Life and History, 2011, www.asalh.org/&lt;/ref&gt; This week was chosen because it coincided with the [[Lincoln's Birthday|birthday of Abraham Lincoln]] on February 12 and of [[Frederick Douglass]] on February 14, both of which dates black communities had celebrated together since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Scott /&gt;

From the event's initial phase, primary emphasis was placed on encouraging the coordinated teaching of the history of American blacks in the nation's [[state school|public schools]]. The first Negro History Week was met with a lukewarm response, gaining the cooperation of the Departments of Education of the states of [[North Carolina]], [[Delaware]], and [[West Virginia]] as well as the city school administrations of [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=Woodson238&gt;C.G. Woodson, "Negro History Week," ''Journal of Negro History,'' vol. 11, no. 2 (April 1926), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this far from universal acceptance, the event was regarded by Woodson as "one of the most fortunate steps ever taken by the Association", and plans for a repeat of the event on an annual basis continued apace.&lt;ref name=Woodson238 /&gt;

At the time of Negro History Week's launch, Woodson contended that the teaching of black history was essential to ensure the physical and intellectual survival of the race within broader society:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If a race has no history, it has no worthwhile tradition, it becomes a negligible factor in the thought of the world, and it stands in danger of being exterminated. The American Indian left no continuous record. He did not appreciate the value of tradition; and where is he today? The Hebrew keenly appreciated the value of tradition, as is attested by the Bible itself. In spite of worldwide persecution, therefore, he is a great factor in our civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, "Negro History Week", p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1929, ''The Journal of Negro History'' was able to note that with only two exceptions, officials with the State Departments of Educations of "every state with considerable Negro population" had made the event known to that state's teachers and distributed official literature associated with the event".&lt;ref&gt;"Negro History Week: The Fourth Year", ''Journal of Negro History'', vol. 14, no. 2 (April 1929), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Churches also played a significant role in the distribution of literature in association with Negro History Week during this initial interval, with the mainstream and black press aiding in the publicity effort.&lt;ref&gt;"Negro History Week: The Fourth Year", p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negro History Week was met with enthusiastic response; it prompted the creation of black history clubs, an increase in interest among teachers, and interest from progressive whites. Negro History Week grew in popularity throughout the following decades, with mayors across the United States endorsing it as a holiday.&lt;ref name=Scott /&gt;

On February 21, 2016, 106-year Washington D.C. resident and school volunteer [[Virginia McLaurin]] visited the [[White House]] as part of Black History Month. When asked by the president why she was there, McLaurin said, "A black president. A black wife. And I’m here to celebrate black history. That’s what I'm here for."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/i-am-so-happy-106-year-old-woman-dances-with-joy-as-she-meets-obama-1.2787437|title='I am so happy': 106-year-old woman dances with joy as she meets Obama|date=2016-02-22|work=CTVNews|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States: Black History Month (1970) ===
[[File:Kuumba House - Black United Students 1st Black Culture Center 1969.jpg|thumb|The Black United Students first Black culture center (Kuumba House) where many events of the first Black History Month celebration took place.]] Black History Month was first proposed by black educators and the [[Black United Students]] at [[Kent State University]] in February 1969. The first celebration of Black History Month took place at Kent State one year later, from 2/1/1970 - 2/28/1970.&lt;ref name=Involvement /&gt;

Six years later, Black History Month was being celebrated all across the country in educational institutions, centers of Black culture and community centers, both great and small, when President [[Gerald Ford]] recognized Black History Month, during the celebration of the [[United States Bicentennial]]. He urged Americans to "seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Gerald R. Ford's Message on the Observance of Black History Month|url=http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/760074.htm|work=[[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum]]|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom (1987) ===
Black History Month was first celebrated in the United Kingdom in 1987. It was organised through the leadership of [[Ghana]]ian analyst [[Akyaaba Addai-Sebo]], who had served as a coordinator of special projects for the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) and created a collaboration to get it underway.&lt;ref&gt;Kubara Zamani, [http://everygeneration.co.uk/index.php/black-british-history/bhm-black-history-month/24-akyaaba-addai-sebo "Akyaaba Addai-Sebo Interview"], Every Generation Media, reprinted from ''New African'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first celebrated in London.&lt;ref name=BHMUK&gt;{{cite web|title=Black History Month FAQ|url=http://www.black-history-month.co.uk/sitea/BHM_FAQ.html|publisher=Black History Month|accessdate=February 14, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221055929/http://www.black-history-month.co.uk/sitea/BHM_FAQ.html|archivedate=February 21, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada (1995) ===
In 1995, after a motion by politician [[Jean Augustine]], representing the riding of [[Etobicoke—Lakeshore]] in Ontario, Canada's [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] officially recognized February as Black History Month and honored [[Black Canadians]]. In 2008, Senator [[Donald Oliver]] moved to have the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] officially recognize Black History Month, which was unanimously approved.&lt;ref name=AboutCIC /&gt;

=== Republic of Ireland (2014) ===
In 2014 the Republic of Ireland became only the fourth country in the world to officially celebrate Black History Month. Ireland's Great Hunger Institute notes: “Black History Month Ireland was initiated in Cork in 2010. This location seems particularly appropriate as, in the nineteenth century, the city was a leading center of abolition, and the male and female anti-slavery societies welcomed a number of black abolitionists to lecture there, including Charles Lenox Remond and Frederick Douglass." &lt;ref&gt; Irish Central "How Ireland Is Celebrating Black History Month, 12 Oct 2018 [https://www.irishcentral.com/news/how-ireland-is-celebrating-national-black-history-month] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Black History Month often sparks an annual debate about the continued usefulness and fairness of a designated month dedicated to the history of one [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. Criticisms include questions over whether it is appropriate to confine the celebration of Black history to one month, as opposed to integration of Black history into the mainstream education the rest of the year. Another criticism is that contrary to the original inspiration for Black History Month, which was a desire to redress the manner in which American schools failed to represent Black historical figures as anything other than slaves or colonial subjects, Black History Month reduces complex historical figures to overly simplified objects of hero worship. Other critics refer to the celebration as racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hirsch|first=Afua|title=Black History Month has to be more than hero worship|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/01/black-history-month-hero-worship|accessdate=February 14, 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black celebrities such as actor and director [[Morgan Freeman]] and actress [[Stacey Dash]] have criticized Black History Month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarter|first=William Matt|title=There is a White Sale at Macy's: Reflections on Black History Month|journal=International Journal of Radical Critique|volume=1|issue=2|year=2012|url=http://www.radicalcritique.org/2012/12/Mccarter.html|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thegrio.com/2016/01/27/stacey-dash-morgan-freeman-apology-bet-black-history/ "Stacey Dash says Morgan Freeman agrees with her views on Black History Month, ask for apology from ‘Twitter haters’"], [[TheGrio]], January 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; with Freeman saying, "I don't want a Black history month. Black history is American history." Freeman has argued that there was no White History Month, because white people did not want their history relegated to just one month.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Freeman calls Black History Month 'ridiculous'|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/10482634/ns/today-entertainment/t/freeman-calls-black-history-month-ridiculous/#.TzrCrUxWrTw|accessdate=February 14, 2012|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=December 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1028">'''Carlos Clarens''' (1930–1987) was a film historian and writer on the cinema particularly noted for his sensitive, pioneering ''Illustrated History of the Horror Film'' (1967, revised 1968). Having left Havana in his younger years, he made his mark in both Paris and New York, providing subtitles in the five languages with which he was fluent.

Upon his death, tributes were held at New York's Little Theatre at the [[Public Theater]], the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] and Paris' [[Cinematheque]].

[[File:Mesa Redonda en Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|Carlos Pérez Soto in a seminar in Germany, which was organized by [[medico international]]]]
'''Carlos Pérez Soto''' (born October 6, 1954 in [[Santiago de Chile]]) is a Chilean teacher of [[physics]], lecturer at various universities and a social sciences researcher, author of works of a broad thematic spectrum: [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]], [[political philosophy]] and [[Marxism]], [[history of dance]], [[anti-psychiatry]].

== Biography ==

In 1972 he joined the Faculty of Education at the [[University of Chile]] for the career of Pedagogy in Physics. In 1979, he obtained the state degree of a (qualified) Teacher of Physics, which is his only formal academic degree. Although he began his studies in the heyday of the student movement's political participation during the government of [[Salvador Allende]], he spent most of his life as a student during the years of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chilean military dictatorship]].

Between 1975 and 1999 he worked as a secondary school teacher of physics in schools and colleges of Santiago.

[[File:Fenomenologia 1.jpg|thumb|left|Carlos Pérez Soto teaches a class on [[Hegel]]'s ''Phenomenology of Spirit'']]

In 1984, he began teaching in higher education at the Institute of Arts and Social Sciences, which gathered intellectuals who opposed Pinochet's dictatorship and which in 1991 became the University known until today as [[University of Art and Social Sciences|ARCIS]]. He continued as a university professor, teaching epistemology and philosophy of science in psychology departments, first at the [[Diego Portales University]] and later at the [[University of Chile]]. In the late 80's he was already well known among students and scholars for his critical approach, his Marxist analysis and concrete policy proposals. In this context, he received invitations to give lectures and conferences at numerous Chilean universities so that the following years were characterized by an intense teaching activity.

In the last decade he has taught regular courses and elective seminars at the [[University of Chile]] (Faculty of Law),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derecho.uchile.cl/pregrado/secretaria-de-estudios/53916/ciencias-del-derecho-curriculum  Academic curriculum at the website of the University of Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |title=On Carlos Pérez Soto at the web site of the Faculty of Law |access-date=2014-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323045122/http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/autoridades/curriculum/profesores/c_derecho/c_perez.htm# |archive-date=2014-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Catholic University of Valparaiso]] (School of Psychology), the [[Andrés Bello National University]] (School of Sociology), at [[University of Santiago, Chile|University of Santiago]] (Department of Philosophy), [[Academy of Christian Humanism University]] (Dance School) and at the [[Finis Terrae University]] (School of Theatre).

In the late 90's he also started giving some seminars and conferences outside Chile, at the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] on Hegel (1997) and Marxism (1999), as well as in Cali, at the [[University of Valle|Universidad del Valle]] on epistemology and dialectics (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf  Texto de seminario en Cali] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323033746/http://pioneros.puj.edu.co/lecturas/interesados/FILOSOFIA%20CIENCIA.pdf |date=March 23, 2014 }}, formato PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ARCIS University, where he has focused his academic work, besides teaching in regular courses at the School of Psychology, (Psychological Theories and Systems) and the School of Sociology (Epistemology; Classics of social thought - Marx, Science, Technology and society), Philosophy (Philosophy of Science), Political Science (Theory of power and the state) and Pedagogy of Dance (Dance History), he served as senior researcher at the Center for Social Research as well as Coordinator of Academic Informatics.

As a Marxist intellectual he has been interviewed with some frequency by the leftist press,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puntofinal.cl/676/cambio.php Entrevista en Revista Punto final] diciembre de 2008&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because he has made relevant theoretical contributions to the political discussion. In the context of the student movement of 2011 and 2012, he actively participated providing analysis and proposals for the transformation of the Chilean educational model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanidades.uach.cl/2012/11/14/carlos-perez-dictara-charla-magistral-sobre-educacion/ Clase magistral] en la [[Universidad Austral de Chile]] sobre la transformación del modelo educativo] 15 de noviembre de 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His class analysis of the kind of society that is set under the neoliberal economic model has attracted the interest of international organizations for him to lecture on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio.uchile.cl/2013/10/07/40-anos-de-modelo-neoliberal-en-chile  Nota en el Diario Universidad de Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.uarcis.cl/index.php/cs-sociales/academicas/3373-docente-carlos-perez-dicto-conferencias-en-alemania-sobre-40-anos-de-neoliberalismo-en-chile Carlos Pérez dictó charlas en Alemania sobre 40 años de neoliberalismo en Chile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323051620/http://noticias.uarcis.cl/index.php/cs-sociales/academicas/3373-docente-carlos-perez-dicto-conferencias-en-alemania-sobre-40-anos-de-neoliberalismo-en-chile |date=March 23, 2014 }} Boletín de noticias de la Universidad Arcis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medico.de/themen/aktion/konferenzen/dokumente/chile-im-wandel/4478/ Seminario de [[medico international]]] 16 de septiembre de 2013 (en alemán)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faitesvotrejeu.blogsport.de/2013/09/11/donnerstag-12-september-2013-19-uhr-von-chile-lernen-neoliberalismus-und-protest/ ''Aprender de Chile: Neoliberalismo y protesta''] Foro en Frankfurt,12 de septiembre de 2013 (en alemán)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among scholars of [[Hegel]] and of the reception of Hegel and [[Marx]] at the [[Frankfurt School]], particularly by [[Herbert Marcuse]], Carlos Perez is a regular speaker at international meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2003/10/03/125010/conferencia-internacional-adorno-100-anos-en-el-goethe-institut.html Conferencia internacional, "Adorno, 100 años", en el Goethe-Institut] El Mercurio, 3 de octubre de 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/02/04/index.php?section=opinion&amp;article=002a2cor Anuncio del curso “Hegel y las ciencias sociales” ] Universidad autónoma de México, febrero de 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the vast educational activity in regular and elective courses at the universities, there is a number of free biannual seminars, which he has been giving since 2009 about the ''Phenomenology of the Spirit'' of Hegel, on Marxism and [[Psychoanalysis]], Critical Theory of Law, History of Marxism, [[Carl Sagan]]: Introduction to the current natural philosophy.

Since 2009 he also teaches as a professor of epistemology in several graduate programs (masters and doctorate) at the university Andrés Bello&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postgradounab.cl/academico/carlos-perez/  Presentación de Pérez Soto] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323062217/http://www.postgradounab.cl/academico/carlos-perez/# |date=2014-03-23 }} en un programa de postgrado de la Universidad Andrés Bello&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Art and Social Sciences|ARCIS University]], addressing in his classes and seminars the critical reflection on methodological aspects of the social sciences. He usually presents himself as a teacher of physics, which intends to be "a provocation against the academic ''establishment''", as he has declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elciudadano.cl/2012/07/01/54474/carlos-perez-soto-a-la-senora-bachelet-no-le-conviene-ser-presidenta/# |title=Entrevista en “El Ciudadano”: ''A la señora Bachelet no le conviene ser presidenta |access-date=2014-07-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516210728/http://www.elciudadano.cl/2012/07/01/54474/carlos-perez-soto-a-la-senora-bachelet-no-le-conviene-ser-presidenta/# |archive-date=2014-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national press, however, prefers to cite him as "a great epistemologist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscador.emol.com/vermas/El%20Mercurio/Magazine/2007-11-18/046869bf-3db2-4012-87c3-7528072a8b40/Evidencias_y_clarividencias/ Evidencias y Clarividencias] El Mercurio, 18 de noviembre de 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical contribution and main ideas ==

In epistemology, he has developed a historical and dialectical analysis of the concept of science, more precisely:

* The development of the idea that the scientific method should be considered as a logic for the legitimation of the scientific community; 
* the proposal for a rational reconstruction of the history of philosophy of science from which it is possible to criticize the claim to truth that follows the scientific method; 
* the development of a historical concept of science based on a Marxist critique of the epistemological anarchism of Paul Feyerabend; 
* the formulation of a critique of the prevailing public subjectivity of the middle classes starting from a historical and social concept of modern psychology.

From a political point of view, Carlos Pérez places his theoretical approach and proposals for the political practice in the "Hegelian Marxism", a stance which, as he points out, could be constituted within the philosophical foundations for the purpose of the emergence of a new type of Marxism. Here the following contributions stand out:
* The idea that the bureaucracy should be considered a social class in the Marxist sense of the term; 
* the formulation of a Marxist critique of the ruling regime in socialist countries, based on the concept of bureaucracy as a class; 
* conducting a review of the processes of objective bureaucratization occurred in advanced capitalism; 
* the proposal of the reconstruction of Marxist theory based on a materialist reading of Hegel's philosophy.

His proposals for a new anti-psychiatry are also a political program. They focus on a profound critique of the psychiatric practices, on the need for an unmedicalization and de-privatization of the symptoms, in order to return the problems to the scope of their actual causes, origins and perpetuation: the social sphere. Among other differences with the anti-psychiatry postulates of the twentieth century ( [[Ronald David Laing|Laing]], [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|Cooper]] or [[Franco Basaglia|Basaglia]]), the "new" anti-psychiatry that Perez Soto promotes is one that also overcomes the paternalistic aspects of the psychiatric house as a "shelter", going beyond the logic of organizing a more humane or better quality psychiatric care, paving the way for an anti-psychiatry which arises from the persons themselves that are affected. Apart from a summary and historical connection of the different moments of critical psychiatry and anti-psychiatry, two specific contributions of Carlos Perez stand out:
* The development of a critique of the medicalization processes of behavioral disturbances; 
* the proposal of distinctions to criticize the medicalization and commodification of modern medicine.

The following contributions in the field of art and dance are important: 
* His proposal of a theoretically founded reconstruction of modern dance history in its European tradition and throughout the twentieth century; 
* his proposal of technical style distinctions in contemporary dance; 
* his proposals or theoretical distinctions regarding the political art, political use of art and particular politics of the art guild itself.

With his second book ''Comentar obras de danza'' (Discussing Works of Dance), he ended his excursion through the history of dance. As he explains, because he wants to return to the core of his developments. 
{{cita|I usually write about Marxism, that's the center of all my thoughts. From there I ventured into epistemology and philosophy of science, critical psychology and anti-psychiatry. From now on I will probably write more about the Hegelian philosophy, to which I have devoted many years of study. Except in the most general subjects of aesthetics and art history, this book marks for me the end of a period, and a farewell.

'''Community archaeology''' is [[archaeology]] by the people for the people.  The field is also known as public archaeology. There is debate about whether the terms are interchangeable; some believe that community archaeology is but one form of public archaeology, which can include many other modes of practice, in addition what is described here.&lt;ref&gt;The terms are interchangeable in McDavid (2002:304) and Marshall (2002:214)&lt;/ref&gt;  The design, goals, involved communities, and methods in community archaeology projects vary greatly, but there are two general aspects found in all community archaeology projects.  First, community archaeology involves communities "in the planning and carrying out of research projects that are of direct interest to them".&lt;ref&gt;Trigger (2007:260)&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, community archaeologists generally believe they are making an altruistic difference.  Many scholars on the subject have argued that community collaboration does not have a pre-set method to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber (2006a:xxx)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not found in every project, there are a number of recurring purposes and goals in community archaeology.  Similarities are also found in different countries and regions—due to commonalities in archaeological communities, laws, institutions, and types of communities. It has also been suggested that public archaeology can be defined in a broad sense as the production and consumption of archaeological "commodities".&lt;ref&gt;Moshenska (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community archaeology by country==

===Community archaeology in the United States===
In the United States community archaeology can broadly be separated into three distinct types: projects that collaborate with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], projects that collaborate with other [[local and descendant communities]], and outreach specifically for [[public education]].

===American Indians===
Archaeologists have a long history of excavating American Indian sites without consulting or collaborating with American Indians.  Points of tension include, but are not limited to, the excavation and collection of human remains, the destruction and collections of sacred sites and objects, and archaeological interpretations that ignored or contradicted the opinions and beliefs of American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (2003, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Even the so-called ‘father of American archaeology’ [[Thomas Jefferson]] excavated adults and sub-adults from a site still visited by American Indians&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006:286-288)&lt;/ref&gt; and Pilgrims plundered an American Indian grave days after anchoring at [[Cape Cod]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (2006:xi)&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, “American Indians tend to equate archaeologists with pothunters, grave looters, or, even worse, animals who feast off of the dead (i.e., the “Vulture Culture”).  Most do not trust the system supposedly designed to protect their heritage.”&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (2003:134)&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, any prehistoric archaeological excavation in the Americas will involve the material products left by the ancestors of American Indians.  For these reasons, community archaeology projects   with both federally and non-federally recognized American Indians are different from those that collaborate with local and other descent communities.  Some have found that collaboration can be a means to “break down barriers” between American Indians and archaeologists, and that in collaboration “[e]ach side learns something from the other.”&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:141-142)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many unique ways archaeological collaboration can benefit American Indians.  Kerber reports that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;. . . archaeology benefits American Indians and First People of Canada, respectively, by contributing important historical information; assisting in land claims; managing cultural resources and burial for protection from current and future impacts; promoting sovereignty; offering employment opportunities through field work, interpretive centers, and tourism; educating the young; aiding in nation (re-)building and self-discovery; demonstrating innovative responses of past groups to changing environmental and social circumstance; and providing populations themselves with skills and experience in doing archaeology.  Clearly, collaborative archaeology is not a panacea for the difficulties facing indigenous groups, but in certain situations . . . it can be a powerful tool&lt;ref&gt;Kerber (2006a:xxii)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dean and Perrelli have noted that collaboration with American Indians is only new “from the perspective of the dominant culture”&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:144)&lt;/ref&gt; and that “American Indian people have been cooperating and collaborating with their neighbors and visitors for hundreds of years.”&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:145)&lt;/ref&gt;
Some have argued that archaeologists should attempt to collaborate and repatriate materials to non-federally recognized tribes in addition to federally recognized ones.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Blume has contended that when collaborating with American Indians should design "forms of public outreach specifically for the Indian audience."&lt;ref&gt;Blume (2006:198)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many recognized and non-recognized tribes have explicitly asked archaeologists for consolation and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;See Marshall (2002) and cases in Kerber (2006b)&lt;/ref&gt;
Two particularly well known examples of indigenous collaboration are [[Janet Spector]]’s book [[What does this Awl Mean]] and the [[Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site]].&lt;ref&gt;See Marshall (2002:212-214); Spector (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Collaborations have occurred throughout the United States, including with [[Alaska Natives]].&lt;ref&gt;See Knecht (2003); Hollowell-Zimmer (2003); Hollowell (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many tribes have also begun hiring full-time tribal archaeologists.

====Local and descendent communities====
Many other community archaeology projects occur in the United States aside from those with American Indians.  These projects focus on [[local communities]], [[descendent communities]], and descendent [[diasporas]].&lt;ref&gt;See Singleton and Orser (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  A goal of some of these projects has been to recover and publicly present forgotten aspects of the race relations in local communities—such as histories of slavery and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;See McDavid (2002, 2003); Singleton and Orser (2003); Shackel (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public education====
As a form of public outreach and collaboration, many archaeology projects in the United States have taken steps to present their work in schools and to children.  These projects vary from a "one time" presentation to local schools, to long-term commitments in which public education is an intricate part of the research design.&lt;ref&gt;De Cunzo and Jameson (2007); Jeppson and Brauer (2007); Atalay (2007); Wille (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community archaeology in the United Kingdom===

====History====
Community archaeology in the United Kingdom has existed for many years, although only recently has it come to be known by that name.  The roots of archaeology in the United Kingdom lie in the tradition of antiquarian and amateur work,&lt;ref&gt;Also see Trigger (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and many county or locally based archaeology and history societies founded over a century ago have continued to enable the involvement of local people in archaeology.  Up until the 1970s volunteers often had opportunities to initiate or take part in archaeological investigations.  Since then the recognition that more investigations were required by the subsequent establishment of archaeological units eroded some of these opportunities; more significantly the introduction of archaeology to the legalities of the planning process through Planning Policy Guidance note 16 (PPG16) and the full professionalization of archaeology, has made public participation in archaeology extremely limited.

====Public participation====
Archaeology (including historic buildings, landscapes and monuments, as well as ‘traditional’ archaeology) is about people and the discovery of the past.  As a subject, archaeology in the United Kingdom has been increasingly brought into the public eye in recent years.  The most common form of community archaeology in the United Kingdom has come from the grass roots level. Local groups are smaller than the large, county societies, and operate in their own area and at their own pace. The work produced is often of a high standard, reflecting the amount of time and effort local people are willing to put into local projects they themselves initiated.  Increasingly, over the last two decades, public participation has been pushed aside by developer-led, commercial archaeology, with the bulk of work going to contracting units. The reasons behind this relate to the professionalization of the discipline and the implementation of PPG16, as discussed by Faulkner who proposed a return to community-led archaeology in his article entitled “Archaeology from below”.&lt;ref&gt;See Faulkner (2000) and Faulkner (2001/2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
A recent investigation carried out by the Council for British Archaeology&lt;ref&gt;See Farley (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; identified the main perceived barriers to public participation, gave examples of good practice in encouraging public participation, and made several recommendations for future improvements.  Its first recommendation was the establishment of full-time Community Archaeologist posts across the country, as it states, “such dedicated posts represent a very effective way of stimulating and guiding public participation at a local level.”&lt;ref&gt;Farley (2003:14)&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the longest running and most successful community archaeology projects is based in Leicestershire.&lt;ref&gt;Schadla-Hall (forthcoming)&lt;/ref&gt; Leicestershire County Council (which incorporates the museum service) established the project in 1976 and today they have 400 members within 20 local groups across the county. Peter Liddle (Keeper of Archaeology) is the Community Archaeologist and was probably the first to use the term ‘community archaeology’ as the title for his fieldworker’s handbook.&lt;ref&gt;See Liddle (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Valletta Convention====
The Valletta Convention affects the work of non-official or amateur groups who have been, or are, investigating their local historic environment.  The European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (Revised) was signed in Valletta in 1992, and ratified by the UK government before coming into force on 21 March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.archaeologyuk.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 of the document caused considerable debate as it stated that all archaeological work should be carried out by suitably qualified, authorized people.&lt;ref&gt;Current Archaeology (2001a; 2001b)&lt;/ref&gt; This form of ‘licensing’ for archaeologists already exists in the rest of Europe, where it has limited the work of voluntary archaeologists and local societies.

===Community archaeology in Australia ===
Australian Community Archaeology has a long history of community archaeology, with established disciplines and laws.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2002"&gt;Marshall (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  In her review of community archaeology, Marshall found that there is an “antipodean dominance” in field community archaeology, suggesting that Australian community archaeology may be more established as a discipline than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:212)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is reflected in anthologies on community archaeology in Harrison and Williamson&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Williamson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and Colley.&lt;ref&gt;Colley (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally Australian community archaeology projects have involved collaboration between archaeologists and aboriginal tribes similar to archaeologists in the United States collaborate with American Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002); Fredericksen (2002); Clarke (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community archaeology outside of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia===
Hundreds, if not thousands, of community archaeology projects have occurred throughout the world—including in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;Funari et al. (2007); Najjar and Najjar (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Friesen (2002); Doroszenko (2007); Fry (2007); Hansen and Fowler (2007); Pope and Mills (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;Moser et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Breglia, (2007); Rodriguez, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; the People's Republic of Bangladesh,&lt;ref&gt;Sen (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Segobye (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand (Praicharnjit 2006, www.archaeopen.com)and Turkey.&lt;ref name="Atalay 2007"&gt;Atalay (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Wikipedia would greatly appreciate if scholars, students, or members of communities affiliated with Community Archaeology projects would contribute to this page.

==Communities==

===Definitions===
In a reduced sense, [[communities]] are aggregations of people that “are seldom, if ever, monocultural and are never of one mind.”&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:215)&lt;/ref&gt;  For understanding the goals of community archaeology projects it is helpful to classify these communities into three broad and overlapping types.  That is local communities, local descent communities, and non-local descent communities or [[diaspora]]s.”&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:216); Singleton and Orser (2003:144)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local communities and non-local descent communities===
Descent communities are those ancestrally linked to a site.  Descent communities located within proximity of the site are local descent communities, and non-local descent communities “are groups that are linked to a site, but that live in another location, potentially hundreds or even thousands of miles away.”&lt;ref&gt;Singleton and Orser (2003:144)&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeological collaborations with local descent communities include those that focus on proto-historic sites and collaborate with American Indians ancestrally linked to them, or plantation excavations that incorporate collaborations with the local ancestors of slaves who worked at the plantation.&lt;ref&gt;Hollowell (2006); Hollowell-Zimmer (2003); Singleton (2003); Shackel (2007); McDavid (2003); McDavid (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of community projects involving non-local descent communities include those where archaeologists set up museums for non-locals to come and visit.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2003); Smith et al. (2003); Jones and McBride (2006); Wille (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-descent local communities===
Local communities are simply communities that live “either on or close to a site”&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:216)&lt;/ref&gt; and non-descent local communities are those not believed ancestrally related to the site. This category includes landowners, local volunteers, local organizations, and local stakeholders.  Some feel that many of the major issues in community archaeology are applicable to non-local descent communities, and that these collaborations are crucial for archaeologists seeking to understand the local social context of their work.&lt;ref name="Atalay 2007"/&gt;

==Major issues==

===Decolonization of archaeology===
Archaeology is a practice whose history is entrenched in [[colonialism]], and many archaeologists and communities contend that archaeology has never escaped its [[colonial past]].&lt;ref&gt;See Pyburn (2003); Pyburn (2004); Atalay (2006); Trigger (2007); Pyburn (2008b)&lt;/ref&gt;  A major goal of many community archaeologists and community archaeology projects is to [[decolonize]] archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006); Pyburn (2008a); Pyburn (2004); Spector (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  In decolonizing archaeology, archaeologists are trying to give communities more control over every stage in the archaeological process.  For example, some programs have begun attempting to bring Indigenous leaders together globally to discuss shared methods for decolonization through archaeological collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;See Atalay (2006), Atalay (2007), Pyburn (2008b)&lt;/ref&gt;    Community archaeology, the sharing of archaeological knowledge, and the below major issues have been viewed as a crucial parts of decolonization.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006); Pyburn (2008a); Pyburn (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-reflexivity===
Community archaeology can alleviate or prevent violence towards communities that archaeology may cause.  Self-reflexivity in archaeology can be thought of as looking into a metaphorical mirror, and includes attempts to make explicitly make visible the violence—such as colonization—archaeology has been implicitly part of.&lt;ref name="Spector 1993"&gt;Spector (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-reflexivity in archaeology can be part of community presentation, as a means of breaking down imbalanced power dynamics between non-academic communities and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;Moser et al. (2002:234)&lt;/ref&gt;  Self-reflection amongst archaeologists—such as discussion with community members, writing field journals, and professional writings about self-reflection—can also be a means for identifying unethical and violent aspects of archaeological projects.&lt;ref&gt;Edgeworth (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public outreach===
Public [[outreach]], in archaeology, is a form of [[science outreach]] that attempts to present archaeological findings to non-archaeologists.  Public outreach is usually a crucial aspect of most community archaeology projects.&lt;ref&gt;Specter (1993); Herscher and McManamon (1995); Jameson (2003); Lynott (2003) Wille (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Public outreach can take many forms, from a onetime presentation to a local school to long-term agreements with local communities in developing intricate public outreach programs.&lt;ref name="Atalay 2007"/&gt;  Many feel that archaeology and archaeological findings have been greatly distorted by the popular media and through western associations, and that public outreach is the only way non-archaeologists will be able to understand what archaeologists actually do and find.&lt;ref&gt;Pyburn (2008a)&lt;/ref&gt;
On another level, public participation can mean local people taking part in training excavations, and this type of involvement results in a hands-on learning experience in archaeological techniques.

==Approaches to community archaeology==

===Community interpretation===
Interpretation of archaeological findings by the community is a quintessential aspect of community archaeology, and is viewed as an important aspect of “decolonizing archaeology” and giving non-archaeologists power to interpreting the past.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;   Multiple community archaeologists have created projects that give the community a major role in the interpretation and dissemination of archaeological information.&lt;ref name="Marshall 2002"/&gt;  Community participation is not relegated to the interpretation of discoveries but includes contributions to any aspect of archaeology—such as theory&lt;ref&gt;See [[de-centering]] in Atalay (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and project goals.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (2002); Moser et al. (2002); Kuhns (2008); Watson and Waterman (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;   Community involvement ends the exclusive control that archaeologists have had over the material past, and gives non-archaeologists a chance to interpret the past.&lt;ref name="Spector 1993"/&gt;  Many archaeologists now argue that the incorporation of local knowledge is important to archaeology’s survival as an academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1980); Watkins (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree of interpretive control communities have in archaeological projects vary from using interpretations garnered from interviews and consultations,&lt;ref&gt;Sanger et al. (2006:325)&lt;/ref&gt;  to academic publication written by community members based on community identified research questions.&lt;ref&gt;See Wiynjorroc et al. (2005); Dean and Perrelli (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term commitment===
Ethnographers and development specialists have shown&lt;ref name="Pyburn 2007:177"&gt;Pyburn (2007:177)&lt;/ref&gt; that a long-term relationship is necessary to develop a rapport and mutual respect with the local community, and argue that to succeed at collaboration archaeologists must make a long-term commitment&lt;ref&gt;Pyburn (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  in order to understand the dynamics of the social context of their research. Without this depth of knowledge archaeologists risk making decisions with unintended consequences.&lt;ref name="Pyburn 2007"&gt;Pyburn (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, collaborations and repatriations have been more successful where archaeologists and American Indians have met on a regular basis and developed both friendship and mutual respect.&lt;ref&gt;Versaggi (2006:30); Dean and Perrelli (2006:142-143)&lt;/ref&gt;  Versaggi found that “allowing the process to take time is what matters.”&lt;ref&gt;Versaggi (2006:30)&lt;/ref&gt;   Many community archaeologists now plan on conducting long-term collaborations from the outset of their project.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht (2003) Moser et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnography and getting to know the community===
As a method for knowing the community, archaeologists have advocated the use of [[ethnographic]] methods in community archaeology projects.&lt;ref name="Pyburn 2007"/&gt;  While most scholars feel that it is not necessary for all archaeologists to become trained ethnographers, a degree of ethnographic knowledge is needed before initiating a project.&lt;ref name="Pyburn 2007:177"/&gt;  Some community archaeology projects rely on ethnographic data conducted by members of their research team,&lt;ref&gt;Bartu as cited Atalay (2007:257)&lt;/ref&gt; while others have had some success beginning with published sources or collaborating with professionals already established in the focal community.

===Museums and institutions===
The construction of museums or other institutions as education centers,  repositories for archaeological materials and, centers for scientific and socio-cultural collaboration with a community is a common long-term goal for many community archaeology projects, and one achieved with increasing frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Moser (2002); Knecht (2003); Smith (2003); Jones and McBride (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Museums have become hubs for public outreach and collaboration to both local and non-local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Wille (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  One well known example of a museum created by a collaboration between American Indians and archaeologists is the [[Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center]], which is “the largest Native American owned museum in the United States”,&lt;ref&gt;Jones and McBride (2006:275)&lt;/ref&gt; has multiple laboratories and collections for scientific research, and a staff that includes five full-time archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Jones and McBride 2006"&gt;Jones and McBride (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications for the community===
Another method in community archaeology for the sharing and distribution of archaeological knowledge is the publication or presentation of materials specifically for the community.  This includes books, pamphlets, children’s stories,&lt;ref name="Jones and McBride 2006"/&gt; school-oriented workbooks,&lt;ref&gt;Moser et al. (2002:238-239)&lt;/ref&gt; comic books,&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2007:260-261)&lt;/ref&gt; websites,&lt;ref&gt;McDavid (2002, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; public lectures, radio programs, television shows and news coverage, dramatic reenactments, artistic and literary creations, and other forms.

===Participatory action research===
[[Participatory action research]] is another method archaeologists have used in community archaeology projects.&lt;ref&gt;Strand et al. (2003); Hemment (2007); Pyburn (2007); Kuhns (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

===Who speaks for the community?===
In community archaeology, by definition decisions cannot be made based on the information from only a handful of members from a given community.  Although the number of consultants needed will vary, it is rare that a small subgroup can speak for the community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez (2008); also see Pyburn (2007); Wobst (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes it is clear who should be contacted in a community.  For example, archaeologists in the United States must contact the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) before attempting collaboration with federally recognized tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:142)&lt;/ref&gt;  In places where the appropriate contacts and stakeholders are less obvious, community archaeologists attempt to identify as many interest groups as possible and contact them before research begins.

===Top-down approach===
A [[top-down approach]] to community archaeology is when archaeologists decide before consultation what the goals of the project will be, or what benefits will be provided to the community is not really community archaeology at all.  The top-down approach creates a one-sided exchange of information from the archaeologists to the community and precludes real collaboration.  Blume found the “archaeologist-informant relationship [to be] essentially exploitative and patronizing because it takes place on the archaeologist’s terms—the informant must address issues that the archaeologists understand—and it excludes participation by [community members] who are unable or unwilling to participate on those terms.”&lt;ref&gt;Blume (2006:197)&lt;/ref&gt;  To succeed at community archaeology, Archaeologists have begun to undertake more reflexive collaborations with indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006); Pyburn (2007); Pyburn (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carrying through with long-term commitments===
Some community archaeologists have had difficulty sticking to their original commitments to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (2002:218); Singleton (2003); Rodriguez (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consultation and collaboration===
Some have argued that ‘consulting’ archaeologists do not relinquish control over the process of interpretation, and that consulting is a ‘top-down’ approach to collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Atalay (2006); Clarke (2002); Versaggi (2006);Watkins (2003); Blume (2006:210)&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, some definitions of the word ‘collaboration’ make allusions to opposed and/or warring parties cooperating with one another during tense or bellicose times.  Dean has proposed that the word cooperate be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Dean and Perrelli (2006:145); also see Brown and Robinson (2006:62); Blume (2006:210)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2632">'''Cornelis de Waard''' (born August 19, 1879 in [[Bergen op Zoom]], died in [[Vlissingen]] on May 6, 1963) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] math teacher and a historian who specialized in researching science and mathematics of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph W. Dauben, Christoph J. Scriba, Writing the History of Mathematics: Its Historical Development, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2002, page 409&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
De Waard studied mathematics and physics in [[Amsterdam]] and was then a teacher in [[The Hague]], [[Winschoten]], and from 1909 until retirement in 1944, lived in [[Vlissingen]].

==Historical work==
de Waard was particularly concerned with mathematicians of the first half of the 17th century such as [[René Descartes]], [[Pierre de Fermat]], [[Gilles Personne de Roberval]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Girard Desargues]]. He discovered and published several original writings of scholars of the seventeenth century, including 8 volumes of the correspondence [[Marin Mersenne]] and the journals of [[Isaac Beeckman]]. He assisted [[Étienne Gilson]] in the preparation of his edition of Descartes' ''[[Discourse on the Method]]''. In his 1906 “De uitvinding der verrekijkers” ("The Discovery of the Telescope"), one of the first modern works on the subject, he put forward evidence that supported Middelburg spectacle-maker [[Zacharias Janssen]] as the inventor of the device.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupré, Rob van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope, Amsterdam University Press - 2010, page 37-39&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniele Ganser''' (born August 29, 1972 in Lugano) is a [[Swiss]] [[historian]]. He became known in Europe with his 2005 book ''NATO's Secret Armies'', an adaption of his 2001 dissertation. Since then he has published, among other things, on open and covert military actions of [[NATO]] countries, which he describes as being contrary to international law, as well as on the global maximum production of crude oil. He picks up on various conspiracy theories, especially on [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11]] and presents them as explanatory approaches still to be examined by scientists. Many media label him a [[conspiracy theorist]] and scientists dissociate themselves.

==Background==
Ganser was born in [[Lugano]], Switzerland and was Senior Researcher at the [[ETH Zurich]], [[Center for Security Studies (CSS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiv.ethlife.ethz.ch/e/articles/sciencelife/9.11.html |title=sciencelife:ETH Life - ETH Zurich's weekly web journal |website=Archiv.ethlife.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was president (2006–2012) of the Swiss branch of the "Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas" (ASPO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aspo.ch/?page_id=862|title=ASPO Switzerland – Association for the Study of Peak Oil|last=|first=|date=2015-11-24|website=Aspo.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught a summer course titled ''History and Future of Energy Systems'' at the [[University of St. Gallen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danieleganser.ch/Biographie.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110112244/http://www.danieleganser.ch:80/Biographie.html |archivedate=2013-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egi.unisg.ch/en/lehreweiterbildung |title=University of St.Gallen &amp;#124; EGI-HSG &amp;#124; Teaching and Executive Education at EGI |website=Egi.unisg.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''NATO's Secret Armies''==
In 2004, Ganser published ''NATO's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe''. In this book, Ganser states that [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] units were in close cooperation with NATO and the CIA and that Gladio in Italy was responsible for terrorist attacks against the Italian civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Anton, Michael Schetsche, Michael K. Walter ''Konspiration'' p. 175, Springer VS 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-531-19324-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer Henrik Hansen, a scholar at [[Roskilde University]], wrote two scathing criticisms of the book for the ''[[International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence]]'' and the ''Journal of Intelligence History'', describing Ganser's work as "a journalistic book with a big spoonful of conspiracy theories" that "fails to present proof of and an in-depth explanation of the claimed conspiracy between USA, CIA, NATO and the European countries."  Hansen also criticized Ganser for basing his "claim of the big conspiracy" on the [[US Army Field Manual 30-31B]], which members of the intelligence community claim is just a 'Cold War era hoax document.'&lt;ref&gt;Peer Henrik Hansen, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070826145603/http://www.intelligence-history.org/jih/reviews-5-1.html Review of NATO’s Secret Armies]," Journal of Intelligence History, Summer 2005. ''Web Archive - archived website of August 26, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peer Henrik Hansen, "Falling Flat on the Stay-Behinds," International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, January 2006, 182-186.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hayden Peake's book review ''Intelligence in Recent Public Literature'' describes: "Ganser fails to document his thesis that the CIA, MI6, and NATO and its friends turned GLADIO into a terrorist organization."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no3/html_files/Bookshelf_11.htm ''The Intelligence Officer’s Bookshelf''] Hayden Peake, ''CIA,'' April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

Philip H.J. Davies of the [[Brunel University London|Brunel University]] Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies likewise concludes that the book is "marred by imagined conspiracies, exaggerated notions of the scale and impact of covert activities, misunderstandings of the management and coordination of operations within and between national governments, and... an almost complete failure to place the actions and decisions in question in the appropriate historical context." According to Davies, "The underlying problem is that Ganser has not really undertaken the most basic necessary research to be able to discuss covert action and special operations effectively".&lt;ref&gt;Philip HJ Davies, "Review of NATO’s Secret Armies," The Journal of Strategic Studies, December 2005, 1064-1068.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Olav Riste]] of the [[Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies]], writing for the journal ''Intelligence and National Security'', mentions several instances where his own research on the stay-behind network in Norway was twisted by Ganser and concludes that "A detailed refutation of the many unfounded allegations that Ganser accepts as historical findings would fill an entire book".&lt;ref&gt;Olav Riste, "Review of NATO’s Secret Armies," Intelligence and National Security, September 2005, 550-551.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later joint article with Leopoldo Nuti of the [[Roma Tre University|University of Rome III]], the two concluded that the book's "ambitious conclusions do not seem to be entirely corroborated by a sound evaluation of the sources available."&lt;ref&gt;Olav Riste and Leopoldo Nuti, "Introduction: Strategy of 'Stay-Behind'," The Journal of Strategic Studies, December 2007, 930.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence F. Kaplan|Lawrence Kaplan]] wrote a mixed review commending Ganser for making "heroic efforts to tease out the many strands that connect this interlocking right-wing conspiracy", but also arguing that "Connecting the dots between terrorist organizations in NATO countries and a master plan centred in NATO's military headquarters requires a stretch of facts that Ganser cannot manage." Kaplan believes that some of Ganser's theories "may be correct", but that "they do damage to the book's credibility."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Kaplan, "Review of NATO’s Secret Armies," The International History Review, September 2006, 685-686.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a mostly positive review for the journal ''Cold War History'', [[Beatrice Heuser]] praised Ganser's "fascinating study" while also noting that "It would definitely have improved the work if Ganser had used a less polemical tone, and had occasionally conceded that the Soviet Empire was by no means nicer".&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Heuser, "Review of NATO’s Secret Armies," Cold War History, November 2006, 567-568.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Security analyst [[John Prados]] writes "Ganser, the principal analyst of Gladio, presents evidence across many nations that Gladio networks amounted to anti-democratic elements in their own societies."&lt;ref&gt;John Prados ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA'' 2006, p. 95, {{ISBN|9781615780112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[State Department]] stated in 2006 that Ganser had been taken in by long-discredited Cold-War era disinformation and "fooled by the forgery". In an article about the Gladio/stay-behind networks and [[US Army Field Manual 30-31B]] they stated, "Ganser treats the forgery as if it was a genuine document in his 2005 book on “stay behind” networks, ''Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe'' and includes it as a key document on his Web site on the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html |title=Misinformation about "Gladio/Stay Behind" Networks Resurfaces - US Department of State |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710005257/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html |archivedate=2008-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==9/11 opinion==
Ganser wrote a chapter for [[David Ray Griffin]]'s book ''9/11 &amp; American Empire''. Ganser argues that all three versions &amp;ndash; the "surprise" theory (the commonly accepted version that he calls "the official version") as well as the versions that the administration let the attack go ahead or even planned it &amp;ndash; are all actually [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. The U.S. Embassy has protested Ganser's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Vonplon |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/25/september-11-anniversary-switzerland-conspiracy-theories-_n_908811.html |title=September 11 Anniversary: Why Switzerland Is A New Hotbed Of 9/11 Conspiracy Theories |website=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ganser is known for relating the events of 9/11 to his research on Operation Gladio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.journalof911studies.com/resources/2014GanserVol39May.pdf |format=PDF |title=The "Strategy of Tension" in the Cold War Period* |journal=Journal of 9/11 Studies |volume=39 |date=May 2014 |author=Daniele Ganser |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that the [[strategy of tension]], which Ganser links to Operation Gladio, sought to pin right-wing terrorist attacks on the political left in order to inspire fear among the citizenry, Ganser likewise contends that "it has been said that [[Saddam Hussein]] had biological weapons, that there was a link between Iraq and the attacks of September 11, or that there was a link between Iraq and the terrorists of [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]]. But all this was not true. By these lies, we wanted to make the world believe that the Muslims wanted to spread terrorism around, that this war was necessary to fight terror. However, the real reason for the war is the control of energy resources."&lt;ref name="cattori"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article144415.html|title=Le terrorisme non revendiqué de l'OTAN, par Silvia Cattori|author=Silvia Cattori|work=[[Voltaire Network|Réseau Voltaire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganser also calls into question the conclusions of the [[9/11 Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin (dir), ''9/11 American Empire: Intellectual speaks out'', Olive Branch Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"9/11 Commission Report questioned by 100 professors," News &amp; Politics Examiner, September 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that "the official story about September 11th, the conclusions of the commission, are not credible" and "The information that we have is not very precise. Which raises the question in this report of 600 pages is that the third tower that collapsed that day is not even mentioned."&lt;ref name="cattori"/&gt; Ganser says we would only know because of blurred video images, something flew into the Pentagon, an open, objective and scientific debate on all outstanding issues of 9/11 would be important and calls for a new investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/dossiers/9-11/historiker-daniele-ganser-fordert-911-neu-zu-untersuchen-112899879 |title=Historiker Daniele Ganser fordert, 9/11 neu zu untersuchen - 9-11 - dossiers - az Aargauer Zeitung |website=Aargauerzeitung.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniele Ganser is a member of the [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 Consensus Panel]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.consensus911.org/panel-members/#ganser&lt;/ref&gt; and said that "Because all three theories implicitly start from a secret agreement of two or more persons, all three must be called conspiracy theories."&lt;ref&gt;http://911untersuchen.ch/wissenschaft/daniele-ganser/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Edmund Kerchever Chambers''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE|CB|FBA|sep=,|size=100}} (16 March 1866 &amp;ndash; 21 January 1954), usually known as '''E. K. Chambers''', was an [[English people|English]] literary critic and [[Shakespeare]]an scholar. His four-volume work on ''The Elizabethan Stage'', published in 1923, remains a standard resource.

==Biography==
Chambers was born in [[West Ilsley]], [[Berkshire]]. His father was a [[curate]] there and his mother the daughter of a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theologian. He was educated at [[Marlborough College]], before matriculating at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. He won a number of prizes, including the chancellor's prize in English for an essay on literary [[forgery]]. He took a job with the national education department, and married Eleanor Bowman in 1893.

In the newly created Board of Education, Chambers worked principally to oversee adult and continuing education. He rose to be second secretary, but the work for which he is remembered took place outside the office, at least before he retired from the Board in 1926. He was the first president of the [[Malone Society]], serving from 1906 to 1939. He edited collections of verse for Oxford University Press. He produced a work on [[King Arthur]] and a privately printed collection of poems.

However, Chambers's great work, begun even before he left Oxford and pursued for three decades, was a great examination of the history and conditions of English theatre in the medieval and Renaissance periods. This study, which Chambers (in the preface to ''Elizabethan Stage'') called prolegomena to a "little book on Shakespeare," was published in three bursts. ''The Medieval Stage'', issued in 1903, offered a comprehensive survey of medieval theatre, covering not only the fairly well-known interludes, but also the then-obscure folk drama, [[minstrel]]sy, and [[miracle play|liturgical drama]]. ''The Elizabethan Stage'' followed after two decades. The work, though it contained less original discovery than its predecessor, remains among the most useful depictions of the material conditions of [[English Renaissance theatre]]. [[W. W. Greg]] described it as "one of those books which perhaps no living person is in a position to criticise adequately." It remains in use today. In 1930 came at last the two-volume work on Shakespeare, which collected and analysed the extant evidence of Shakespeare's work and life.

In his retirement, Chambers produced works on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Matthew Arnold]]. After moving to [[Eynsham]], [[Oxfordshire]], he returned to medieval history, producing a volume in the Oxford history and a local study of Eynsham. He died in 1954.

Chambers was invested as a Companion of the [[Order of the Bath]] in 1912, [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] in 1925. In 1924, he was elected fellow of the [[British Academy]] and his biography ''Samuel Taylor Coleridge'' was awarded the 1938 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]].

'''Elaine Fantham''' (née Crosthwaite, 25 May 1933 – 11 July 2016) was a British-Canadian [[Classics|classicist]] whose expertise lay particularly in [[Latin literature]], especially comedy, epic poetry and rhetoric, and in the social history of Roman women.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elainefantham.com/about/about.html|title=Elaine Fantham: Scholar of Ancient Greece and Rome|last=Fantham|first=Jennifer|website=''elainefantham.com''|access-date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://classics.princeton.edu/department/news/elaine-fantham-1933-2016|title=Elaine Fantham 1933-2016 {{!}} Princeton Classics|website=classics.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of her work was concerned with the intersection of literature and Greek and Roman history.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; She spoke fluent Italian, German and French and presented lectures and conference papers around the world—including in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Argentina, and Australia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.utoronto.ca/elaine-fantham/|title=In Memoriam: R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17628">'''Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri''' (1651–1725) was a seventeenth-century [[Italy|Italian]] adventurer and traveler. He was among the first [[Europe]]ans to tour the world by securing passage on ships involved in the carrying trade; his travels, undertaken for pleasure rather than profit, may have inspired ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]].'' Some suspected him of spying for the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on his journey.

==Biographic information==
Gemelli Careri was born in [[Taurianova]], 1651, and died in [[Naples]], 1725.  He obtained a doctorate in law at the College of Jesuits in Naples.  After completing his studies he briefly entered the judiciary.  In 1685 he took time off to travel around Europe (France, Spain, Germany, and Hungary).  In Hungary he was wounded when an army of Turks besieged [[Buda]].

In 1687 he returned to Naples and re-entered the judiciary.  He also began work on his first two books: "Relazione delle Campagne d'Ungheria" (1689) with co-author Matteo Egizio, and "Viaggi in Europa" (1693).  At this time Gemelli encountered frustrations with his legal profession.  He was denied certain opportunities because he did not have an established aristocratic origin.  Eventually, he decided to suspend his career for a round-the-world trip.  This five-year trip would lead to his best known six-volume book, ''Giro Del Mondo'' (1699).&lt;ref&gt;Source Article: [[:it:Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri|Giovanni_Francesco_Gemelli_Careri]]; Angela Amuso Maccarrone, ''Gianfrancesco Gemelli-Careri. L'Ulisse del XVII secolo'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==World voyage==
[[Image:Description De Mexico et des Lagunes De Ses Environs Gemelli Careri.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Map of the area around Mexico City, centered on the large Lagune de Mexico.  Many villages are located including Pachuca, Tacoma, Atlapilco, Tolodyuca, Tetlapanaloya, and Apazco.]]
[[Image:Voyage Du Tour Du Monde.jpg|thumb|Title image taken from a French translation of the book: "Voyage du Tour du Monde"]]

Gemelli Careri realized that he could finance his trip by carefully purchasing goods at each stage that would have enhanced value at the next stage: at [[Bandar-Abbas]] on the [[Persian Gulf]], he asserts, the traveler should pick up "dates, wine, spirits, and all the fruits of Persia, which one carries to India either dried or pickled in vinegar, on which one makes a good profit".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Fernand Braudel]]. The Wheels of Commerce: Civilisation and Capitalism 15th-18th Century'' 1979 p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gemelli Careri started his world trip in 1693, with a visit to Egypt, [[Constantinople]], and the [[Holy Land]]. At the time, this Middle Eastern route was already becoming a standard ingredient of any excursion into foreign lands, a hike that was almost not worth writing home about. However, from there the Italian 'tourist' would take less traveled paths. After crossing [[Armenia]] and [[Persia]], he visited Southern [[India]] and entered [[China]], where the [[Jesuit missionaries]] assumed that such an unusual Italian visitor could be a spy working for the pope. This fortuitous misunderstanding opened for Gemelli many of the most tightly closed doors of the country. He got to visit the emperor at [[Beijing]], attended the [[Lantern Festival]] celebrations and toured the [[Great Wall]].

"Almost all the structure, as has been said, is of brick, so well built that it does not only last but looks new after several ages.  It is above 1800 years since the Emperor Xi-hoam-ti caused it to be built against the incursions of the Tartars.  This was one of the greatest, and most extravagant works that ever was undertaken. In prudence the Chinese should have secured the most dangerous passes:  But what I thought most ridiculous was to see the wall run up to the top of a vast high and steep mountain, where the Birds would hardly build much less the Tartar horses climb... And if they conceited those people could make their way climbing the clefts and rocks it was certainly a great folly to believe their fury could be stopped by so low a wall."&lt;ref&gt;"Voyage Round the World", 1704, London: Vol. 4, p. 323-324&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Macau]], Gemelli Careri sailed to the [[Philippines]], where he stayed two months while waiting for the departure of a [[Manila galleon]], for which he carried [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]], for a 300% profit in Mexico. In the meantime, as Gemelli described it in his journal, the half-year-long transoceanic trip to [[Acapulco]] was a nightmare plagued with bad food, epidemic outbursts, and the occasional storm. In [[Mexico]], he became friends with Mexican creole patriot and savant Don [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]], who took the Italian traveler to the great ruins of [[Teotihuacan]]. Sigüenza spoke with Gemelli about his theories of the ancient Mexicans and entrusted him with information about the Mexican calendar, which appeared in Gemelli's account.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Brading, ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492-1867,'' New York: Cambridge University Press 1991, 363, 366-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as having visited the pyramids at Teotihuacan, he also visited several mining towns. After leaving Mexico city he visited the city of Puebla de Los Angeles and several towns as he traveled to the port city of Veracruz, where he joined a Spanish fleet to Cuba. After five years of wandering around the world, Gemelli was finally on his way back to Europe when he joined the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Source Article:  Denis, Adrian L.

The aim of ''Giro Del Mondo'' - a faithful description of the countries visited - was emphasized by Giosef-Antonio Guerrieri in his preface.  While pointing out the difference between the account of a journey and "an imaginary journey", Guerrieri praised Gemelli Careri for the reliability of his experiences, and criticized those who were prone to fantasize over geographic maps.

For many years scholars and experts did not consider Gemelli Careri's adventurous journey authentic.  With time, however, its truthfulness was proved, and it was also ascertained that he collected important historical documents in order to know those exotic realities in greater detail.  Indeed, the sixth volume of ''Giro Del Mondo'', which covers only [[Mexico]], contains information gathered from codices that existed prior to the Conquest, which he got access to via Don [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]]; it also contains several illustrations of [[Aztec]] warriors gathered from these codices.  In [[New Spain]], Gemelli Careri had the opportunity to study the [[pyramids]] carefully (their affinity to the Egyptian pyramids led him to believe that the [[ancient Egyptians]] and the [[Amerindians]] both descended from the inhabitants of [[Atlantis]]), which Sigüenza had long held.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Brading, ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492-1867,'' New York: Cambridge University Press 1991 p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Stefania Buccini: ''The Americas in Italian literature and culture, 1700-1825'' Penn State Press, 1997 p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Due to lack of funds, Sigüenza himself had been unable to publish much on the ancient Mexicans, but through Gemelli's work was able to disseminate his ideas and even drawings from the ancient Mexican manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Irving A. Leonard, ''Baroque Times in Old Mexico: Seventeenth-Century Persons, Places, and Practices,'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press 1959, pp. 201-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1849 release of ''The [[Calcutta Review]]'' (a periodical now published by the [[University of Calcutta]]), stated the following about Gemelli's writings concerning [[India]]: "In a previous number of this Review we made an attempt to describe something of the Court and Camp of the best and wisest prince Muhainmedan India had ever beheld (Aurungzebe, [[Mughal Empire|Mogul]] emperor of [[Hindustan]])... To this we are urged by two main considerations, the character of the age, and the materials at our command.... Sir H. M. Elliot's work has... met with, to a certain extent, adverse criticism, and some doubts have been raised as to the soundness, or the justice, of its conclusions. It is therefore (possible that readers may be willing) to peruse a description of the Government of Aurungzebe, taken not from native historians, but from the accounts of men who saw with the eyes of travelers.

From three men, who all visited India during the reign of [[Aurungzebe]], the most valuable and the most curious information is attainable... The second of the triumvirate, on whom we mainly rely, is the Doctor John Francis Gemelli Careri.  Natural curiosity and domestic misfortunes were, he tells us, his motives for traveling.  Of the three (sources this paper is based), he is the most discursive in his narration, the most piquant in his anecdotes, the most amusing in his simplicity. As he traveled for no one particular aim, but to see and to hear, there are few Indian topics, on which he does not give us something. Natural productions, the beasts and the birds, manners, [[Hindu theology]], state maxims, the causes of Portuguese supremacy and degradation, anecdotes of the camp, the convent, and the Harem, accidents by water and land, complaints of personal inconvenience, and remarks on the tendency of Eastern despotism, are scattered plentifully throughout a narrative, which owes very much to the author's own liveliness and observation, but occasionally something, we are compelled to say, to the labours of others who had gone before. His plagiarism is, however, confined to specifications of caste or creed. Where he saw or suffered personally, his narrative is clear, picturesque, and beyond suspicion." &lt;ref&gt;Quoted by: ''The Calcutta Review Volumes 11-12, University of Calcutta, 1849, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53953">The '''history of the Jews in Laupheim''' began in the first half of the 18th century. Until the second half of the 19th century, the [[Jew]]ish community in [[Laupheim]], expanded continuously to become the largest of its kind in [[Württemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Sauer, ''Die jüdischen Gemeinden in Württemberg und Hohenzollern'', p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Jewish community gradually assimilated to its Christian surroundings and its members prospered until the beginning of the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-period in 1933. With the [[deportation]] of the last remaining Jews in 1942, more than 200 years of Jewish history in Laupheim forcibly came to an end.&lt;ref&gt;W. Eckert, "Zur Geschichte der Juden in Laupheim", p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
[[File:Jewish man - worms - 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|Jewish man wearing a distinguishing mark (16th century)]]
[[File:SwabianJew.jpg|thumb|right|A Jew of Swabia (Late 17th century)]]
At the beginning of the 18th century, Laupheim was a small market town in [[Upper Swabia]] and politically part of [[Further Austria]]. Jews were allowed to enter the town as [[Peddler|pedlars]] but permanent residence was refused. Since the 15th century, Jews were not allowed to settle within the territories of the surrounding [[Free Imperial City|free imperial cities]], nor in the [[History of Württemberg|Duchy of Württemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement of Jews in the territories of [[Imperial Knight]]s, however, was often welcomed. These rulers were often highly in debt due to the fragmentation of their territories, as was the case with Laupheim being separated into two independent states, Großlaupheim and Kleinlaupheim, as well as frequent wars. The income generated by [[taxation]] of the Jews helped to sustain the life-style of the nobility and also to stimulate the local economy.

[[Hans Pankraz von Freyberg]], the ruler of Laupheim between 1570 and 1582, explicitly forbade his subjects any contact with Jews&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Aich, ''Laupheim 1570 - 1870'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and another early local law from 1622 threatened any inhabitant of Laupheim, who got involved with Jews with a fine of 25 [[Florin (Italian coin)|fl]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (a), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; However, by then Jewish communities had already been established in [[Upper Swabia]]. The local ruler of the nearby village of [[Baltringen]] allowed Jews to settle there in 1572. In the villages of [[Schwendi, Baden-Württemberg|Schwendi]] and [[Orsenhausen]], the last of which still has a ''Judengasse'' ("Jews' Lane"), Jewish communities seem to have existed well before the 18th century. In Laupheim, the presence of Jewish traders on market days in the 17th century is documented.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, permanent Jewish presence in Laupheim was not permitted until the 18th century.

In 1724, Abraham Kissendorfer from [[Altenstadt (Iller)|Illeraichheim]] petitioned the owner of Großlaupheim, [[Constantin Adolf von Welden]], and the owner of Kleinlaupheim, [[Damian Carl von Welden]], to allow three Jewish families, later extended to twenty, to settle in Laupheim. After some negotiation, an agreement was reached and permission for a permanent Jewish presence was granted so that four Jewish families entered Laupheim: Leopold Jakob, Josef Schlesinger and Leopold Weil from [[Bad Buchau|Buchau]], and David Obernauer from [[Grundsheim]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 7f&lt;/ref&gt; The first protection contract between them and the local authorities dates from 1730 which indicates that the final arrival of the four Jewish families occurred in that year. This contract was at first limited to 20 years. The first house for the newly arrived Jews was erected between 1730 and 1731. The Jews had to contribute to the costs of the house with 100 fl each.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kullen, "Spurensuche", p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Various taxes, financial obligations and restrictions were imposed on the Jews: a special [[death duty]] as well as compensation for various services the local [[serf]]s were obliged to perform and from which the Jews were exempt, had to be paid; an extra [[Tax per head|tax per capita]] was also imposed by [[Austria]]n officials.&lt;ref name="G. Schenk p. 104"&gt;G. Schenk (a), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Jews had to wear special garment and hats and were allowed to trade in any goods except those that were considered to be of suspicious or dubious origin, such as wet cloth, unthreshed grain and untanned hide, as well as goods that had a particular [[Christian]], [[liturgy|liturgical]] character.&lt;ref name="L. Georg, p. 57"&gt;L. Georg, ''Historische Bauten'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Transactions of more than 4 fl had to be registered with the local authorities. The [[shechita|slaughter of animals according to Jewish rites]] and the selling of the meat itself were allowed. However, the tongue of each slaughtered cow as well as the innards of calves and sheep slaughtered according to Jewish rites had to be handed over to the authorities. Alternatively, 4 [[Kreuzer|kr]] could be paid for each slaughtered animal. Jews were not allowed to buy and own property and to prevent any of their community from converting to [[Christianity]]. On the other hand, they were strictly forbidden to convert any Christians to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Kullen, "Spurensuche", p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after 1730, more Jewish families came to Laupheim from [[Fellheim]], [[Fischach]], Illeraichheim&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and other places, where Jews had already been allowed to settle, so that, when, in 1754, the protection contract, which had expired some time before,&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; was renewed for another 30 years, the Jewish community in Laupheim had grown to 27 families. The contract was again renewed in 1784 and with each of these renewals a substantial fee of 800 fl had to be paid. The families arriving after 1750 had to have their houses built at their own expense. The area where those dwellings were built was allocated by the local rulers, who also kept the legal right to the properties. After 1784, these houses were held by the Jews as hereditary [[fief]]s from the local rulers.&lt;ref name="L. Georg, p. 57"/&gt;

A plot of uncultivated land to the north of the Jewish settlement in Laupheim was bought by the infant community shortly after their settlement to be used as a cemetery. Due to the rapid growth of the population the cemetery had to be expanded in 1784, 1856 and again 1877.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kullen, "Spurensuche", p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the quorum of ten or more adult male Jews was reached, ([[Minyan]]), the first Jews in Laupheim used a room on the first floor in the house of butcher Michael Laupheimer, located on the ''Judengasse'', for their religious services.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; However, the continuous, rapid growth of the Jewish community made it necessary to have a [[synagogue]] built. It was built as an L-shaped building next to the cemetery close to the spot where later on the Jewish mortuary was to be built.&lt;ref name="S. Kullen, Spurensuche, p. 51"&gt;S. Kullen, "Spurensuche", p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the unfree Christian population of both parts of Laupheim, the Jewish inhabitants had a considerable larger autonomy in administrating their own communal affairs. Around 1760, a [[Qahal|Jewish community]] seems to have been officially established with the permission to elect two ''parnassim'', chairmen of the community, one for each part of the divided Laupheim, as the town had been separated into Großlaupheim and Kleinlaupheim since 1621. The ''parnassim'' were allowed to make independent decision concerning the internal affairs of the Jewish community. Other tasks included the appointment of the [[rabbi]] and the ''[[chazzan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; These officials were not included in the number of [[Schutzjude]]n ("Protected Jews") and were exempt from the annual protection fee the other Jewish inhabitants of Laupheim had to pay. The Jewish community as a whole had to pay the fees for the ''parnassim'' and it also had to provide for their accommodation. The ''parnassim'' and the rabbi had restricted legal authority over members of the community, being permitted to exact, up to a certain amount, financial penalties.&lt;ref&gt;L. Georg, ''Historische Bauten'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases they were not allowed to decide, respected non-local rabbis were consulted and in very important legal disputes, the files were sent for consultation to the Jewish communities in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], [[Fürth]] or even as far as [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="G. Schenk p. 104"/&gt; In criminal cases and in disputes between Christians and Jews, the local ruler reserved the right to make a legal decision.

The settlement of the Jews in Laupheim developed on the so-called ''Judenberg'' ("Jews’ mountain" or rather "Jews’ hill") with the ''Judengasse'' ("Jews’ Lane") at its centre, a [[ghetto]]-like area, separated from the rest of the town, yet in close proximity to the market square. The ''Judenberg'' forms a regular square where the 8 oldest houses, arranged in 3 rows, are positioned parallel to one of the main streets leading away from the town centre.&lt;ref name="L. Georg, p. 57"/&gt; The local Jews were allowed to influence the planning and design of their houses from the end of the 18th century onwards. It is remarkable, even today, that all houses are approachable from the front as well as the back, and that even the front yards and front gardens are not fenced in. The reason for this lies in the fact that the ''Judengasse'' was meant to incorporate the whole Jewish settlement to form an ''[[eruv]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim Laupheim", p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

After having received the houses as hereditary fiefs in 1784, Jews were allowed to buy their houses from 1812 onwards. In 1807, 41 families lived in 17 houses on the ''Judenberg''. In 1820, the number had risen to 59 families living in 34 houses.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl,'' Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 30ff&lt;/ref&gt;

This growth in population made it necessary in 1822, to have an even bigger synagogue built. The new building was erected at a cost of 16.000 fl. However, due to errors made during the construction, the building had to be completely broken down less than 15 years later, to be replaced by a new building in 1836/1837. This new synagogue had a length of approximately 24 metres and was approximately 13 metres wide.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (a), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

== From 1828 to 1869 ==

[[File:Laupheim Judenberg 4.JPG|thumb|right|Entrance to the ''Judenberg'']]
[[File:Laupheim Judenberg 3.JPG|thumb|right|''Judenberg''-front of Kapellenstraße]]
In 1806, both parts of Laupheim were annexed by the newly formed [[History of Württemberg|Kingdom of Württemberg]]. As a consequence the Jews in Laupheim now fell under the [[jurisdiction]] of Württemberg. Initially, there were no changes in the legal status of Jews living within the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 45 
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Jews’ Act of 1828 meant a considerable improvement in the status of the Jews. The legal obligation of Jews living only in the areas allocated by the authorities was lifted. Jews now had the freedom to settle and live wherever they decided to. The effect of this law in Laupheim meant that very soon the Jewish population had houses built along the ''Kapellenstraße'' and the surrounding areas so that the street unofficially received the name of ''Judenstraße'' ("Jews' Street").&lt;ref&gt;S. Kullen, "Spurensuche", p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that in a relative short period of time so many new buildings could be erected is an indication of the prosperity of the Jewish community, particularly regarding the [[recession]] and the [[famine]]s that followed the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Another indication for this prosperity was the fact that, when a couple wanted to get married, it had to prove a certain amount of wealth before the permission to marry was granted by the local ruler, more Jewish inhabitants of Laupheim were able to get married than their Christian fellow-citizens. The act of 1828 also lifted any restrictions with regards to the prohibition of Jews to choose their professions. From now on, Jews were allowed to choose and work in any profession they wished. Furthermore, the prohibition of Jews to buy and own property was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 47f&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following this decree, Jews from Laupheim bought several bankrupt agricultural businesses in the surrounding villages as well as within the town of Laupheim itself, split them into smaller entities and sold them off again, thereby making considerable profit. One example of this is the acquisition of Großlaupheim Castle with all its property by the family Steiner in 1843. In 1840, [[Karl von Welden]], the last feudal lord of Laupheim, sold the castle to the state of Württemberg. He was bitterly disappointed with his subjects obstinate behaviour towards him as their former feudal lord (they had taken him to court for 300 different offences) and sold the castles to the Kingdom of Württemberg.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Großlaupheim Castle with all accompanying lands was acquired by the Jewish merchant [[Viktor Steiner]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; whose family managed to hold on to the possession for five generations, even through the Nazi-period, until 1961. After Viktor Steiner's death in 1865, his son, Daniel Steiner, and his son-in-law, Salomon Klein, became heirs to the business. They, in turn, sold it on to Laupheim-born banker and [[Business magnate|industrialist]] [[Kilian von Steiner|Kilian Steiner]], who had  resided in Stuttgart.&lt;ref&gt;Benigna Schönhagen, ''Kilian und Steiner und Laupheim'', p. 4, 11f&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's policy to encourage young Jews to learn one of the crafts they had been excluded from, only met with partial success. Even though more Jews became apprentices to craftsmen, they usually chose a profession which later enabled them to change it into a craft-related trade.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 290f&lt;/ref&gt;

A side effect of the act was that those Jews who had not used a surname as yet were forced to acquire [[family name]]s. Few of the Laupheim Jews had had surnames. Those that had used them were the families of Einstein, Obernauer and Weil. Suddenly new families seemed to emerge even though they had been living in Laupheim for quite some time. There were several options: one, to Germanise the first name, which led, amongst others, to Levi, Löw, Löffler and Levinger, instead of Levi, or to Heumann instead of Hayum. A second option was to use the name of the place from where the family had once moved to Laupheim. This resulted in family names such as Nördlinger, Öttinger, Hofheimer and Thannhauser. Furthermore, not only surnames were suddenly Germanised but first names were adapted to the German speaking environment too. Hayum became, for example, Heinrich, Baruch was changed to Berthold or Bernhard, so that at the end of the 19th century, it was almost impossible to distinguish the Jewish citizens of Laupheim from their Christian fellow-citizens simply because of their names.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews' Act of 1828 forced the rabbis to keep [[vital records]] of all members of their community, something Christian priests had been obliged to do so for a long time. Rabbis now had to keep records of all [[birth certificate]]s, [[marriage license]]s, and [[death certificate]]s. This turned the office of rabbi from being a purely spiritual leader into a semi-official function, the tasks of which also included administration for which he was accountable to the officials of the Kingdom of Württemberg.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic equality granted to the Jews in 1828 caused an increase in building works in Laupheim which, in turn, caused an increase in the economic fortunes of the small market town. This is demonstrated by the fact that the number of building-related craftsmen doubled within ten years between 1845 and 1856. The weekly market, which had been discontinued at the beginning of the century, was reintroduced in 1842. Although it had to compete with the larger markets in [[Ulm]] and [[Biberach an der Riß|Biberach]], it still managed to hold its own as many horse and cattle traders as well as [[Peddler|pedlars]] and hawkers, quite a few of whom were Jewish, visited the market in Laupheim, further contributing to its prosperity.&lt;ref name="W. Kohl, p. 48"&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a great number of the founders of the local trade bank, an early form of the [[Credit Union]], in 1868, were Jewish entrepreneurs from Laupheim.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kullen, ''Spurensuche'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
Until 1933 they were to partake in its development in prominent positions.

In 1864, Jews living in the Kingdom of Württemberg, were finally granted complete [[political emancipation|political equality]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Engisch, ''Das Königreich Württemberg'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that after achieving economic emancipation, they were now citizens with the same rights and obligations as their Christian neighbours. Soon after this, in 1868, the first Jewish counsellors appeared on the town council, Samuel Lämmle being the first Jew elected to it.&lt;ref name="W. Kohl, p. 48"/&gt;

== From 1869 to 1933 ==
The Laupheim Jews contributed substantially to the effort to have Laupheim elevated to the status of [[city]], by appealing repeatedly to the King of Württemberg to grant Laupheim this status from the early years of the 1860s onwards. Finally, in a charter of 1869, the King of Württemberg conferred on Laupheim [[Town privileges|city rights]].

Ironically, the absolute number of Jewish inhabitants in Laupheim reached its zenith the very same year. In 1856, the number of Jewish inhabitants constituted more than a fifth of all inhabitants of Laupheim, even though the absolute number was less than in 1869. This is because the general population of Laupheim grew disproportionally. In 1869, 843 Jews were registered in Laupheim, accounting for approximately twelve percent of the total population. From this year onwards, the Jewish population dwindled. The reason for this lies in the fact that for many Jewish inhabitants, Laupheim did not offer enough opportunities to sustain a living. This process of migration had already started in the 1850s with many Laupheim Jews being attracted to the bigger cities, such as Ulm, [[Stuttgart]], [[Munich]] and [[Frankfurt]]. Furthermore, between 1835 and 1870, no less than 176 Jewish inhabitants of Laupheim emigrated to the [[United States]], particularly after the failed [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]] and its ensuing economic crisis, which was felt most harshly by those who were less affluent. Some did return but most stayed and became an integral part of the United States. This development gathered momentum in the 1870s with more and more Jewish inhabitants leaving Laupheim either to move abroad or to other centres within the newly founded [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 292f&lt;/ref&gt;

The upturn in Jewish fortunes was also shown in the fact that the community could afford to have the synagogue completely rebuilt and refurbished. As early as 1845 there had been complaints that the synagogue was too small to accommodate the growing numbers of believers. The works for the new synagogue  finished in May 1877. By adding two towers with domed roofs and wide, rounded windows, the building was given a renaissance-like appearance.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 53ff&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, several businesses were founded or expanded. A company producing wooden tools, founded by Josef Steiner and his four sons, became one of the leading distributors of products of this kind in southern Germany. A company for refinement of hair products was founded by the brothers Bergmann. This company still exists today, having been [[Aryanization (Nazism)|aryanised]] after 1933, only to be given back to its rightful owners after 1945, and is now operating worldwide. A textile [[mill (factory)|mill]] was established by Emmanuel Heumann, continued by his sons, in the town centre. The premises were later moved to the suburbs. The hop merchant Steiner also began in Laupheim to become one of the leading players in this market after expanding into the United States. The headquarters of this company are now in [[New York City]]. Until the 1880s, trading in [[real estate]] was in Jewish hands but this vanished completely after the establishing of the credit union. The local dealers in [[livestock]], however, were until after 1933 predominantly Jewish as well as the traders in [[liquor]], wine, oil, grain and timber. There were even a few private banks owned by Jews, which were successful enough to survive well into the 1930s but were forced to close down after 1933 following the immense pressure put on them by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist]] administration.
[[File:Laupheim former department store Einstein.JPG|thumb|right|Former department store D. M. Einstein]]
Around and in the vicinity of the market square, several [[retailing|retail shops]] were established, specializing in selling textile products. The first [[department store]] in Laupheim was erected in 1906 by Jewish merchant Daniel David Einstein whose family had been residents of Laupheim since the second half of the 17th century. Until the late 1980s, it was still possible to see the by then faded name of the original owner above the entrance. A number of [[public houses]] were also run by Jewish landlords. Less remarkable and yet important are the contributions made by local Jewish craftsmen. There were several [[baker]]s and [[butcher]]s, serving the Jewish as well as the Christian inhabitants of Laupheim. Also, a number of Jewish [[shoemaker|cobblers]], [[furrier]]s, [[clockmaker]]s, tailors and [[Woodturning|wood turners]] had their shops near the market square.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century Jews in Laupheim were completely integrated and assimilated into society, being part of all walks of life, a situation which would not change for more than 30 years. This assimilation is seen by the fact that many, more affluent Jews moved away from the confinement of the ''Judenberg''. Consequently, many of the [[Gründerzeit]] buildings still existing in Laupheim were erected by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Jewish school ==
[[File:Laupheim, public house Zum Rad.JPG|thumb|right|Public house ''Zum Rad'', place of the first official schooling for Jewish children in Laupheim]]
[[File:Laupheim former Rabbi's office.JPG|thumb|right|Rabbi's office and first school building]]
Traditionally, the education of the children of a Jewish family rested with the father. However, the absence of many fathers due to their frequently being away from home in their capacity as traders, made it necessary to employ travelling teachers who received food and accommodation in return for their services. These teachers, called ''[[cheder|chedarim]]'', received a contract of six months, usually terminating at either [[passover|Pesach]] or [[Sukkot]].&lt;ref name="S. Kullen, Spurensuche, p. 51"/&gt; In 1808, the number of Jewish children amounted to 39 which indicates that many children were sent to either Christian schools or to Jewish schools outside Laupheim. The first Jewish school was founded only in 1823, when the Jewish community rented a ballroom in a public house to be used as a classroom and hired a teacher, Simon Tannenbaum from Mergentheim. He acted as head teacher until his retirement in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; As his assistant Abraham Sänger from [[Buttenhausen]] was taken on and worked as teacher until his death in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;L. Georg, ''Historische Bauten'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; His descendants run the public house ''Zum Ochsen'' until after 1933. In 1830, the Jewish community bought a house opposite the synagogue which was refurbished to house the rabbi's office and the school. This building functioned as school until 1868 when a new Jewish school was built in the vicinity of the ''Judenberg'' in the ''Radgasse''. This building was demolished in 1969.&lt;ref name="S. Kullen, Spurensuche, p. 51"/&gt; Due to the lack of Jewish teachers, for several years [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] teachers were asked to help out.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, 162 Jewish pupils attended the Jewish school. In the following decades, the number of Jewish pupils would decrease continuously, so that, at the beginning of the 20th century, the Jewish school taught only 65 pupils. However, the Jewish school existed until well into the 1930s and was only closed in 1939.

== Jewish societies ==
The first Jewish society (''Chewra Kadischah'') was founded in 1748 with the task of looking after the ill and taking care of funerals. This society was active for almost 200 years. In 1780, the [[Talmud]]-[[Torah]]-Society was founded to assist the religious instruction of fellow Jews and to take care of young people. It was accompanied by a welfare society ''Nathan Basseser'', founded in 1804, the Jewish Women Society and the Jewish Orphan Fund, supporting the Jewish [[orphanage]] in [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], in 1838.
Jewish societies sprang up not only for charitable but also for sociable purposes. A choral society, called ''Frohsinn'' (Cheerfulness), was founded in 1845 and went on to win many prizes at choir festivals. The reading society ''Konkordia'' (Concord) came into existence in 1846 on the initiative of the Laupheim-born rabbi-candidate Max Sänger.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 298; W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 58ff 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==From 1933 to 1938==
After the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933 and the subsequent seizure of power by his party, the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]], Jewish life in Laupheim began to change for the worse. During the previous decades, Jews had been influential and prominent members in all ways of life, not only in the economic life but also in the cultural sphere. Numerous non-Jews had been employed by Jewish-run businesses and by Jewish households. Jews had been participating in all spheres of public and commercial life. The local craftsmen had been able to rely on Jewish customers to sell their products to. Jews were members in several cultural, political and social societies. All these relations began to loosen or even abruptly break down after January 1933. On 1 April 1933, the nationwide [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], organised by [[Julius Streicher]], also took place in Laupheim. Members of the local [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] positioned themselves in front of Jewish shops in order to intimidate potential customers and prevent them from entering. The windows of one shop were smashed.&lt;ref&gt;W. Eckert, "Zur Geschichte der Juden in Laupheim", p. 59. This was the department store D. M. Einstein, owned by the father of poet [[Siegfried Einstein]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the year following the Nazis' rise to power, in the course of so-called ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', the Laupheim Jews were deprived of membership of all non-Jewish organisations, be it political or cultural. On 6 November 1935, a non-local party group leader of the NSDAP took photographs of customers entering a shoe shop, which happened to be owned by a Jew. This caused such a commotion that the police had to be called in to disperse the crowd, which was shouting abuse at entering customers by calling them ''Volksverräter '' (people's traitors) and ''Judenknecht'' (Jews' servant).&lt;ref&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Köhlerschmidt &amp; Karl Neidlinger, ''Die jüdische Gemeinde Laupheim und ihre Zerstörung'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; The propaganda of the ruling party had its effects in that the turnover of Jewish businesses decreased dramatically; one shop's revenue declined even by 80 percent. Many customers went for their purchases to Ulm and Biberach instead. The [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, reduced the Jews in Germany to the status of second class citizens and prohibited the Jews to employ female [[Nazism and Race|Aryan]]s under the age of 45. 
On 8 April 1938, the Jewish cattle traders were allocated a separate part on the weekly cattle market and as of 1 January 1939 the licences for Jewish cattle trader were permanently revoked. From June onwards, all Jewish businesses had to be visibly marked. In July, Jewish [[physician]]s were struck off the medical register. In September, the permission of Jewish members of the [[lawyer|legal profession]] to practice law was cancelled. There were further restrictions and harassment in the same year such as the adding of ''Sara'' and ''Israel'' respectively to non-Jewish first names, the confiscating and re-issuing of passports after a large ''J'' was added. However, many Jews clung to the businesses their ancestors had established and hoped that by keeping a low profile they could weather the storm. A record from July 1938, shows that there still existed 45 businesses run by Jews in Laupheim.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kullen, "Spurensuche", p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laupheim synagogue plaque.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial of the Synagogue]]
The assassination of [[Ernst vom Rath]], Third Secretary of the German Embassy in Paris, by [[Herschel Grynszpan]] served as a pretext for a nationwide [[pogrom]] against Jews throughout Germany and Austria on the night of 9–10 November 1938, colloquially known as [[Kristallnacht]]. In Laupheim, Jewish shops were vandalised and the synagogue was burnt to the ground. The fire-brigade was prevented by locals from extinguishing the fire. A number of Jewish inhabitants were arrested and transported to the town hall. From there, they were marched to the burning synagogue, escorted by members of the Nazi-party, where they had to listen to a diatribe by a SA-leader, after which they were forced to carry out physical exercises in front of the burning building during which several of them were physically assaulted and injured.&lt;ref&gt;W. Eckert, "Zur Geschichte der Juden in Laupheim", p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, some of them were released, whereas the more prominent Jews were transported to the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] where 16 of them had been released by February 1939.&lt;ref name="G. Schenk p. 300"&gt;G. Schenk (b), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

The main perpetrators, were never brought to justice as they were either killed during the war or missing in action. 16 locals, however, were tried in 1948. All of them claimed that they were acting under orders. Four of them were acquitted whereas the twelve others were sentenced to prison terms ranging between two months and one year for [[crimes against humanity]] and being [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to arson.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 79ff; G. Schenk (a), "Die Juden in Laupheim", p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

== The end of Jewish life in Laupheim ==
A few days after the pogrom of 9–10 November 1938, a decree for the expropriation of Jewish businesses was implemented. Following this, all Jewish businesses had to be [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanised]]. In Laupheim this meant that some Jewish shops were bought by one or some of the former employees at a rate considerably lower than the current market price.&lt;ref&gt;W. Eckert, "Zur Geschichte der Juden in Laupheim", p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of these businesses did not manage to survive for long as they lacked sufficient capital and expertise to run an enterprise, especially since there was no possibility to export goods.

As a result of the accelerated discrimination of Jews, emigration from Laupheim increased to 32 in 1939. In 1940, only 14 persons managed to escape the oppression and in 1941 a meagre 4 Jews from Laupheim managed to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;W. Kohl, ''Die Geschichte der Judengemeinde in Laupheim'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Those who remained were, after having been driven out of business, systematically deprived of their other properties, evicted and allocated alternative accommodation. Some were moved into the former Rabbi's office building, now turned into a Jewish [[retirement home]], where living conditions were very crammed. Others were sent to live in the ''Wendelinsgrube'', a designated settlement area in a [[gravel pit]] just outside the then [[Urban area|built-up area]] of Laupheim, where since 1927 small houses had been erected to provide accommodation for the unemployed and homeless. By 1939 these houses consisted of wooden [[shack]]s without running water or electricity. The former residents of the ''Wendelinsgrube'' moved into the forcibly abandoned Jewish properties.&lt;ref&gt;A. Köhlerschmidt &amp; Karl Neidlinger, ''Die jüdische Gemeinde Laupheim und ihre Zerstörung'', p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 November 1941, the first transport of Laupheim Jews left, in the first instance to Stuttgart, and then onwards to [[Riga Ghetto#Jews from Germany|Riga]]. The second wave of [[deportation]]s took place on 25 March 1942, when a number of Laupheim Jews were transported to the [[General Government]], [[Poland]]. The final deportation took place on 19 August 1942, when the remaining 43 Jews of Laupheim, amongst whom were all the remaining inhabitants of the ''Wendelinsgrube'', were transported to the east to the concentration camp [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]].&lt;ref name="G. Schenk p. 300"/&gt; This date marks the end of more than 200 years of Jewish history in Laupheim since none of the emigrants or surviving deportees returned to live in Laupheim.

Schenk dates Treitel's rabbinate from 1895 to 1925 whereas Kohl says that with the retirement of Treitel on 1 April 1923, the office of rabbi in Laupheim ceased to exist. This is confirmed by Emmerich who indicates that Treitel was rabbi for more than 28 years and retired in the year of the publication of his monograph on Philo of Alexandria in 1923. However, during a speech held in 1937 the last teacher of the Laupheim Jewish school, Heinz Säbel, dated the end of Treitel's rabbinate to 1922. Furthermore, in an obituary dated 20 March 1931 published in the  ''C.V.-Zeitung'', the weekly newspaper of the ''Central-Vereins deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens'', upon the death of Treitel the dates for his rabbinate are given as 1985 to 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;|| align="left"|(1845 in [[Breslau]] - 1931 in Laupheim) previously rabbi in [[Karlsruhe]]; Jewish scholar

The '''Jaburara''' ('Northerners') were an [[Indigenous Australian|Indigenous Australian people]] who once lived about the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]] and the [[Dampier Archipelago]]. The traditional tribe is virtually extinct,{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=242}} though some people of Jaburara descent are still active.{{sfn|Taylor|Scambary|2005|p=46}}

==Language==
The Jaburara (Yaburarra) are thought to have spoken a language similar to [[Ngarluma language|Ngarluma]], affiliated with the [[Ngayarda languages]].{{sfn|Thieberger|1993|p=100}}

==Country==
The Jaburara owned some {{convert|200|mi2|km2}} of territory from around [[Dampier, Western Australia|Dampier]], [[Burrup Peninsula|Burrup]], Nichol Bay and the peninsula northwards to the [[Dolphin Island (Western Australia)|Dolphin]] and Legendre islands.{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=242}}

==Early contact==
During one of [[Phillip Parker King]]'s voyages on {{HMS|Mermaid|1817|6}} to survey the Australian coast, an attempt was made to communicate in February 1817 with members of the tribe, three of whom had been sighted off-shore floating on a log in the vicinity of present-day [[Western Australia|Karratha (Good Country)]]. The intermediary used was the ship's interpreter [[Bungaree]], who, speaking the [[Broken Bay]] [[Dharug language]] could not understand them, but managed to calm their anxieties by undressing and showing he wore [[Scarification|ritual scars]].{{sfn|Shellam|2015|pp=89–91}}

==Resistance and extinction==
The Jaburara, together with other local tribes such as the [[Ngarluma]] and [[Martuthunira language|Mardu-Dunera]] fought against the [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|colonization of their lands by white settlers]].{{sfn|Stannage|1981|p=99}} According to an American whaler at the time, the law that accompanied settlement in their region could be summed up as 'a word and a blow: the blow, which is generally fatal, coming first'.{{sfn|Gibbs|2010|p=28}} In 1868, near the present-day township of [[Roebourne]], in an area known in the local language as [[Murujuga|Murujuga (hip bone sticking out)]], two policemen and a native tracker had been killed. The suspects, three Jaburara men, were duly caught and sentenced to imprisonment. Two parties, made up of [[Pearling in Western Australia|north coast pearlers]] and [[Pastoralism|settler pastoralists]] had been given permission by the district authority to apply lethal force 'with discretion and judgement',{{sfn|Knafla|2016|p=79}} and they attacked Jaburara encampments in a pincer movement. In what is now known as the [[Flying Foam massacre]] it has been estimated that up to 60 Jaburara were killed.{{sfn|Knafla|2016|p=79}} In one camp alone, some 15 were killed.{{sfn|Gara|1983|pp=85–94}} Following the [[La Grange expedition|La Grange massacre]], this episode constitutes the second known example of the use of massacre to forcibly remove an indigenous north Western population.{{sfn|Walsh|2015}} One small 'family' was recorded in the first half of the 20th century as still surviving{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=242}} but the massacre effectively cut off the tribe's connections to the islands.{{sfn|Veth|2015}}

==Heritage==
The Jaburara heritage is attested by rock quarries, extensive archaic [[petroglyph]]s, grindstones used by native women to make flour from native seeds, nomadic camps, and [[midden]]s to be found along the Jaburara Heritage Trail, which winds through an area containing some of the most extensive remains of [[Indigenous Australian art|ancient Aboriginal]] [[rock art]], some dating back 25,000&amp;nbsp;years.{{sfn|Van Driesum|2002|p=343}}{{sfn|Flood|1999|pp=66–67}}

==Alternative names==
* ''Jaburara-ngaluma.'' (northern Ngaluma)
* ''Jaburrara-ngarluma.''
* ''Madoitja.'' (perhaps).{{sfn|Tindale|1974}}

'''John Robert Gregg''' (b. 17 June 1867, Shantonagh, [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]], [[Ireland]] – d. 23 February 1948, [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) was an [[educator]], [[publisher]], [[humanitarian]], and the [[inventor]] of the eponymous [[shorthand]] system [[Gregg Shorthand]].

==Life==

===Childhood===
John Robert Gregg was born in Shantonagh, Ireland, as the youngest child of Robert and Margaret Gregg, where they remained until 1872, when they moved to Rockcorry, County Monaghan.&lt;ref name="Cowen11"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first=Leslie |title=John Robert Gregg: A Biography |page=11 |year=1984 |publisher=Oxford: The Pre-Raphaelite Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gregg, who was of Scottish ancestry, was station-master at the Bushford railway station in Rockcorry.  He and his wife raised their children as strict Presbyterians, and sent their children to the village school in Rockcorry, which John Robert Gregg joined in 1872.&lt;ref name="Cowan11b"&gt;Cowan, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  On his second day of class, John Robert was caught whispering to a schoolmate, which prompted the schoolmaster to hit the two children's heads together.&lt;ref name="Cowan11b"/&gt;  This incident profoundly damaged Gregg's hearing for the rest of his life, rendering him unable to participate fully in school, unable to understand his teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Jack. 1981. ''Deaf Heritage–A Narrative History of Deaf America'', Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, p. 169 ([http://saveourdeafschools.org/Deaf_Heritage_by_Jack_Gannon_page_169.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424040350/http://saveourdeafschools.org/Deaf_Heritage_by_Jack_Gannon_page_169.pdf |date=2012-04-24 }})&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately led to John Robert unnecessarily being perceived as dull or mentally challenged by his peers, teachers, and family.&lt;ref name="Cowan, 12"&gt;Cowan, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, one of Robert Gregg's friends, a journalist named Annesley, visited the village for a weekend.  He was versed in Pitman Shorthand, and took verbatim notes of the sermon at the village church, causing the preacher to sweat and studder,{{clarify|date=June 2014|reason=stutter? shudder?}} out of fear that his sermon, which he had plagiarized from a famous preacher, would be made public through Annesley's notes.&lt;ref name="Cowan, 12"/&gt;  That day, Robert Gregg saw the shorthand skill as a powerful asset, so he made it mandatory for his children to learn Pitman shorthand, with the exception of John, who was considered by his family too "simple" to learn it.&lt;ref name="Cowan, 13"&gt;Cowan, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the children succeeded in fully learning the system.&lt;ref name="Cowan, 12"/&gt;  On his own, John Robert learned a different shorthand system, that of Samuel Taylor, published in a small book by Odell.  He taught himself the system fully, since he did not require the ability to hear in order to learn from the book.&lt;ref name="Cowan, 13"/&gt;

Due to hardships on the family, Gregg had to leave school before the age of 13 in order to support his family's income.&lt;ref name="Cowan, 14"&gt;Cowan, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked in a law office, earning five shillings a week.&lt;ref name="Cowan, 14"/&gt;

===Career===
Gregg said he initially set out to improve the English adaptation by John Matthew Sloan of the French Prévost [[Duployan_shorthand | Duployé Shorthand]], while working with one of Sloan's sales agents, Thomas Malone.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Malone published a system called ''Script Phonography'', of which Gregg asserted a share in authorship was owed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Angered by Malone, Gregg resigned from working with him and, encouraged by his older brother Samuel, published and copyrighted his own system of shorthand in 1888.&lt;ref name="Cowan"/&gt; It was put forth in a brochure entitled ''Light-Line Phonography: The Phonetic Handwriting'' which he published in [[Liverpool]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="Cowan"&gt;Cowan, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, he emigrated to the United States. That year he published ''Gregg Shorthand''.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; with great success. Gregg settled in [[Chicago]] where he wrote many books for the Gregg Publishing Company on shorthand and business practices.

'''Abū 'Amr Khalifa ibn Khayyat al Laythī al 'Usfurī''' (born : 160/161 AH/777 AD– died 239/240 AH/854 AD) was an Arab historian.

His family were natives of [[Basra]] in [[Iraq]]. His grandfather was a noted [[muhaddith]] or traditionalist, and Khalifa became renowned for this also. Among the great Islamic scholars who were his pupils were [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] and [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]].

He is known to have written at least four works, of which two have survived. These are the ''Tabaqat'' (biographies) and ''Tarikh'' (history). The latter is valuable as being one of three of the earliest Arabic histories, but the full text was not known until an 11th-century copy was found in 1966, in the [[Nasiriyya|Nassiriyya Zawiya]] in [[Tamegroute]], where the local dry climate helped preserving it, and was published in 1967.

The '''Kielce [[Pogrom]]''' was an outbreak of violence toward the [[Jews|Jewish]] community centre's gathering of refugees in the city of [[Kielce]], [[Poland]] on 4 July 1946 by Polish soldiers, police officers, and civilians&lt;ref name=ushmm&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007941 THE KIELCE POGROM: A BLOOD LIBEL MASSACRE OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124115259/https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007941 |date=2016-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during which 42 Jews were killed and more than 40 were wounded.&lt;ref name=ushmm/&gt;&lt;ref name="angora"/&gt; Polish courts later sentenced nine of the attackers to death in connection with the crimes.&lt;ref name=ushmm/&gt;

Some sources claim the massacre was instigated by the Soviet-backed Communist security corps, for propaganda purposes, attempting to discredit Poland's anti-Communist stance and to maintain totalitarian control over the country. As the top-secret case files were destroyed, the academic inquiry is ongoing with regard to possible secret coordination with the [[NKVD]] by the Moscow-Communist-controlled 'Polish' authorities.&lt;ref name="angora"&gt;Interview with Krzysztof Kąkolewski, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124436/http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/1631716%2Cto-moskwa-zaplanowala-ten-mord%2Cid%2Ct.html?cookie=1 Archive copy at the Wayback Machine] Also available with purchase at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215529/http://www.angora.com.pl/archiwum/?y=2006&amp;is=285&amp;part=2 "To Moskwa zaplanowała ten mord" (The murder was planned in Moscow)], ''[[Tygodnik Angora|Tygodnik Angora – "Przegląd prasy krajowej i światowej"]]'', Łódź, 29/2006 (839); section Kultura, p. 56.

As the deadliest pogrom against Polish Jews after the [[Second World War]], the incident was a significant point in the post-war [[history of Jews in Poland]]. It took place only a year after the end of the Second World War and the [[Holocaust]], shocking Jews in Poland, Poles, and the international community. It has been recognized as a catalyst for the flight from Poland of most remaining Polish Jews who had survived the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="patterns"/&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Kielce planty 7.jpg|thumb|250px|''Ulica'' Planty 7, [[Kielce]]]]
During the [[German occupation of Poland]], Kielce was completely [[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] by the Nazis of its pre-war Jewish community. By the summer of 1946, some 200 Jews, many of them former residents of Kielce, had returned from the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, the [[Soviet Union]], and other places of refuge to live there. About 150-160 of them were quartered in a single building administered by the Jewish Committee of [[Kielce Voivodeship]] at Planty,&lt;ref name="ucsb"/&gt; a small street in the centre of the town.

On 1 July 1946, an eight-year-old Polish boy, Henryk Błaszczyk, was reported missing by his father Walenty Błaszczyk. According to the father, upon his return two days later the boy claimed he had been kidnapped by an unknown man, allegedly a Jew or a [[Romani people|gypsy]]. Two days later, the boy, his father and the neighbour went to a local [[Milicja Obywatelska|Civic Militia station]] (communist state-controlled police force). While passing the 'Jewish house' at 7 Planty Street, Henryk pointed at a man nearby who, he said, had allegedly imprisoned him in the house's cellar. At the police station, Henryk repeated his story that he had been kidnapped and specified the Jews and their house as involved in his disappearance. A Civic Militia patrol of more than a dozen men was then dispatched on foot by the station commander Edmund Zagórski to search the house at 7 Planty Street for the place where Henryk had allegedly been kept.&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt;

Although the kidnapping claim was quickly withdrawn,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Henryk Błaszczyk remained publicly silent about the events until 1998, when, in an interview to a Polish journalist he admitted he was never kidnapped but was living with "unknown family" in nearby village and treated well. He perceived his disappearance as happening with his father's awareness and concerted by the communist security service. After returning home he was categorically commanded by his father not to discuss anything that happened and reaffirm only the story of "Jewish abduction" if ever asked. He was threatened to keep quiet long after 1946, which he did out of fear until the end of communist rule in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/7/5347/Artykul/1639433,Porwanie-ktorego-nigdy-nie-bylo-Prawda-o-pogromie-kieleckim|title=Porwanie, którego nigdy nie było.

Civic Militia publicised the rumours of the kidnapping and further announced that they were planning to search for the bodies of Polish children [[blood libel|supposedly ritually murdered]] and kept in the house, resulting in the gathering of civilian spectators.&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt; A confrontation ensued between the militia forces and officers of the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland]] (UBP), which had been called in on the suspicion that the incident was a Jewish "provocation" to stir up unrest.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

During the morning, the case came to the attention of other local state and military organs, including the [[Polish People's Army]] (LWP - communist controlled regular army), the [[Internal Security Corps]] (KBW, interior ministry paramilitary), and the [[Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army]] (GZI WP, military intelligence and counterintelligence). About 100 soldiers and five officers were dispatched to the location at about 10 am. The soldiers were unfamiliar with the circumstances, but soon picked up rumors from the people in the street, who at this time commenced pelting the building with stones.&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt;

==Outbreak of violence==
The Civic Militia and soldiers then forcibly broke into the building only to discover that it did not contain any abducted children as claimed. The inhabitants of the house, who had proper permits to bear arms for self defence, were ordered to surrender their weaponry and give up valuables. Someone (unclear who) started firing a weapon. Civic Militia and the KBW opened fire, killing and wounding a number of people in the building. In response, shots were fired from the Jewish side killing two or three Poles, including a Civic Militia officer. The head of the local Jewish Committee, Dr Seweryn Kahane, was fatally wounded by a [[Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army|GZI WP]] officer while telephoning the Kielce office of [[Ministry of Public Security (Poland)|Public Security]] for help. A number of local Priests attempted to enter the building but were stopped by militia officers, who vowed to control the situation.&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt;

Following the initial murders inside the building, numerous Jews were driven outdoor by soldiers and later attacked with stones and clubs by civilians who crowded surrounding streets. By noon, the arrival of a large group of estimated about 600 to 1,000 workers from [[Huta Ludwików|Ludwików steel mill]], led by activists of Poland's ruling [[Polish Workers' Party]] (PPR, [[communist party]]), opened the next stage of the pogrom. Approximately 20 Jews were viciously battered to death by the workers armed with iron rods and clubs. Some of the workers were members of the [[ORMO]] (volunteer reserve militia) and at least one possessed a handgun. Neither the military or security heads, including a Soviet army advisor, nor the local civic leaders, sought to prevent the aggression. A unit of Civic Militia [[cadet]]s which also arrived at the scene did not intervene, but some of its members joined in the looting and violence which continued inside and outside the building.&lt;ref name=rzepa/&gt;

Among the slain Jews, nine had been shot dead, two were killed with bayonets, and the rest beaten or stoned to death. The dead included women and children. The mob also killed a Jewish nurse (Estera Proszowska),whom the attackers had mistaken for a Polish female attempting to aid the Jews. Two Jewish people not residing at Planty Street dwelling were also murdered on this day in separate incidents. Regina Fisz, her 3-week old child, and a male companion were abducted at their home at 15 Leonarda Street by a group of 4 men led by Civic Militia corporal Stefan Mazur. They were robbed and driven out of the city, where Regina and her baby were shot while allegedly trying to escape, while her friend did manage to escape. 
Three non-Jewish Poles were among the dead. Two uniformed state servicemen were killed in gunfire exchange, most likely shot by Jews defending themselves. The cause of death of the third man remains unexplained.&lt;ref name=rzepa/&gt;

==Cessation of violence==
{{one source|section|date=July 2016}}
The pogrom ended at roughly 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. with the arrival of new security units from a nearby Public Security Academy, advanced by Colonel Stanisław Kupsza, and additional troops from [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt; After warning shots discharge, on the order of Major Kazimierz Konieczny, the new troops swiftly restored order, posted guards, and removed all the survivors as well as corpses from the dwelling and its proximity.

The violence, nevertheless, did not stop. Wounded Jews being taken to the local hospital were beaten and robbed by soldiers&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt; and injured were assaulted in the hospital by other patients. A civilian crowd approached one of the hospitals and demanded that the hurt Jews be handed over, but the hospital staff refused.

Trains passing through Kielce's main railway station were scrutinized for Jews by civilians and [[Railroad Guards (Poland)|SOK]] railway guards, resulting in at least two passengers being murdered. As many as 30 more may have been killed in this manner, as the train murders reportedly continued for several months after the pogrom.&lt;ref name="rzepa"/&gt; The large-scale disorder in Kielce ultimately ended some nine hours after it started. Polish born [[Julia Pirotte]], a well-known French photojournalist with the [[French Resistance]], photographed the pogrom's immediate aftermath.&lt;ref name="yadvashem"/&gt;

==The aftermath==
===Attempts to blame Polish nationalists===
One immediate reaction of the [[communism|Communist]] government of Poland was to attempt to blame the pogrom on Polish [[nationalism|nationalists]],&lt;ref name="passim"/&gt; alleging that uniformed members of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|anticommunist]] formations backing the [[Polish government-in-exile]] were egging the mob on. At the funeral of the Jewish victims, the Minister of Public Security, [[Stanisław Radkiewicz]], stated that the pogrom was "a deed committed by the emissaries of the Polish government in the West and [[Władysław Anders|General Anders]], with the approval of [[Home Army]] soldiers." Other early official statements at the time followed this line.&lt;ref name="kami"/&gt;

As the militiaman and army are known to have been involved in the pogrom from its inception, this has given rise to the idea that the pogrom was deliberately incited by the Communists to discredit the government in exile (possibly to distract attention from the [[Polish people's referendum, 1946|rigged referendum]] which had taken place at the end of June 1946). When it became clear following trials that the nationalists could not be blamed, this line of propaganda was swiftly dropped by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Additional investigation into the circumstances of the massacre was opposed by the communist regime until the era of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], when in December 1981 an article was published in the ''Solidarity'' newspaper ''[[Tygodnik Solidarność]]''.&lt;ref name="kami1"/&gt; However, [[Martial law in Poland|the return of repressive government]] meant that files could not be accessed for research until after the fall of Communism in 1989, by which time many eyewitnesses had died. It was then discovered that many of the documents relating to the pogrom had been allegedly destroyed by fire or deliberately by military authorities.&lt;ref name="kami2"/&gt;

For these reasons, debate about the origins of the pogrom has remained controversial. Some claim it was a deliberate provocation by the communists to discredit the opposition. Some claim that it was a spontaneous antisemitic incident that was later exploited by the government. Others {{Who|date=July 2016}} have accused the [[Roman Catholic Church]] hierarchy in Poland of passivity during the pogrom and its aftermath. The fact that a number of Jews held important positions in the Polish Communist party and security services also affected popular sentiment. Insufficient documented evidence significantly limits historical research.&lt;ref name="kami3"/&gt;

===Trials===
Between 9 and 11 July 1946, twelve civilians (one of them apparently mentally challenged) were arrested by MBP officers as perpetrators of the pogrom. The accused were tried by the Supreme [[Military Court]] in a joint [[show trial]]. Nine were sentenced to death and executed the following day by [[firing squad]] on the orders of Polish Communist leader [[Bolesław Bierut]]. The remaining three received prison terms ranging from seven years to life.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Aside from Kielce Voivodeship's Civic Militia commandant, Major Wiktor Kuźnicki, who was sentenced to one year for "failing to stop the crowd" (he died in 1947), only one militia officer was punished — for the theft of shoes from a dead body. Mazur's explanation regarding his killing of the Fisz family was accepted. Meanwhile, the regional UBP chief, Colonel Władysław Sobczyński, and his men were cleared of any wrongdoing. The official reaction to the pogrom was described by [[Anita J. Prazmowska]] in ''Cold War History'', Vol. 2, No. 2:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nine participants in the pogrom were sentenced to death; three others were given lengthy prison sentences. Militiaman, military men and functionaries of the UBP were tried separately and then unexpectedly all, with the exception of Wiktor Kuznicki, Commander of the [[Milicja Obywatelska|MO]], who was sentenced to one year in prison, were found not guilty of "having taken no action to stop the crowd from committing crimes." Clearly, during the period when the first investigations were launched and the trial, a most likely politically motivated decision had been made not to proceed with disciplinary action. This was in spite of very disturbing evidence that emerged during the pre-trial interviews. It is entirely feasible that instructions not to punish the MO and UBP commanders had been given because of the politically sensitive nature of the evidence. Evidence heard by the military prosecutor revealed major organisational and ideological weaknesses within these two security services.&lt;ref name="Prazmowska"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The neighbour of the Błaszczyk family who had originally suggested to Henryk that he had been kidnapped by Jews was subsequently tried, but acquitted.&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt; Of the 12 persons put on trial, nine were condemned to death.

===Effects on Jewish emigration from Poland===

The ruthlessness of the murders put an end to the expectation of many Jews that they would be able to resettle in Poland after the end of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation and precipitated a mass exodus of Polish Jewry.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; Bożena Szaynok, a historian at [[Wrocław University]] estimated that from July 1945 until June 1946 about fifty thousand Jews crossed the Polish border illegally. In July 1946, almost twenty thousand decided to start a new life abroad.&lt;ref name="Intermarium"/&gt; Polish Minister Marian Spychalski, motivated by political and humanitarian reasons, signed a decree allowing Jews to leave officially without visas or exit permits, and the Jewish emigration from Poland increased dramatically.&lt;ref name="Marrus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrus|first=Michael Robert|author2=Aristide R.

By the spring of 1947, wrote Bernhard and Szlajfer, the number of Jews in Poland – in large part arriving from the Soviet Union – declined from 240,000 to 90,000 due to mass migration.&lt;ref name="MB-HS"&gt;Michael Bernhard, Henryk Szlajfer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nUhiPCkawCoC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=%22After+the+war,+there+were+more+Jews+repatriated+from+the+east+than+Jews+who+somehow+managed+to+survive+in+Poland%22  ''From the Polish Underground'', page 375] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214085700/https://books.google.com/books?id=nUhiPCkawCoC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=%22After+the+war,+there+were+more+Jews+repatriated+from+the+east+than+Jews+who+somehow+managed+to+survive+in+Poland%22 |date=2018-02-14 }} Published by Penn State Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-271-02565-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-271-02565-0}}. 500 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Britain demanded that Poland halt the Jewish exodus, but their pressure was largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Kochavi-xi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kochavi|first=Arieh J.|title=Post-Holocaust Politics: Britain, the United States &amp; Jewish Refugees, 1945–1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdWSwGaSoJAC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Britain+exerted+pressure+on+the+governments+of+Poland%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y0cCTa2tC8_wsgahoZTqCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Britain%20exerted%20pressure%20on%20the%20governments%20of%20Poland%22&amp;f=false|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2001|pages=xi|isbn=0-8078-2620-0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214085659/https://books.google.com/books?id=LdWSwGaSoJAC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Britain+exerted+pressure+on+the+governments+of+Poland%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y0cCTa2tC8_wsgahoZTqCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Britain%20exerted%20pressure%20on%20the%20governments%20of%20Poland%22&amp;f=false|archivedate=2018-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight ([[berihah]]) of Jews was motivated by the post-Holocaust absence of Jewish life in Poland as well as the raging civil war against the Communist takeover, in as much as the efforts of strong Polish-Jewish lobby at the Jewish Agency working towards the higher standard of living and special privileges for the immigrants from Poland.

===Reaction of the Catholic Church===
{{POV section|date=February 2017}}
Six months before the Kielce pogrom, during the celebration of [[Hanukkah]], a [[hand grenade]] had been thrown into the headquarters of the local Jewish community. The Jewish Community Council had approached the [[Bishop]] of Kielce, Czesław Kaczmarek, requesting that he admonish the Polish people to refrain from attacking the Jews. The bishop refused, replying that "as long as the Jews concentrated upon their private business Poland was interested in them, but at the point when Jews began to interfere in Polish politics and public life they insulted the Poles' national sensibilities".&lt;ref name="yadvashem4"/&gt;

Similar remarks were delivered by the Bishop of Lublin, [[Stefan Wyszyński]], when he was approached by a Jewish delegation. Wyszyński stated that the widespread hostility to Jews was provoked by Jewish backing of Communism (there was a widespread perception that Jews were supportive of Soviet-installed Communist administration in Poland; see ''[[Żydokomuna]]''), which had also been the reason why "the Germans murdered the Jewish nation". Wyszyński also gave some credence to [[blood libel]] stories, commenting that the issue of the use of Christian blood was never fully clarified.&lt;ref name="Lederhendler"/&gt;

The controversial stance of the Polish [[Roman Catholic Church]] towards anti-Jewish violence was criticised by the American, British and Italian ambassadors to Poland. Reports of the Kielce pogrom caused a major sensation in the [[United States]], leading the American ambassador to Poland to insist that the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[August Hlond]] hold a press conference and explain the position of the church. In the conference held on 11 July 1946, Hlond condemned the violence, but attributed it not to racial causes but to rumours concerning the killing of Polish children by Jews. Hlond put the blame for the deterioration in Polish-Jewish relations on collaboration with the Soviet-backed communist occupiers, Jews "occupying leading positions in Poland in state life". This position was echoed by Polish rural [[clergy]] and Cardinal [[Adam Stefan Sapieha|Sapieha]], who reportedly stated that the Jews had brought it upon themselves.&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt;

==Evidence of Soviet involvement==
Some sources claim the massacre was instigated by the Soviet-backed Communist security corps, for propaganda purposes, attempting to discredit Poland's anti-Communist stance and to maintain totalitarian control over the country. As the top-secret case files were destroyed, the academic inquiry is ongoing with regard to possible secret coordination with the [[NKVD]] by the Moscow-Communist-controlled 'Polish' authorities.&lt;ref name="angora"&gt;Interview with Krzysztof Kąkolewski, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150504124436/http://www.dziennikpolski24.pl/artykul/1631716%2Cto-moskwa-zaplanowala-ten-mord%2Cid%2Ct.html?cookie=1 Archive copy at the Wayback Machine] Also available with purchase at [https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215529/http://www.angora.com.pl/archiwum/?y=2006&amp;is=285&amp;part=2 "To Moskwa zaplanowała ten mord" (The murder was planned in Moscow)], ''[[Tygodnik Angora|Tygodnik Angora – "Przegląd prasy krajowej i światowej"]]'', Łódź, 29/2006 (839); section Kultura, p. 56.

The idea that the event was secretly [[Provocation (legal)|provoked]] or inspired by Soviet intelligence services has been put forward, and a number of similar scenarios were offered.

[[Aleksander Wat]],&lt;ref name="Wat"/&gt; [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]],&lt;ref name="Piotrowski"/&gt; logician Abel Kainer (Stanisław Krajewski),&lt;ref name="Bernhard"/&gt; and Jan Śledzianowski,&lt;ref name="Śledzianowski213"/&gt; allege that the events were part of a much wider action organised by Soviet intelligence in countries controlled by the [[Soviet Union]] (a very similar pogrom took place in [[Hungary]]), and that Soviet-dominated agencies like the UBP were used in the preparation of the Kielce pogrom. Polish Communist and Soviet commanders were in the locality. The most notable was the Jewish expert Nathan Spychaj (a.k.a. Natan Shpilevoi or Szpilevoy), brother of a senior official in [[Union of Polish Patriots|Stalin's puppet Polish regime]],&lt;ref name="Wat"/&gt; as well as Mikhail Diomin, a high-ranking [[GRU]] officer for special operations. It was also uncommon that numerous troops from security formations were present at the place and did not prevent the "mob" from gathering, at a time when even a gathering of five people was considered suspicious and immediately controlled.&lt;ref name="Kąkolewski"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krzysztof Kąkolewski|author2=Joanna Kąkolewska|title=Umarły cmentarz|year=2006|isbn=83-87689-73-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHInAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn=8387689734|publisher=Wydawn. von Borowiecky|location=Warsaw|language=pl|accessdate=5 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214085659/https://books.google.com/books?id=cHInAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn=8387689734|archivedate=14 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Checinski, a former Polish Military Counter-Intelligence officer, emigrated to [[United States]] after the [[1968 Polish political crisis]], where he published his book in which he asserts that the events of Kielce pogrom were a well planned action of the Soviet intelligence in Poland, with the main role in planning and controlling the events being played by Diomin, and with the murders carried out by some Poles, including Polish policemen and military officers.&lt;ref name="google5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google6"/&gt;

On 19 July 1946, former Chief Military Prosecutor Henryk Holder wrote in the letter to the deputy chief of LWP General [[Marian Spychalski]] that "we know that the pogrom wasn't only a fault of Police and Army guarding the people in and around the city of Kielce but also members of the official government who took a role in it."&lt;ref name="ledzianowski"/&gt;

One line of argument that implies external inspiration goes as follows:&lt;ref name="Umorzenie"/&gt; The [[Polish people's referendum, 1946|1946 referendum]] showed that the communists had little support and only [[vote rigging]] won them a majority in the carefully controlled poll - hence, it has been alleged that the UBP organised the pogrom to distract the [[Western world]] media's attention from the fabricated referendum. Another argument for the incident's use as distraction was the upcoming ruling on the [[Katyn massacre]] in the [[Nuremberg trials]], which the communists tried to turn international attention away from, placing the Poles in an unfavourable spotlight (the pogrom happened on 4 July, the same day the Katyn case started in [[Nuremberg]], after the Soviet prosecutors falsely accused the Nazis of the massacre which was actually committed by the Soviets themselves in 1940).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Jan T. Gross]] in his book, ''[[Fear: Anti-Semitism in Poland after Auschwitz]]'', offers a somewhat different and more nuanced interpretation. Gross, while agreeing that the crime was initiated not by a mob, but by the communist police, and that it involved people from every walk of life except the highest level of government officials in the city, wrote the indifference of the majority of Poles to the Jewish Holocaust combined with demands for the return of Jewish property confiscated during the Second World War created a climate of violence against Jews.&lt;ref name="fear"/&gt;

==Recent events==
===Monument===
A monument by [[New York City]]-based artist Jack Sal entitled ''White/Wash II'' commemorating the victims was dedicated on 4 July 2006, in Kielce, on the 60th anniversary of the pogrom. At the dedication ceremony, a statement from the [[President of the Republic of Poland]] [[Lech Kaczyński]] condemned the events as a "crime and a great shame for the Poles and tragedy for the Polish Jews". The presidential statement asserted that in today's [[democracy|democratic]] Poland there is "no room for antisemitism" and brushed off any generalizations of the antisemitic image of the Polish nation as a [[stereotype]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman"/&gt;

'''Kishtwar''' is a municipality in the [[Kishtwar District]] of the [[Jammu region]] in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="Head"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kishtwar.nic.in/ |title=District Kishtwar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main article|Rajatarangini|History of Kashmir}}
Kishtwar is first referred to in the [[Rajatarangini]] by the ancient name Kashthavata.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jktourism.org/component/k2/item/132-kishtewar.html |title=Kishtewar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dcmsme.gov.in/dips/DPS%20Kishatwar.pdf |title=Brief Industrial Profile of  Kishatwar  District |last=Development Institute |first=MSME}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the reign of Raja Kalsa of Kashmir (1063–1089), when "Uttamaraja", the ruler of Kashthavata visited the court of the Kashmir King in company with several other hill chiefs to pay their respects to the Raja.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Kishtwar merged with the State of Jammu and Kashmir in 1821, A.D.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}  With the passage of time Kishtwar became a Tehsil of the [[Udhampur district]] and remained so until 1948, when it became part of the newly created District [[Doda district|Doda]] in the wake of first re-organization of the state during the post-independence period.

==Economy==
The economy of area is not regularized with no visible investment from government. The area being rural in nature has agriculture based economy. The Padder area produces world class Pine nuts called chilgoza which is a delicacy and costly dry fruit. In Marwah, Chatroo, Mughalmaidan and Bounjwah Tehsils wall nut production of best quality walnuts in thousands of tons is recorded but due to absence of any fruit Mandi the exact figures are not available. Besides walnut, Marwah Tehsil produces thousands of tons of kidney beans which is the cash crop of the area. Villages of Pochhal, Matta and Hidyal produce saffron of good quality. The rural households are also abundantly gifted by nature through cash crops of eatable mushrooms and [[morchella]] called ''guchhi'' in local language. Some families have been reported to earn more than Rs1,00,000 per year by just selling the dried morchella in local markets. The eatable ferns are also a natural cash crop of the area. The apples are produced in some areas however the quality of Kishtwar apple is not of world class. Due to dry nature of the climate the village peasant population usually grow wheat and barley in Rabi season and kidney bean and maize in Kharif season.
The rivers are rich source of electricity and the site of the hydroelectric power projects of [[Dul Hasti Dam|Dul Hasti]] 390 MW, Ratle Hydroelectric Project 850 MW, Kirthai 1400 MW, [[Pakal Dul Dam|Pakal Dool]] 1,000 MW, Lower Kalnai 48 MW and Chaudhary 15MW, Keeru HEPP and Kwar HEPP with the highest per capita wattage production in world for such a small area.These projects have been the largest source of employment and have immensely contributed to the prosperity of the area. Kishtwar has the distinction of producing world class blue Diamond Sapphire and its Kashmir sapphire was mined at Padder valley. The area is although rich in natural mineral resources but poor infrastructure has posed difficulty in its extraction. Mineral gypsum is mined at Village Trigam. The river sand of Chenab is of best quality and used extensively for construction purpose.

==Early life==
Inoue was born in Kochi Prefecture.&lt;ref name=JT1&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Kiyoshi Inoue|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20011125b3.html|publisher=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[University of Tokyo]]; and his doctoral thesis was "The History of Modern Reform."&lt;ref name="iwanami"&gt;[[Iwanami Shoten, Publishers|Iwanami shoten]], [http://www.iwanami.co.jp/moreinfo/600111+/top4.html Inoue bio notes]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded his Ph.D. in 1936.&lt;ref name=JT1/&gt;

==Career==
In 1954, Inoue joined the faculty of the University of Kyoto as an associate professor at the Institute of Humanities.&lt;ref name="iwanami"/&gt;  In 1961, he was named a professor.  He continued as a member of the Kyoto faculty until his retirement in 1977.&lt;ref name=JT1/&gt;

In his early career, Inoue established himself as a [[Marxist historian]], publishing works on such subjects as the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese imperial system]] and [[buraku]].

In his later years, Inoue worked to expand the number of academic exchanges between Japan and China,&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2003-09/12/content_1076909.htm 日本已故历史学家、社会活动家井上清]&lt;/ref&gt; and led a movement seeking solidarity with Asian nations.&lt;ref name=JT1/&gt; He also published works on the subject of the [[Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute]] that sided with the Chinese claim.

Inoue received an honorary degree from the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] in 1997.

== Inoue's views ==
Inoue had published a book criticizing the imperial system; and he continued to be critical of the Japanese emperor throughout his life.&lt;ref name=JT1/&gt; In a range of topics, his work was often viewed as controversial&lt;ref&gt;LaFeber, Walter. (1999). {{Google books|-vTLF9KIzYoC&amp;dq|''The Clash: U.S.-Japanese Relations throughout History,'' p. 418 n.21.|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to his active protests and lawsuits against the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;deBaets, Antoon. (2002) {{Google books|4DlMSrtOGLIC|''Censorship of Historical Thought: a World Guide, 1945–2000,'' p. 314.|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Japanese students riots in 1969, Professor Inoue openly supported the students who were demanding the scrapping of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.&lt;ref name=JT1/&gt;

Inoue was also very critical of "Japanese militarism" in the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute with China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Japanese Militarism &amp;  Diaoyutai (Senkaku) Island|url=http://www.skycitygallery.com/japan/diaohist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had written a number of books on the subject.

He is known for his theories on the [[origin of life]].

==Biography==
Born in [[London, England|London]], England, Orgel received his Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry with [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first class honours]] from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1948. In 1951 he was elected a [[Research fellow|Fellow]] of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] and in 1953 was awarded his PhD. in chemistry.

Orgel started his career as a [[Theoretical chemistry|theoretical]] [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] chemist and continued his studies in this field at Oxford, the [[California Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of Chicago]].

Together with [[Sydney Brenner]], [[Jack D. Dunitz|Jack Dunitz]], [[Dorothy Hodgkin]], and Beryl M. Oughton he was one of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of [[DNA]], constructed by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson|James Watson]], at the time he and the other scientists were working at Oxford University's Chemistry Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology|last=Judson|first=Horace Freeland|publisher=CSH Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-879694-78-4|location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York|pages=238|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the late Dr. Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner who subsequently worked with Crick; Orgel himself also worked with Crick at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Olby, Robert, ''Francis Crick: Hunter of Life's Secrets,'' Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2009, Chapter 10, p. 181 {{ISBN|978-0-87969-798-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 he joined the chemistry department at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. There he did work in [[transition metal]] chemistry and [[ligand field theory]], published several peer-reviewed journal articles and wrote a textbook entitled ''Transition Metal Chemistry: Ligand Field Theory'' (1960). He developed the [[Orgel diagram]] showing the energies of electronic terms in transition metal complexes.

Orgel formulated his [[error catastrophe]] theory of ageing in 1963, which has since been experimentally refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolutionary Biology of Aging|date=1991|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, NY|pages=147–152|author1=Michael R. Rose|authorlink1=Michael R. Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Orgel was appointed Senior Fellow and Research Professor at the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in [[La Jolla, California]], where he directed the Chemical Evolution Laboratory. He was also an adjunct professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the [[University of California, San Diego]], and he was one of five principal investigators in the [[NASA]]-sponsored NSCORT program in [[Astrobiology|exobiology]]. Orgel also participated in NASA's [[Viking program|Viking]] Mars Lander Program as a member of the Molecular Analysis Team that designed the [[gas chromatography]] [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] instrument that robots took to the planet [[Mars]].

Orgel's lab came across an economical way to make [[Cytosine arabinoside|cytarabine]], a compound that is one of today's most commonly used [[Cancer#Treatment|anti-cancer agents]].

Together with [[Stanley Miller]], Orgel also suggested that [[peptide nucleic acid]]s – rather than [[ribonucleic acid]]s – constituted the first pre-[[Life|biotic]] systems capable of [[self-replication]] on [[early Earth]].

His name is popularly known because of [[Orgel's rule]]s, credited to him, particularly Orgel's Second Rule: "[[Evolution]] is cleverer than you are." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dunitz, Jack D.|author2=Joyce, Gerald F.|title=Leslie E. Orgel|journal=Biographical Memoirs, National Academy of Sciences|year=2013|page= 11|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/orgel-leslie.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Origins of Life'', Orgel coined the concept of [[specified complexity]], to describe the criterion by which living organisms are distinguished from non-living matter. He published over three hundred articles in his research areas.

In 1993, Orgel presented at the "What is Life?" Conference at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin, Ireland along with many other prominent scientists exploring origin of life research such as [[Manfred Eigen]], [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. Orgel's talk was on "Molecular Structure and Disordered Crystals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icr.provocation.net/whatislf.htm|title=WHAT IS LIFE? The next fifty years Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland September 20th – 22nd,|last=Rice|first=Fredric L.|website=icr.provocation.net|access-date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orgel died of pancreatic cancer on 27 October 2007 at the San Diego Hospice &amp; Palliative Care in San Diego.

== Contributions to Origin of Life Research ==

=== Nucleobase Synthesis ===
Orgel proposed a novel solution to a problem with [[Joan Oró|Juan Oro]]'s proposed mechanism of [[nucleobase]] synthesis on the [[Abiogenesis|early Earth]], which relied on the reaction of five molecules of [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) to form [[adenine]]. The problem with this was that it would require much more concentrated hydrogen cyanide than evidence suggested was present.

Orgel suggested that the hydrogen cyanide was frozen in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanchez|first=R.|last2=Ferris|first2=J.|last3=Orgel|first3=L. E.|date=1 July 1966|title=Conditions for purine synthesis: did prebiotic synthesis occur at low temperatures?|journal=Science|volume=153|issue=3731|pages=72–73|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5938419|doi=10.1126/science.153.3731.72|bibcode=1966Sci...153...72S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would concentrate HCN molecules in the spaces in between the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]] of ice, and also solved the problem of HCN being too [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]] in a liquid water solution.

=== Nucleoside Formation ===
For [[nucleoside]] ([[nucleobase]] + [[ribose]] sugar) synthesis, Orgel suggested an almost opposite approach, heating a mixture of ribose and the [[purine]] nucleobases [[hypoxanthine]], adenine, and [[guanine]] to dryness in the presence of [[magnesium]] ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuller|first=William D.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Robert A.|last3=Orgel|first3=Leslie E.|date=14 June 1972|title=Studies in prebiotic synthesis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002228367290383X|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=67|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1016/0022-2836(72)90383-X|pmid=4339529}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction puts the [[glycosidic bond]] in the correct position in two ways: the nucleobase attaches to the correct carbon on ribose, and in the correct orientation (the beta [[anomer]]).

However, the synthesis was later criticised because it only worked most with hypoxanthine, a nucleobase that is not relevant to current life on Earth, and because it was not specific for the ribose sugar and could instead be applied to other sugars.

=== RNA Polymerization ===
Continuing his work exploring the [[Abiogenesis#Chemical synthesis|prebiotic synthesis]] of [[RNA]], Orgel suggested a solution to the problem of condensing [[nucleotide]]s to form [[nucleic acid]] [[polymer]]s, an energy-demanding process. To counteract this energy barrier, he proposed a nucleotide with an [[imidazole]] ring attached to the [[phosphate]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lohrmann|first=R.|last2=Bridson|first2=P. K.|last3=Orgel|first3=L. E.|date=27 June 1980|title=Efficient metal-ion catalyzed template-directed oligonucleotide synthesis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/208/4451/1464|journal=Science|language=en|volume=208|issue=4451|pages=1464–1465|doi=10.1126/science.6247762|issn=0036-8075|pmid=6247762|bibcode=1980Sci...208.1464L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imidazole would be a good [[leaving group]] for the [[condensation]] of nucleotides.

Orgel also theorised that one single strand of RNA could have been the [[Template strand|template]] for the first life on Earth and that these imidazole-activated nucleotides could have used this DNA template strand to polymerise and [[Replicate (biology)|replicate]]. However, in lab experiments, this only worked when the DNA template strands were rich in the nucleotide [[cytosine]], and furthermore, there so far is no proposed prebiotic synthesis for how an imidazole-activated nucleotide could be formed on the early Earth.

=== Directed Panspermia ===
Though he later downplayed the hypothesis, Orgel, along with [[Francis Crick]], proposed a detailed [[panspermia]] scenario for the origin of life on Earth, going so far as to suggest that life on Earth was designed by an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien species]] and sent to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crick|first=F. H. C.|last2=Orgel|first2=L. E.|date=1 July 1973|title=Directed panspermia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103573901103|journal=Icarus|volume=19|issue=3|pages=341–346|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90110-3|bibcode=1973Icar...19..341C}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed a design for the spaceship that aliens could have used to seed life on Earth.

=== RNA World ===
In the late 1960s, Orgel proposed that life was based on RNA before it was based on DNA or proteins. His theory included genes based on RNA and RNA enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joyce|first=Gerald F.|year=2007|title=Obituary: Leslie Orgel (1927–2007)|journal=Nature|volume=450|pages=627|doi=10.1038/450627a|bibcode=2007Natur.450..627J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view would be developed and shaped into the now widely-accepted [[RNA world]] hypothesis.

Almost thirty years later, Orgel wrote a lengthy review of the RNA World hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=E|first=Orgel Leslie|date=1 January 2004|title=Prebiotic Chemistry and the Origin of the RNA World|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10409230490460765|journal=Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|volume=39|issue=2|pages=99–123|doi=10.1080/10409230490460765|issn=1040-9238|pmid=15217990}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review highlighted many proposed syntheses for RNA and its parts in [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] conditions, noted the significance of the discovery of [[ribozyme]]s (RNA molecules that function as [[enzyme]]s just as Orgel had once predicted) and at the same time, demonstrated nucleic acid polymers with alternatives to ribose such as [[Threose nucleic acid|threose nucleic acid (TNA)]] and [[Peptide nucleic acid|peptide nucleic acid (PNA)]].

In conclusion, Orgel wrote, "One must recognize that, despite considerable progress, the problem of the origin of the RNA World is far from being solved."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves (or how I slugged it out with Lou Reed and stayed awake)''' is an infamous interview with [[Lou Reed]] conducted by [[Lester Bangs]] and published in ''[[Creem]]'' magazine in 1975. It is now regarded as a classic document of [[music journalism]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The title is a play on ''[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Men]],'' the book by [[James Agee]]. The full interview was reprinted in the [[New Musical Express]] in November 2013, as a tribute to Lou Reed, who died the previous month.

==Approach==
In this [[Gonzo journalism|Gonzo-style]] interview Lester Bangs attempts to demythologize rock-n-roll and its stars, by giving the arrogant behavior of rock superstars a more vulnerable, human context.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Content==
An extended introduction describes Bangs' complex feelings about the music of Lou Reed, admiring his songwriting genius, but intrigued by some of the anti-social aspects of Lou's more challenging albums, such as ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' and ''[[Metal Machine Music]],'' as well as Lou's sometimes hostile personality.  

After fortifying himself with research and drugs, Lester Bangs meets Lou Reed in a hotel room, where they trade barbed personal insults, and argue about the current music scene, [[amphetamine]] formulae, and the background music which Lou has selected ([[Herbie Hancock]]).

In a provocative gesture, Lester finally challenges Lou to remove his sunglasses:

"...Lou's sallow skin almost as whitish yellow as his hair, whole face and frame so transcendently emaciated he had indeed become insectival. His eyes were rusty, two copper coins lying in desert sands under the sun all day with telephone wires humming overhead, but he looked straight at me. Maybe through me..."

==Quote==
* "A hero is a goddam stupid thing to have in the first place and a general block to anything you might wanta accomplish on your own."&lt;ref&gt;''Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves'', interview/essay, Creem Magazine, March 1975, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mike Schmeitzner''' (born [[Dresden]] 29 July 1968) is a [[Germany|German]] [[historian]].&lt;ref name=ErfurtMSVita&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-erfurt.de/fileadmin/public-docs/Geschichte/Neuere_und_Zeitgeschichte/Team/Vita.Schmeitzner.pdf|title=VITA – Dr. Mike Schmeitzner |accessdate=10 December 2014|publisher=[[University of Erfurt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His focus is on twentieth century German history.&lt;ref name=HaanarenMS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hait.tu-dresden.de/ext/ma.asp?eing=3&amp;la=1|title=PD Dr. Mike Schmeitzner|publisher=[[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]], [[Dresden University of Technology]]|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmeitzner was born in the southern part of what was then the [[German Democratic Republic]].   His 1968 birth year meant that his university-level education straddled [[Die Wende|the events]] that led to [[German reunification]] in the second half of 1990.   He successfully completed his schooling in Dresden at the [[:de:Gymnasium Dresden-Plauen|"Friedrich Engels Extended Secondary School (EOS) - Dresden south"]] in 1987 and then, in 1987/88, worked for [[VEB Robotron]], a large electronics manufacturing operation.   He then returned to academe, studying [[History]], [[German studies|German Language, Culture and Linguistics]] and Education, initially at [[:de:Pädagogische Hochschule „Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander“ Dresden|Dresden's Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander Pedagogical Academy]] and then at the [[Dresden University of Technology]].&lt;ref name=ErfurtMSVita/&gt;

His work has focused on the [[Weimar Republic|History of the "Weimar Republic"]], of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], of the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation zone (SBZ / ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'')]] in what had previously been Germany, and on the formative years of the [[German Democratic Republic]] which grew out of it.   He has also undertaken extensive historical research into nineteenth and twentieth century [[Parliamentary system|Parliamentary structures]], Youth movements and left-wing [[Totalitarianism]].&lt;ref name=HaanarenMS/&gt;   He is a member of various academic bodies including the advisory board of the [[Stiftung Sächsische Gedenkstätten zur Erinnerung an die Opfer politischer Gewaltherrschaft|Saxony Memorials Foundation]] and of the [[President Friedrich Ebert Memorial|Friedrich Ebert Memorial House]].   He is also a member of the Editorial board for the quarterly journal: "Dresdner Hefte. Beiträge zur Kulturgeschichte".

'''Mykola Andriyovych Markevych''' ({{lang-uk|Микола Маркевич}}) (7 February 1804 – 21 June 1860) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] musician, composer, historian, [[ethnographer]], and poet.

Mykola Markevych was born in Dunaiets, [[Ukraine]] on 7 February 1804. He studied at the [[Saint Petersburg]] Pedagogical Institute from 1817 to 1820 and studied piano and [[musical composition|composition]] in Moscow. He served as an officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]] from 1820–24.

Markevych collected many historical materials on Ukraine's history and Ukrainian [[folk songs]] at his estate and around Ukraine.  He wrote many works on Ukrainian folk customs and beliefs, as well as foods.  His greatest work was the "''History of Little Russia (Ukraine)''" (Історії Малоросії), which was published in Moscow in 1842–3.  In it, Markevych portrays Ukraine as "ours" (part of [[Imperial Russia]]), but not "us" (not [[Russians|Russian]]).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sanders.  ''Historiography of Imperial Russia: The Profession and Writing of History in Mulinational State.''  (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;   He also wrote extensively on Ukrainian cossacks, most notably on [[Ivan Mazepa]] and [[Yakiv Barabash]].  His works influenced his friend and contemporary [[Taras Shevchenko]].

He died in Turivka, Ukraine on 21 June 1860. Many of his works have not been published. His personal archive and diary are kept at the Institute of Russian Literature in [[Saint Petersburg]].

'''Robin George Collingwood''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|ɪ|ŋ|ˌ|w|ʊ|d}}; 1889–1943) was an English [[philosopher]], historian and archaeologist. He is best known for his philosophical works including ''The Principles of Art'' (1938) and the posthumously published ''The Idea of History'' (1946).

==Biography==
Collingwood was born 22 February 1889 in [[Cartmel]], [[Grange-over-Sands]], in [[Lancashire]], the son of the artist and archaeologist [[W.&amp;nbsp;G. Collingwood]], who had acted as [[John Ruskin]]'s private secretary in the final years of Ruskin's life. Collingwood's mother was also an artist and a talented pianist. He was educated at [[Rugby School]], and at [[University College, Oxford]], where he gained a First in Classical Moderations (Greek and Latin) in 1910 and a congratulatory First in [[Greats]] (Ancient History and Philosophy) in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Calendar 1913'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1913, pp. 196, 222&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to graduation he was elected a fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]].

Collingwood was a fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], for some 15 years until becoming the [[Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He was taught by the historian and archaeologist [[Francis J. Haverfield|F. J. Haverfield]], at the time [[Camden Professor of Ancient History]].  Important influences on Collingwood were the Italian Idealists [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Giovanni Gentile]] and [[Guido de Ruggiero]], the last of whom was also a close friend. Other important influences were [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Giambattista Vico]], [[F.&amp;nbsp;H. Bradley]] and [[John Alexander Smith|J.&amp;nbsp;A. Smith]].

After several years of increasingly debilitating strokes Collingwood died at [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], Lancashire, on 9 January 1943. He was a practising [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] throughout his life.

==Philosopher==
===Philosophy of history===
Collingwood is widely noted for ''The Idea of History'' (1946), which was collated from various sources soon after his death by a student, [[Malcolm Knox|T. M. Knox]]. It came to be a major inspiration for philosophy of history in the English-speaking world and is extensively cited, leading to an ironic remark by commentator [[Louis Mink]] that Collingwood is coming to be "the best known neglected thinker of our time".&lt;ref&gt;Mink, Louis O. (1969). ''Mind, History, and Dialectic''. Indiana University Press, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collingwood thought that history cannot be studied in the same way as natural science because the internal thought processes of historical persons cannot be perceived with the physical senses, and past historical events cannot be directly observed. He suggested that a historian must "reconstruct" history by using "historical imagination" to "re-enact" the thought processes of historical persons based on information and evidence from historical sources.

Collingwood pointed out a fundamental difference between knowing things in the present (or in the natural sciences) and knowing history. To come to know things in the present or about things in the natural sciences, "real" things can be observed, as they are in existence or that have substance right now.

===Philosophy of art===
''The Principles of Art'' (1938) comprises Collingwood's most developed treatment of [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] questions. Collingwood held (following Croce) that works of art are essentially expressions of emotion. For Collingwood, an important social role for artists is to clarify and articulate emotions from their community.

Collingwood developed a position later known as [[aesthetic expressivism]], a thesis first developed by [[Benedetto Croce]].&lt;ref name=RCA&gt;Berys Gaut and Dominic McIver Lopes, ''The Routledge Companion to Aesthetics'', Routledge, 2002, ch. 11: "Expressivism: Croce and Collingwood."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political philosophy===
In politics Collingwood defended the ideals of what he called liberalism "in its Continental sense":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The essence of this conception is... the idea of a community as governing itself by fostering the free expression of all political opinions that take shape within it, and finding some means of reducing this multiplicity of opinions to a unity.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Collingwood (2005). "Man Goes Mad" in ''The Philosophy of Enchantment''. Oxford University Press, 318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''Autobiography'', Collingwood confessed that his politics had always been "democratic" and "liberal", and shared Guido de Ruggiero's opinion that socialism had rendered a great service to liberalism by pointing out the shortcomings of laissez-faire economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boucher |first1=David |title=The Social and Political Thought of R.&amp;nbsp;G. Collingwood |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeologist==
Collingwood was not just a philosopher of history but also a practising historian and archaeologist. He was, during his time, a leading authority on [[Roman Britain]]: he spent his term time at Oxford teaching philosophy but devoted his long vacations to archaeology.

He began work along [[Hadrian's Wall]]. The family home was at Coniston in the Lake District and his father was a leading figure in the Cumberland and Westmorland Archaeological Society. Collingwood was drawn in on a number of excavations and put forward the theory that Hadrian's Wall was not so much a fighting platform but an elevated sentry walk.&lt;ref&gt;''The Vasculum'' 8:4–9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also put forward the suggestion that Hadrian's defensive system also included a number of forts along the Cumberland coast.

He was very active in the 1930 Wall Pilgrimage for which he prepared the ninth edition of [[John Collingwood Bruce|Bruce]]'s Handbook.

His final and most controversial excavation in Cumbria was that of a circular ring ditch near Penrith known as [[King Arthur's Round Table (henge)]] in 1937. It appeared to be a Neolithic henge monument, and Collingwood's excavations, failing to find conclusive evidence of Neolithic activity, nevertheless found the base of two stone pillars, a possible cremation trench and some post holes. Sadly, his subsequent ill health prevented him undertaking a second season so the work was handed over to the German prehistorian [[Gerhard Bersu]], who queried some of Collingwood's findings. However, recently, Grace Simpson, the daughter of the excavator F.&amp;nbsp;G. Simpson, has queried Bersu's work and largely rehabilitated Collingwood as an excavator.&lt;ref&gt;''Collingwood Studies'' 5, 1998, 109-119&lt;/ref&gt;

He also began what was to be the major work of his archaeological career, preparing a corpus of the ''[[Roman Inscriptions of Britain]]'', which involved travelling all over Britain to see the inscriptions and draw them; he eventually prepared drawings of nearly 900 inscriptions. It was finally published in 1965 by his student R.P. Wright.

He also published two major archaeological works. The first, somewhat surprisingly for a philosopher was ''The Archaeology of Roman Britain'', a handbook in sixteen chapters covering first the archaeological sites (fortresses, towns and temples and portable antiquities) inscriptions, coins, pottery and brooches. [[Mortimer Wheeler]] in a review,&lt;ref&gt;Antiquity 43&lt;/ref&gt; remarked that "it seemed at first a trifle off beat that he should immerse himself in so much museum-like detail… but I felt sure that this was incidental to his primary mission to organise his own thinking".

However, his most important work was his contribution to the first volume of the Oxford History of England, ''Roman Britain and the English Settlements'', of which he wrote the major part, [[Nowell Myres]] adding the second smaller part on English settlements. The book was in many ways revolutionary for it set out to write the story of Roman Britain from an archaeological rather than a historical viewpoint, putting into practice his own belief in 'Question and Answer' archaeology.

The result was alluring and influential. However, as [[Ian Richmond]] wrote, 'The general reader may discover too late that it has one major defect. It does not sufficiently distinguish between objective and subjective and combines both in a subtle and apparently objective presentation'.&lt;ref&gt;I. A. Richmond, ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 29:478&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notorious passage is that on Romano-British art: "The impression that constantly haunts the archaeologist, like a bad smell, is that of an ugliness that plagues the place like a London fog".&lt;ref&gt;Collingwood 1937, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

Collingwood’s most important contribution to British archaeology was his insistence on Question and Answer archaeology: excavations should not take place unless there is a question to be answered. It is a philosophy which, as [[Anthony Birley]] points out,&lt;ref&gt;Introductory essay in R. G. Collingwood, ''An Autobiography'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has been incorporated by English Heritage into the conditions for Scheduled Monuments Consent. Still, it has always been surprising that the proponents of the "new" archaeology in the 1960s and the 70s have entirely ignored the work of Collingwood, the one major archaeologist who was also a major professional philosopher. He has been described as and early proponent of [[archaeological theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Leach, S. |chapter=R.G. Collingwood – An Early Archaeological Theorist? |editor1=Duggan, M. |editor2=McIntosh, F. |editor3=Rohl, D.

==Author==
Outside archaeology and philosophy, he also published the travel book ''The First Mate's Log of a Voyage to Greece'' (1940), an account of a yachting voyage in the Mediterranean, in the company of several of his students.

[[Arthur Ransome]] was a family friend, and learned to sail in their boat, subsequently teaching his sibling's children to sail. Ransome loosely based [[List of characters in Arthur Ransome books#The Swallows|the Swallows]] in ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' on his sibling's children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4327">{{Tort law}}
The '''tort of seduction''' was a civil wrong or [[tort]] in [[common law]] legal systems, and still exists in some jurisdictions. 

An unmarried woman could sue on the grounds of [[seduction]] to obtain damages from her seducer, if her [[Sexual consent|consent to sex]] was based upon his misrepresentation.&lt;ref name="pos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Posner|year=1994|title=Sex and Reason|page=81|isbn=0-674-80279-9|quote=The tort of seduction allows an unmarried woman (formerly her father or other guardian), usually but not always a virgin, to obtain damages from her seducer, provided that he made misrepresentations to obtain her consent to sex.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
Initially, the tort of seduction was a remedy for a father's property interest in his daughter's chastity.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; However, the damages to which the father would be entitled were based on the father's loss of the working services of a daughter, much as a master could sue if a third-party caused injury to his servant that rendered the servant unable to work, because she was "seduced and debauched" and became pregnant as a result of nonmarital sexual activity. The tort of seduction was one of the most common civil actions toward the end of the 19th century, and fathers were often successful before juries.&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;http://writ.news.findlaw.com/grossman/20030211.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 20th century, the action was criticised as maintaining "property interests in humans", and the tort was recast to recognize personal injury to the woman, rather than solely deprivation of a father's property right. Most jurisdictions granted the victim (the wronged woman) the right to sue in her own name. (Fathers could still sue as well, on the ground that they had a moral interest in their daughters' chastity).&lt;ref name=findlaw /&gt; The suing woman was "usually but not always a virgin".&lt;ref name="pos"/&gt;

==England==
Historically, the seduced female could not bring a suit herself. Rather, it would be brought by her father, acting under the [[legal fiction]] that the parent-child relationship falls under the master-servant relationship. However, if the daughter was a contracted servant, a suit could not be brought by her father against her master.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==Canada==
[[Property and civil rights]] is a [[federalism|provincial power]] in [[Canada]], so all torts can vary by province.

===Ontario===
An Act to make the remedy for cases of seduction more effectual, and to tender the fathers of illegitimate children liable for their support, was passed in [[Upper Canada]] on March 4, 1837. Amending traditional [[common law]], it allowed fathers to sue their daughters' masters for the tort of seduction. It also held [[biological father]]s liable for children conceived out of wedlock.

The Seduction Act was repealed in 1978.&lt;ref name="family"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey|first=Martha|year=1991|title=Girls and Masters: The Tort of Seduction and the Support of Bastards|journal=Canadian Journal of Family Law|volume=10|pages=137–162|url=http://faculty.law.ubc.ca/cdnjfl/art/1011991.html#bailey|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alberta===
The 1934 [[John Brownlee sex scandal]] revolved around a seduction suit.

===Other provinces===
An 1852 statute in [[Prince Edward Island]] allowed for a seduced woman to sue for herself with this tort.,&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; although damages were capped at 100 [[Pound sterling|pounds]]. [[Manitoba]] and the [[North West Territories]] enacted similar legislation around the turn of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the tort of seduction has been abolished in "most states".&lt;ref name="pos"/&gt; Fears of fraudulent suits, combined with a turn away from the view of property interests in persons, led to the enactment of "[[heart balm]]" statutes, abolishing causes of action for seduction, [[breach of promise]], [[alienation of affection]], [[criminal conversation]], etc. in most states in the 20th century.

He was educated at [[Sacred Heart College, Auckland|Sacred Heart College]],&lt;ref name="Fishpond"/&gt; and later studied at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University College]], where he graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shadowsoftime.co.nz/university13.html|title=NZ university graduates 1870–1961: I–K|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jelicich married Barbara Jean McLennan in 1958.&lt;ref name="Death notice"/&gt;

==Architectural practice==
{{Expand section|date=December 2015}} 
In 1949, Jelicich formed Brenner Associates in [[Auckland]] with fellow architects Desmond Mullen and Ron Grant and designer [[Milan Mrkusich]]. As well as architectural work, the firm engaged in integrated interior, exhibition, lighting and furniture design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd-Jenkins|first=Douglas|title=Modernism and the Auckland Design Community|journal=New Zealand Home &amp; Building: The 1950s Show|year=1992|issue=Souvenir edition|page=58|publisher=AGM Publishing/Auckland Art Gallery|location=Auckland|ISBN=0864631898}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 they established Auckland's first modern design store, specialising in imported and local furniture, ceramics, woodwork and glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lostproperty.org.nz/architects/vlad-cacala/ |title=Vlad Cacala |date= |website=Lost Property |publisher= |accessdate= 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brenner Associates was dissolved in about 1958, and Jelicich went into sole practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynda|first=Simmons|title=From Man Alone to larrikin: the work of Neil Simmons 1958–84 (March thesis)|url=http://www.lyndasimmonsarchitect.co.nz/pdf/1.History.pdf|accessdate=21 December 2015|year=2011|publisher=University of Auckland|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 1960, Jelicich formed the Architects Planning Group, with the aim of influencing planning issues in Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://issuu.com/ponsonbynews/docs/ponsonbynewsjun14highres4web/26|title=A tribute to Ivan Mercep|date=June 2014|work=Ponsonby News|accessdate=21 December 2015|first=Deirdre|last=Tohill|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered into partnership in 1963 with Rodney Davies, [[Ivan Mercep]], John Austin and Graham Smith to form what would become JASMaD (later Jasmax, one of the largest architectural practices in New Zealand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0805/S00253/new-zealands-best-new-buildings-recognised.htm|title=New Zealand's best new buildings recognised|date=25 May 2008|work=Scoop Independent News|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historian==
Jelicich researched the history of Croatian immigrants to New Zealand and their descendants. His book, ''From distant villages: the lives and times of Croatian settlers in New Zealand, 1858–1959'', was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/mainlander/347415/Still-yearning-for-Croatia|title=Still yearning for Croatia|date=4 April 2008|work=the Press|accessdate=21 December 2015|first=Mike|last=Crean}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a contributor to the ''[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|title=Kosovich, Ante|first=Stephen A.|last=Jelicich|id=3k20|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|title=Totich, John Mark|first=Stephen A.|last=Jelicich|id=3t39|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Teymur bey Bayramalibeyov was born to a noble family in the village of Yeddioymag in the present-day [[Masally District]] of [[Azerbaijan]] but spent most of his life in [[Lankaran]]. His family descended from the [[Iran]]ian Shahsevans who moved to the [[Caucasus]] in the 16th century. He received his primary education at a local [[madrasah]] where among other disciplines he learned [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] languages. He continued his education at the two-year Russian-Tartar School of Lankaran and a newly opened Russian school in [[Tiflis]] (present-day [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) where he was sponsored by philanthropists from the Baku Land Department. In 1879 he applied and was admitted to the [[Gori Pedagogical Seminary]] to receive his post-secondary education as a teacher.&lt;ref name="lankaran"&gt;{{Az icon}} [http://lankaran.aznet.org/lankaran/famous_az.htm Famous Personalities of Lankaran: Teymur Bayramalibeyov]. ''Lankaran.aznet.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from the seminary Bayramalibeyov was hired to teach at one of Lankaran's Russian schools. At the same time, he worked as a Lankaran regional reporter for the [[Baku]]-based Russian-language newspaper ''Kaspi''. In 1903 he started an amateur theatre where local teachers played roles in various staged plays. This was the theatre where [[Huseyn Arablinski]] revealed his talent in 1905 before going on to become a renowned Azerbaijani actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.axtar.az/ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=300&amp;Itemid=183 Huseyn Arablinski] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203152/http://www.axtar.az/ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=300&amp;Itemid=183 |date=2007-09-27 }}. ''Axtar.az''&lt;/ref&gt; Teymur Bayramalibeyov was the author of numerous historical books and articles, such as ''History of the [[Talysh Khanate]]'', ''Lankaran in the Past'' and several works on the mythology, folklore and lifestyles of the [[Talysh people]]. In 1917 Bayramalibeyov helped his daughter [[Maryam Bayramalibeyova]] in establishing the Unas Russian-Muslim School for Girls in Lankaran and to become its first principal. In 1918, with the independence of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] he became regional representative of the [[Musavat]] Party in Lankaran. He participated in the negotiations with the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation forces in Azerbaijan in 1919. After [[Azerbaijan SSR|Azerbaijan's Sovietization]] in 1920 he moved to Baku, where he worked as a secondary school instructor.&lt;ref name="lankaran"/&gt;

The '''Thule''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|l|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|uː|l}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/Thule#m_en_gb0862120 |title=Definition of Thule |website=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
or '''proto-Inuit''' were the ancestors of all modern [[Inuit]]. They developed in coastal [[Alaska]] by 1000 and expanded eastwards across [[Canada]], reaching [[Greenland]] by the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Robert |last=Mcghee |title=Thule Culture |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/thule-culture/ |encyclopedia=Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |date=3 April 2015 |access-date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, they replaced people of the earlier [[Dorset culture]] that had previously inhabited the region. The appellation "[[Thule]]" originates from the location of [[Pituffik|Thule]] (relocated and renamed [[Qaanaaq]] in 1953) in northwest Greenland, facing Canada, where the [[Archaeology|archaeological]] remains of the people were first found at [[Comer's Midden]]. The links between the Thule and the Inuit are [[biology|biological]], [[Culture|cultural]], and [[Eskimo–Aleut language|linguistic]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Evidence supports the idea that the Thule (and also the [[Dorset culture|Dorset]], but to a lesser degree) were in contact with the [[Vikings]], who had reached the shores of Canada in the 11th century. In Viking sources, these peoples are called the ''[[Skræling]]jar''. Some Thule migrated southward, in the "Second Expansion" or "Second Phase". By the 13th or 14th century, the Thule had occupied an area currently inhabited by the [[Central Inuit]], and by the 15th century, the Thule replaced the Dorset. Intensified contacts with Europeans began in the 18th century. Compounded by the already disruptive effects of the "[[Little Ice Age]]" (1650–1850), the Thule communities broke apart, and the people were henceforward known as the [[Eskimo]], and later, Inuit.

==History==
[[Image:Cambridge Bay Thule Site 1998-06-28.jpg|left|thumb|Thule archaeological site]]

The Thule Tradition lasted from about 200 B.C. to 1600 A.D. around the Bering Strait, the Thule people being the prehistoric ancestors of the Inuit who now live in Northern Labrador.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{cite web |last=Park |first=Robert W. |title=Thule Tradition |website=Arctic Archaeology |publisher=Department of Anthropology, University of Waterloo |url=http://anthropology.uwaterloo.ca/ArcticArchStuff/thule.html |access-date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thule culture was mapped out by [[Therkel Mathiassen]], following his participation as an archaeologist and cartographer of the Fifth Danish Expedition to Arctic America in 1921–1924. He excavated sites on Baffin Island and the northwestern [[Hudson Bay]] region, which he considered to be the remains of a highly developed Eskimo whaling culture that had originated in Alaska and moved to Arctic Canada approximately 1000 years ago.&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt;  There are three stages of development leading up to Thule culture; they are Okvik/Old Bering Sea, Punuk, Birnirk, and then Thule culture. These groups of peoples have been referred to as "Neo-Eskimo" cultures, which are differentiated from the earlier [[Norton Tradition]].&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt;

There are several stages of the Thule tradition: Old Bering Sea Stage, Punuk Stage, and Birnirk Stage. These stages represent variations of the Thule Tradition as it expanded over time. The Thule Tradition replaced the Dorset Tradition in the Eastern Arctic and introduced both [[kayak]]s and [[umiak]]s, or skin covered boats, into the archaeological record as well as developed new uses for [[iron]] and [[copper]] and demonstrated advanced [[harpoon]] technology and use of [[bowhead whale]]s, the largest animal in the Arctic.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt; and spread across the coasts of Labrador and Greenland. It is the most recent "neo-Eskimo" culture.

===Old Bering Sea stage B.C. 200 to A.D. 500===

The Old Bering Seas (OBS) stage was first characterized by [[Diamond Jenness]], on the basis of a collection of deeply [[patina]]ted decorated ivory harpoon heads and other objects dug up by natives on the St. Lawrence and Diomede Islands.&lt;ref name="karenm"&gt;{{cite book |last=McCullough |first=Karen M. |title=The Ruin Islanders: Early Thule Culture Pioneers in the Eastern High Arctic |publisher=Canadian Museum of Civilization |volume=Volume 141 of Archaeological Survey of Canada |series=Mercury Series Paperback |date=1989 |isbn=978-0-6601-0793-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jenness identified the Bering Sea culture as a highly developed Inuit culture of northeastern Asiatic origin and pre-Thule in age.

A strong maritime adaptation is characteristic of the Thule, and the OBS stage, and then can be seen in the archaeological evidence. Both Kayaks and umiaks (large skinned boats) appear in the archaeological record for the first time.&lt;ref name="fagan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian M. |title=Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent |edition=Fourth |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=New York |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-5002-8532-9 |pages=196–97, 210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toolkits of the people of the time are dominated by polished-slate rather than flaked-stone artifacts, including lanceolate knives, projectile heads, and the ulu transverse-bladed knife. The people also made a crude form of pottery and there was much use of [[bone]] and [[antler]]s to use as heads on harpoons, as well as to make darts, spears, snow goggles, blubber scrapers, needles, awls and mattocks, also walrus shoulder-blade snow shovels.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt;

There are many important innovations that emerged that allowed hunting to be more efficient. Harpoon mounted ice picks were used for seal hunting, as well as ivory plugs and mouthpieces for inflating harpoon line floats, which enabled them to recover larger sea mammals when dispatched. These people relied heavily on seal and walrus for subsistence. It is easy to pick out OBS technology because of the artistic curvilinear dots, circles, and shorter lines that were used to decorate their tools.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt;

The chronological relationship between the Okvik and Old Bering Seas cultures has been the subject of debate and remains largely undecided, based mainly on art styles. Some consider it to be a distinct culture pre-dating Old Bering Sea, but the close similarity and overlapping radiocarbon dates suggest Okvik and Old Bering Sea are best considered as roughly contemporaneous, with regional variants.&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt;

===Punuk and Birnirk stages c.  A.D. 800 to 1400===
The Punuk stage is a development of Old Bering Sea stage, with distribution along the major Strait islands and along to shores of the Chukchi Peninsula. The Punuk culture was initially defined by Henry Collins in 1928 from a {{convert|16|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} deep midden on one of the Punuk Islands. Later excavation on St Lawrence Island confirmed Jenness's ideas on the Bering Sea culture, and demonstrated a continual cultural sequence on the island from Old Bering Sea, to Punuk, to modern Eskimo culture.&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt;

Punuk is differentiated with Old Bering Sea through its artifact styles and house forms, as well as harpoon styles and whale hunting. Punuk settlements were larger and more common than earlier villages. They were subterranean, square or rectangular dwellings with wooden floors. The house was held up by whale jaw-bones, and covered in skins, sod and then snow. These houses were nicely insulated, and would have been only visible to the occupants.&lt;ref name="glenbow"&gt;{{cite web |website=The Glenbow Museum |title=Thule Whalebone House |date=2008 |access-date=1 June 2015}} (For a reconstructed 3D image of the house, and more information on life for a Thule person, [http://www.glenbow.org/thule/?lang=en&amp;p=outside click on this link.])&lt;/ref&gt;

Whaling has a greater emphasis in the Punuk stage. Hunters would use umiaks and kill whales in narrow ice leads as well as in the open sea in the fall. Open sea whaling required skilled leadership, teams of expert boatmen and hunters, and the cooperation of several boats. The whaleboat captain, the umialik, is still a prominent position in Arctic communities today.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt;
Chipped stone tools were replaced by ground slate, ivory winged tolls were largely replaced by tridents, and iron-tipped tools were used for engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ford |first1=James |title=Eskimo prehistory in the vicinity of Point Barrow, Alaska |journal=Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History |location=New York |date=1959 |volume=47 |issue=1 |access-date=1 June 2015 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/handle/2246/126//v2/dspace/ingest/pdfSource/ant/A047a01.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harpoon styles became simpler and more standardised, as did Punuk art.  The Punuk developed their methods of hunting that led to the creation of [[armor]] made from bone as well as the technology of the [[bow and arrow]]. As well, bone plated wrist guards, the reinforced bow, bird bola, heavy ivory net sinkers, and blunt tipped bird arrows appeared in the Punuk stage.&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt;

Birnirk culture is best known along coastal northern and western Alaska. There are three phases of Birnirk culture: Early Birnirk, Middle Birnirk, and Late Birnirk. These phases were primarily distinguishable by gradual changes in harpoon head and arrow styles. Harpoon heads were more often made of antler, rather than ivory, and were characterized by medially-placed, trifurcated spurs during Early Birnirk, bifurcated in Middle Birnirk, and single-laterally-placed spurs in Late Birnirk.&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt;

The Birnirk people used many of the same hunting methods and [[technology]] as Punuk and Old Bering Sea, but there was no art. There is very little evidence of tool or weapon decoration. The little art that was present in the Birnirk stage was limited to spiral and concentric motifs on clay pots with bone paddles.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt; They did use sledges, of the same basic design as were later used with dog teams. Birnirk people were sea-mammal hunters who engaged in fishing and whaling.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt; Birnirk houses were square shaped, with walls constructed of horizontal logs and single or double posts in each corner. Sleeping areas were at the back of the dwelling and were either built up or at floor level. No interior hearths were found in the house ruins, although heavily encrusted and fire-blackened pottery vessel fragments suggest extensive use of open fires.&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt;

===Classic Thule A.D. 1100 to 1400===
During this time, eastern Thule spread out throughout the high arctic and into the south. Thule people were living along the Hudson Strait coasts, in the Hudson's Bay region, and on the shores of the Foxe Basin, along the mainland from the Mackenzie Delta to Melville Peninsula. The term "Classic Thule" was originally coined by archaeologist Alan McCartney in regards to the population that existed between A.D. 1100 and 1400.
The Thule people still lived in semi-subterranean winter houses, but in the summer moved into skin tents, the edges held down by circles of stone. The Thule were using iron long before European contact. In the west it was used in small quantities for carving knives and for engraving other tools. The source of the iron came from both meteoric resources as well as trade from the [[Norsemen|Norse]] expansion and was used in the creation of projectile points through a process called epi-metallurgy which made stronger, harder, more efficient points. The metal enabled the Thule people to work with more materials to make more wood and bone tools. The only problem they faced was a lack of a steady supply of metal. The Thule were clever with technology. Reports on classic Thule sites lists myriad artifacts used for hunting.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt; Classic Thule did not place much emphasis on art. There were slight artistic details on household things such as [[comb]]s but it was very simple, linear designs featuring people without appendages, animals, or symbols that represented the human ties with the [[supernatural]] world.

===Post Classic Thule A.D. 1400 to European contact===
Post Classic Thule tradition existed from A.D. 1400 up until European contact in areas where whales were not as prevalent so there is an increase in evidence of other means of subsistence, such as caribou, seal and fish. These settlements show a more gradual settlement of fewer whales and using more subsistence strategies from the west. The redistribution of the Thule people reflects the population pressures of the Classic Thule, but the climate played a more important role. The onset of the "[[Little Ice Age]]" that occurred between A.D. 1400 and 1600 limited the use of boats and number of whales present in the area. This shortened the season for open-water whale hunting. By the 16th century, umiak and kayak whale hunting had ceased in the High Arctic. By A.D. 1600 the people had moved on and abandoned the High Arctic due to the severe [[climate change]]s.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}} The Thule Eskimos who lived near open water were not as affected by the decrease in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCartney |first1=Allen P. |last2=Savelle |first2=James M. |journal=Arctic Anthropology |title=Thule Eskimo Whaling in the Central Canadian Arctic |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |volume=22 |number=2 |date=1985 |page=40 |jstor=40316088 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that local groups such as the Copper [[Inuit]], Netsilingmuit, and Inglulingmuit emerged.

===Thule expansion into the West and Eastern Arctic===
Between A.D. 900 and A.D. 1100 the Thule Tradition spread westward. The efficiency of [[house|housing]] was improved as they spread to the west and [[hunting]] methods were improved due to the use of [[dog sled]]s, umiaks, and kayaks. This enabled the hunters to travel further to hunt and follow the migration of the [[large game]] and [[sea mammal]]s. After A.D. 1000 the practice of using polished [[slate]] for tool making continued to spread to the [[Aleutian Islands]]. The methods of [[pottery]] making also spread and replaced the Norton tradition in Southern Alaska.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt; There were differences between the areas to which the tradition migrated. Houses in the more eastern region were more above ground and round with stone platforms to sleep on. The shape and support for the buildings came from whale bones. Eastern populations preferred [[soapstone]] domestic items instead of pottery and developed the use of [[dog]]s to pull sleds.

Sometime around the beginning of the 2nd millennium, Thule people began migrating east.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt; As western Thule peoples settled the northern and western coasts of Alaska, other Thule groups migrated eastward across the Canadian Arctic as far as [[Greenland]]. Prior to A.D. 1000, the central and eastern Canadian Arctic were occupied by people of the [[Dorset Culture]]. Within a few centuries, Dorset culture was completely displaced by Thule immigrants from the west. Evidence of contact between Dorset and Thule peoples is scarce and the nature of the Dorset/Thule succession remains poorly understood.&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt;

Thule culture was first identified in the Eastern Arctic by interdisciplinary researches of Danish scholars between 1921 and 1924. A team of anthropologists, archaeologists and natural scientists compiled a massive description of the Canadian Arctic on the fifth Thule expedition.&lt;ref name="waterloo" /&gt; Therkel Mathiassen added upon their research and claimed that the tradition had started out in Alaska, and that Thule hunting was based on the dog sled, the large skin boat and the kayak which enabled them to range over a much greater hunting territory, participate in widespread trade, and transport heavier loads. Mathiassen was right about his hypotheses and even mapped out the Thule migration and interaction with Greenland.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt;

There are many different theories as to why the Thule moved out of the Bering Strait. One is the cultural/ecological model developed by R. McGhee. The ideas is that the first Thule families to move, followed groups of [[bowhead whale]]s, which were an important source of food, fuel and raw materials.&lt;ref name="glenbow" /&gt; The onset of the Neo-Atlantic climatic episode, a warming trend which occurred between A.D. 900 and 1200 in the northern hemisphere, resulted in the lengthened season of open water along the North Alaskan Coast, and an extension of the summer range of bowhead whales into the Beaufort Sea and further east into the Canadian Archipelago.&lt;ref name="karenm" /&gt; Like other whale species, bowheads tend to avoid ice-choked channels and passages because of the possibility of entrapment and death. General climatic warming may have reduced the extent and severity of pack ice, allowing bowheads and their Thule predators to expand eastward.&lt;ref name="glenbow" /&gt;

Another theory is that warfare in Alaska or a desire to seek out new resources of iron for making tools such as knives may have encouraged people to move eastward.&lt;ref name="glenbow" /&gt; Archaeologists have used the distribution of early Alaskan-style harpoon heads to track the routes taken by Thule people. One route follows the Beaufort Sea coast and Amundsen Gulf, entering the High Arctic via Parry Channel and Smith Sound. A second route led the Thule south, along the western coast of Hudson Bay.&lt;ref name="glenbow" /&gt;

==Culture==

Known for using [[slate]] knives, [[umiaks]], seal-skin floats  and [[toggling harpoon]]s, the Thule subsisted primarily on marine animals—especially large [[marine mammal|sea mammals]].

Thule winter settlements usually had one to four houses with about ten people each. Their houses were made of [[whale]] [[bone]]s from summer hunts. Other structures included kill sites, food caches, and [[tent]] encampments. Some major settlements may have had more than a dozen houses, although not all were inhabited at the same time by the approximately fifty residents.

==Tools==
The different stages of the Thule Tradition are distinguished by their different styles of making tools and art. The later stages, Punuk and [[Birnirk culture|Birnirk]], have greater representation in the [[archaeological record]] and are said to have spread further and lasted longer than their predecessor, the Old Bering Sea Stage.&lt;ref name="fagan" /&gt;  The Thule people are well known for their technological advances in transportation and hunting techniques and tools. The harpoon played a very significant role in whaling and the Thule people made several types of harpoon points out of [[whale bone]]. They also made inflated harpoon line floats to help them hunt larger prey.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/archaeo/online-exhibits/paleo-eskimo-cultures/thule/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsistence==
[[File:Ancient Thule Home.jpg|thumb|Whalebone used in the building of an ancient Thule home. [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]].]]
The Classic Thule tradition relied heavily on the [[bowhead whale]] for survival because bowhead whales swim slowly and sleep near the water's surface. Bowhead whales served many purposes for the Thule people. The people could get a lot of [[meat]] for food, [[blubber]] for oil that could be used for fires for light and cooking purposes, and the bones could be used for building structures and making tools.  The Thule people survived predominantly on fish, large sea mammals and caribou outside of the whaling communities. Because they had advanced transportation technology, they had access to a wider range of food sources. There is superb faunal preservation in Thule sites due to a late prehistoric date as well as an arctic environment. Most of the bowhead [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] were harvested from live bowhead whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCartney |first1=Allen P. |last2=Savelle |first2=James M. |title=Thule Eskimo Bowhead Whale Interception Strategies |journal=World Anthropology |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=30 |number=3, Arctic Anthropology |date=February 1999 |page=437 |jstor=124962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thule developed an expertise in hunting and utilizing as many parts of an animal as possible. This knowledge combined with their growing wealth of tools and modes of transportation allowed the Thule people to thrive. They whaled together where one person would shoot the whale with the harpoon and the others would throw the floats on it and they all transferred the whale to land to butcher it together to share with the entire community. Their unity played a significant role in the length of time they thrived in the Arctic.

==Thule sites and projects==
There are several major archaeological research projects that have been conducted on the Thule culture at sites including [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat]] Archaeological Project, [[Somerset Island (Nunavut)|Somerset Island]], The Clachan site, [[Coronation Gulf]], Nelson River, [[Baffin Island]], Victoria Island, the Bell site, [[Devon Island]] – QkHn-12, and Cape York.

The [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] term  '''''oğuz''''' or '''''oğur''''' (in [[z-Turkic|z-]] and [[r-Turkic]], respectively) is a historical term for "military division, clan, or tribe" among the [[Turkic peoples]].
With the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of 1206–21, the Turkic [[khaganate]]s were replaced by Mongol or hybrid [[Turco-Mongol]] confederations, where the corresponding military division came to be known as ''[[Orda (organization)|orda]]''.

The 8th-century [[Kül Tigin stela]] has the earliest attestation of the term in [[Old Turkic]] [[Orkhon inscriptions|epigraphy]], as ''Toquz Oghuz'' "nine tribes"
The term occurs in numerous proper names of tribes or confederations of the time of the [[Turkic migration]] during the early medieval period, viz.
*[[Onogurs|Onogur]] "ten tribes"
*[[Toquz Oghuz]] "nine tribes"
*[[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghur]]

The Old Turkic stem ''uq-, oq-'' "kin, tribe" is from a Proto-Turkic ''*uk''.
The Old Turkic word is sometimes connected with the Old Turkic word ''oq'' "arrow";&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin, [http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Calt%5Cturcet&amp;first=1&amp;off=&amp;text_proto=uk&amp;method_proto=substring&amp;ic_proto=on&amp;text_meaning=+&amp;method_meaning=substring&amp;ic_meaning=on&amp;text_rusmean=&amp;method_rusmean=substring&amp;ic_rusmean=on&amp;text_atu=&amp;method_atu=substring&amp;ic_atu=on&amp;text_krh=&amp;method_krh=substring&amp;ic_krh=on&amp;text_trk=&amp;method_trk=substring&amp;ic_trk=on&amp;text_tat=&amp;method_tat=substring&amp;ic_tat=on&amp;text_chg=&amp;method_chg=substring&amp;ic_chg=on&amp;text_uzb=&amp;method_uzb=substring&amp;ic_uzb=on&amp;text_uig=&amp;method_uig=substring&amp;ic_uig=on&amp;text_sjg=&amp;method_sjg=substring&amp;ic_sjg=on&amp;text_azb=&amp;method_azb=substring&amp;ic_azb=on&amp;text_trm=&amp;method_trm=substring&amp;ic_trm=on&amp;text_hak=&amp;method_hak=substring&amp;ic_hak=on&amp;text_shr=&amp;method_shr=substring&amp;ic_shr=on&amp;text_alt=&amp;method_alt=substring&amp;ic_alt=on&amp;text_khal=&amp;method_khal=substring&amp;ic_khal=on&amp;text_chv=&amp;method_chv=substring&amp;ic_chv=on&amp;text_jak=&amp;method_jak=substring&amp;ic_jak=on&amp;text_dolg=&amp;method_dolg=substring&amp;ic_dolg=on&amp;text_tuv=&amp;method_tuv=substring&amp;ic_tuv=on&amp;text_tof=&amp;method_tof=substring&amp;ic_tof=on&amp;text_krg=&amp;method_krg=substring&amp;ic_krg=on&amp;text_kaz=&amp;method_kaz=substring&amp;ic_kaz=on&amp;text_nogx=&amp;method_nogx=substring&amp;ic_nogx=on&amp;text_bas=&amp;method_bas=substring&amp;ic_bas=on&amp;text_blkx=&amp;method_blkx=substring&amp;ic_blkx=on&amp;text_gagx=&amp;method_gagx=substring&amp;ic_gagx=on&amp;text_krmx=&amp;method_krmx=substring&amp;ic_krmx=on&amp;text_klpx=&amp;method_klpx=substring&amp;ic_klpx=on&amp;text_sal=&amp;method_sal=substring&amp;ic_sal=on&amp;text_qum=&amp;method_qum=substring&amp;ic_qum=on&amp;text_reference=&amp;method_reference=substring&amp;ic_reference=on&amp;text_any=&amp;method_any=substring&amp;sort=proto&amp;ic_any=on Turkic etymology] ([http://starling.rinet.ru/ Online Etymological Database Project]),
citing VEWT 511, ЭСТЯ 1, 582-583, Егоров 76. Starostin thought the connection with "arrow" was made "erroneously".&lt;/ref&gt;
Pohl (2002) in explanation of this connection adduces the Chinese T'ang-shu chronicle, which reports that
"the khan divided his realm into ten tribes. To the leader of each tribe, he sent an arrow. The name [of these ten leaders] was 'the ten ''[[Shad (prince)|she]]''', but they were also called 'the ten arrows'."
&lt;ref&gt;the "arrows" connection was first reported by [[Édouard Chavannes]], ''Documents sur les Tou-kiue (Turcs) occidentaux'', 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pohl26"&gt;Walter Pohl, ''Die Awaren: ein Steppenvolk im Mitteleuropa, 567-822 n. Chr'', C.H.Beck (2002),  {{ISBN|978-3-406-48969-3}}, p. 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
An ''oguz'' (''ogur'') was in origin a military division of a [[Nomadic empire]], and only secondarily acquired tribal or ethnic connotations, by processes of [[ethnogenesis]].&lt;ref name="Pohl26"/&gt;

While he was in Britain Reeves became a friend of a number of left-wing intellectuals, such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H. G. Wells]], and [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], all leading members of the [[Fabian Society]].  He was also a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers.
[[File:William Pember Reeves, 1925.jpg|thumb|left|William Pember Reeves in 1925]]

Reeves became Director of the [[London School of Economics]] (1908–19) and President of the [[Anglo-Hellenic League]] (1913–25). He also headed the committee organising the [[First Universal Races Congress]] in London in 1911. Finally, he was chairman of the board of the [[National Bank of New Zealand]] from 1917 to 31.

Reeves's more influential writings include his history of New Zealand, ''The Long White Cloud'' (1898) and ''State Experiments in Australia and New Zealand'' (1902).  He also published a number of poems, such as "The Passing of the Forest" and "A Colonist in his Garden".

Reeves married, in 1885, the [[feminist]] [[Maud Pember Reeves|Magdalen Stuart Robison]], who joined the [[Fabian Society]]. They had two daughters, the [[feminist]] writer [[Amber Reeves]] (born 1887) and Beryl (born 1889), and one son, Fabian Pember Reeves (1895–1917), who was killed in the [[First World War]], aged 21, as a Flight Lieutenant in the [[Royal Naval Air Service|RNAS]].

Reeves three times declined offers of a [[knighthood]].&lt;ref name=NZdic/&gt;
