'''Besta Madang Fighters''' was a short-lived [[Papua New Guinea]] semi-professional football club founded in 2007, based in [[Madang]].

The club was founded as a new franchise ahead of the [[2007–08 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League]] season, consisting predominantly from the local-level areas of the Madang province.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/archives-15465/|title=PAPUA NEW GUINEA – BOUGAINVILLE TO JOIN PNG NSL? {{!}} Oceania Football Confederation|website=Oceania Football Confederation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club finished 6th out of 7 sides that season, and failed to return the following season.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tablesp/png07.html#nsl|title=Papua New Guinea 2007|website=rsssf.com|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The club was founded shortly before the 2007–08 National Soccer League, and was the second Madang-based franchise to enter the competition after [[Madang FC]]'s debut the previous season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The franchise was created to allow players from local-level government areas of the Madang province to get a taste of semi-professional football.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The team entered the second as one of two debuting teams, with the second being [[Rapatona F.C.|Rapatona FC]], who had competed for years in the Port Moresby Premier League. Rapatona's experience was no match for the newcomers in the opening match of the season, and the Fighters went down 3–0.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In their second game, they managed to hold champions [[Hekari United]] to a thrilling 4–4 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/archives-13669/|title=BLUE KUMULS ON TELIKOM NSL CUP ROLL {{!}} Oceania Football Confederation|website=Oceania Football Confederation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they would not win a league game until the fifth round of fixtures, when they defeated fellow Madang side [[Madang FC]] 3–2 thanks to a hat-trick from [[Niel Hans]]. The side then endured a run of four consecutive defeats, including a 6–0 thrashing in the return fixture against Hekari, but would win their second game against title-chasing [[Morobe FC]] on 16 February 2008, unexpectedly winning 4–0 to shake up the title race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/archives-15061/|title=WELGRIS HIGHLANDERS CAUSE TELIKOM CUP UPSET {{!}} Oceania Football Confederation|website=Oceania Football Confederation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would win twice more, completing the double over Madang FC with a 6–5 win later in February, before a 3–1 victory over [[Welgris Highlanders]] on the final day of the season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The side finished 6th in the table.

In October 2008, it was reported that both Madang-based teams had been kicked out of the National Soccer League, with 'poor performance and lack of support, financial and otherwise' being the reasons cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/archives-14757/|title=NABASA ENTER SIDE IN NSL {{!}} Oceania Football Confederation|date=2008-10-16|work=Oceania Football Confederation|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be the first and last time the side were seen in competitive action.

'''Bruce Russell''' (born 1960) is a New Zealand experimental musician and writer.

He is a founding member and guitarist of the [[noise rock]] trio [[The Dead C]] and the free [[noise music|noise]] combo [[A Handful of Dust (band)|A Handful of Dust]] (with [[Alastair Galbraith (musician)|Alastair Galbraith]]). He has released solo albums featuring guitar and tape manipulation, and has contributed articles to British music magazine [[The Wire (magazine)|''The Wire'']].

He established the [[Xpressway]] record label, which was active from 1985 until the early 1990s, releasing mostly cassettes and a few records. Russell then founded the [[Corpus Hermeticum (record label)|Corpus Hermeticum]] record label. Xpressway released only music by New Zealanders, usually song-based.  Corpus Hermeticum releases, in contrast, may feature New Zealand or international artists, and they eschew song forms in favor of free-form, experimental, usually improvised sounds.

In summer of 2013, Bruce Russell's daughter Olive Russell uploaded a documentary of her father that she shot and edited herself called "27 Minutes with Mr. Noisy: A Documentary about Bruce Russell" to Vimeo.com.

==Trivia==
During his time at the [[University of Otago]], Bruce Russell was a member of that university's champion team in the television quiz [[University Challenge (New Zealand)|''University Challenge'']].&lt;ref&gt;University Challenge http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/university-challenge/series NZonScreen&lt;/ref&gt;

During the South African Springbok [[rugby union|rugby]] team's controversial [[1981 Springbok tour|1981 tour]] of New Zealand, Russell received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Luke|title=The Aesthetics of Distribution: a conversation with Bruce Russell|url=http://www.audiofoundation.org.nz/nat_grid1.html|work=The National Grid|accessdate=28 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209182453/http://audiofoundation.org.nz/nat_grid1.html|archivedate=9 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a period Russell worked as an [[archivist]] in [[Radio New Zealand]]'s Sound Archives.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Russell entry on New Zealand Electronic Poetry website, published by The University of Auckland http://www.nzepc.auckland.ac.nz/features/dunedin/russell.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2469">The '''Canadian Football League Players' Association''' (or '''CFLPA''') represents [[Canadian football]] players in the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). The association was established in 1965, when local lawyer John Agro became concerned by the number of [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] players approaching him with legal questions about contracts, medical coverage and pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/live/the-agro-sisters-special-connection-to-the-cfl.html |title=The Agro Sisters' Special Connection to the CFL |author=Calum Shanlin |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC Live]] |date=2012-11-24 |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cflpa.com/about/ |title=The formation of the C.F.L.P.A. |publisher=CFLPA |date= |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All CFLPA presidents have been active or retired CFL players. The first president was [[Gary Schreider]], who had recently retired as a player for the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] player. The current president is Jeff Keeping.

In June 2010, the CFLPA and the CFL announced the details of a new four-year [[collective bargaining agreement]].&lt;ref name="Tait"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tait|first=Ed|title=CFL, players' union find common ground|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/football/bombers/cfl-players-union-find-common-ground-97460429.html|accessdate=12 September 2010|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFL's annual [[John Agro Special Teams Award]], voted on by the players, is named for CFLPA co-founder and long-time legal counsel John Agro, [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2257">'''Codeball''' is an individual sport combining the gameplay of [[golf]] and [[soccer]].

== Rules ==
Codeball is played on a fairway consisting of usually 14 bowls, similar to the holes in golf. A six-inch rubber ball is kicked from a marked kickoff area, and once the ball comes to rest, it is kicked again. The process is repeated until the ball is sunk into the bowl. The goal of codeball is to reach the bowl using as few kicks as possible.

== History ==
Codeball was invented in 1929 by a Chicago doctor named William Edward Code, who developed the game for his friend. At the time, Code's friend sought an inexpensive outdoor game suited to large playgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lD5gUt3d7zoC&amp;pg=PA122 | title=Urban Physical Education: Instructional Practices and Cultural Activities | author=Clements, Rhonda L. | year=2012 | pages=122| isbn=9780736098397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost forgotten today, the game reached its peak of popularity in the 1930s. By summer 1932, at least 12 codeball courses were in existence, chiefly in the upper Midwest.&lt;ref name="Golfdom 32" /&gt;

It was officially sanctioned by the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="Golfdom 32"&gt;''Golfdom''. [http://archive.lib.msu.edu/tic/golfd/article/1932sep32.pdf "Codeball on the Green" (Michigan State University archive)]. September 1932, p. 32. Retrieved 14 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first codeball championship was won by Bert Gates, with a score of 69 for 15 bowls, at [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], [[St. Louis]], in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,770064,00.html | title=Sport: Who Won, Jul. 1, 1935 | work=Time | date=1 July 1935 | accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==
Code later invented codeball-on the-court, a combination of [[American handball|handball]] and soccer. It is a two-person sport played with a six-inch ball on a playing court. The ball is kicked against a wall, and the opposing player must return the ball on the second bounce. The original sport is sometimes called Codeball-on-the-Green to distinguish it from the newer game.

A '''diving suit''' is a garment or device designed to protect a diver from the [[underwater]] environment. A diving suit may also incorporate a [[breathing gas]] supply (i.e. [[Standard diving dress]] or [[atmospheric diving suit]]).&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt; but in most cases applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as [[diving equipment]] or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.

Diving suits can be divided into two classes: "soft" or [[ambient pressure]] diving suits - examples are [[wetsuit]]s, [[dry suit]]s, semi-dry suits and dive skins, and "hard" or [[atmospheric diving suit|atmospheric pressure diving suits]] - armored suits that keep the diver at [[atmospheric pressure]] at any depth within the operating range of the suit.

==History==
{{see also|Underwater diving#History|Dry suit#History}}
[[File:Lethbridge diving machine.jpg|thumb|[[John Lethbridge]]'s diving dress, the first enclosed diving suit, built in the 1710s.]]
The first diving suit designs appeared in the early 18th century. Two English inventors developed the first pressure-proof diving suits in the 1710s. [[John Lethbridge]] built a completely enclosed suit to aid in salvage work. It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves.&lt;ref name=lethbridge /&gt; This suit gave the diver more maneuverability to accomplish useful underwater salvage work.

[[File:Divers - Illustrated London News Feb 6 1873-2.PNG|thumb|left|upright|[[Augustus Siebe|Siebe's]] improved design in 1873.]]
After testing this machine in his garden pond (specially built for the purpose) Lethbridge dived on a number of wrecks: four English men-of-war, one East Indiaman (both English and Dutch), two Spanish galleons and a number of galleys. He became very wealthy as a result of his salvages. One of his better-known recoveries was on the Dutch ''Slot ter Hooge'', which had sunk off [[Madeira]] with over three tons of silver on board.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999" /&gt;

At the same time, Andrew Becker created a leather-covered diving suit with a helmet featuring a window. Becker used a system of tubes for inhaling and exhaling, and demonstrated his suit in the [[River Thames]], [[London]], during which he remained submerged for an hour.

[[File:DiveSuitNHMDF.JPG|thumbnail|Early diving suit on display at the Naval History Museum in Mexico City.]]
German-born British engineer [[Augustus Siebe]] developed the [[standard diving dress]] in the 1830s. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design - a [[diving helmet|helmet]] fitted to a full length watertight [[canvas]] diving suit. Later suits were made from waterproofed canvas invented by [[Charles Macintosh|Charles Mackintosh]]. From the late 1800s and throughout most of the 20th century, most standard dress was made from a sheet of solid rubber laminated between layers of tan twill.&lt;ref name="Acott 1999b" /&gt;

The oldest preserved suit named "Wanha herra"{{clarify|reason=what does this mean?|date=September 2018}} can be found in [[Raahe Museum]], [[Finland]]. It was made of calf leather and dates from the 18th century. Its exact origin is unknown but the foot parts suggest a Finnish origin. The suit, which was used in short underwater work like checking the conditions of the bottom of a ship, was donated to Raahe Museum by Captain Johan Leufstadius (1829-1906), who was a master mariner, merchant and ship owner.{{cn|date=September 2018}} 
The conservator of Raahe Museum, Jouko Turunen, tailored a perfect copy of the old suit in 1988. The copy has been successfully tested underwater several times.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Dry suits made of latex [[rubber]] were used in [[World War II]] by Italian [[frogmen]]. They were made by [[Pirelli]] and patented in 1951.&lt;ref name="Pirelli" /&gt;

==Ambient pressure suits==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-225, Reval, Taucher im Hafen.jpg|thumb|Diver of the [[Estonia]]n [[Omakaitse|Home Guard]], 1941]]
Ambient pressure suits are a form of exposure protection protecting the wearer from the [[hypothermia|cold]]. They also provide some defense from abrasive and sharp objects as well as potentially harmful underwater life. They do not protect divers from the pressure of the surrounding water or resulting [[barotrauma]] and [[decompression sickness]].

There are five main types of [[ambient pressure diving]] suits; dive skins, wetsuits and their derivative semi-dry suit and hot-water suits, and dry suits.&lt;ref name="Barsky and Christensen 2004" /&gt; Apart from hot water suits, these types of suit are not exclusively used by divers but are often used for thermal protection by people engaged in other water sports activities such as [[surfing]], [[sailing]], [[powerboating]], [[windsurfing]], [[kite surfing]], [[waterskiing]], [[caving]] and [[human swimming|swimming]].

Added [[buoyancy]] due to the volume of the suit is a side effect of most diving suits. A diving weighting system can be worn to counteract this buoyancy. Overalls may be worn over the diving suit as additional protection against cuts and abrasion. This is more usual for professional divers. Overalls increase drag while swimming and are not popular for recreational scuba.&lt;ref name="Barsky and Christensen 2004" /&gt;

===Dive skins===
''Dive skins'' are used when diving in water temperatures above {{convert|25|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. They are made from [[spandex|spandex or Lycra]] and provide little thermal protection, but do protect the skin from [[jellyfish]] stings, abrasion and [[sunburn]]. This kind of suit is also known as a 'Stinger Suit'. Some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit, which allows easier donning and (for those who experience skin problems from neoprene) provides additional comfort.&lt;ref name="EcoStinger 2014" /&gt;

The "Dive Skin" was originally invented to protect scuba divers in Queensland Australia against the "Box" [[jellyfish]] (''[[Chironex fleckeri]]''){{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 1978, Tony Farmer was a swimsuit designer and manufacturer who owned a business called "Daring Designs". Besides swimwear he also did underwear and aerobic wear which included a full suit in Lycra/Spandex. He became a scuba diver and that was the catalyst to the invention of the "dive skin" as we know it today.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Wetsuits===
[[File:Chasseur sous-marin et son équipement.jpg|thumb|Spearfisher in wet suit]]
{{main|Wetsuit}}

Wetsuits are relatively inexpensive, simple, expanded [[neoprene]] suits that are typically used where the water temperature is between {{convert|10|and|25|C|F}}. The foamed neoprene of the suit thermally insulates the wearer.&lt;ref name="USNDM" /&gt;&lt;ref name=fulton /&gt; Although water can enter the suit, a close fitting suit prevents excessive heat loss because little of the water warmed inside the suit escapes from the suit to be replaced by cold water, a process referred to as "flushing".

Proper fit is critical for warmth. A suit that is too loose will allow a large amount of water to circulate over the diver's skin, taking up body heat. A suit that is too tight is very uncomfortable and can impair circulation at the neck, a very dangerous condition which can cause blackouts. For this reason, many divers choose to have wetsuits custom-tailored instead of buying them "off the rack". Many companies offer this service and the cost is often comparable to an off-the-rack suit.

Wetsuits are limited in their ability to preserve warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7&amp;nbsp;mm, 5&amp;nbsp;mm, 3&amp;nbsp;mm, and 1&amp;nbsp;mm. A 1&amp;nbsp;mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they are more comfortable for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.&lt;ref name="O'Three" /&gt;

====Semi-dry suits====
Semi-dry suits are effectively a thick wetsuit with nearly watertight seals at wrist, neck and ankles and zip. They are typically used where the water temperature is between {{convert|10|and|20|C|F}}. The seals limit the volume of water entering and leaving the suit, and a close fit minimises pumping action caused by limb motion. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not readily leave the suit, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add to the suit's insulating ability, and any water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits, and do not fail catastrophically. They are made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the trapped gas bubbles in the neoprene foam compress at depth. Semi-dry suits are usually made as a one piece full suit with slick inside surface neoprene wrist, cuff and neck seals  Two-piece sets tend to be a one piece full length suit, sometimes described as "long johns", plus accessories to be worn over, under or with the one-piece suit, such as a shortie tunic, which may be worn separately in warm water, but has no flush-limiting seals at the openings. Semi dry suits do not usually include hoods, boots or gloves, so separate insulating hoods, boots and gloves are worn.&lt;ref name="Northern Diver Delta-Flex" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scubapro Semidry" /&gt;

====Hot water suits====
Hot water suits are used in cold water [[commercial diving|commercial]] [[surface supplied diving]].&lt;ref name="Mekjavic 2001" /&gt; A hose in the umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries the hot water from a heater on the surface down to the suit. The diver controls the flow rate of the water from a valve near his waist, allowing him to vary the warmth of the suit in response to changes in environmental conditions and workload. Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn. These suits are normally made of foamed [[neoprene]] and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design. The wrists and ankles of the suit are open, allowing water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook" /&gt;

Hot water suits are often employed for extremely deep dives when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much more efficiently than air, which means that the diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it. This fact compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is a matter of survival, not comfort. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a backup water heater is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a backup unit cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can die within minutes; depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook" /&gt;

Heated water in the suit forms an active insulation barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32&amp;nbsp;°C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45&amp;nbsp;°C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, and in the early stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook" /&gt; The suit is loose fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook" /&gt; When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook" /&gt;

The diver will usually wear something under a hot water suit for protection against scalding, chafe and for personal hygiene, as hot water suits may be shared by divers on different shifts, and the interior of the suit may transmit fungal infections if not sufficiently cleaned between users. Shorty wetsuits are effective against scalding of the covered parts of the body, and thermal underwear can protect against chafe, and keep the standby diver warm on the surface.&lt;ref name="Barsky and Christensen 2004" /&gt;

===Dry suits===

Dry suits&lt;ref name="Piantadosi 1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewster 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nishi 1989"/&gt; are used typically where the water temperature is between {{convert|-2|and|15|C|F}}. Water is prevented from entering the suit by seals at the neck and wrists; also, the means of getting the suit on and off (typically a [[zipper]]) is waterproof. The suit insulates the wearer in one of two main ways: by maintaining an insulating layer of air in the undersuit between the body and the suit shell, (in exactly the way that thermal insulation garments work above water) or by using a watertight expanded neoprene suit shell, which is inherently insulating in the same way as a wet suit, and which can usually be worn with additional insulating undergarments.

Both fabric and neoprene drysuits have advantages and disadvantages: a fabric drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, they are quite bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. Additionally, if a fabric drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses nearly all of its insulating properties. Neoprene drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits, but in some cases do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction is that even it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a wetsuit and will still provide a degree of insulation.

Special dry suits (typically made of strong rubberised fabric) are worn by commercial divers who work in contaminated environments such as sewage or hazardous chemicals. The hazmat dry suit has integral boots and is sealed to a [[diving helmet]] and dry gloves to prevent any contact with the hazardous material.

Constant volume dry suits have a system allowing the suit to be inflated to prevent "suit squeeze" caused by increasing pressure and to prevent excessive compression of the insulating undergarments. They also have vents allowing the excess air to escape from the suit during ascent.&lt;ref name="Barsky Long and Stinton 2006" /&gt;

For additional warmth, some dry suit users inflate their suits with [[argon]], an inert gas which has superior thermal insulating properties compared to air.&lt;ref name=IEEE2008 /&gt; The argon is carried in a small cylinder, separate from the diver's [[breathing gas]]. This arrangement is frequently used when the breathing gas contains helium, which is a very poor insulator in comparison with other breathing gases.

===Diving suit combinations===
A "shortie" wetsuit may be worn over a full wetsuit for added warmth. Some vendors sell a very similar item and refer to it as a 'core warmer' when worn over another wetsuit.  A "skin" may also be worn under a wetsuit. This practice started with divers wearing body tights under a wetsuit for extra warmth and to make donning and removing the wetsuit easier. A "skin" may also be as an undersuit beneath a drysuit in temperatures where a full undersuit is not necessary.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Atmospheric diving suits==
{{main|Atmospheric diving suit}}
[[File:JIM suitRoyal Navy Submarine Museum.jpg|thumb|A [[JIM suit]] at the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]].]]
An atmospheric diving suit is a small one-man articulated submersible of anthropomorphic form which resembles a suit of armour, with elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere.

These can be used for very deep dives for long periods without the need for [[decompression (diving)|decompression]], and eliminate the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving. Divers do not even need to be skilled swimmers. Mobility and dexterity are usually restricted by mechanical constraints, and the [[ergonomics]] of movement are problematic.

'''Engel Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The stadium was built in 1930 and holds 12,000 people. It was the home of the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] until 1999 when they moved to their current stadium, [[AT&amp;T Field]]. The former [[Tennessee Temple University]] held its home games at Engel after the Lookouts left. Engel Stadium was named for longtime President of the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]], [[Joe Engel]].

The ballpark is located at 1130 E. 3rd Street, at the corner of O'Neal Street, adjacent to the [[Fort Wood Historic District|historic Fort Wood neighborhood]], [[Norfolk Southern|Norfolk Southern's DeButts Yard]], and [[Erlanger Health System|Erlanger Hospital]]. The park is bounded by East 3rd Street, O'Neal Street, East 5th Street, and railroad tracks.

==History==
In 1929, [[Clark Griffith]], owner of the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] sent a young scout by the name of [[Joe Engel]] to the South to find a home for the club's first minor league affiliate. First, Engel went to [[Atlanta]] with cash in hand to buy the [[Atlanta Crackers]], but for reasons unknown he backed out and came north to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. Engel not only bought the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] from [[Sammy Strang]], but also replaced their ballpark, Andrews Field with a state-of-the-art stadium at a cost of $150,000.[http://www.engelfoundation.com/Historical-Importance/Timeline/]

Andrews Field had been the team's home since 1911. (Their first two seasons, 1909 and 1910, they played their games at [[Chamberlain Field]].) Andrews was on the same block as Engel Stadium, with home plate in the opposite corner.[http://www.engelfoundation.com/Historical-Importance/Photo-Gallery/] The rebuilding effort was sufficiently completed to allow the new facility to open for exhibition play on March 23, 1930. The regular season opener was April 15, 1930.

Engel Stadium featured a spacious outfield, especially the corner to the left of straightaway center field, which was posted as 471 feet. The gradual rise of Third Street along the left field wall necessitated a "terrace" or hill to make up the difference in grade between the field and the street. The terrace contained the word "LOOKOUTS" in large letters. [[Harmon Killebrew]] is said to be the only man to hit a ball over the deepest part of the outfield.&lt;ref name="martini"&gt;{{cite book

Many of [[Joe Engel]]'s famous antics also took place at Engel Stadium, gaining him the nickname, "The Barnum of Baseball." In 1931, the [[New York Yankees]] played an exhibition game at Engel Stadium against the Lookouts. During the game, a 17-year-old girl named [[Jackie Mitchell (baseball)|Jackie Mitchell]] pitched for the Lookouts, striking out Major League greats [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Babe Ruth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/aubrecht8.shtml The Pinstripe Press : Jackie Mitchell - The Pride of the Yankees on Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, a record crowd of 24,624 fans crammed into the park that only held 12,000 seats for the chance of winning a house in the middle of the [[Great Depression]]. The winning ticket was not at the game. On Opening Day in 1938, Joe Engel debuted his popular "Wild Elephant Hunt" prior to the game. It was such a success, he took it to ballparks throughout the South.

Many notables have played on the field, including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Hank Aaron]], [[Satchel Paige]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Harmon Killebrew]], [[Ferguson Jenkins]], [[Kiki Cuyler]],  and [[Rogers Hornsby]].

When the Lookouts could not find an affiliate from 1966 to 1975, the Stadium began to deteriorate. Despite amateur games being played at Engel day and night all summer long, it was not being properly maintained. In 1972, [[Chattanooga News Free Press]] columnist Allan Morris wrote that "paint is peeling off the walls, the floor is filthy, the roof is falling down, and it looks like a tornado hit the place." When Woody Reid bought the club in 1976 and gained a Major League affiliate in the [[Oakland Athletics]], he hosted "Sparkle Days" at the stadium, where fans volunteered their time to fixing up Engel.

In the winter of 1988, Engel Stadium underwent its first major renovation. The $2 million project called for a new look to the exterior of the stadium, a two-story front office building built down the first base line, a new press box on top of the roof, a restaurant in the concourse with a view of the field, and a resurfaced field. "We were trying to do things in a real haphazard way", said Lookouts General Manager Bill Lee. The renovation resulted in a half-million dollar lawsuit by the Lookouts against the city and county for installing a field that did not drain properly.&lt;ref name="martini"/&gt;

In the winter of 1994, Frank Burke bought the Lookouts. Years later he would say, "Finding Engel Stadium was a bit like falling in love: initially, you don't see some of the downsides." The downside was that Engel Stadium was becoming so costly to keep up that he could not turn a profit. By 1998, the situation got so severe that Burke agreed to fund a new ballpark on top of Hawk Hill, so long as he could sell 1,800 season tickets and 10 luxury boxes for his new park by February 4, 1999. Burke met his goal a week early and the Lookouts played their last game at Engel Stadium on September 10, 1999.&lt;ref name="martini" /&gt;

In 2000, [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] and the city of Chattanooga assumed joint ownership of Engel Stadium.  It was subsequently leased to [[Tennessee Temple University]] for use as their baseball team's home field.  The field was modified, with a fence running across the left and center fields to reduce the dimensions of the playing field. The terrace still exists, beyond the inner fence, and covered with grass, the "LOOKOUTS" having been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.utc.edu/news/2008/12/university-acquires-engel-stadium-property/ |title=University acquires Engel Stadium property &amp;#124; UTC News Feeds |publisher=Blog.utc.edu |date=2008-12-18 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[UT Chattanooga]] acquired the property.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.utc.edu/TheLoop/2011/04/12/utc-gets-the-ok-to-purchase-engel-stadium/&lt;/ref&gt; The University will build a state-of-the-art track and field complex in the current parking lot and partner with the Engel Foundation in the restoration of the Stadium. On April 5, 2011 the City of Chattanooga passed an interim agreement allowing UTC to take control of the Stadium, pending final approval of the state government.  Vice Chancellor Richard Brown announced plans to work with The Engel Foundation to restore the Stadium, which was [[2011 Super Outbreak|damaged during a tornado in April 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_198297.asp/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Engel Stadium was used as the movie set for the motion picture ''[[42 (film)|42]]'', the life story of [[Jackie Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnett |first=Mary |url=http://www.nooga.com/155444/filming-of-42-begins-at-engel-stadium/ |title=Filming of "42" begins at Engel Stadium |publisher=Nooga.com |date=2012-05-21 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the entire film's baseball action was shot at Engel Stadium, which also doubled for Brooklyn's [[Ebbetts Field]]. On July 18, 2012 crews began demolition to restore the ballpark back to its historic accuracy after [[construction]] was done for the movie that altered the ballpark, including moving the location of the ball fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdef.com/news/story/42-Crew-begins-Engel-Stadium-Deconstruction/ShvY3viVeEux90L7HoyANw.cspx |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209015539/http://www.wdef.com/news/story/42-Crew-begins-Engel-Stadium-Deconstruction/ShvY3viVeEux90L7HoyANw.cspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-09 |title="42" Crew begins Engel Stadium Deconstruction – WDEF News 12 |publisher=Wdef.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Engel Foundation==
In April 2009, The Engel Foundation was formed to restore, preserve, promote, and revitalize Engel Stadium. "It is just kind of sitting there", said Foundation director Janna Jahn. "It is not getting the maintenance it needs. It is not being promoted." In its short existence, the Foundation has hosted a Great Spaces Open House at the Stadium that was attended by over a hundred people, two Legends Baseball Camps led by former major leaguers [[Steve Trout]], [[Rick Honeycutt]], [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]], and [[Jay Johnstone]], and on December 14, 2009, Engel Stadium was approved as a site on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="timesfreepress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/mar/12/group-fights-to-save-engel-stadium/ |title=Group fights to save Engel Stadium |publisher=timesfreepress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Engel Foundation plans to raise $150,000 in needed repairs. Once that is accomplished, the Foundation wants to promote Engel as a destination for events from [[Little League Baseball]], to middle/ high school baseball to adult league baseball. The venue could also serve as a museum to [[Chattanooga]] baseball, a site for concerts, and other community events.&lt;ref name="timesfreepress.com"/&gt;

In May 2013 the Foundation announced that the stadium would be renovated and ready to hold baseball games by the 2014 season. The foundation released a statement claiming that $200,000 will be necessary to complete the renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/may/30/play-ball/|title = Engel Foundation aims for games in historic stadium next year|date = May 30, 2013|accessdate = 2014-09-22|website = Chattanooga Times Free Press|publisher = |last = Burkholder|first = Lindsay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Húsafell Stone.png|thumb|The Húsafell Stone]]
The '''Húsafell Stone''' is a legendary [[lifting stone]] located in [[Húsafell]], [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="elitefitness1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elitefitness.com/forum/strongman-power-lifting/whyis-called-husafell-stone-424952.html |title=whyis it called the Husafell Stone? |publisher=Elitefitness.com |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone weighs 186&amp;nbsp;kg (409&amp;nbsp;lbs)&lt;ref&gt;https://s21.postimg.org/gwanc8c6v/Husaffel_stone_inscription.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; and is kept near a goat pen built by pastor Snorri Björnsson over two hundred years ago.&lt;ref name="elitefitness1"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=August 2017}}

The stone has been used as a test of strength by either simply lifting the stone, or by lifting and carrying the stone around the goat pen where it is located. The Húsafell Stone is also named ''Kviahellan'' ("pen slab") by pastor Snorri, who used the stone as a door to his sheep pen. The test to achieve ''fullsterkur'' ("full-strong") status is to lift the stone up and carry it the 50 metres around the perimeter of the goat pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shetler |first=Scott |url=http://www.halfsquare.net/shetler_112306.php |title=The Art of Stone Lifting: Nature's Gym |publisher=Halfsquare.net |date=23 November 2006 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723142102/http://www.halfsquare.net/shetler_112306.php |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successfully walking the full distance around the pen is considered a widely recognized feat of strength in the field of [[Lifting stone|stone carrying]], and is referred to as achieving ''fullsterkur'' status.&lt;ref name="elitefitness1"/&gt;

''Fullsterkur'' status refers to the weight of the actual stone; for this status the stone must weigh a minimum of 155&amp;nbsp;kg (341&amp;nbsp;lbs). ''Hálfsterkur'' ("half strength") stones weigh up to 104&amp;nbsp;kg (228.8&amp;nbsp;lbs), ''hálfdrættingur'' ("weakling") stone up to 49&amp;nbsp;kg (107.8&amp;nbsp;lbs), and ''amlóði'' ("useless") stone up to 23&amp;nbsp;kg (50.6&amp;nbsp;lbs).

[[File:Husafell-carry-brodick-2017.jpg|thumb|An athlete carries the{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Husafell Stone at Brodick Highland Games]]
Men have lifted the Húsafell Stone to different heights and attempted to carry the stone as a test of strength for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="dieselcrew1"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Husafell Stone Challenge |url=http://www.dieselcrew.com/the-husafell-stone-challenge |title=Diesel Crew – Muscle Building, Athletic Development, Strength Training, Grip Strength » Blog Archive » The Husafell Stone Challenge |publisher=Dieselcrew.com |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the event was featured at the [[1992 World's Strongest Man]] competition held in Iceland and using the actual Húsafell Stone, it proved to be a very popular and influential event in the sport of [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]].&lt;ref name="dieselcrew1"/&gt; Canadian strongman [[Gregg Ernst]] set a world record at the 1992 WSM by carrying the Húsafell Stone 70 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getbig.com/boards/index.php?topic=250575.0 |title=Canadian Gregg Ernst World Record back lift &amp; Hussefelt Stone |publisher=Getbig.com |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken during [[Iceland's Strongest Man|Icelands strongest man]] 2017, where the 2018 World's Strongest Man&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theworldsstrongestman.com/ny-times-mountain-game-thrones-wins-worlds-strongest-man-title/|title=NY Times: The Mountain from Game of Thrones Wins World’s Strongest Man Title - World's Strongest Man|date=2018-05-08|work=World's Strongest Man|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson]] carried the stone for 90 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Strength Tree|title=Iceland's Strongest Man 2017|date=2018-01-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmxPVgnYJW8|accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, replicas are created (of varying weights and sizes) and used in events at strongman competitions all over the world.&lt;ref name="dieselcrew1" /&gt;

[[Prestwick Golf Club]] hosted the first championship in [[1860 Open Championship|1860]] and remained the sole venue until [[1873 Open Championship|1873]], when the [[Old Course at St Andrews]] hosted the event. Prestwick hosted a further 12 championships, the last in [[1925 Open Championship|1925]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prestwickgc.co.uk/history/the-open-championship/ |title=The Open Championship |publisher=Prestwick Golf Club |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musselburgh Links]] became the third course to host the championship in [[1874 Open Championship|1874]]. The three courses rotated the hosting of the championship until [[1892 Open Championship|1892]] when [[Muirfield]] hosted the event. The Honourable Company of Edinburgh golfers built their own course at Muirfield and Musselburgh was removed from the rota as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musselburgholdlinks.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=11 |title=The Musselburgh Opens |publisher=Musselburgh Links |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal St George's Golf Club]] became the first course outside Scotland to host the championship in [[1894 Open Championship|1894]].&lt;ref name=Stgeorges&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theopen.com/Heritage/OpenVenues/Royal-St-Georges |title=Royal St Georges |publisher=The Open Championship |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Royal Liverpool Golf Club]] hosted the event for the first time in [[1897 Open Championship|1897]]. [[Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club]] became the next course to host the event in [[1909 Open Championship|1909]]. The course hosted a further championship in [[1920 Open Championship|1920]], but further attempts to host the Championship in [[1938 Open Championship|1938]] and [[1949 Open Championship|1949]] were thwarted by bad weather and the course was dropped from the rota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcinqueports.com/open_rota |title=Royal Cinque Ports and The Open Rota |publisher=Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Troon Golf Club|Royal Troon]], [[Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club|Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes]] and [[Carnoustie Golf Links|Carnoustie]] held the Open Championship for the first time in [[1923 Open Championship|1923]], [[1926 Open Championship|1926]] and [[1931 Open Championship|1931]] respectively. The following year [[Prince's Golf Club]] hosted the event for the only time. The course was requisitioned by the military during the Second World War and was extensively damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.golf-monthly.co.uk/tour/open-championship/open-history-and-records/the-forgotten-open-venues-75227 |title=The forgotten Open venues |work=Golf Monthly |date=12 July 2015 |accessdate=19 August 2015 |first=Roderick |last=Easdale }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Birkdale]] was chosen as the host course in 1940, however, due to the Second World War the event did not go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper = The Times |date=21 January 1939 |page=4 |title=Golf Championships for 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until [[1954 Open Championship|1954]] that Royal Birkdale hosted the Open.&lt;ref name=birkdale&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theopen.com/Heritage/OpenVenues/Royal-Birkdale |title=Royal Birkdale |publisher=The Open Championship |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Course at St Andrews has hosted the most championships with 29 in total, most recently with the [[2015 Open Championship]]. The championship has only been held outside Scotland and England once, in [[1951 Open Championship|1951]] when [[Royal Portrush Golf Club]] in Northern Ireland was the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/16/uk-golf-open-portrush-idUKKBN0ER19O20140616 |title=British Open set for Royal Portrush return |work=Reuters |date=16 June 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turnberry (golf course)|Turnberry]] became the most recent course to have hosted the Championship for the first time, when it held the [[1977 Open Championship]].&lt;ref name=Turnberry&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theopen.com/Heritage/OpenVenues/Turnberry |title=Turnberry |publisher=The Open Championship |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FrankNighbor.jpg|right|thumb|[[Frank Nighbor]] with the original [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlSilverware/silver_splashhart.shtml|website=Official website of Hockey Hall of Fame|title=Hart Memorial Trophy|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy is awarded annually to the "player judged most valuable to his team" in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=24934|website=NHL.com|title=Hart Memorial Trophy|accessdate=15 February 2018|quote=The Hart Memorial Trophy is an annual award given to the player judged to be the most valuable to his team.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[sport|sports]], a '''most valuable player''' ('''MVP''') [[award]] is an honor typically bestowed upon the best-performing player (or players) in an entire league, for a particular competition, or on a specific team.  Initially used in professional sports, the term is now also commonly used in amateur sports, as well as in other completely unrelated fields such as business and music.  In many sports, MVP awards are presented for a specific match—in other words, a [[man of the match]] award.

The term is most common in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  In other cases, "[[player of the year award|player of the year]]" is used. In Australia, [[Australian rules football]] clubs and leagues use the term "[[best and fairest]]", while those playing [[rugby league]] use "player of the year", such as the [[Dally M Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrl.com/thurston-wins-2015-dally-m-medal/tabid/10874/newsid/90203/default.aspx Dally M Medal 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]], however, uses the American-style "MVP" for its awards. 

In many cases the awards are voted on by members of the [[sports journalism|media]].  In others the vote is by players, [[coach (sports)|coaches]], or umpires.  In recent years, [[online voting|online polls]] from the public decide some awards.

[[Image:1911 out at third baseball card.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A 1911 [[American Tobacco Company]] [[baseball card]] illustrating a [[baserunner]] being [[tagged out]] at [[third base]].]]

In baseball, an '''out''' occurs when the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] rules a [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] or [[baserunner]] out.  When three outs are recorded in an [[inning]], a team's half of the inning, or their turn at [[batting (baseball)|batting]], ends.

To signal an out, an umpire generally makes a fist with one hand, and then flexes that arm either upward, particularly on pop flies, or forward, particularly on routine plays at first base.  Home plate umpires often use a "punch-out" motion to signal a called '''third strike.'''

The most common ways batters or runners are put out are by [[strikeout]]s, [[fly out]]s, [[tag out]]s, and [[force play|force outs]]; however, there are many, somewhat rarer, ways an out can occur.

** he is found to have used an altered bat&lt;ref name="MLB17" /&gt;{{rp|6.03(a)(5)}}.
* The [[batter-runner]] is out when:
** a fielder with a [[live ball (baseball)|live ball]] in his possession touches first base or [[tag out|tags]] the batter-runner before the batter-runner reaches first base (except when the batter is awarded first base, such as on a [[base on balls]]);
** a batted ball is caught in flight ([[fly out]]); or
** he hits an infield popup while the [[infield fly]] rule applies;
** a fielder intentionally drops a line drive with fewer than two outs in a force situation (man on first, men on first and second, men on first and third, bases loaded) in an attempt to create a double play;
** a preceding runner interferes with a fielder trying to complete a double play on the batter-runner;
** the batter-runner does not return directly to first base after overrunning the bag and he is tagged with the ball by a fielder.
* Any [[baserunner]], other than the batter-runner, is out when:
** he is [[force play|forced out]]; that is, he fails to reach his [[force base]] before a fielder with a live ball touches that base;
** a fielder catches a batted ball in flight, and subsequently, some fielder with a live ball in possession touches the runner's [[time of pitch]] base before the runner [[tag up|tags up]] ([[appeal play]]);
** while he is attempting to reach home plate with fewer than two outs, the batter interferes with a fielder and such action hinders a potential tag out near home plate;
** he is found to have committed a mockery of the game, for example a [[stolen base]] of first from second;
** he is found to be an illegal substitute.
* Any baserunner, including the batter-runner, is out when:
** he is [[tag out|tagged out]]; that is, touched by a fielder's hand holding a live ball while [[tag out|in jeopardy]], such as while not touching a base;
** he passes a base without touching it and a member of the defensive team properly executes a [[appeal play|live ball appeal]];
** he commits [[interference (baseball)|interference]], such as when he contacts a fielder playing a batted ball, or when he contacts a live batted ball before it passes a fielder other than the pitcher;
** he strays more than three feet (.91 meters) from his running [[baseline (baseball)|baseline]] in attempting to avoid a tag;
** he passes a preceding runner who is not out;
** he is touched by a fair ball in fair territory before the ball has touched or passed an infielder. The ball is dead and no runner may score, nor runners advance, except runners forced to advance. EXCEPTION: If a runner is touching his base when touched by an Infield Fly, he is not out, although the batter is out;
** he intentionally abandons his effort to run the bases after touching first base; or
** he runs the bases in reverse order in an attempt to confuse the defense or to make a travesty of the game.&lt;ref name="MLB17" /&gt;{{rp|5.09(b)(10)}}

==Scoring==
In baseball statistics, each out must be credited to exactly one defensive player, namely the player who was the direct cause of the out.  When referring to outs credited to a defensive player, the term [[putout]] is used. Example: a batter hits a fair ball which is fielded by the shortstop.  The shortstop then throws the ball to the first baseman.  The first baseman then steps on first base before the batter reaches it.  For this play, only the first baseman is credited with a putout, while the shortstop is credited with an [[Assist (baseball)|assist]].  For a strikeout, the [[catcher]] is credited with a putout, because the batter is not out until the pitched ball is caught by the catcher. (If the catcher drops the third strike and has to throw the batter-runner out at first base, the first baseman receives the putout while the catcher receives an assist.) When an out is recorded without a fielder's direct involvement, such as where a runner is hit by a batted ball, the fielder nearest to the action is usually credited with the putout.

Although pitchers seldom get credited with putouts, they are credited with their role in getting outs through various pitching statistics such as [[innings pitched]] (a measure of the number of outs made by the pitcher, used in calculating his [[Earned run average|ERA]]) and [[strikeout]]s.

In the game of [[chess]], '''prophylaxis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] προφυλαξις, "prophylaxis," ''guarding or preventing beforehand'') or a ''prophylactic move'' is a move that stops the opponent from taking action in a certain area for fear of some type of reprisal. Prophylactic moves are aimed at not just improving one's position, but preventing the opponent from improving their own. Perhaps the most common prophylactic idea is the advance of the [[rook pawn]] near a [[Castling|castled]] king to make [[luft]] averting the possibility of a [[back rank checkmate]], or to prevent [[Pin (chess)|pins]].  

In a more [[chess strategy|strategic]] sense, prophylaxis leads to a very [[Glossary of chess#Positional play|positional game]], often frustrating for players with a strong [[chess tactics|tactical]] orientation. Players who play in the prophylactic style prevent the initiation of tactical play by threatening unpleasant consequences. One of the largest advantages of this approach is that it keeps risk to a minimum while causing an overaggressive opponent to lose patience and make a mistake. The disadvantage is that it frequently fails against an opponent who is content with a [[draw (chess)|draw]].

It should be understood, however, that any move which prevents an opponent from threatening something can be called prophylactic, even if this word would not be used to describe the player's style. For example, [[Mikhail Tal]] and [[Garry Kasparov]] frequently played the move ''h3'' in the [[Ruy Lopez]]—a prophylactic move intended to prevent Black from playing ''...Bg4'' and creating an irritating [[pin (chess)|pin]] on the [[knight (chess)|knight]] at ''f3''—yet neither player would ever be described as playing in the prophylactic style. All [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]]s make use of prophylaxis in one way or another.

'''Ralph Engelstad Arena''' ('''REA'''), commonly called '''the Ralph''', is an indoor [[arena]] located on the campus of the [[University of North Dakota]] (UND) in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]] and serves as the home of UND men's ice hockey. The arena was built by controversial UND alumnus [[Ralph Engelstad]]. The [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks]] [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks men's ice hockey|men's]] hockey team is the tenant. The arena formerly hosted the defunct North Dakota [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks women's ice hockey|women's]] hockey team.

==Facility==
Ralph Engelstad Arena, which seats 11,643, opened on October 5, 2001 and is located on the UND campus.&lt;ref name="TheRalph"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theralph.com/the-ralph/hockey-history/the-new-ralph |title=The New Ralph |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |publisher=Ralph Engelstad Arena |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320160143/http://www.theralph.com/the-ralph/hockey-history/the-new-ralph |archive-date=March 20, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The REA is home to the UND men's ice hockey team (UND women's ice hockey team discontinued after 2016-17 season), and hosts select games for UND men's and women's basketball. The arena also hosts many non-athletic events including concerts and a yearly circus. Called the "[[Taj Mahal]] of hockey," the $104 million arena was built with materials that would not usually be found in such a facility.&lt;ref name="TheRalph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amsoil"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/187656/publisher_ID/36/ |title=Amsoil Arena Gets Fans' Approval |accessdate=2011-01-02 |publisher=Duluth News Tribune }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the concourses of the REA are covered in [[granite]] flooring, each spectator seat is made of [[Cherry wood]] and [[leather]] upholstery, [[escalator]]s bring spectators between levels, and full-color [[Liquid crystal display|LCD displays]] dot the arena.&lt;ref name="TheRalph"/&gt; The REA has been called one of the finest facilities of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name="TheRalph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roadtrip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportsroadtrip.com/ralphengelstadarena.html |title=Ralph Engelstad Arena |accessdate=2007-10-19 |publisher=thesportsroadtrip.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey player [[Wayne Gretzky]] has called the structure "one of the most beautiful buildings we have in [[North America]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Terry | last=Vandrovec | coauthors= | title=Gretzky down on future | date=January 3, 2005 | publisher= | url=http://www.in-forum.com/articles/index.cfm?id=79541 | work=The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead | pages= | accessdate=2007-10-19 | language= }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The REA complex has evolved to include more than just the main arena. A second Olympic-sized sheet of ice sits adjacent to the main arena. An addition to the main arena, The [[Betty Engelstad Sioux Center]] (or simply '''The Betty''') was completed in 2004 and is now the home of UND's [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux basketball|basketball]] and [[North Dakota Fighting Sioux volleyball|volleyball]] teams.

Although located on the campus of the University of North Dakota the arena and land itself is owned by The Engelstad Family Foundation and rented conditionally to UND each year for $1.  This setup was created to give the Engelstad family control and final say regarding the facility.

In 2015 the Ralph Engelstad Arena received a certificate of excellence from Trip Advisor for being one of the top rated destinations in America.

==Controversy==
{{See also|North Dakota Fighting Sioux controversy}}
Midway during construction, Ralph Engelstad threatened to withdraw his funding if UND's [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks|Fighting Sioux]] sports teams were renamed in deference to political pressures.&lt;ref name="logo"&gt;{{cite news | first=Sal | last=Ruibal | coauthors= | title=N. Dakota at center of 'hostile' debate | date=September 28, 2005 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/other/2005-09-27-sioux-arena_x.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to make the prospect of removal a prohibitively costly measure, the Fighting Sioux logo was strategically placed in thousands of instances in the arena, including a large granite logo in the main concourse.&lt;ref name="logo"/&gt; After the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] barred several universities that use [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] imagery from hosting post-season tournaments or wearing such imagery in post-season play, UND sued the NCAA. A preliminary [[injunction]] was granted that would have allowed the Fighting Sioux to both host post-season events and wear their regular uniforms while the lawsuit was in progress.  The [[legal papers]] filed in support of UND pointed out that the [[Florida State Seminoles]] have not been required to change their name, thus raising the possibility that the decision regarding the UND Fighting Sioux was arbitrary and capricious.  In addition, the legal papers noted that UND has a Native American Studies program, has Native Americans on its faculty, and has a significant Native American student population.

The lawsuit with the NCAA was settled under the condition that UND had three years to gain tribal support from both Sioux nations in North Dakota, or retire the Sioux name and logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title='Fighting Sioux' lawsuit settled |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/10/26/fighting.sioux.lawsuit.ap/ |publisher=Associate Press |date=October 26, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028171347/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/10/26/fighting.sioux.lawsuit.ap/ |archivedate=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the three years expired,  permission was obtained from only one of the two Sioux tribes.  The [[North Dakota Legislative Assembly]] passed a law requiring the University to retain the name in June 2011, but then repealed the law in November 2011.  A statewide vote was held in June 2012, and the citizens of North Dakota voted to discontinue the Sioux name, and on October 22, 2012 crews removed signage that declared "Home of the Fighting Sioux" from the face of the building. The 2012 vote also banned UND from choosing a new name for three years. After the nickname ban expired in 2015, the university held two rounds of online fan voting from a suggested list of nicknames; the final selection of [[North Dakota Fighting Hawks|Fighting Hawks]] was adopted in November of that year.

==Notable events==
[[Image:Front Sign Arena.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Sign in front of Ralph Englestad Arena]]
The REA's inaugural hockey game was on October 5, 2001 and featured the Fighting Sioux men's team against the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association|WCHA]] rival [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] in the [[Us hockey hall of fame|US Hockey Hall of Fame]] Game, in which Minnesota defeated North Dakota, 7-5. The REA hosted the West Regional in the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament]], with North Dakota playing in its home building.

The REA has hosted a number of non-NCAA ice hockey events, notably the [[2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]] with over 195,000 tickets sold and the 2005 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship.

'''Raymond C. Hand Park''' is a [[baseball]] venue in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], United States.

Hand.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

== History ==
The park opened on March 23, 1970, as '''Governors Park'''.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;  In 1993, following renovations led by Clarksville businessman Charles Hand, the park was renamed Raymond C. Hand Park after Hand's father.  The park has been the home of Austin Peay State's baseball program since its 1970 construction.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;  As of the end of the 2010 season, the Governors have a 576-422-2 all-time record at Hand Park.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;

In 1996 and 1997, the independent professional [[Clarksville Coyotes]] of the [[Big South League]] (1996) and [[Heartland League]] (1997) played at the venue.&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web|last=Merzbach|first=Brian|title=Raymond C. Hand Park: Clarksville, Tennessee|url=http://www.ballparkreviews.com/clarksville/clarksville.htm|work=Ballpark Reviews|accessdate=20 December 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/645DT8UHD|archivedate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cb&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Charles|title=Let's Go Peay!|url=http://www.charliesballparks.com/st/TN-Clarksville-Hand.htm|work=Charlie's Ballparks|accessdate=20 December 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/645DUiQoI|archivedate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and renovations ==
In 1993, a pair of [[USD|$]]25,000 donations from the estate of Raymond C. Hand led to the installation of stadium lighting and construction of a new seating structure.  During 1996 and 1997, when the Clarksville Coyotes shared Hand Park, the team collaborated with the university to add ticket booths, concession stands, and restrooms.  In 2001, brick facing was added to the backstop and stadium entrance.  In 2008, an eight-foot steel outfield fence was built, including a 12-foot [[batter's eye]].&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;

The field also features an irrigated natural grass surface.&lt;ref name="mg" /&gt;

'''The Royal Hobart Regatta''' began in 1838,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linc.tas.gov.au/events/featured/allfeatured/royal-hobart-regatta175-years|title=Royal Hobart Regatta:175 years|publisher=LINC Tasmania|accessdate=28 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130627222927/http://www.linc.tas.gov.au/events/featured/allfeatured/royal-hobart-regatta175-years|archivedate=27 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a series of aquatic competitions and displays held annually in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]] and is Tasmania's oldest sporting event. The regatta runs for three days, ending on the second Monday in February, and dominates the whole river for the duration of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalhobartregatta.com/Index.html |title=Royal Hobart Regatta, Hobart, Tasmania |last1=Hobart Regatta |first1=Royal |date=2016 |website=royalhobartregatta.com |publisher=Royal Hobart Regatta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regatta of 6 February 1934 was the first to be called the Royal Hobart Regatta, the title being conferred by King George V.

On 1 December 1838, the first Hobart Town Anniversary Regatta was held in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]] to celebrate the Tasmanian Anniversary of the 17th-century European discovery of the island by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article203147248|title=THE REGATTA.|date=7 December 1838|newspaper=[[The True Colonist Van Diemen's Land Political Despatch, And Agricultural And Commercial...]]|issue=800|location=Tasmania, Australia|page=4|via=National Library of Australia|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided that the annual anniversary regatta should be celebrated by the wearing of a sprig of silver wattle blossom tied with British [[Navy blue]] ribbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4161391|title=Classified Advertising.|date=23 November 1838|publisher=National Library of Australia|newspaper=[[The Courier (Hobart)|The Hobart Town Courier (Tas. : 1827 - 1839)]]|location=Tas.|page=4|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was begun by the then [[Governor of Tasmania]], [[Sir John Franklin]]. Franklin provided free food and beer for all of the spectators, and the tradition of free entry continues to this day.  The Monday was declared as a [[holiday|public holiday]] by the governor, and is now the oldest public holiday still continuing in Australia. Since 1879 the regatta has been held in January or February, rather than December. The Hobart Regatta was not staged in 1853 and 1854. The 1942 regatta, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of Abel Tasman's exploration, was held on 5 December 1942. The 1967 regatta was cancelled because of the bushfires on 7 February 1967.

Originally staged at Pavilion Point, the regatta has, since 1856, been held in grounds near Macquarie Point known as the "Regatta Ground" at the [[Queens Domain]] along the western side of the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]]. The grounds are now dominated by the [[Hobart Cenotaph]], a war memorial to Tasmania's war dead.

It is normally well attended by public and competitors and is usually well supported by the [[Royal Australian Navy]], which sends a warship to be a [[flagship]] for the regatta, and sometimes the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], who provide fly-pasts with military aircraft. Often the [[Roulettes|RAAF Roulettes]] will do aerobatic performances.  The [[Australian Army]]'s elite Red Beret parachute regiment provides sky diving displays.

The events includes [[sailing]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[open water swimming]], [[wood chopping]], [[jet ski]] racing, [[dragon boat]] racing, a [[tug of war]] and a trans-Derwent swim across the 1.6&amp;nbsp;km width of the river. There is also a Miss Regatta girl competition, and the Regatta always has an official attendance ceremony by the Governor.

In 2013, the Regatta celebrated 175 years of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sail-world.com/cruising/canada/175th-Royal-Hobart-Regatta-underway-on-the-River-Derwent/106475|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630070011/http://www.sail-world.com/cruising/canada/175th-Royal-Hobart-Regatta-underway-on-the-River-Derwent/106475|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 June 2013|title=175th Royal Hobart Regatta underway on the River Derwent|publisher=Sail World|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rugby union]] in [[Estonia]]''' is a minor but growing sport.

==Governing body==
The national body is the [[Estonian Rugby Union]] (Eesti Ragbi Liit).

The Estonian Rugby Federation was the original rugby body, but did not affiliate to the IRB, as it was a "federation" of one team, instead of the required three. It was in fact expelled from [[FIRA-AER]] for lack of rugby development.&lt;ref name=Heaven&gt;http://www.heavensgame.com/national-rugby-news/estonia-rugby-news/estonaian-rugby-union-growing-the-game.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rugby in the Baltic region was mainly introduced during the interwar period, although the game was played in [[Imperial Russia]], including [[Saint Petersburg]] pre-Russian revolution, and was introduced to Germany in the 19th century.

===Soviet period===
{{see also|Rugby union in the Soviet Union}}

In 1949, rugby union was forbidden in the USSR during the "fight against the [[cosmopolitanism]]". The competitions were resumed in 1957, and the Soviet Championship in 1966. In 1975 the [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|Soviet national team]] played their first match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianrugby.ru/history.php?Id=RUS Rugby union in Russia and USSR] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estonia had its own rugby team in the USSR, but it was not treated as a proper national side.

===Post independence===
The current stadium used by the national team is [[Viimsi Staadion]] on generous loan from NordWest Kinnisvara OÜ.

For a number of years, the Estonian Rugby Federation controlled the game in a federation of one, the "Tigers" based in Tallinn.

[[Rugby league in Estonia]] has attempted to make aggressive inroads since the mid-2000s, and took over the one team rugby federation. As a result, 70% of Tallinn's players left, and set up their own [[rugby union]] team, the Sharks.&lt;ref name=Heaven/&gt;

[[Tallinn]] hosts to a fair number of touring sides.
&lt;ref name=Heaven/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icecricket.co.uk/tallinn_rugby_tours.php|title=Ice Cricket - Tallinn Rugby Tours to Estonia|website=www.icecricket.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other places in the region, the playing season is April to October, as pitches are frequently frozen in winter.&lt;ref name=Heaven/&gt;

[[Image:Sheaf toss 001.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The sheaf toss event at the 2005 [[Skagit Valley]] Highland Games, in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]].]]

The '''sheaf toss''' is a traditional [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[sport]] event originally contested at country fairs. A [[pitchfork]] is used to hurl a [[burlap]] bag stuffed with [[straw]] over a horizontal bar above the competitor's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams |first1=Doug |title=Terri Ventress can throw just about anything -- and has 14 world records to prove it |url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/life-style/article/24663876/terri-ventress-throw-just-anything-14-world-records-prove-it |accessdate=30 November 2018 |publisher=ESPN |date=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical weight for the bag is 16 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (about 7 [[kilogram|kg]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nauright |first1=John |title=Sports around the World: History, Culture, and Practice [4 volumes]: History, Culture, and Practice |date=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781598843019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mYBtMajLAaAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA111&amp;dq=%22Sheaf+toss%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwg4vGhv3eAhWC8oMKHSqBAUkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sheaf%20toss%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three chances are given to each competitor to cleanly go over the bar, without touching it. After all challengers have made their attempts, the bar is raised and all successful competitors move on to the new height. This continues until all but one athlete is eliminated.

The Sheaf toss has been incorporated as an event at many of the Scottish [[highland games]] although technically it is not itself a heavy athletics event. The sheaf toss is also a traditional sport in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. It is a feature of the annual [[Sykehouse Show]] in South Yorkshire, England.

Sheaf tossing is also contested in [[Ireland]] and [[Australia]] particularly at [[agricultural show]]s and at [[fair]]s; Irish sheaf tossing differs from sheaf tossing in Scotland and France in that the sheaf is made of [[Juncus|rushes]] which are bound tightly with [[Baler|baling twine]] and are not placed in a bag. The rules are the same as the Scottish version and a [[pitchfork]] is used. The same pitchfork is usually used for all competitors so as not to give anybody an unfair advantage by allowing them use their own customised pitchfork. A variation of this rule is that if one brings a custom pitchfork to the competition, they must allow any other competitor to use that fork.

'''Tritonville Football Club''' was an [[association football]] club from [[Dublin]], Ireland. They competed for one season ([[Irish League 1912–13|1912–13]]) in the [[IFA Premiership|Irish League]], one of only three Dublin clubs to do so; they also competed in the [[Irish Cup]].

Tritonville played their games on grounds which were used by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] on Sundays for Gaelic games; as a result this attracted much controversy from the Belfast-based [[Irish Football Association]] who favoured [[Sunday Sabbath|Sabbatarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bB5SrdeaXv4C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Tritonville+football+club&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FYDm9G-2XZ&amp;sig=v5e-SjX9VKXC2NygTaH62r8V9vA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C2fTSearPObTjAeD08jwBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result The Game 1878-1914, Association football and society in pre-partition Ireland]

'''Wanborough''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɒ|n|b|ər|ə}}) is a rural village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in Surrey approximately 6&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Guildford]] on the northern slopes of the [[Hog's Back]]. Wanborough lies between [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]] and [[Normandy, Surrey|Normandy]] which includes the larger community around [[Wanborough railway station]] named Flexford.  Wanborough grew around and to service Wanborough Manor which is on the site of ancient [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1029614|accessdate=17 June 2012}} Wanborough Manor&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Prehistory===

According to a local publication ''Wanborough and its Church'',&lt;ref&gt;Anon ''Wanborough and its Church'' (available from the church)&lt;/ref&gt; humans in prehistory travelled along the Hog's Back, attracted by the [[spring (hydrology)|spring]] in the locality. The earliest settlement dates to 8000 BC.

The "Wanborough Coins" are part of a votive offering deposited at a Romano-Celtic temple (i.e., late 1st century BC to 4th century AD); this site was looted between 1983 and 1985, but over one thousand silver coins, a small part of the original assemblage, were eventually added to the collection of the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bean|first=S. C.|date=1996|title=Review of The Roman Temple at Wanborough. Surrey Archaeological Collections Vol. 82|journal=The Numismatic Chronicle|volume=156|pages=348–354|via=|jstor=42667984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biab.ac.uk/contents/9902&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum calls the destruction of the Romano-Celtic temple at Wanborough in Surrey 'one of the saddest stories in British archaeology'.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum.org"&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/o/offerings_from_wanborough.aspx Offerings from Wanborough Roman temple&lt;/ref&gt;

A headdress and sceptre handles were also recovered. These were probably used by a priest during rituals. Subsequent excavations have shown that there were in fact two temples on the site. A circular temple had been built during the late first century BC, replaced in the second century AD by a square temple.&lt;ref name="britishmuseum.org"/&gt;

 [[image:Wanborough coins.jpg|thumb|right| The Wanborough coins, discovered in 1983&lt;ref&gt;[[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] Wikimedia Commons photographs of finds&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Saxon name of ''Wenberge'' means ''bump-barrow''; this [[tumulus|barrow]] was on the southern border of Wanborough on the top of the [[Hog's Back]].

===Pre-dissolution===

Wanborough appears in [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as ''Weneberge'' held by Goisfrid (Geoffrey) de Mandville. Its assets were: 3&amp;nbsp;[[hide (unit)|hide]]s; 1&amp;nbsp;church, 9&amp;nbsp;[[plough]]s, {{convert|6|acre|ha}} of [[meadow]], [[woodland]] worth 30&amp;nbsp;[[hog (swine)|hog]]s (per year). Its people rendered £7 [[feudal system|per year to their overlords]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm Surrey Domesday Book] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030192829/http://www.gwp.enta.net/surrnames.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also states that it had been held before the [[Norman conquest]] by two [[thegn]]s, Sweign and Leofwin, who may have been brothers of [[Harold II of England|King Harold]]. 
[[Image:wanborough barn2 20060909.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The exterior of the Great Barn.]]

In 1130 the Manor was sold to [[Waverley Abbey]] for £80 and put to use in great part to farm sheep to feed, clothe and endow the [[Cistercian]] community. The present Great [[Barn]] was built in 1388 and was used for storing and processing crops ([[threshing]] and [[winnowing]]). Having been built for the [[Cistercian]] Abbey, the barn was not a [[tithe barn]] as it would have stored the entire manor crop. The barn is made from massive oak timbers and is an aisled barn with large doors on either long side to permit entry by carts. It was extended in 1705. The dates have been obtained using tree-ring dating techniques.

In 1511 the [[Waverley Abbey|Abbey]] obtained the right to hold an annual fair at Wanborough for 3 days from 23 August. By 1536 the fair was making £35 for the abbey and had a [[pie poudre]] court to try trading offences.

===Post-dissolution===
In 1536, Waverley Abbey was dissolved and the manor passed into secular ownership. St Bartholomew's Church was in regular use until at least 1675. By 1794, as leaseholder, the [[Quaker]] [[Morris Birkbeck]] was farming an estate of 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) at Wanborough, where he joined others in England and France who were experimenting with crossbreeding Merino sheep and innovating with modern techniques. He used the church as a wood store and barn. The church's architectural importance is reflected in its [[Grade I listed buildings in Surrey|Grade I listing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1287038|accessdate=17 June 2012}} St Bartholomew's Church&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1613, a court case recorded that someone was assaulted with a "[[cricket]] staffe" (an early term for the [[cricket bat]]) at Wanborough.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |title=From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300 – 1787 |publisher=Stumpsite |first=John |last=Leach |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629134518/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/main.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present [[manor house]], [[Wanborough Manor]], was built starting in about 1670 by Thomas Dalmahoy, who was MP [[Guildford (UK Parliament constituency)|for Guildford]] for most of the reign of the [[English Restoration|restored monarch]] (that is, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]).

Whilst nearby [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]] church was closed for repairs, its Rector, the Rev. W A Duckworth, decided to hold services in Wanborough's church. He arranged and paid for the restoration of St Bartholomew's by architect Henry Woodyer. It was rededicated in 1861.

From 1880, Sir [[Algernon West]] lived at Wanborough Manor. He was Principal Private Secretary to Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone]]. West entertained many political figures at the manor, including Gladstone, [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]. He was also a director of the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] and was responsible for the opening of [[Wanborough railway station|Wanborough Station]] (in nearby [[Normandy, Surrey|Normandy]]) in 1891. In 1900, the manor passed to [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]] who lived there until he became Prime Minister. In 1908 West returned and stayed until his death in 1921.

===World War II===
During [[World War II]] the Manor was used as a training centre for [[Special Operations Executive]] agents. The manor was designated Special Training School 5, and handled the first three phases of agent training. It operated from spring 1941 to March 1943 under the command of Major Roger de Wesselow, who had been a Coldstream Guards officer in [[World War I]]. Many agents in 'Section F' (France) passed through STS5 and courses lasted 3 weeks. Each course was specific to one country and all conversation during the course was in the target language. Trainees were taught theoretical and practical subjects including physical training, shooting, explosives, sabotage, map-reading, [[Morse code]], and observation skills.

One of the tests in the course was to invite beautiful women to seduce the agents through alcohol and flirtation and try to get them to divulge secrets. But the test was dropped, as almost all the agents appear to have failed to keep sensitive information to themselves.

===Post-war===

In the 1950s the Manor became a country club and restaurant. It acquired a reputation amongst the taxi drivers of Guildford who would be called to collect girls from Guildford station at weekends and then drive them back up to London for an early train on Monday morning.

The Manor House is now split into three private dwellings.

Since the 1960s development has been constrained by its rural isolation and protected status of much of its land, Wanborough has gradually become a mixture of a commuter and retirement settlement.  Principal employment areas are the [[Aldershot Urban Area]], [[Guildford]] and London.

== St Bartholomew's Church ==
[[File:Wanborough, Church.JPG|thumb|right|St Bartholomew's Church]]
The village church is small, only 13.5 m by 5.5 m internally. It was originally built around 1060 replacing an earlier wooden [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Saxon]] church. It was rebuilt in the 13th century and [[Victorian restoration|restored]] in 1861. Thus the various walls and windows have significantly different heritage. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] west brick wall now supports an external bell.
