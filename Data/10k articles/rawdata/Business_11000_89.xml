Cremades has been featured on the Top 30 Under 30 lists of GQ Magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, and Vanity Fair.&lt;ref name="Vanity Fair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelapaloma.com/2014/04/24/30-bajo-treinta-entrevista-para-vanity-fair/|title=30 bajo 30|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emprendedores"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emprendedores.es/casos-de-exito/jovenes-emprendedores|title=30 emprendedores de menos de 30|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistagq.com/actualidad/trending-topic/articulos/theo-james-portada-gq-noviembre-2015/22743|title=33 tipos menores de 33|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured by TechCrunch as one of the expats that is shaping New York's tech.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/gallery/meet-the-expats-shaping-new-york-tech/slide/10/=all|title=Mett The Expats Shaping New York Tech|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entrepreneurial activities ==

In 2010, Cremades founded [[Rock the Post]] with the goal to help entrepreneurs, including those without strong business connections, raise funds and gain exposure. The site was launched in November 2011. Initially the platform offered projects that could receive funding or [[barter|in-kind contributions]] (e.g., time and/or materials), but  switched to equity and debt based funding only.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/crowdfunding-for-entrepreneurs-who-are-spread-thin/2012/10/10/4bae8f04-12f9-11e2-a16b-2c110031514a_story.html|title=Crowdfunding for entrepreneurs who are spread thin|accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Mundo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/tecnologia/2014/08/30/53fc45dae2704e3f3c8b4570.html|title=El español que consiguió 66 millones de dólares para 80 'startups' de Estados Unidos|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2014, RockThePost announced the acquisition of CoFoundersLab, an online and in person matchmaking network that claims to build startup teams scientifically, creating a platform with over 70,000 startup founders and 30,000 investors registered. The new combined entity is operating as [[Onevest]].&lt;ref name="Upstart Business Journal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/devinthorpe/2014/07/16/combination-creates-a-leader-in-crowdfunding-market/=all|title=Combination Creates A Leader In Crowdfunding Market|accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2016, Cremades announced that Onevest was acquiring its major direct competitor, FounderDating, in order to merge that platform with its very own CoFoundersLab. According to the announcement the result of the acquisition would increase the number of registered entrepreneurs to over 300,000 on the platform and now providing services to entrepreneurs that would range from idea to funding and beyond.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/28/cofounderslab-buys-founderdating/=all|title=CoFoundersLab gobbles up FounderDating because 1+1=3|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/28/founderdating-onevest-acquisition/=all|title=Entrepreneur Networking Site FounderDating Just Got Acquired By Its Top Competitor|accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2018, Onevest/CoFoundersLab was acquired by Business Rockstars. At this point the company had over 400,000 active registered members. The deal was worth millions according to a post published by Cremades on Forbes where he describes the 10 biggest lessons during the journey of building the company.&lt;ref name="PRWeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/04/prweb15403090.htm=all|title=“Business Rockstars” Acquires CoFoundersLab|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrocremades/2018/04/16/my-biggest-10-lessons-after-my-startup-got-acquired-for-millions/#a29e4ae54eff=all|title=“My Biggest 10 Lessons After My Startup Got Acquired For Millions|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==

On June 6, 2013, Cremades testified at the U.S. House Committee on Small Business to voice his stance on the challenges the company was facing as a changing industry and the future of equity crowdfunding.&lt;ref name="Crowdfundinsider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2013/06/16880-indiegogo-other-crowdfunding-groups-set-to-testify-today-at-house-of-representatives/|title=Indiegogo, Other Crowdfunding Groups, Set to Testify Today at House of Representatives|work=Crowdfundinsider |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cremades is also a member of the Advisory Committee of the Spain U.S. Start-Up initiative of the Spain-U.S. Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name="Spain-U.S. Chamber of Commerce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spainusstartup.com/advisory-committee/alejandro-cremades//|title=Spain-U.S. Chamber of Commerce|work=Crowdfundinsider |accessdate=September 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==

Cremades is the author of ''The Art of Startup Fundraising'', published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]. In addition to having a foreword by Shark Tank‘s [[Barbara Corcoran]], in the book Cremades tries to distill everything he has learned in the past years down into an actionable guidebook for angel investors and startup founders. The book provides guidance on how startup funding works. Cremades also covers how the JOBS Act impacts the fundraising model, insights on startups from early stage to growth stage, crafting presentations and optimizing the strategy, building momentum, identifying the right investors, and avoiding the common mistakes. Geoffrey James, contributing editor for the magazine [[Inc. (magazine)|''Inc.'']], named it one of 2016's best books for entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Inc. Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/2016s-best-books-for-entrepreneurs.html|title=2016's Best Books for Entrepreneurs|work=Inc.

'''Anthony Bolton''' (born 7 March 1950) is one of the UK's best known [[Investment management|investment fund managers]] and most successful investors, having managed the [[Fidelity International Limited|Fidelity]] Special Situations fund from December 1979 to December 2007. Over this 28-year period the fund achieved annualised growth of 19.5%, far in excess of the 13.5% growth of the wider stock exchange, turning a £1,000 investment into £147,000.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Until April 2014 he managed [[Fidelity China Special Situations]] PLC, a [[London Stock Exchange]] listed [[investment trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fidelity.co.uk/investor/investment-trusts/china-special-situations/latest-news.page |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529160949/https://www.fidelity.co.uk/investor/investment-trusts/china-special-situations/latest-news.page |archivedate=29 May 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
Educated at [[Stowe School]] and [[trinity college cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], Bolton left with a degree in engineering and business studies. He pursued a career in the city where, age 29, he was recruited by Fidelity as one of their first London based investment managers. He is now President of Investments at [[Fidelity International Limited]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and manager of Fidelity China Special Situations PLC.

Bolton began managing Special Situations (a UK equity [[OEIC]]) when he joined Fidelity in 1979 and continued until 2007. He managed other funds alongside Special Situations during this time. From November 1985 to December 2002, he managed the Fidelity European Fund (a European equity OEIC). He managed Fidelity European Growth fund (a European equity [[SICAV]]) from 1990 to 2003, Fidelity European Values PLC (a UK-listed investment trust) from 1991 to 2001 and Fidelity Special Values PLC (also a UK-listed investment trust) from 1994 to 2007.

In 2006 his Special Situations Fund was split. The success of the fund had brought in so much money from investors, it had become the UK's largest open ended fund ([[OEIC]]) and it was feared that the fund was becoming too big to manage successfully.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The fund was split into UK and Global Special Situations funds, with the Global fund passed to Jorma Korhornen and the UK fund continuing under Bolton's stewardship until the end of 2007.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; With Bolton's step back from fund management, many questioned whether the fund could continue to outperform the market in future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Sanjeev Shah succeeded Anthony Bolton as the manager of the UK Special Situations Fund in January 2008. The fund remained in the first decile over the first two years of Shah's tenure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Bolton's former funds suffered amongst the worst redemptions in 2007. Investors withdrew £335m from the Special Situations fund and £508m from Global Special Situations. However, redemptions in both funds slowed significantly in 2008 and in March 2010, at £3 billion, the UK fund is almost back to the same size as when Bolton stepped down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citywire.co.uk/adviser/-/selection/profiles/content.aspx?ID=385194 |title=Fidelity Special Situations - Citywire Selection &amp;#124; New Model Adviser ® |publisher=Citywire |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

When he ceased managing funds in 2007, he took a full-time role mentoring and developing newer investment managers.

== Fidelity China Special Situations ==
In 2009 he announced his return to fund management and in April 2010 moved to Hong Kong to begin managing the newly launched Fidelity China Special Situations PLC, an investment trust listed on the London Stock Exchange.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust is fairly unusual among Investment Trusts in paying a commission (0.5%) to financial advisers, paid out of its 1.5% annual management charge, a feature standard with Unit Trusts such as the Fidelity Special Situations fund Bolton had previously managed, but uncommon in the Investment Trust world. Another unusual feature is that the Trust charges a performance fee if the fund's cumulative performance exceeds its benchmark, the MSCI China Index, by more than 2%, which is charged at 15% of any outperformance, to a maximum fee of 1.5% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fidelity.co.uk/investor/research-funds/fund-supermarket/factsheet/summary.page?idtype=ISIN&amp;fundid=GB00B62Z3C74 |title=Summary |publisher=Fidelity.co.uk |date=2012-12-31 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher than usual charges, along with uncertainty over Bolton's long-term commitment to the fund, have led to criticism of the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thisismoney.co.uk/2011/02/fidelity-china-special-situations-investment-trust-another-reason-not-to-invest-further.html |title=Fidelity China Special Situations Investment Trust: another reason not to invest further - This is Money |publisher=Blogs.thisismoney.co.uk |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this criticism, the fund has attracted high levels of investment, being fully subscribed at £460 million on issue in April 2010, and was initially trading at a premium to its net asset value due to high demand for the shares, whereas most investment trusts trade at a discount (in reflection of the fact that management costs damage returns). A second share issue in February 2011 was also fully subscribed, raising £166.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Paul |url=http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/investments/fidelity-china-special-sits-trust-c-share-offer-brings-in-%C2%A3166m/1026666.article |title=Fidelity China special sits trust C-share offer brings in £166m &amp;#124; News |publisher=Money Marketing |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candidmoney.com/candidreviews/review49.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703055301/http://www.candidmoney.com/candidreviews/review49.aspx |archivedate=3 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially performing well, the fund suffered in 2011, and as of 14 November 2011 it was 5th out of 6 trusts in its sector, losing 34% of its value in 2011 and trading at 78p, well below its £1 initial flotation price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustnet.com/News/Research.aspx?id=286802 |title=Bolton offers no excuse for dire performance &amp;#124; FE Trustnet |publisher=Trustnet.com |date=2011-11-14 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Private life ==
Bolton has three children. In his spare time he relaxes by composing music and cites [[Benjamin Britten]] as his biggest influence. His compositions have been performed at St Paul's Cathedral. He is a keen traveller and has a holiday home in [[Antigua]].&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=Times071215&gt;

== Operations ==
Based in [[Montreal]], Artistri Sud has built a following in [[Canada]] and abroad, using mainstream and [[social media]] platforms to raise awareness. The organization also hosts an annual fundraising event around [[International Women’s Day]] each year, recognizing local Montreal entrepreneurs for their work.&lt;ref name="Design"&gt;"Tales of Triumph 2016" ''[http://designisyummy.com/tales-of-triumph/]'' Design Is Yummy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization’s founder and executive director, [[Jennifer Lonergan]], is the organization's only paid employee. All other positions are filled by volunteers and interns. Artistri Sud has around 50 volunteers, and about 90% of them are women.

All donations made and grants received are used to fund the entrepreneurship training programs the organization implements in developing countries to empower women.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
Prior to launching the [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], executive director Lonergan opened a retail store in 2008, Artistri Atelier Boutique. The idea was to support women craftspeople both in [[Canada]] and in the developing world by promoting and selling their work in the store.&lt;ref name="Chatelaine"&gt;Friedman, Caroline (September 24, 2010). Coup de coeur Boutique Artistri''[http://blogues.chatelaine.com/blogue-bouffe/coup-de-coeur-boutique-artistri/2010/09/]'' Chatelaine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zurbaine"&gt;September 24, 2010. Artistri - Les artizanes''[http://zurbaines.com/fr/plaisirs-zurbains/decoration/artistri/]'' Vos copines en ville - zurbaines.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Empathic"&gt;Empathic Action Interview. ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njNJDV8lAZI]'' YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; The retail store is now closed.

=== Today ===
Today the nonprofit’s main activity is the implementation of its [[entrepreneurship]] training programs in the developing world, to empower women artisans to run their own micro-enterprises and earn a sustainable income to support themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Gazette" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;CBC News: Montreal - March 09, 2016.

In [[disk array]]s, a '''business continuance volume''', or BCV, is [[EMC Corporation]]'s term for an independently addressable copy of a data volume, that uses advanced mirroring technique for [[business continuity]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drj.com/articles/Win98/ogor.htm|title=Disaster Recovery Journal|accessdate=2012-03-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814163434/http://www.drj.com/articles/Win98/ogor.htm|archivedate=2009-08-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
BCVs can be detached from the active data storage at a point in time and mounted on non-critical servers to facilitate offline [[backup]] or [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]]. Once offline processes are completed, these BCVs can be either:
* discarded 
* re-attached (re-synchronized) to the production data again 
* used as a source to recover the production data

== Types ==
There are two types of BCVs:

* A clone BCV is a traditional method, and uses one-to-one separate physical storage (splitable [[disk mirror]])
** least impact on production performance
** high cost of the additional storage 
** persistent usage
* A [[Snapshot (computer storage)|snapshot]] BCV, that uses [[copy on write]] algorithm on the production volume
** uses only a small additional storage, that only holds the changes made to the production volume
*** lower cost of the additional storage
*** reads and writes impact performance of production storage
** once snapshot storage fills up, the snapshot becomes invalid and unusable
** short-term usage

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Business journalism''' is the part of [[journalism]] that tracks, records, analyzes and interprets the [[business sector | business]], [[Economy|economic]] and [[finance | financial]] activities and changes that take place in societies. Topics widely cover the entire purview of all [[commerce | commercial]] [[economic activity|activities]] related to the economy.

This area of journalism provides news and feature [[Article (publishing)|articles]] about people, places and issues related to the [[business sector]]. Most{{quantify|date=February 2018}} newspapers, magazines, radio, and television-news shows include a business segment. Detailed and in-depth business journalism may appear in publications, radio, and television channels dedicated specifically to business and financial journalism.

== History ==
Business journalism began as early as the [[Middle Ages]], to help well-known trading families communicate with each other.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournalismhistory.org/main_frame.htm |title=main_frame.htm |work=History of Business Journalism |publisher=Carolina Business News Initiative, [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Journalism and Mass Communication]] |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 1700, [[Daniel Defoe]]--best known for his novels especially ''Robinson Crusoe''-- began publishing business and economic news.&lt;ref&gt;Margarett A. James, and Dorothy F. Tucker. "Daniel Defoe, Journalist." ''Business History Review'' 2.1 (1928): 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882 [[Charles Dow]], [[Edward Jones (statistician)|Edward Jones]] and Charles Bergstresser began a wire service that delivered news to investment houses along Wall Street.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; And in 1889, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' began publishing.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; While the famous muckraking journalist [[Ida Tarbell]] did not consider herself to be a business reporter, her reporting and writing about the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Co.]] in 1902 provided the template for how thousands of business journalists have covered companies ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://businessjournalism.org/pages/biz/2008/05/taking_on_the_trust/ |title=Book Reviews: Taking on the Trust |last1=Roush |first1=Chris |date=May 2008 |publisher=BusinessJournalism.org |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708010519/http://businessjournalism.org/pages/biz/2008/05/taking_on_the_trust/ |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business coverage gained prominence in the 1990s, with wider investment in the [[stock market]]. ''The Wall Street Journal'' is one prominent example of business journalism, and is among the [[United States|United States of America]]'s top newspapers in terms of both [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] and respect for the [[journalist]]s whose work appears there.

== Personnel ==
Journalists who work in this branch are classed as "business journalists". Their main task is to gather information about current events as they related to business. They may also cover processes, trends, consequences, and important people, in business and disseminate their work through all types of mass media.

== Scope ==
Business journalism, although common in most industrialized countries, has a very limited role in [[Third World|third-world]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]]. This leaves citizens of such countries in a very disadvantaged position locally and internationally.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Recent efforts to bring business media to these countries have proven to be worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/191013/index.en.shtml |title=Enlightening entrepreneurs |last1=Luesby |first1=Jenny |date=February 2011 |at=Focus, Page 62 |journal=D+C Development and Cooperation |volume=52 |number=2 |publisher=[[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] (GIZ) |accessdate=25 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809030853/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/191013/index.en.shtml |archivedate=9 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Buxton Going''' (April 4, 1863 - 1952 in [[France]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Records for Americans Abroad|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=BMD_DEATH&amp;rank=1&amp;new=1&amp;MSAV=0&amp;msT=1&amp;gss=angs-c&amp;gsfn=charles+buxton&amp;gsln=going&amp;uidh=000&amp;so=2|work=France 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Americans|American]] engineer, author, and editor.

== Biography == 
Born in [[Westchester, New York|Westchester N.Y.]], Going attended [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science|Columbia College School of Mines]], where he graduated in 1882. [[Columbia University]] awarded him the honorary degree of M.Sc. in 1910.

Mr. Going immediately began work in the [[Middle West]] in industrial and corporate management.  He joined the staff of the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' in 1896, becoming managing editor in 1898 and editor in 1912. He did much to discern, define, and establish the profession of "industrial engineering."

He became special lecturer on the subject of "industrial engineering" at Columbia, [[Harvard University]], [[New York University]], and the [[University of Chicago]].

== Publications ==
His writings include:
* 1909. ''Methods of the Santa Fé''
* 1911. ''[https://openlibrary.org/works/OL4419424W/Principles_of_industrial_engineering Principles of Industrial Engineering]''
* 1915. Preface to ''[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL13554528M/Ford_methods_and_the_Ford_shops Ford methods and the Ford shops].'' [[Horace Lucian Arnold]] and Fay Leone Faurote.  The Engineering magazine company, 1915.
On less scholarly notes, he wrote:

A '''clawback''' or '''clawback provision''' is a special contractual clause typically included in employment contracts by [[financial firm]]s, by which money already paid must be paid back under certain conditions. The term also is in use in [[bankruptcy]] matters where insiders may have raided assets prior to a filing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/clawback_suit_seeks_420k_from_us_transportation_secretary|title=Clawback suit seeks $420K from US transportation secretary concerning in-house counsel pay|last=|first=|date=|website=American Bar Association|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medicaid#Clawback controversy|Medicaid]], when a state recovers costs of long-term care or covered medical expenses from the estates of deceased Medicaid patients. The aim of the clause is to secure an option for an employer or trustee to limit bonuses, compensation or other remuneration in case of catastrophic shifts in business, bankruptcy, and national crisis as the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], and for states to recoup the cost of administering Medicaid services.

The term '''clawbacks''' or '''claw backs''' can also be used to refer to any money or benefits that have been given out but need to be returned due to special circumstances or events, which are mentioned in a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clawback.asp|title= Clawback | website=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The employees' bonuses are, in a clawback scheme, tied specifically to the performance (or lack thereof) of the [[financial product]](s) the individual(s) may have created and/or sold as part of his or her job expecting a high profit. If the product does indeed do well over a long period of time, and permanently improves the nature of the firm, the bonuses paid to the individual are allowed to be retained by the individual. However, if the product fails, and damages the nature of the firm—even years down the line from the product's inception—then the firm has the inherent right to revoke, reclaim, or otherwise repossess some or all of the bonus amount(s).&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite news|date=November 29, 2010|title=What Good Is Wall Street? Much of what investment bankers do is socially worthless|author=Cassidy, John |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/11/29/101129fa_fact_cassidy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research shows managers who are subject to clawback provisions that are newly in place in a company often try to offset their increased risk of bonus clawback by demanding an increase in base salary that is not subject to being clawed back.&lt;ref name="deHaan et al."/&gt;

The prevalence of clawback provisions among Fortune 100 companies increased from lower than 3% prior to 2005 to 82% in 2010.&lt;ref name="CSuite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-suiteinsight.com/index.php/2011/02/focus-on-clawbacks/|title=Focus on Clawbacks|website=C-Suite Insight|date=2011|access-date=2012-05-16|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118164533/http://www.c-suiteinsight.com/index.php/2011/02/focus-on-clawbacks/|archive-date=2013-01-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing popularity of clawback provisions is likely, at least in part, due to the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002, which requires the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) to pursue the repayment of incentive compensation from senior executives that are involved in a fraud. In practice, the Securities and Exchange commission has enforced its clawback powers in only a small number of cases.&lt;ref name= "Fried and Shilon"&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1798185 |title=Excess-Pay Clawbacks|authors= Fried, Jesse &amp; Shilon, Nitzan |date=2011|journal= Journal of Corporation Law|volume= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dodd-Frank Act]] of 2010 mandates the SEC to require that U.S. public companies include a clawback provision in their executive compensation contracts that is triggered by any accounting restatement, regardless of fault (whereas the clawback provisions per the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] only applied to intentional fraud). As of mid 2015, this portion of the Dodd-Frank Act has yet to be implemented. &lt;ref name=SEC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2015/33-9861.pdf |title=Listing Standards for Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation|accessdate=February 10, 2018|website=SEC.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The usual objective of a clawback provision is to deter managers from publishing incorrect accounting information. Academic research finds that voluntarily adopted clawback provisions appear to be effective at reducing both intentional and unintentional accounting errors.&lt;ref name= "deHaan et al."&gt;{{cite news|ssrn=2049442 |title=Does Voluntary Adoption of a Clawback Provision Improve Financial Reporting Quality?|authors= deHaan, Ed &amp; Hodge, Frank &amp; Shevlin, Terry J. |date=2012|work=Contemporary Accounting Research, forthcoming}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also finds that investors have greater confidence in a firm's financial statements after clawback adoption, and that boards of directors place greater weight on accounting numbers in executive bonuses after a clawback is in place (i.e., [[pay for performance (human resources)|pay for performance]] sensitivity increases).

According to a December 2010 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine article,&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; the clawback phenomenon pursued by banks and other financial groups directly and/or indirectly responsible for the financial crisis has been used by the chief administrators of those institutions in order to make the case that they are presently taking tangible self-corrective action to both prevent another crisis (by supposedly dis-incentivizing the sorts of shady investment-product behavior displayed by their people in the recent past) and to appropriately punish any potential future activity of a similar or identical sort. However, the case is made in ''The New Yorker'' article (which cites several professional economists who agree with its perspective) that it is probably unlikely that either result will become the case, and ''The New Yorker'' article also alleges that the people making this argument may not even truly believe it, but are instead promoting it as a sort of [[public relations]] tactic until such time as the impact of the financial crisis fades and similar (perhaps near-identical) abuses of the financial system can slowly and quietly resume, with minimal or no detection by outside forces.&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

==Background==
In the past, clawback phenomena have been used primarily in securing [[tax incentive]]s, [[Tax holiday|abatements]], [[tax refund|refund]]s and [[Grant (money)|grants]]. Clawbacks are distinguished from repayments or refunds as they involve a [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]] in addition to a repayment.

The use of tax incentives for attracting jobs and [[capital investment]] has grown over the past twenty odd years to include performance measures from which to gauge a company's growth. Typical measures are:

#number of created jobs over 5 or 10 years
#annual payroll
#amount of capital investment over a similar time frame, and
#amount of depreciated value in a given time.

More unusual measures are retaining a headquarters at a specific site for a period of time, amount of production increase or production cost decrease per unit or the requirement to bring a given technology to a commercial market. The recipient will be required to return the monetary value of the incentive plus a penalty and/or interest to the grantor of the incentive, usually a local or state taxing authority. As the use of incentives mature over time, it is sometimes alleged {{who|date=May 2012}} that the triggering of clawbacks for non performance will likely become more ubiquitous.

Clawbacks can be understood to be the contractual elements that stand between the drive for economic development and community development and the slippery slope of [[corporate welfare]]. They are highly controversial and are utilized as community based guarantees for some expectation of performance. The site location industry normally tries to eliminate or reduce any such promises as part of their negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Business Facilities|url=http://www.businessfacilities.com/bf_03_04_cover5.asp|title=Cover|date=|access-date=2006-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113130202/http://www.businessfacilities.com/bf_03_04_cover5.asp|archive-date=2006-11-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodjobsfirst.org"&gt;{{cite web|website=Good Jobs First|url=http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/accountable_development/reform2.cfm|title=Reform|access-date=2006-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823152332/http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/accountable_development/reform2.cfm|archive-date=2006-08-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goodjobsfirst.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iedconline.org/ |website=International Economic Development Council|title=Homem page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in mortgage brokering==
Clawbacks are also used by most banks and lenders to recover money from "unprofitable" home loans. This is usually done when the borrower pays back the loan in a short period of time, usually within 24 months of the loan advancement.

In Australia this fee is usually 0.77% of the total loan amount for loans paid back within the first 12 months after the settlement and 0.385% within 24 months. If a borrower is using a mortgage broker for their home loan, then the broker will usually charge them this amount.

==Use in Medicaid==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12164">[[File:ClusterSampling.jpg|thumb|Cluster Sampling]]
'''Cluster sampling''' is a [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] plan used when mutually homogeneous yet internally heterogeneous groupings are evident in a [[statistical population]].  It is often used in [[marketing research]]. In this sampling plan, the total population is divided into these groups (known as clusters) and a [[simple random sample]] of the groups is selected. The elements in each cluster are then sampled. If all elements in each sampled cluster are sampled, then this is referred to as a "one-stage" cluster sampling plan. If a simple random subsample of elements is selected within each of these groups, this is referred to as a "two-stage" cluster sampling plan. A common motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the total number of interviews and costs given the desired accuracy. For a fixed sample size, the expected [[Observational error|random error]] is smaller when most of the variation in the population is present internally within the groups, and not between the groups.

==Cluster elements==
The population within a cluster should ideally be as heterogeneous as possible, but there should be homogeneity between clusters. Each cluster should be a small-scale representation of the total population. The clusters should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. A random sampling technique is then used on any relevant clusters to choose which clusters to include in the study. In single-stage cluster sampling, all the elements from each of the selected clusters are sampled. In two-stage cluster sampling, a random sampling technique is applied to the elements from each of the selected clusters.

The main difference between cluster sampling and [[stratified sampling]] is that in cluster sampling the cluster is treated as the sampling unit so sampling is done on a population of clusters (at least in the first stage).  In stratified sampling, the sampling is done on elements within each strata. In stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn from each of the strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are sampled. A common motivation of cluster sampling is to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. This contrasts with stratified sampling where the motivation is to increase precision.

There is also [[multistage sampling|multistage cluster sampling]], where at least two stages are taken in selecting elements from clusters.

==When clusters are of different sizes==

Without modifying the estimated parameter, cluster sampling is unbiased when the clusters are approximately the same size. In this case, the parameter is computed by combining all the selected clusters. When the clusters are of different sizes, [[sampling (statistics)#Probability-proportional-to-size sampling|probability proportionate to size sampling]] is used. In this sampling plan, the probability of selecting a cluster is proportional to its size, so that a large clusters has a greater probability of selection than a small cluster. However, when clusters are selected with probability proportionate to size, the same number of interviews should be carried out in each sampled cluster so that each unit sampled has the same probability of selection.

==Applications of cluster sampling==
An example of cluster sampling is [[area sampling]] or [[geographical cluster sampling]]. Each cluster is a geographical area. Because a geographically dispersed population can be expensive to survey, greater economy than simple random sampling can be achieved by grouping several respondents within a local area into a cluster. It is usually necessary to increase the total sample size to achieve equivalent precision in the [[estimator]]s, but cost savings may make such an increase in sample size feasible.

Cluster sampling is used to estimate high mortalities in cases such as [[war]]s, [[famine]]s and [[natural disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;David Brown, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001442.html Study Claims Iraq's 'Excess' Death Toll Has Reached 655,000], ''Washington Post'', Wednesday, October 11, 2006. Retrieved September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantage==

* Can be cheaper than other sampling plans – e.g. fewer travel expenses, administration costs.
*Feasibility: This sampling plan takes large populations into account. Since these groups are so large, deploying any other sampling plan would be very costly.
*Economy: The regular two major concerns of expenditure, i.e., traveling and listing, are greatly reduced in this method. For example: Compiling research information about every household in a city would be very costly, whereas compiling information about various blocks of the city will be more economical. Here, traveling as well as listing efforts will be greatly reduced.
*Reduced variability: When estimates are being considered by any other method, reduced variability in results are observed. This may not be an ideal situation every time.
Major use: when sampling frame of all elements is not available we can resort only to the cluster sampling.

==Disadvantage==

* Higher [[sampling error]], which can be expressed in the so-called "design effect", the ratio between the number of subjects in the cluster study and the number of subjects in an equally reliable, randomly sampled unclustered study.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry and Bland (1998). [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/316/7142/1455 Statistics notes: The intracluster correlation coefficient in cluster randomization]. ''British Medical Journal'',  316, 1455–1460.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Biased samples: If the group in population that is chosen as a sample has a biased opinion, then the entire population is inferred to have the same opinion. This may not be the actual case.

Errors: The other probabilistic methods give fewer errors than this method. For this reason, it is discouraged for beginners.

==More on cluster sampling==

===Two-stage cluster sampling===
Two-stage cluster sampling, a simple case of [[multistage sampling]], is obtained by selecting cluster samples in the first stage and then selecting sample of elements from every sampled cluster. Consider a population of ''N'' clusters in total. In the first stage, ''n'' clusters are selected using ordinary cluster sampling method. In the second stage, [[simple random sampling]] is usually used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Saifuddin|title=Methods in Sample Surveys|year=2009|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University and Saifuddin Ahmed|url=http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/statmethodsforsamplesurveys/PDFs/Lecture5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used separately in every cluster and the numbers of elements selected from different clusters are not necessarily equal. The total number of clusters ''N'', number of clusters selected ''n'', and numbers of elements from selected clusters need to be pre-determined by the survey designer. Two-stage cluster sampling aims at minimizing survey costs and at the same time controlling the uncertainty related to estimates of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Daniel Pfeffermann|author2=C. Radhakrishna Rao| title = Handbook of Statistics Vol.29A Sample Surveys: Theory, Methods and Infernece| url = https://books.google.com/?id=waHxMgEACAAJ| year = 2009| publisher = Elsevier B.V.| isbn = 978-0-444-53124-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used in health and social sciences. For instance, researchers used two-stage cluster sampling to generate a representative sample of the Iraqi population to conduct mortality surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=LP Galway |author2=Nathaniel Bell |author3=Al S SAE |author4=Amy Hagopian |author5=Gilbert Burnham |author6=Abraham Flaxman |author7=Wiliam M Weiss |author8=Julie Rajaratnam |author9=Tim K Takaro|title=A two-stage cluster sampling method using gridded population data, a GIS, and Google EarthTM imagery in a population-based mortality survey in Iraq|journal=International Journal of Health Geographics|date=27 April 2012|url=http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/11/1/12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampling in this method can be quicker and more reliable than other methods, which is why this method is now used frequently.

===Inference when the number of clusters is small===
Cluster sampling methods can lead to significant bias when working with a small number of clusters. For instance, it can be necessary to cluster at the state or city level, units that may be small and fixed in number. Microeconometrics methods for panel data often use short panels, which is analogous to having few observations per clusters and many clusters. The small cluster problem can be viewed as an incidental parameter problem.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron A. C. and P. K. Trivedi (2005): Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; While the point estimates can be reasonably precisely estimated, if the number of observations per cluster is sufficiently high, we need the number of clusters &lt;math&gt;G\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; for the asymptotics to kick in. If the number of clusters is low the estimated covariance matrix can be downward biased.&lt;ref name="CameronMiller"&gt;Cameron, C. and D. L. Miller (2015): A Practitioner's Guide to Cluster-Robust Inference. Journal of Human Resources 50(2), pp. 317-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Small numbers of clusters is a risk when there is serial correlation or when there is intraclass correlation as in the Moulton context. When having few clusters, we tend to underestimate serial correlation across observations when a random shock occurs, or the intraclass correlation in a Moulton setting.&lt;ref name="AngristPischke"&gt;Angrist, J.D. and J.-S. Pischke (2009): Mostly Harmless Econometrics. An empiricist's companion. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have highlighted the consequences of serial correlation correlation and highlighted the small-cluster problem.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, M., E. Duflo and S. Mullainathan (2004): How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates? Quarterly Journal of Economics 119(1), pp. 249-275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kezdi, G. (2004): Robust Standard Error Estimation in Fixed-Effect Panel Models. Hungarian Statistical Review 9, pp. 95-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the framework of the Moulton factor, an intuitive explanation of the small cluster problem can be derived from the formula for the Moulton factor. Assume for simplicity that the number of observation per cluster is fixed at ''n''. Below, &lt;math&gt;V_{c}(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; stands for the covariance matrix adjusted for clustering, &lt;math&gt;V(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; stands for the covariance matrix not adjusted for clustering, and ρ stands for the intraclass correlation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{c}(\hat\beta)}{V(\hat\beta)}=1+(n-1)\rho&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio on the left-hand side provides an indication of how much the unadjusted scenario overestimates the precision. Therefore, a high number means a strong downward bias of the estimated covariance matrix. A small cluster problem can be interpreted as a large n: when the data is fixed and the number of clusters is low, the number of data within a cluster can be high. It follows that inference when the number of clusters is small will not have correct coverage.&lt;ref name="AngristPischke"/&gt;

Several solutions for the small cluster problem have been proposed. One can use a bias-corrected cluster-robust variance matrix, make T-distribution adjustments, or use bootstrap methods with asymptotic refinements, such as the percentile-t or wild bootstrap, that can lead to improved finite sample inference.&lt;ref name="CameronMiller"/&gt; Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2008) provide microsimulations for different methods and find that the wild bootstrap performs well in the face of a small number of clusters.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, C., J. Gelbach and D. L. Miller (2008): Bootstrap-Based Improvements for Inference with Clustered Errors. The Review of Economics and Statistics 90, pp. 414-427.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations 1980''', or the "Rome Convention", is a measure in [[private international law]] or [[conflict of laws]] which creates a common choice of law system in contracts within the [[European Union]]. The convention determines which law should be used, but does not harmonise the substance (the actual law). It was signed in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] on 19 June 1980 and entered into force in 1991.

It has now been replaced by the [[Rome I Regulation]] (593/2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008R0593:EN:NOT 593/2008]&lt;/ref&gt; except for in [[Denmark]], which has an [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-out]] from implementing regulations under the [[area of freedom, security and justice]], and the [[Special member state territories and the European Union#Overseas countries and territories|Overseas countries and territories]] of European Union member states. In that respect, the convention is applicable in Aruba, the Caribbean Netherlands, Curaçao, Sint Maarten (Kingdom of the Netherlands), Faroer (Denmark), Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barthélemy, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia (France).&lt;ref name=depositary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/agreements-conventions/agreement/?aid=1988024|title=Agreement details|accessdate=31 March 2013|work=Council of the European Union}}&lt;br&gt;for France, see Article 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the convention==
{{Conflict of laws}}
Under Article 1, the Convention's rules are to apply to all [[choice of law]] issues involving contractual obligations and, under Article 10, once selected, the ''[[lex causae]]'' will govern:
:(a) interpretation;
:(b) performance but, in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance, regard shall be had to the ''[[lex loci solutionis]]'', i.e. law of the place in which performance takes place;
:(c) within the limits of the powers conferred on the forum [[court]] by its [[procedure (conflict)|procedural]] law, the consequences of breach, including the assessment of [[damages]] in so far as it is governed by rules of law;
:(d) the various ways of extinguishing obligations, and the [[statute of limitations|limitation]] of actions; and
:(e) the consequences of nullity of the contract.
Article 15 excludes the operation of [[renvoi]]. In addition, a number of issues with a separate [[characterisation (conflict)|characterisation]] are excluded, namely:
*the [[status (law)|status]] or [[capacity (law)|capacity]] of [[natural person]]s. Article 11 covers the situation where two persons physically present in the same [[Sovereign state|state]] make a contract, and both parties have capacity under the ''[[lex loci contractus]]''. One party cannot invoke incapacity under another law unless the other party was aware of this incapacity at the time the contract was made or was not aware of the incapacity as a result of [[negligence]].
*contractual obligations relating to [[succession (conflict)|succession]] and all rights claimed in property in a [[marriage (conflict)|marriage]] or family relationship, particularly where the question of the entitlement of any [[child]] who is [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] is raised.
*obligations arising under [[negotiable instrument]]s including bills of exchange, [[cheque]]s, and [[promissory note]]s and connected to their negotiable character;
*[[arbitration]] agreements and agreements on the choice of court (see [[arbitration clause]]s and [[forum selection clause]]s);
*questions governed by the law of [[company (law)|companies]] and other bodies [[corporation|corporate]] or [[business entity|unincorporate]] such as the creation, by registration or otherwise, legal capacity, internal organisation or winding up of companies and other bodies corporate or unincorporate, and the personal liability of officers and members for the obligations of the company or body;
*the question whether an [[agent (law)|agent]] is able to bind a [[principal (commercial law)|principal]], or an organ to bind a company or body corporate or unincorporate, to a third party;
*the constitution of trusts and the relationship between settlors, [[trustee]]s and [[beneficiary|beneficiaries]] (see [[trusts (conflict)]]);
*[[evidence (law)|evidence]] and procedure save that, under Article 14, the Applicable Law applies to the extent that it contains, in the law of contract, rules which raise presumptions of law or determine the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]]. Thus, under Article 14 (2) a contract or an act intended to have legal effect may be proved by any mode of proof recognised by the ''[[lex fori]]'' or by any of the laws referred to in Article 9 under which that contract or act is formally valid, provided that such mode of proof can be administered by the forum court.
*the question of whether a contracts of [[insurance]] covers a [[risk]] situated in the territories of one of the [[Member States]] is determined under the municipal law of the relevant states. This exclusion does not apply to contracts of [[reinsurance]].

==The uniform rules==

===Express selection===
Article 3 states the general rule that the parties to a contract have freedom of choice over the applicable law. To exercise this choice either express words may be used or the intention should be demonstrated with reasonable certainty by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case.

The law chosen may apply to the whole or only a part of the contract, and the choice is not irrevocable. The parties can at any time agree to change the applicable law and any such variation will not prejudice the formal validity of the agreement nor adversely affect the rights of third parties.

Where all the elements of a contract, at the time of its conclusion, are connected with only one country, Article 3 may not be used to [[evasion (law)|evade]] the mandatory provisions of that state (Article 3(4)).

To establish a choice demonstrated with reasonable certainty, there must have been a "real choice". That the parties ''would'' have chosen a particular law is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;"This Article does not permit the court to infer a choice of law that the parties might have made where they had no clear intention of making such a choice" ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980Y1031(01):EN:HTML Giuliano-Lagarde Report]).&lt;/ref&gt; The court will take into account '''both''' the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case.&lt;ref&gt;See the examples in the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980Y1031(01):EN:HTML Guiliano-Lagarde Report].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guiliano-Lagarde Report gives three examples of situations where a real choice may be demonstrated with reasonable certainty:
* '''Standard form contracts''' The report gives as an example a Lloyd's policy of marine insurance.
* '''Jurisdiction and arbitration agreements'''
* '''Course of dealing'''&lt;ref&gt;See further {{cite court

  |date=1996
  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implied selection===
If there is no express choice, Article 4 provides that the contract shall be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected. If the agreement is severable, two applicable laws may be selected. For these purposes, it is presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the ''lex loci solutionis'', i.e. the law of the place where the contract is to be performed, or the law of the [[habitual residence]] of the person who is to perform, or, in the case of a body corporate or unincorporate, where its central administration is located. However, if it is a commercial or professional contract, the applicable law will be the law of the place in which the principal place of business is situated or, where under the terms of the contract the performance is to be effected through a place of business other than the principal place of business, the country in which that other place of business is situated except that there is a [[rebuttable presumption]]:
:where the subject matter of the agreement is immovable property, the ''[[lex situs]]'' will apply; and
:contracts for the carriage of goods and charter-parties are governed by the law of the place in which, at the time the contract is concluded, the carrier has his principal place of business if that is also the place in which loading or discharge is to occur or the place where the consignor has his or her principal place of business.

===Consumer contracts===
Article 5 applies to contracts for the supply of goods or services to a [[consumer]] for a non-commercial purpose, or to a contract for the provision of credit for that object. Although Article 3 gives the parties a free choice of law, this choice cannot deprive the consumer of any protections available under the mandatory law of the country in which he has his habitual residence if the consumer was responding to advertising material or a specific invitation and makes the agreement in that country, or if the other party or his agent received the consumer's order in that country, or if the contract is for the sale of goods and the consumer travelled from that country to another country and there gave his order, provided that the consumer's journey was arranged by the seller for the purpose of inducing the consumer to buy. For these purposes, Article 7 defines "mandatory rules" as rules that must be applied whatever the Applicable Law. In deciding whether rules are mandatory in the ''lex fori'' or a law with which the contract has a close connection, regard shall be had to their nature and purpose and to the consequences of their application or non-application.

If the contract is silent on the choice of law, it will be governed by the law of habitual residence if it is entered into in the circumstances described above. But this Article does not apply to:

:(a) a contract of carriage;
:(b) a contract for the supply of services where the services are to be supplied to the consumer exclusively in a country other than that in which he has his habitual residence.

The Article does, however, apply to a contract which, for an inclusive price, provides for a combination of travel and accommodation.

===Contracts of employment===
{{see also|Posted Workers Directive}}
Under Article 6, no choice of law selection contained in a contract of [[employment]] can deprive the [[employee]] of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory laws which would be applicable in the absence of that choice. If there is no express selection, an employment contract is governed,

{{quote|(a) by the law of the country in which the employee habitually carries out his work in performance of the contract, even if he is temporarily employed in another country; or

(b) if the employee does not habitually carry out his work in any one country, by the law of the country in which the place of business through which he was engaged is situated;

unless it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country, in which case the contract shall be governed by the law of that country.}}

The provisions may only apply for the benefit of the employee.

===Material validity===
Under Article 8, the material validity of a contract, or of any term in a contract, shall be determined by the law which would govern it under the Convention if the contract or term were valid (i.e. the putative Applicable Law). But, if this would produce an obviously unfair result, a party may rely upon the law of the place of habitual residence to establish that he did not give a free consent.

===Formal validity===
Under Article 9, a contract concluded between persons who are in the same country is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of either the Applicable Law or the law of the country where it is concluded. A contract concluded between persons who are in different countries is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of either the Applicable Law or the law of one of those countries. Where a contract is concluded by an agent, the country in which the agent acts is the relevant country for the purposes of the earlier tests. But a contract relating to immovable property is always subject to the mandatory provisions of the ''lex situs''.

===Transfers of obligation===
Article 12 deals with a voluntary [[assignment (law)|assignment]] or [[novation]]. Whether the rights and/or obligations can be transferred, the nature of the relationship between the assignee and the debtor that results from a transfer, the conditions under which the assignment can be invoked against the debtor, and any question whether the debtor's obligations have been discharged, are determined by the Applicable Law of the original agreement. The Applicable Law of the transfer will determine the mutual obligations of assignor and assignee as against the third party, i.e. "the debtor". Article 13 deals with [[subrogation]] so that whether a third person may enforce an existing liability owed to a "creditor" by a "debtor" is determined by reference to the law which governs the debtor's duty to satisfy the creditor.

===Ordre public===
Under Article 16, the forum court may invoke its own [[public policy (law)|public policy]] as a justification for refusing to apply the ''lex causae''.

===Composite or federated states===
Under Article 19, where the choice of law rules point to a country with more than one legal system, the Convention selects the most appropriate municipal law (not the choice of law rules of that law given that renvoi is excluded).

==Signature, ratification and amendment==
The convention was signed by Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland and Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on 19 June 1980, followed by Denmark and the United Kingdom in 1981, thus covering all members of the [[European Communities]]. It entered into force in 1991 for 8 of those countries and one year later for Ireland. During the enlargement of the Communities with Greece (1984), Spain and Portugal (1992) and Sweden, Finland and Austria (1996), and the 10 countries in 2004, treaties were concluded on the extension of the convention to those countries. Those Extension conventions were however not all ratified by the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland and thus which hampered entry into force of the convention between those three countries and the acceding countries. With the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the council of the European Union was empowered to effect the accession to the treaty, which took place in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:347:0001:0002:EN:PDF|title=concerning the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the Convention on the Law applicable to Contractual Obligations, opened for signature in Rome on 19 June 1980|accessdate=30 March 2013|work=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15090">In [[finance]], a '''credit derivative''' refers to any one of "various instruments and techniques designed to separate and then transfer the ''[[credit risk]]''"&lt;ref name=Econ1&gt;[[The Economist]] ''Passing on the risks'' 2 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt; or the risk of an event of default of a corporate or sovereign borrower, transferring it to an entity other than the lender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Das |first = Satyajit |title = Credit Derivatives: CDOs and Structured Credit Products, 3rd Edition |publisher = Wiley |year = 2005 |isbn = 978-0-470-82159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt; or debtholder.

An unfunded credit derivative is one where credit protection is bought and sold between bilateral counterparties without the protection seller having to put up money upfront or at any given time during the life of the deal unless an event of default occurs. Usually these contracts are traded pursuant to an [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA) master agreement. Most credit derivatives of this sort are [[credit default swap]]s. If the credit derivative is entered into by a financial institution or a [[special purpose vehicle]] (SPV) and payments under the credit derivative are funded using [[securitization]] techniques, such that a debt obligation is issued by the financial institution or SPV to support these obligations, this is known as a funded credit derivative.

This synthetic securitization process has become increasingly popular over the last decade, with the simple versions of these structures being known as synthetic [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs), [[credit-linked note]]s or [[single-tranche CDO]]s. In funded credit derivatives, transactions are often rated by rating agencies, which allows investors to take different slices of credit risk according to their risk appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Bruyere |first1 = Richard |last2 = Cont|first2 = Rama |title = Credit Derivatives and Structured Credit: A guide for investors |publisher = Wiley |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0470018798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit market participants, regulators, and courts are increasingly using credit derivative pricing to help inform decisions about loan pricing, risk management, capital requirements, and legal liability.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Simkovic|editor1-last=Adler|editor1-first=Barry|title=Making Fraudulent Transfer Law More Predictable, in Handbook on Corporate Bankruptcy|date=2016|publisher=Edward Elgar|ssrn=2775920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBO"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|last2=Kaminetzky|first2=Benjamin|title=Leveraged Buyout Bankruptcies, the Problem of Hindsight Bias, and the Credit Default Swap Solution|journal=Columbia Business Law Review|date=2011|volume=2011|page=118|ssrn=1632084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simkovic|first1=Michael|title=What Can We Learn from Credit Markets|journal=Proceedings of the 93rd Annual Meeting of the American Law Institute|date=2016|ssrn=2782844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and participants ==
The market in credit derivatives started from nothing in 1993 after having been pioneered by [[J.P. Morgan]]'s Peter Hancock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=AIG: America’s Improved Giant |url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21571139-insurer-has-done-good-job-rehabilitating-itself-can-it-stand-its-own |newspaper=The Economist |location=London |date=February 2, 2013 |accessdate=March 30, 2015 }}

&lt;/ref&gt; By 1996 there was around $40 billion of outstanding transactions, half of which involved the [[debt of developing countries]].&lt;ref name=Econ1/&gt;

Credit default products are the most commonly traded credit derivative product&lt;ref name="BBACDR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bba.org.uk/content/1/c4/76/71/Credit_derivative_report_2006_exec_summary.pdf|format=PDF|title=British Banker Association Credit Derivatives Report |date=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and include unfunded products such as [[credit default swap]]s and funded products such as [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (see further discussion below).

On May 15, 2007, in a speech concerning credit derivatives and liquidity risk, Geithner stated: “Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk.” &lt;ref&gt;Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's 2007 Financial Markets Conference—Credit Derivatives, Sea Island, Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;  Credit market participants, regulators, and courts are increasingly using credit derivative pricing to help inform decisions about loan pricing, risk management, capital requirements, and legal liability.&lt;ref name="FT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LBO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALI"/&gt;
The ISDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isda.org|title=ISDA |date=April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported in April 2007 that total notional amount on outstanding credit derivatives was $35.1 trillion with a gross [[market value]] of $948 billion ([http://www.isda.org ISDA's Website]). As reported in ''[[The Times]]'' on September 15, 2008, the "Worldwide credit derivatives market is valued at $62 trillion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4761839.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Dow dives as Federal Reserve lines up 75bn emergency loan for AIG | date=September 16, 2008 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 | first1=Patrick | last1=Hosking | first2=Miles | last2=Costello | first3=Marcus | last3=Leroux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the credit [[derivatives market]] is a global one, London has a market share of about 40%, with the rest of Europe having about 10%.&lt;ref name="BBACDR" /&gt;

The main market participants are banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and other corporates.&lt;ref name="BBACDR" /&gt;

== Types ==
Credit derivatives are fundamentally divided into two categories: funded credit derivatives and unfunded credit derivatives.

An '''unfunded credit derivative''' is a bilateral contract between two counterparties, where each party is responsible for making its payments under the contract (i.e., payments of premiums and any cash or physical settlement amount) itself without recourse to other assets.

A '''funded credit derivative''' involves the protection seller (the party that assumes the credit risk) making an initial payment that is used to settle any potential credit events. (The protection buyer, however, still may be exposed to the ''credit risk'' of the ''protection seller'' itself. This is known as counterparty risk.)

Unfunded credit derivative products include the following products:
* [[Credit default swap]] (CDS)
* [[Total return swap]]
* [[Constant maturity credit default swap]] (CMCDS)
* First to Default Credit Default Swap
* Portfolio Credit Default Swap
* Secured Loan Credit Default Swap
* Credit Default Swap on Asset Backed Securities
* Credit default [[swaption]]
* Recovery lock transaction
* Credit Spread Option
* CDS index products

Funded credit derivative products include the following products:
* [[Credit-linked note]] (CLN)
* Synthetic [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO)
* [[Constant Proportion Debt Obligation]] (CPDO)
* Synthetic [[constant proportion portfolio insurance]] (Synthetic CPPI)

=== Key unfunded credit derivative products ===

==== Credit default swap ====
{{Main|Credit default swap}}
The credit default swap or CDS has become the cornerstone product of the credit derivatives market.  This product represents over thirty percent of the credit derivatives market.&lt;ref name="BBACDR"/&gt;

The product has many variations, including where there is a basket or portfolio of reference entities, although fundamentally, the principles remain the same.  A powerful recent variation has been gathering market share of late: credit default swaps which relate to asset-backed securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last1=Parker |first1=Edmund |last2=Piracci |first2=Jamila |url=http://www.mayerbrown.com/london/article.asp?id=3517&amp;nid=1575|title=Documenting credit default swaps on asset backed securities |publisher=Mayer Brown |date=April 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521170516/http://www.mayerbrown.com/london/article.asp?id=3517&amp;nid=1575 |archivedate=May 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Total return swap ====
{{Main|Total return swap}}

=== Key funded credit derivative products ===

==== Credit linked notes ====
[[Image:Securitization-en.PNG|thumb|RIGHT|400px|In this example coupons from the bank's portfolio of loans are passed to the SPV which uses the cash flow to service the credit linked notes.]]
A credit linked note is a note whose cash flow depends upon an event, which may be a default, change in credit spread, or rating change. The definition of the relevant credit events must be negotiated by the parties to the note.

A CLN in effect combines a credit-default swap with a regular note (with coupon, maturity, redemption).  Given its note-like features, a CLN is an on-balance-sheet asset, in contrast to a CDS.

Typically, an investment fund manager will purchase such a note to hedge against possible down grades, or loan defaults.

Numerous different types of credit linked notes (CLNs) have been structured and placed in the past few years. Here we are going to provide an overview rather than a detailed account of these instruments.

The most basic CLN consists of a bond, issued by a well-rated borrower, packaged with a credit default swap on a less creditworthy risk.

For example, a bank may sell some of its exposure to a particular emerging country by issuing a bond linked to that country's default or convertibility risk. From the bank's point of view, this achieves the purpose of reducing its exposure to that risk, as it will not need to reimburse all or part of the note if a credit event occurs. However, from the point of view of investors, the risk profile is different from that of the bonds issued by the country. If the bank runs into difficulty, their investments will suffer even if the country is still performing well.

The credit rating is improved by using a proportion of government bonds, which means the CLN investor receives an enhanced coupon.

Through the use of a credit default swap, the bank receives some recompense if the reference credit defaults.

There are several different types of securitized product, which have a credit dimension.
* [[Credit-linked note]]s (CLN): Credit-linked note is a generic name related to any bond whose value is linked to the performance of a reference asset, or assets. This link may be through the use of a credit derivative, but does not have to be.
* [[Collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO): Generic term for a bond issued against a mixed pool of assets—there also exists [[CDO-Squared]] (CDO^2) where the underlying assets are CDO tranches.
* [[Collateralized bond obligation]]s (CBO): Bond issued against a pool of bond assets or other securities. It is referred to in a generic sense as a CDO
* [[Collateralized loan obligation]]s (CLO): Bond issued against a pool of bank loan. It is referred to in a generic sense as a '''CDO'''

CDO refers either to the pool of assets used to support the CLNs or the CLNs themselves.

==== Collateralized debt obligations  ====
{{main|collateralized debt obligation}}
Not all collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are credit derivatives. For example, a CDO made up of loans is merely a securitizing of loans that is then tranched based on its credit rating. This particular securitization is known as a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and the investor receives the cash flow that accompanies the paying of the debtor to the creditor. Essentially, a CDO is held up by a pool of assets that generate cash.  A CDO only becomes a derivative when it is used in conjunction with credit default swaps (CDS), in which case it becomes a [[Synthetic CDO]]. The main difference between CDOs and derivatives is that a derivative is essentially a bilateral agreement in which the payout occurs during a specific event which is tied to the underlying asset.

Other more complicated CDOs have been developed where each underlying credit risk is itself a CDO [[tranche]]. These CDOs are commonly known as CDOs-squared.

== Pricing ==
Pricing of credit derivative is not an easy process.&lt;ref name = "Secret Liens"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1323190 "Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008"], American Bankruptcy Law Journal 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is because:
* The complexity in monitoring the market price of the underlying credit obligation.
* Understanding the creditworthiness of a debtor is often a cumbersome task as it is not easily quantifiable.
* The incidence of default is not a frequent phenomenon and makes it difficult for the investors to find the empirical data of a solvent company with respect to default.
* Even though one can take help of different ratings published by ranking agencies but often these ratings will be different.

== Risks ==
Risks involving credit derivatives are a concern among regulators of financial markets.  The [[US Federal Reserve]] issued several statements in the Fall of 2005 about these risks, and highlighted the growing backlog of confirmations for credit derivatives trades.  These backlogs pose risks to the market (both in theory and in all likelihood), and they exacerbate other risks in the financial system.&lt;ref name="Secret Liens" /&gt;   One challenge in [[regulation|regulating]] these and other derivatives is that the people who know most about them also typically have a vested [[incentive]] in encouraging their growth and lack of regulation. Incentive may be indirect, e.g., academics have not only consulting incentives, but also incentives in keeping open doors for research.

'''The Digital Media Advertising Creative Showcase (DMACS)''' was a Los Angeles, California based organization that recognized creative talent in digital and rich media marketing for the entertainment industry. The DMACS provided a showcase for digital advertising and explored the tops trends in digital marketing.

== History ==
The DMACS was first held in May 2006 (and was then called the I.M.A.C.S.). The showcase grew into a more formal awards show in 2009. In 2010, the awards were retired.&lt;ref&gt;https://134west.wordpress.com/2010/10/14/dmacs-awards/&lt;/ref&gt;

The DMAC awards were awarded for ads or a set of rich media ads used to promote these five categories:

*	Theatrical Release Rich Media Ad(s)
*	Home Entertainment Release Rich Media Ad(s)
*	Broadcast Television Launch Rich Media Ad(s)
*	Video Game Release Rich Media Ad(s)
*	Multi-Channel Cross Media Campaign

Additionally, the DMACS presented a YouTube Creative Award for any home entertainment, theatrical movie, video game or broadcast television program campaign creative that included YouTube in its execution.
The awards ceremony was held in October at the Director’s Guild in Los Angeles. The DMACS 2010 was sponsored by Doubleclick by Google.

[[File:Electrolysis Apparatus.png|thumb|Illustration of an electrolysis apparatus used in a school laboratory.]]
In [[chemistry]] and [[manufacturing]], '''electrolysis''' is a technique that uses a [[Direct current|direct]] [[electric current]] (DC) to drive an otherwise non-spontaneous chemical reaction. Electrolysis is commercially important as a stage in the [[#Industrial uses|separation]] of [[chemical element|elements]] from naturally occurring sources such as [[ores]] using an [[electrolytic cell]]. The [[voltage]] that is needed for electrolysis to occur is called the [[decomposition potential]].

==History==
The word "electrolysis" was introduced by [[Michael Faraday]] in the 19th century, on the suggestion of the Rev. [[William Whewell]], using the [[Greek language|Greek]] words {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} {{IPA-el|ɛ̌ːlektron|}} "amber", which since the 17th century was associated with [[electricity|electric phenomena]], and ''{{lang|grc|λύσις}}'' {{IPA-el|lýsis|}} meaning "dissolution". Nevertheless, electrolysis, as a tool to study chemical reactions and obtain pure [[chemical element|elements]], precedes the coinage of the term and formal description by Faraday.
* 1785 – [[Martinus van Marum]]'s electrostatic generator was used to reduce [[tin]], [[zinc]], and [[antimony]] from their salts using electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;The Supplement (1803 edition) to Encyclopædia Britannica 3rd edition (1797), volume 1, page 225, "Mister Van Marum, by means of his great electrical machine, decomposed the calces of tin, zinc, and antimony, and resolved them into their respective metals and oxygen" and gives as a reference Journal de Physiques, 1785.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1800 – [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Carlisle]] (view also [[Johann Ritter]]), decomposed [[water]] into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].
* 1808 – [[Potassium]] (1807), [[sodium]] (1807), [[barium]], [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] were discovered by [[Sir Humphry Davy#Electrolysis|Sir Humphry Davy]] using electrolysis.
* 1821 – [[Lithium]] was discovered by the English chemist [[William Thomas Brande]], who obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide.
* 1833 – [[Michael Faraday]] develops his [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|two laws of electrolysis]], and provides a mathematical explanation of his laws.
* 1875 – [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] discovered [[gallium]] using electrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Crookes, William |title=The Chemical news and journal of industrial science; with which is incorporated the "Chemical gazette.": A journal of practical chemistry in all its applications to pharmacy, arts and manufactures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgDOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA294|accessdate=27 February 2011|year=1875|publisher=Chemical news office.|pages=294–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1886 – [[Fluorine]] was discovered by [[Henri Moissan]] using electrolysis.
* 1886 – [[Hall–Héroult process]] developed for making [[aluminium]]
* 1890 – [[Castner–Kellner process]] developed for making [[sodium hydroxide]]

==Overview==
Electrolysis is the passing of a [[Direct current|direct]] [[electric current]] through an [[ion]]ic substance that is either molten or dissolved in a suitable solvent, producing chemical reactions at the electrodes and a separation of the materials.

The main components required to achieve electrolysis are:
* An [[electrolyte]]: a [[Chemical substance|substance]], frequently an ion-conducting [[polymer]] that contains free [[ion]]s, which carry [[electric current]] in the [[electrolyte]].  If the [[ion]]s are not mobile, as in most solid [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, then electrolysis cannot occur.
* A [[direct current]] (DC) electrical supply: provides the [[energy]] necessary to create or discharge the [[ion]]s in the [[electrolyte]]. Electric current is carried by [[electron]]s in the external circuit.
* Two [[electrode]]s: [[electrical conductor]]s that provide the physical interface between the [[electrolyte]] and the [[electrical circuit]] that provides the [[energy]].

Electrodes of [[metal]], [[graphite]] and [[semiconductor]] material are widely used. Choice of suitable electrode depends on chemical reactivity between the electrode and electrolyte and manufacturing cost.

===Process of electrolysis===
The key process of electrolysis is the interchange of atoms and ions by the removal or addition of electrons from the external circuit. The desired products of electrolysis are often in a different physical state from the electrolyte and can be removed by some physical processes. For example, in the electrolysis of [[brine]] to produce hydrogen and chlorine, the products are gaseous. These gaseous products bubble from the electrolyte and are collected.&lt;ref name="Tilley2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tilley, R. J. D. |title=Understanding solids: the science of materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFZ0guoKD1QC&amp;pg=PA281|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-85276-7|pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 NaCl + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 NaOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A liquid containing electrolyte is produced by:
* [[Solvation]] or reaction of an [[ionic compound]] with a [[solvent]] (such as water) to produce mobile ions
* An ionic compound is melted by heating

An electrical potential is applied across a pair of [[electrode]]s immersed in the electrolyte. &lt;!--
Many people misunderstand these definitions and think they should be the other way round. Please read the [[electrode]] article before trying to 'correct' them. Also see the [[anode]] and [[cathode]] articles. The definition is: "The anode is now defined as the electrode at which electrons leave the cell and oxidation occurs, and the cathode as the electrode at which electrons enter the cell and reduction occurs." For electrolysis, this means the anode is the positive electrode and the cathode is the negative electrode. The positively-charged ions move towards the negative electrode, the cathode. The negatively-charged ions move towards the positive electrode, the anode. --&gt;

Each electrode attracts ions that are of the opposite [[Electric charge|charge]]. Positively charged ions ([[cation]]s) move towards the electron-providing (negative) cathode. Negatively charged ions ([[anion]]s) move towards the electron-extracting (positive) anode.

In this process [[electron]]s are either absorbed or released. Neutral atoms gain or lose electrons and become charged ions that then pass into the electrolyte. The formation of uncharged atoms from ions is called discharging. When an ion gains or loses enough electrons to become uncharged (neutral) atoms, the newly formed atoms separate from the electrolyte. Positive metal ions like Cu&lt;sup&gt;++  &lt;/sup&gt;deposit onto the cathode in a layer. The terms for this are [[electroplating]], [[electrowinning]], and [[electrorefining]].  When an ion gains or loses electrons without becoming neutral, its electronic charge is altered in the process. In chemistry, the loss of electrons is called [[Oxidation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;, while electron gain is called reduction.

===Oxidation and reduction at the electrodes===
[[Oxidation]] of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the [[anode]]. For example, it is possible to oxidize ferrous ions to ferric ions at the anode:
: Fe{{su|p = 2+}}(aq) → Fe{{su|p = 3+}}(aq) + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
[[Redox|Reduction]] of ions or neutral molecules occurs at the [[cathode]].

It is possible to reduce [[ferricyanide]] ions to [[ferrocyanide]] ions at the cathode:
:Fe(CN){{su|p=3-|b=6}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Fe(CN){{su|p=4-|b=6}}

Neutral molecules can also react at either of the electrodes. For example: p-Benzoquinone can be reduced to hydroquinone at the cathode:

[[Image:P-Benzochinon.svg|35px]] + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → [[Image:Hydrochinon2.svg]]

In the last example, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (hydrogen ions) also take part in the reaction, and are provided by an acid in the solution, or by the solvent itself (water, methanol etc.). Electrolysis reactions involving H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are fairly common in acidic solutions. In aqueous alkaline  solutions, reactions involving OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (hydroxide ions) are common.

Sometimes the solvents themselves (usually water) are oxidized or reduced at the electrodes. It is even possible to have electrolysis involving gases. Such as when using a [[Gas diffusion electrode]].

===Energy changes during electrolysis===
The amount of electrical energy that must be added equals the change in [[Gibbs free energy]] of the reaction plus the losses in the system. The losses can (in theory) be arbitrarily close to zero, so the maximum [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] efficiency equals the [[enthalpy]] change divided by the free energy change of the reaction. In most cases, the electric input is larger than the enthalpy change of the reaction, so some energy is released in the form of heat. In some cases, for instance, in the electrolysis of [[steam]] into hydrogen and oxygen at high temperature, the opposite is true and heat energy is absorbed. This heat is absorbed from the surroundings, and the [[heating value]] of the produced hydrogen is higher than the electric input.

===Related techniques===
The following techniques are related to electrolysis:
* [[Electrochemical cell]]s, including the hydrogen [[fuel cell]], use differences in [[Standard electrode potential]] to generate an electrical potential that provides useful power. Though related via the interaction of ions and electrodes, electrolysis and the operation of electrochemical cells are quite distinct. However, a chemical cell should ''not'' be seen as performing ''electrolysis in reverse''.

==Faraday's laws of electrolysis==
{{main|Faraday's laws of electrolysis}}

===First law of electrolysis===
In 1832, Michael Faraday reported that the quantity of elements separated by passing an electric current through a molten or dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] is proportional to the quantity of electric charge passed through the circuit. This became the basis of the first law of electrolysis:
:&lt;math&gt;m = k \cdot q&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;m = e \cdot Q&lt;/math&gt;

where;
e is known as electrochemical equivalent of the metal deposited or of the gas liberated at the electrode.

===Second law of electrolysis===
Faraday discovered that when the same amount of current is passed through different electrolytes/elements connected in series, the mass of substance liberated/deposited at the electrodes  is directly proportional to their [[equivalent weight]].

==Industrial uses==
[[Image:hall-heroult-kk-2008-12-31.png|thumb|[[Hall-Heroult process]] for producing [[aluminium]]]]
* [[Electrometallurgy]] is the process of reduction of metals from metallic compounds to obtain the pure form of metal using electrolysis. [[Aluminium]], [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and in some cases [[copper]], are produced in this way.
* Production of [[chlorine]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]
* Production of [[sodium chlorate]] and [[potassium chlorate]]
* Production of perfluorinated organic compounds such as [[trifluoroacetic acid]] by the process of [[electrofluorination]]
* Production of [[Copper extraction techniques#Electrorefining|electrolytic copper]] as a [[cathode]], from refined [[copper]] of lower purity as an [[anode]].

Electrolysis has many other uses:
* Production of [[oxygen]] for [[spacecraft]] and [[nuclear submarines]].
* Production of [[hydrogen]] for fuel, using a cheap source of electrical energy.

Electrolysis is also used in the cleaning and preservation of old artifacts. Because the process separates the non-metallic particles from the metallic ones, it is very useful for cleaning a wide variety of metallic objects, from old coins to even larger objects including [[rust]]ed [[cast iron]] [[cylinder block]]s and [[cylinder head|heads]] when rebuilding automobile engines. [[Rust removal]] from small iron or steel objects by electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket, [[tap water]], lengths of [[rebar]], [[Sodium carbonate|washing soda]], [[baling wire]], and a [[battery charger]].&lt;ref name="antique-engines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rust Removal using Electrolysis|url=http://antique-engines.com/electrol.asp|website=antique-engines.com|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing processes===
In manufacturing, electrolysis can be used for:
* [[Electroplating]], where a thin film of metal is deposited over a substrate material. Electroplating is used in many industries for either functional or decorative purposes, as in vehicle bodies and nickel coins.
* [[Electrochemical machining]] (ECM), where an electrolytic cathode is used as a shaped tool for removing material by anodic oxidation from a workpiece. ECM is often used as technique for [[Burr (edge)|deburring]] or for etching metal surfaces like tools or knives with a permanent mark or logo.

==Competing half-reactions in solution electrolysis==
Using a cell containing inert platinum electrodes, electrolysis of aqueous solutions of some salts leads to reduction of the cations (e.g., metal deposition with, e.g., zinc salts) and oxidation of the anions (e.g. evolution of bromine with bromides). However, with salts of some metals (e.g. sodium) hydrogen is evolved at the cathode, and for salts containing some anions (e.g. sulfate SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) oxygen is evolved at the anode. In both cases this is due to water being reduced to form hydrogen or oxidized to form oxygen.
In principle the voltage required to electrolyze a salt solution can be derived from the [[standard electrode potential]] for the reactions at the anode and cathode. The [[standard electrode potential]] is directly related to the [[Gibbs free energy]], ΔG, for the reactions at each electrode and refers to an electrode with no current flowing. An extract from the [[table of standard electrode potentials]] is shown below.

In terms of electrolysis, this table should be interpreted as follows:
* Oxidized species (often a cation) with a more negative cell potential are more difficult to reduce than oxidized species with a more positive cell potential. For example, it is more difficult to reduce a sodium ion to a sodium metal than it is to reduce a zinc ion to a zinc metal.
* Reduced species (often an anion) with a more positive cell potential are more difficult to oxidize than reduced species with a more negative cell potential. For example, it is more difficult to oxidize sulfate anions than it is to oxidize bromide anions.

Using the [[Nernst equation]] the [[electrode potential]] can be calculated for a specific concentration of ions, temperature and the number of electrons involved. For pure water ([[pH]] 7):
* the electrode potential for the reduction producing hydrogen is −0.41 V
* the electrode potential for the oxidation producing oxygen is +0.82 V.
Comparable figures calculated in a similar way, for 1M [[zinc bromide]], ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are −0.76 V for the reduction to Zn metal and +1.10 V for the oxidation producing bromine.
The conclusion from these figures is that hydrogen should be produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode from the electrolysis of water—which is at variance with the experimental observation that zinc metal is deposited and bromine is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, A.E. (1951), ''A textbook of Quantitative Inorganic Analysis'', Longmans, Green and Co&lt;/ref&gt;
The explanation is that these calculated potentials only indicate the thermodynamically preferred reaction. In practice many other factors have to be taken into account such as the kinetics of some of the reaction steps involved. These factors together mean that a higher potential is required for the reduction and oxidation of water than predicted, and these are termed [[overpotential]]s. Experimentally it is known that [[overpotential]]s depend on the design of the cell and the nature of the electrodes.

For the electrolysis of a neutral (pH 7) sodium chloride solution, the reduction of sodium ion is thermodynamically very difficult and water is reduced evolving hydrogen leaving hydroxide ions in solution. At the anode the oxidation of chlorine is observed rather than the oxidation of water since the overpotential for the oxidation of [[chloride]] to [[chlorine]] is lower than the overpotential for the oxidation of [[water]] to [[oxygen]]. The [[hydroxide ion]]s and dissolved [[chlorine]] gas react further to form [[hypochlorous acid]]. The aqueous solutions resulting from this process is called [[electrolyzed water]] and is used as a disinfectant and cleaning agent.

===Electrolysis of acidified  water===
{{main|Electrolysis of water}}
Electrolysis of water produces [[hydrogen]].
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g); E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.229 V

The [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of water electrolysis varies widely. The efficiency of an electrolyser is a measure of the enthalpy contained in the hydrogen (to undergo combustion with oxygen, or some other later reaction), compared with the input electrical energy. Heat/enthalpy values for hydrogen are well published in science and engineering texts, as 144 MJ/kg.  Note that fuel cells (not electrolysers) cannot use this full amount of heat/enthalpy, which has led to some confusion when calculating efficiency values for both types of technology.  In the reaction, some energy is lost as heat. Some reports quote efficiencies between 50% and 70% for alkaline electrolysers; however, much higher practical efficiencies are available with the use of PEM ([[polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis|Polymer Electrolyte Membrane electrolysis]]) and catalytic technology, such as 95% efficiency.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmo|first=M|author2=Fritz D |author3=Mergel J |author4=Stolten D |title=A comprehensive review on PEM water electrolysis|journal=Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=38|issue=12|pages=4901|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[NREL]] estimated that 1&amp;nbsp;kg of hydrogen (roughly equivalent to 3&amp;nbsp;kg, or 4 L, of petroleum in energy terms) could be produced by wind powered electrolysis for between $5.55 in the near term and $2.27 in the long term.&lt;ref name="NRELElectrolysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39534.pdf |title=Wind Energy and Production of Hydrogen and Electricity – Opportunities for Renewable Hydrogen – Preprint |accessdate=20 October 2008 |author1=Levene, J.  |author2=Kroposki, B. |author3=Sverdrup, G. |date=March 2006 |format=PDF |work=National Renewable Energy Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 4% of hydrogen gas produced worldwide is generated by electrolysis, and normally used onsite. Hydrogen is used for the creation of ammonia for fertilizer via the [[Haber process]], and converting heavy petroleum sources to lighter fractions via [[hydrocracking]].

===Carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis===
{{main|Hydrogen production}}
Recently, to reduce the energy input, the utilization of carbon ([[coal]]), [[alcohol]]s (hydrocarbon solution), and organic solution ([[glycerol]], formic acid, [[ethylene glycol]], etc.) with co-electrolysis of water has been proposed as a viable option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.062|title=Electro-catalytic conversion of ethanol in solid electrolyte cells for distributed hydrogen generation|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=212|pages=744|year=2016|last1=Ju|first1=Hyungkuk|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit|last3=Badwal|first3=Sukhvinder P.S.|last4=Mulder|first4=Roger J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon/hydrocarbon assisted water electrolysis (so-called CAWE) process for hydrogen generation would perform this operation in a single [[electrochemical]] reactor. This system energy balance can be required only around 40% electric input with 60% coming from the chemical energy of carbon or hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.033|title=Low emission hydrogen generation through carbon assisted electrolysis|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=40|pages=70|year=2015|last1=Giddey|first1=S.|last2=Kulkarni|first2=A.|last3=Badwal|first3=S.P.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process utilizes solid coal/carbon particles or powder as fuels dispersed in acid/alkaline electrolyte in the form of slurry and the carbon contained source co-assist in the electrolysis process as following theoretical overall reactions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.03.195|title=Role of iron species as mediator in a PEM based carbon-water co-electrolysis for cost-effective hydrogen production|journal=

&lt;/ref&gt;:

Carbon/Coal slurry (C + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) -&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;      E' = 0.21 V (reversible voltage) / E' = 0.46 V (thermo-neutral voltage)

or

Carbon/Coal slurry (C + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) -&gt; CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;         E' = 0.52 V reversible voltage) / E' = 0.91 V (thermo-neutral voltage)

Thus, this CAWE approach is that the actual cell overpotential can be significantly reduced to below 1 V as compared to 1.5 V for conventional water electrolysis.

===Electrocrystallization===
A specialized application of electrolysis involves the growth of conductive crystals on one of the electrodes from oxidized or reduced species that are generated in situ.  The technique has been used to obtain single crystals of low-dimensional electrical conductors, such as [[charge-transfer salt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja00399a065|title=Superconductivity in an organic solid.

During 2016–2017, the restaurant saw a period of unrest, when it was alleged that 31 waiters were fired after attempting to form a union, and the restaurant counter-claimed that the terminated employees had defrauded it of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In October 2017, a settlement was agreed to give the fired workers the opportunity to return to their jobs if they wished, and to give them back pay from the date of their firing. The settlement came about days before the issue was due to come to trial following a decision by the [[National Labor Relations Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/nyregion/ellens-stardust-diner-labor-dispute.html |title=Singing Waiters, Once Fired, Will Hit the Red Vinyl Stage Again |last=Maslin Nir |first=Sarah |author-link=Sarah Maslin Nir |date=4 October 2017 |website=[[NYTimes.com]] |access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Energy Park.JPG|thumb|Energy Park from the Hamline Avenue pedestrian bridge]]
'''Energy Park''' is a large mixed-use project in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]'s Midway district that began in 1982. The area is bounded by Lexington Parkway on the East, [[BNSF]] railroad tracks on the south and Canadian Pacific tracks on the North and [[Snelling Avenue]] on the West. It has industrial, commercial, and residential uses. Though not typical of any projects in the Twin Cities, Energy Park is a quintessential 1980s development activity.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Paul planners were determined to turn a liability - more than 200 acres of largely disused railroad land in the heart of the city - into an asset. Energy Park was intended as a model urban environment, a product of the mid 1970s' energy crisis. Energy conservation was its theme: people would live and work within the area, most jobs would be energy related, and all buildings would be energy efficient. Little of this actually came to pass, and some critics would consider Energy Park a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 174&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the project received $12.1 million from the federal government as an [[Urban Development Action Grants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Phelps|title=Twin Cities are cited as evidence urban-development aid should end|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|date=February 6, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first few years were certainly not encouraging. Planning and start-up took much longer than municipal officials anticipated. The energy crisis appeared to have ended thus undermining the whole premise behind the "model urban environment". At the beginning [[Bandana Square]], the project's retail center, seemed to be a bust. The condominiums didn't sell well. Job growth, industrial tenants, housing construction - nothing went according to plan.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 174&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1985 Energy Park's future began to look brighter in 1989 was described as "plainly a success", even though it is not exactly what was planned. The first two phases of housing construction were completed and largely occupied. The industrial space was filling in although not all employment was energy related. [[Bandana Square]] seemed prosperous.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 174&lt;/ref&gt; The center would later be turned over to the Saint Paul Port Authority after it lost the Wilder Foundation $9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meryhew|first=Richard|title=Port Authority to take over Bandana Square|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=March 30, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy Park was not what city officials envisioned, but it is certainly far better than an abandoned railroad yard.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that contribute to the success of Energy Park include the Saint Paul Port Authority's economic strength and industrial marketing skills; the Planning Economic Development's staff creativity in packaging the deal and obtaining substantial and extraordinary federal aid; the involvements of the nonprofit Wilder Foundation in the housing and retail development, in cooperation with the Department of Planning Economic Development; the inclusion of representatives from several district councils in the project's planning; the various agencies' flexibility - including their ability to adapt to the loss of the project's original theme; and finally, [[George Latimer (Minnesota politician)|George Latimer]]'s leadership as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 175&lt;/ref&gt; The Wilder Foundation invested  $35 million in Energy Park retail, housing and office developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meryhew|first=Richard|last2=Lonetree|first2=Anthony|title=Bandana Square management seeks bailout|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=January 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minnesota Children's Museum]] was located in the neighborhood from 1985 to 1995.

==Career==
He was born in [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]], Germany, the son of Edward Oppenheimer, a [[cigar]] merchant. Oppenheimer began his working life at 17, when he entered Dunkelsbuhler &amp; Company, a diamond brokerage in [[London]]. His efforts impressed his employer and in 1902, at the age of 22, he was sent to South Africa to represent the [[company (law)|company]] as a buyer in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], where he eventually rose to the position of mayor.

He became great friends with William Lincoln Honnold, an American engineer and chairman of Transvaal Coal Trust, Brakpan Mines, Springs Mines and The New Era Company.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In 1917, they launched the Anglo American Corporation with financial assistance from [[J. P. Morgan]]. The initial capital was £1 million. Half of the capital was subscribed in America and half in England and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Oppenheimer, R. B. Hagart, W. D. Wilson, Francis Whitmore, H. MacConachie, Dr. J. E.

In 1927, Ernest Oppenheimer managed to wrest control of Cecil Rhodes's De Beers empire and built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the world's diamond industry until his retirement.

He was involved in a number of controversies, including price fixing, [[antitrust]] behaviour and an allegation of not releasing industrial diamonds for the US war effort during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raO8jHBdDhYC|title=Glitter &amp; Greed|author=Janine P.

He died in [[Johannesburg]] in 1957. He was born into a [[Jew]]ish family, but as an adult, he converted to [[Anglicanism]] and was buried at St George's Church, [[Parktown, Gauteng|Parktown]]. He was succeeded in the business by his son [[Harry Oppenheimer]]. Oppenheimer's brother, [[Bernard Oppenheimer|Sir Bernard Oppenheimer]], was also heavily involved in the diamond industry.

In 1964, the [[Oppenheimer Diamond]] was named in his honour by its owner, [[Harry Winston]], who donated the stone (not a [[Gemstone|gem]], as it remains uncut and unpolished) to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] as a memorial.

{{Refimprove|date=January 2014}}

A '''consumer good''' or '''final good''' is any [[commodity]] that is produced or consumed by the [[consumer]] to satisfy current wants or needs. Consumer goods are ultimately consumed, rather than used in the production of another good. For example, a [[microwave oven]] or a [[bicycle]] that is sold to a consumer is a final good or consumer good, but the components that are sold to be used in those goods are [[intermediate good]]s. For example, [[textile]]s or [[transistor]]s can be used to make some further goods.

When used in [[measures of national income and output]], the term "final goods" includes only new goods. For instance, the [[GDP]] excludes items counted in an earlier year to prevent [[double counting (accounting)|double counting]] of production that is based on resales of the same item. In that context, the economic definition of goods includes what are commonly known as ''[[service (economics)|services]]''.
 
''Manufactured goods'' are goods that have been processed in any way. As such, they are the opposite of [[raw material]]s, but they include intermediate goods as well as final goods.

== Law ==
There are legal definitions. For example, the United States Consumer Product Safety Act has an extensive definition of '''consumer product''', which begins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
CONSUMER PRODUCT.--The term ‘‘consumer product’’ means any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise; but such term does not include—
(A) any article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer,
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It then goes on to list eight additional specific exclusions and further details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/cpsa.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108013219/https://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/cpsa.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Durability ==
Final goods can be classified into the following categories:
#[[Durable goods]]
#[[Consumables|Nondurable goods]]
#Services

Consumer durable goods usually have a significant lifespan, which tends to be at least one year, based on the guarantee or warranty period. The maximum life depends upon the durability of the product or good. On the other hand, [[capital good]]s, which are tangible in nature, such as machinery or building or any other equipment that can be used in manufacturing of final product, are durable goods with limited lifespans that are determined by manufacturers before their sale. The longevity and the often-higher cost of durable goods usually cause consumers to postpone expenditures on them, which makes durables the most volatile (or cost-dependent) component of consumption.

Consumer nondurable goods are purchased for immediate use or for use very soon. Generally, the lifespan of nondurable goods is from a few minutes to up to three years: food, beverages, clothing, shoes and gasoline are examples.

Consumer services are the intangible in nature. They cannot be seen, felt or tasted by the consumer but still give satisfaction to the consumer. They are also inseparable and variable in nature: they are thus produced and consumed simultaneously. Examples are haircuts, auto repairs and landscaping.

== Buying habits ==
Final goods can be classified into the following categories, which are determined by the consumer's buying habits:
#Convenience goods 
#Shopping goods
#[[Speciality goods|Specialty goods]] 
#Unsought goods

=== Convenience goods ===
Convenience goods are regularly consumed and easily available. Generally, convenience goods come in the category of nondurable goods such as fast foods, cigarettes and tobacco with low value. Convenience goods are sold mostly by wholesalers or retailers to make them available to the consumers in good or large volume. Convenience goods can further be divided into staple convenience consumer goods and impulse convenience consumer goods.

Staple convenience consumer goods are the basic necessities of the consumer. These goods are easily available and in large quantity: milk, bread, sugar, etc.

Impulse convenience consumer goods do not belong to the priority list of the consumer. They are purchased without any prior planning, just on the basis of the [[impulse buying|impulse]]: potato wafers, candies, ice creams, cold drinks, etc.

=== Shopping consumer goods ===

Shopping consumer goods are the goods which take lot of time and proper planning before making purchase decision; in this case consumer does a lot of selection and comparison based on various parameters such as cost, brand, style, comfort etc., before buying an item. Shopping goods are costlier than convenience goods and are durable in nature. Consumer goods companies usually try to set up their shops and show rooms in active shopping area to attract customer attention and their main focus is to do lots of advertising and promotion so that to attract more customer.

Examples include clothing items, televisions, radios, footwear, home furnishings, etc.

=== Specialty consumer goods ===

Specialty goods are unique in nature; these are unusual and luxurious items available in the market. Specialty goods are mostly purchased by the upper class of the society as they are expensive in nature and difficult to be afforded by middle or lower-class people. Companies advertise their goods targeting the upper class. These goods do not fall under the category of necessity; rather they are purchased on the basis personal preference or desire. Brand name, uniqueness, and special features of an item are major attributes which attract customers and make them buy such products.

Examples include antiques, jewelry, wedding dresses, cars, etc.

=== Unsought consumer goods ===

Unsought goods neither belong to the necessity group of consumer goods list nor to specialty goods. They are always available in the market but are purchased by very few consumers, either based on their interest or their need for some specific reasons. The general public does not purchase such goods often.

Examples include [[snowshoe]]s, [[fire extinguisher]]s, [[flood insurance]], etc.

== Mergers and acquisitions ==

In the consumer product sector, there have been 107,891 deals announced between 1985 and 2018, which cumulates to a total value of around US$5,835 billion. 2007 was the year with the largest value (US$4,888 billion) followed by a steep slump in 2009 (-70.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first wave in 2007, now is the second big M&amp;A wave in the consumer products sector, and a decline is expected.

==Career==
Perdue Farms was founded in 1920 by [[Arthur Perdue]]&lt;ref name=Schmetterer/&gt; with his wife, Pearl Perdue who had been keeping a small flock of chickens.&lt;ref name=tl1920&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Now recognized as a visionary,&lt;ref name=Schmetterer/&gt; Frank Perdue's promotion of the Perdue brand through high-profile [[advertising]] resulted in its being the first well-known brand of chicken in the U.S.&lt;ref name="hawker"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/25perdue.html?ex=1293166800&amp;en=46defcb28cec5d04&amp;ei=5090|title=Chicken Hawker|date=December 25, 2005|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2007-09-25 | first=Joseph | last=Nocera}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He turned over leadership of Perdue Farms to his son, [[Jim Perdue]], in 1991.

Perdue Farms developed a specialized chicken-feed that included [[Tagetes|marigold]] blossoms, which imparted a characteristic golden yellow hue to the skins of his chickens.&lt;ref name="hawker"/&gt;

In the 1980s the visionary Perdue twice sought assistance from then-Mafia boss Paul Castellano Sr. to fend off a union's effort to represent workers at his company, according to a federal commission on labor corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ronald J.

==Advertising==
In 1971, Perdue Farm embarked on its first major advertising campaign and had contracted the firm of [[Scali, McCabe, Sloves]].&lt;ref name=Schmetterer&gt;{{cite book

Much of the commercials were known for Perdue actually encouraging people to voice any complaints or dissatisfaction with Perdue products, usually ending with Perdue stating "Say whatever you have to say; I can take it".&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/01/news/newsmakers/perdue/index.htm?cnn=yes|title=Frank Perdue dead at 84|date=2005-04-01|publisher=CNN/Money|accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this advertising, Perdue is credited with creating the first brand for chicken.&lt;ref name=Schmetterer/&gt;

==Death==
According to Perdue company officials, Perdue died on March 31, 2005, after a brief illness. He was 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wboc.com/story/3153624/poultry-magnate-frank-perdue-dies-at-84|title=Poultry Magnate Frank Perdue Dies at 84|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Salisbury_University#Perdue_School_of_Business|Franklin P. Perdue School of Business]] was established at [[Salisbury University]] in 1986 and named for Frank Perdue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisbury.edu/perdue/about.html Salisbury University] Franklin P. Perdue School of Business&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Félix Amiot (cropped).jpg|thumb|Félix Amiot in 1968]]
'''Félix Amiot''' (October 17, 1894 - December 21, 1974) was a French industrialist and aircraft constructor based in [[Colombes]], France. Some of the aircraft models he designed served in the French Air Force during the Second World War. His second industrial activity was shipbuilding for fishing boats, sailing and warship in [[Cherbourg]]. He became famous for designing and producing Missile Boat (Fast attack craft) type "Combattante" which he sold worldwide.
==Biography==

Born in a small shopkeepers' family, his father being a grocer, Félix Amiot spent his childhood in Cherbourg, where he studied at the local public High School: Lycée Victor Grignard. During his childhood, he became passionate about mechanics and aviation. In 1908, his family left Cherbourg to settle down in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], in the Paris suburbs, where the pioneers of the French aviation - [[Blériot Aéronautique|Blériot]], [[Voisin]], the brothers [[Farman]] – had built aviation sheds and proceeded to flying trials of their engines on a nearby exercise ground.
The proximity of the site was a strong inspiration for Amiot. In 1912, at the age of 18, he built his first plane in a garage near the training ground of [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]]. It was a two-seater monoplane, named after him: Amiot 01. In spite of the short-lived existence of this plane, damaged during a flight in 1913, Félix Amiot persevered with designing new planes.
In September, 1913, he registered his first patent for a "distribution system for fixed or rotary 2 or 4 times combustion engines ".

In September, 1914, Félix Amiot served in the army and was sent to the war front, where he stayed until October, 1915. He was then requested to work for [[Morane-Saulnier]], away from the front lines. He developed an assembly process for metallic parts using a stamping technic. The aircraft industry was very interested by the development of this technology, it attracted the attention of Louis Loucheur who was at the time, Secretary of Armaments. Loucheur suggested that Amiot become director of an  aircraft manufacturing factory. [[Pierre Wertheimer]], owner of [[Chanel]] and [[Bourjois]], financed Amiot's first company: "La Société d'Emboutissage et de Constructions Mécaniques" (SECM), based Avenue des Ternes, in Paris. SECM fabricated and repaired [[Morane-Saulnier]], [[Breguet Aviation|Breguet]] or [[Sopwith Aviation Company|Sopwith]] planes.
At the end of 1917, a second workshop was created in [[Colombes]].

In 1919, the SECM left the workshop at avenue des Ternes to settle down in a brand new factory in Colombes, in the close suburbs of Paris. In 1921, the SECM launched a design cabinet and began developing light passenger aircraft while at the same time, manufacturing planes under license - [[Breguet XIV]], [[Breguet XIX]], [[Farman F.50|Farman F. 50]], [[Dewoitine D.1|Dewoitine D1]]...
In 1926, the SECM produced [[Amiot 120]] among which the military by-product, Amiot 122, which was the first plane of the firm to be ordered in series by the French Army. The model became famous in 1927 and 1928 for a series of successful raids - Circuit of the Mediterranean Sea and Saharan circuit - and a double attempt, with an Amiot 123, at crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 1928 and 1929, piloted by the Polish crew - Idzikowski and Kubala&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.
In 1928, in order to increase his activity, Félix Amiot acquired the seaplanes firm  [[Société Latham|Latham]], based in Caudebec-en-Caux.
In 1929, the SECM merged with several aircraft manufacturers around [[Lorraine-Dietrich]] to form the "Société Générale Aéronautique" (SGA). The brother Wertheimer and Amiot, as well as the shareholders, won impressive dividends. But in 1934, the company faced financial crisis. To avoid bankruptcy, the French State authorized Amiot and [[Bloch]] to buy back the bankrupt company. Amiot and the brother Wertheimer acquired it for a small amount of money.

In 1937, the SECM was partially nationalized : the Colombes factory was kept by Amiot, whereas Caudebec-en-Caux became a state owned company, becoming the [[SNCAN]]. To compensate for loss, Félix Amiot created in 1938 a new factory in his hometown [[Cherbourg]].
At Colombes and Cherbourg, he developed the [[Amiot 340]], 350 and 370, a series of bombers succeeding Amiot 143 which he had just produced in series for the French Air Force. These new models broke several records and acquired recognition :
- September 1937 to August 1939: an Amiot 370 piloted by Commander Maurice Rossi, broke a series of speed records for 1 000km , 2 000km and 5 000 Km distance with different loads of 500, 1000 and 2000 kilos.
- August 1938: the prototype Amiot 340 was chosen by General [[Vuillemin]], Chief of  Air Force Staff, on a diplomatic visit to Berlin.
- From 1938: the French Air Force ordered 1 800 Amiot 350 and by-products. The SECM received numerous requests to acquire the manufacturing license.
However, the planes mass production was affected by Amiot's bad relations with the   Air Ministry, and the constant technical changes required by the [[STAé]] - Service technique de l'Aéronautique. In January, 1939, [[Pierre Wertheimer]] left for the United States, aiming at establishing a factory in New-Orleans&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''WWII'''

In June 1940, the brother Wertheimer left urgently France for Brazil, then settled down in New-York, they asked Amiot to take care of their assets and business based in France and handed over to him all their SECM shares and majority stake in [[Chanel]] and [[Bourjois]] Perfumes. 
June 3rd 1940, in [[Le Bourget]], Amiot workshops were severely bombarded. Two days later, it was the turn of [[Cherbourg]]. On June 10th, Amiot evacuated his 3,000 workers staff to the south of France. He obtained 3 millions Francs from the government, then based in Bordeaux, in return for his pre-war orders. June 13th 1940, the French army, in violation with free city status, ordered the destruction by fire of the Colombes workshops. In retribution, the German Army occupied the factory which had been partially destroyed by the French army and looted by the German army, stole what was left and moved the workshop machines to [[Junkers]], a firm based in [[Dessau]] in Germany&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.

After the Armistice, Amiot repatriated his staff to Paris. "Though” as he wrote in his Memoirs from  the Occupation, “I managed to subtract the design office and to keep it in the free zone". In order to recuperate late payments and to be financed by the French state, he settled his company in Vichy.
From Vichy, Amiot contacted the Resistance, they advised him to pursue his activity. In 1940, the German state contacted Amiot to request [[Junkers]]' planes. Unsure if he bellshould comply to the German's request and collaborate, Amiot wrote to Marshall [[Pétain]] to ask for instructions. Forced to work for the German occupant, he decided however not to get personally involved and left his company's management with two orders. Firstly, to slow down production as much as possible without attracting the attention of the German Occupant and put his staff in danger. Secondly, to enrol everyone who would ask for work at the factory without any discrimination: [[Service du travail obligatoire|STO]] objectors, resistants, communists or French Jews who were in hide such as Marie-Claire Servan-Schreiber&lt;ref&gt;L'Esprit de liberté, avec Catherine David, Presses de la Renaissance, 1992 ({{ISBN|2856166547}})&lt;/ref&gt;.
Amiot reconstituted a factory in Marseille and employed numerous workers who wanted to escape the STO (forced labour in Germany).  After the war, his behaviour was taken in consideration when his case was examined to assess his collaboration with the German forces.

In the spring 1942, Amiot employees aimed at recreating the industrial activity which was been disrupted by the war. They turned to Pierre Wertheimer, who, in the meanwhile, had become administrator to the aircraft manufacturer Bell in the United States. It was impossible to coordinate the two companies as they tried to establish a squadron at the colours of Free France in North Africa. Félix Amiot personally financed a resistance network which clandestinely helped 10 persons to escape to North Africa and sent information to the Allies. Unfortunately, the network was dismantled in May 1943, leading to the arrest by the Gestapo of Yves Maurice, head of design and close collaborator to Amiot, in Perpignan&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, Amiot was busy defending the interests of the Wertheimer brothers, he bought back their Perfume and beauty companies. At the end of the War, when Chanel and Bourjois accounts were settled, the Wertheimer brothers contested  Amiot's decision. Amiot had made fake documents to prove that the Wertheimer companies complied with aryan regulations imposed by the Nazi regime, whereas at the same time associating himself with [[Junkers Flugzeug und Motorenwerke AG|Junkers Flugzeug-und-Motorenwerke]] to build  370 [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport planes. After the Liberation, the Colombes company built its devices under the name AAC 01 Toucan. Amiot was questioned by the Gestapo, in September 1942. Amiot had held back the management of the Wertheimer's factories, in spite of [[Coco Chanel]]'s attempts to take control of the Perfumes bearing her name, helped by the relations she had with the Occupation German authorities&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Hal (2011). Sleeping with the Enemy: Coco Chanel's Secret War. New York: Knopf. {{ISBN|978-0-307-59263-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Soon after the Liberation of Paris, Amiot received [[General Bradley]] at his castle of Boissière-Beauchamps in Lévis-Saint-Nom. Amiot sent a telegram to the Wertheimer brothers informing them of the liberation of France from Nazi Germany&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Patart, ''L’aventure Amiot-CMN, des hommes, le ciel et la mer.'', Éditions des Champs, Bricqueboscq, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;.

After the war, [[Pierre Wertheimer]] launched judicial procedures against Amiot to recover some benefits. Amiot at the end of the war was in good financial situation. However, he was arrested on the 6th of September 1944 with the direction of the SECM accused of collaboration and "antisocial conduct". Quickly released, the charged were abandoned in 1947, after the tribunal cleared his name. The SECM, which had been requisitioned in 1944, was nationalised in 1946, through a private sale to the Government, ending its aeronautics activities.

'''After WWII'''

Amiot dedicated himself to the reconstruction of his factory in Cherbourg, which became the "[[Constructions Mécaniques de Normandie]]" (CMN) developing into  shipbuilding.
In 1948, the CMN launched their first ship : the trawler "Annie" for the "Chalutiers Cherbourgeois" ' fleet, taken back by Félix Amiot in 1946. He built various types of light military ships, minesweepers and mine hunters, patrol boats...

He was also interested in the sailing market, which started booming and produced the Maïca's series, long-distance yachts using glued laminated timber technology,  which had been designed by English naval architects [[John Illingworth (yacht designer)|John Illingworth]] and Angus Primrose, it became famous during the Fastnet race.
CMN shipbuildings counted among his customers known skippers such as [[Olivier de Kersauson]] or [[Eric Tabarly]]. A skilful businessman, Amiot conceived [[La Combattante class fast attack craft|La Combattante-class]], a missile-boat which was exported all over the world thanks to a good market analysis.

A few of his missile-boats became part of the famous event known as the [[Cherbourg Project|boats of Cherbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;Justin Lecarpentier, Rapt à Cherbourg : l'affaire des vedettes israéliennes, L'Ancre de Marine, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-2-84141-240-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;. On 1969 Christmas Christmas eve, 5 boats were illegally delivered to Israel, breaking the French embargo proclaimed by the General [[de Gaulle]] in 1969&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich The Boats of Cherbourg Bluejacket Books {{ISBN|1-55750-714-7}} {{ISBN|978-1557507143}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Amiot was then 75 years old.

Félix Amiot was also a talented engineer-inventor who holds 100 patents to his name. One of the most important one is the stamping technology used to assemble metallic parts. Another one is the 1950 patent related to the improvement of fish preservation. At the beginning of 1950s, he worked on improving deep-sea trawlers. In 1960, he became one of the first in France to develop a licence for rear operating trawlers boats.

At his death on the 21st of December 1974, Félix Amiot left a worldwide recognised company employing more than 1,400 workers with booking orders for the 4 years to come. He was buried at [[Lévis-Saint-Nom]] cemetery, near his Boissière-Beauchamps property mansion.

{{George H. W. Bush series}}
'''George Herbert Walker Bush''' (June 12, 1924&amp;nbsp;– November 30, 2018) was an [[American politician]] who served as the 41st [[President of the United States]] from 1989 to 1993. Prior to assuming the presidency, Bush served as the 43rd [[Vice President of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989. As a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he had previously been a [[U.S. Representative]], Ambassador, and [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. During his career in [[public service]], he was known simply as George Bush; after his eldest son [[George W. Bush]] became President of the United States in 2001, he was referred to as "George H. W. Bush", "Bush 41", or "George Bush Sr."

A scion of the [[Bush family]], he was born in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], to [[Prescott Bush]] and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] on his 18th birthday, and became one of the youngest [[Naval aviation|aviator]]s in the U.S. Navy. He served until September 1945, and then attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1948, he moved his family to [[West Texas]], where he entered the [[oil business]] and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964.

Soon after founding his own oil company, Bush became involved in politics. He was defeated in his first election, for the U.S. Senate [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1964|in 1964]], but won election to the House of Representatives from [[Texas's 7th congressional district|Texas's 7th district]] [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1966#Texas|in 1966]]. He was re-elected in 1968 but was defeated for election to the Senate again [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1970|in 1970]]. In 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Bush as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], and in 1973, Bush became the [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]]. The following year, President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Bush as [[List of ambassadors of the United States to China#List of Chiefs of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing|Chief of the Liaison Office]] in [[China]] and later made Bush the [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. Bush ran for president in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] and was defeated in the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|Republican primary]] by [[Ronald Reagan]], who chose him as his running mate in his successful bid for presidency. During his eight-year tenure as Vice President, Bush headed task forces on deregulation and the [[war on drugs]].

Bush ran [[George H. W. Bush presidential campaign, 1988|a successful campaign]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent [[Michael Dukakis]], becoming the first [[incumbent]] vice president in 152 years to be elected president. [[Foreign policy]] drove the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush presidency]]: [[Military operation]]s were conducted in [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]] and [[Gulf War|the Persian Gulf]]; the [[Berlin Wall]] fell in 1989, and the [[Soviet Union]] dissolved two years later. Bush also signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which created a [[trade bloc]] consisting of the United States, [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]. Domestically, Bush [[Read my lips: no new taxes|reneged on a 1988 campaign promise]] and signed a bill to increase taxes. In the wake of a weak recovery from an [[Early 1990s recession|economic recession]] and the diminution of foreign policy as a major issue in a post-[[Cold War]] [[political climate]], he lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]].

After leaving office in 1993, Bush was active—often alongside his former opponent [[Bill Clinton]]—in humanitarian activities. With George W. Bush's victory in the 2000 presidential election, Bush and his son became the second father–son pair to serve as president, following [[John Adams]] and [[John Quincy Adams]]. Bush's second son, [[Jeb Bush]], served as the [[List of Governors of Florida|43rd]] Governor of Florida and sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

Bush [[Death and state funeral of George H. W. Bush|died]] on November 30, 2018, at the age of {{Age in years and days nts|1924|06|12|2018|11|30}}. He has the distinction of being the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]] in American history. &lt;!-- If Jimmy Carter is still alive on March 21, 2019, change the final sentence to: At the time of his death he was the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]] in American history, a record surpassed by Jimmy Carter on March 21, 2019. --&gt;

George Herbert Walker Bush was born at 173 Adams Street in [[Milton, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidentialavenue.com/gb.cfm |title=Presidential Avenue: George Bush |access-date=March 29, 2008 |publisher=Presidential Avenue|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008144507/http://www.presidentialavenue.com/gb.cfm|archive-date=October 8, 2007|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; on June 12, 1924, to [[Prescott Bush|Prescott Sheldon Bush]] and Dorothy (Walker) Bush. The Bush family moved from Milton to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], shortly after his birth. Bush was named after his maternal grandfather, George Herbert Walker, who was known as "Pop". In turn, Bush was called "Poppy" as a tribute to his namesake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eun Kyung Kim |url=http://www.today.com/parents/jenna-bush-hager-welcomes-second-daughter-named-after-george-h-t31121 |title=Jenna Bush Hager welcomes second daughter&amp;nbsp;— named after George H.W.

Bush began his formal education at the [[Greenwich Country Day School]] in Greenwich. Beginning in 1938, he attended [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], where he held a number of leadership positions that included president of the senior class, secretary of the student council, president of the community fund-raising group, a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper, and captain of both the varsity baseball and soccer teams.&lt;ref name="andover"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm |title=Former President George Bush honored at his 60th reunion at Phillips Academy, Andover |date=June 8, 2002 |access-date=March 29, 2008 |publisher=Phillips Academy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401131455/http://www.andover.edu/news/bush.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bush's promotion to [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] on August 1, 1944, ''San Jacinto'' commenced operations against the Japanese in the [[Bonin Islands]]. Bush piloted one of four [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman TBM Avenger]]s of VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on [[Chichijima]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0312/20/cp.00.html Story of George H.

After Bush received his military discharge, he enrolled at [[Yale University]]. He earned an undergraduate degree in economics on an accelerated program that enabled him to graduate in two and a half years, rather than the usual four.&lt;ref name=GHWBlifebefore /&gt; He was a member of the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity and was elected its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/books/41-george-w-bushs-portrait-of-george-h-w-bush.html |title=Love Flows, President to President |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 11, 2014 |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |access-date=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also captained the Yale baseball team and played in the first two [[College World Series]] as a left-handed [[first baseman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=School House to White House: The Education of the Presidents |url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2007/spring/schoolhouse.html |date=Spring 2007 |publisher=National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was the team captain during his senior year in 1948, and he met [[Babe Ruth]] before a game; the event took place only weeks before Ruth's death.

==Business career==

==Early political career (1963–1980)==
===Congressional years (1967–1971)===
[[File:George H. W. Bush 91st Congress.jpg|thumb|Bush in 1969]]

Bush's career in politics began in 1963 when he was elected chairman of the [[Harris County, Texas]] Republican Party. The following year, he ran against incumbent Democrat [[Ralph Yarborough|Ralph W. Yarborough]] in the [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1964|U.S. Senate race]]. He presented himself as a young Conservative Republican in contrast to the aging liberal Democrat Yarborough. He campaigned against civil rights legislation pending before Congress, stating that he believed it gave too much power to the federal government.&lt;ref name=GHWVB&gt;{{cite book |last=Naftali |first=Timothy |date=2007 |title=George H.

Bush and the Harris County Republicans played a role in the development of the new Republican Party of the late 20th century. First, Bush worked to absorb the [[John Birch Society]] members, who were trying to take over the Republican Party. Second, during and after the [[civil rights movement]], Democrats in the South who were committed to [[racial segregation|segregation]] left their party, and although the "country club Republicans" had differing ideological beliefs, they found common ground in hoping to expel the Democrats from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/bush-transcript/ |title=Program Transcript.

President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Bush to be Chief of the [[De facto embassy#China and the United States|U.S. Liaison Office]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Since the United States maintained diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] instead of the People's Republic of China, Bush did not hold the [[diplomatic rank]] of ambassador. However, Bush acted like an ambassador anyway, ignoring instructions from [[Henry Kissinger]] to stay away from diplomatic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George H.

After Ford assumed the presidency, Bush was under serious consideration for being nominated as vice president. Ford eventually narrowed his list to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and Bush. [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] reportedly preferred Rockefeller over Bush.

==1980 presidential campaign==
{{See also|1980 United States presidential election}}
[[File:Bush80.gif|thumb|right|1980 campaign logo]]
Bush decided in the late 1970s that he was going to run for president in 1980; in 1979, he attended 850 political events ("[[Audition|cattle calls]]") and traveled more than {{convert|250000|mi|km}} to campaign for the nation's highest office. In the contest for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination, Bush stressed his wide range of government experience, while competing against rivals Senator [[Howard Baker]] of Tennessee, Senator [[Bob Dole]] of Kansas, Congressman [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] of Illinois (who would later run as an independent), Congressman [[Phil Crane]], also of Illinois, former Governor [[John Connally]] of Texas, former Minnesota Governor [[Harold Stassen]], and the front-runner [[Ronald Reagan]], a  noted former actor and the former [[Governor of California]].&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

[[File:Reagan-Bush Nashua 1980 debate.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Reagan, moderator John Breen, and Bush participate in the Nashua, New Hampshire Presidential Debate, 1980]]
At the outset of the [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|1980 primary race]], Bush focused heavily on winning the January 21 [[Iowa caucuses]], including 31 visits to the state; five months earlier he had won the [[Iowa Straw Poll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Noble |first=Jason |date=November 30, 2018 |title=George H.W.

Bush represented the centrist wing in the GOP, whereas Reagan represented conservatives. Bush famously labeled Reagan's [[supply-side economics|supply side]]-influenced plans for massive [[tax cut]]s "[[Reaganomics|voodoo economics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Neikirk |first=William R. |date=March 13, 1988 |title=Bush conjures up voodoo economics |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-03-13-8802290552-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His strategy proved useful, to some degree, as he won in Iowa with 31.5% to Reagan's 29.4%.

As a result of the loss, Reagan replaced his [[campaign manager]], reorganized his staff, and concentrated on the [[New Hampshire primary]]. The two men agreed to a debate in the state, organized by ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Nashua Telegraph]]'', but paid for by the Reagan campaign. Reagan invited the other four candidates as well, but Bush refused to debate them, and eventually they left. The debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign; when the moderator, John Breen, ordered Reagan's microphone turned off, his angry response, "I am paying for this microphone," struck a chord with the public. Bush ended up losing New Hampshire's primary with 23% to Reagan's 50%. Bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well, and formally dropped out of the race in May of that year.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

With his political future in doubt, Bush sold his house in Houston and bought his grandfather's estate in [[Kennebunkport, Maine|Kennebunkport]], Maine, known as "Walker's Point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/08/us/white-house-letter-at-parents-home-bush-resumes-role-of-son.html|work=The New York Times |access-date=April 2, 2008 |date=July 8, 2002 |last=Bumiller |first=Elisabeth |title=White House Letter; At Parents' Home, Bush Resumes Role of Son}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1980 Republican National Convention|Republican Convention]], Reagan made the last-minute decision to select Bush as his vice presidential nominee, placing him on the winning [[1980 United States presidential election|Republican presidential ticket of 1980]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allen |first=Richard V. |date=July 30, 2000 |title=George Herbert Walker Bush; The Accidental Vice President |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/30/magazine/george-herbert-walker-bush-the-accidental-vice-president.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cannon |first1=Lou |last2=Broder |first2=David S. |date=July 17, 1980 |title=Reagan Nominated, Picks Bush |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/07/17/reagan-nominated-picks-bush/a1badab9-a12b-4e7f-86a2-1bde75e03346/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.1a4d799ce2a2 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vice presidency (1981–1989)==
{{See also|Presidency of Ronald Reagan}}

===First term, 1981–1985===
As vice president, Bush generally maintained a typically low profile while he recognized the constitutional limits of the office; he avoided decision-making or criticizing Reagan in any way. As had become customary, he and his wife moved into the Vice President's residence at [[Number One Observatory Circle]], about two miles from the [[White House]]. After selling the house in [[Tanglewood, Houston|Tanglewood]], the Bushes declared a room in [[The Houstonian Hotel]] in [[Houston]] as their official voting address.&lt;ref name=Hickey /&gt; The Bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions, including many [[state funeral]]s, which became a common joke for comedians. Mrs. Bush found the funerals largely beneficial, saying, "George met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended, enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to President Reagan." As the [[Vice President of the United States#Roles of the vice president|President of the Senate]], Bush stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

[[File:Vice President George H. W. Bush portrait.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Vice President Bush official portrait (1981)]]
On March 30, 1981 (early into the administration), [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|Reagan was shot]] and seriously wounded by [[John Hinckley Jr.]] in Washington, D.C. Bush was in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and immediately flew back to Washington D.C. because he was next in line to the presidency. Reagan's cabinet convened in the White House [[Situation Room]], where they discussed various issues, including the availability of the "[[nuclear football]]". When Bush's plane landed, he was advised by his aides to proceed directly to the White House by helicopter as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack. Bush rejected the idea, responding, "Only the President lands on the South Lawn."&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; This made a positive impression on Reagan,&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; who recovered and returned to work within two weeks. From then on, the two men would have regular Thursday lunches in the [[Oval Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bumiller |first=Elisabeth |date=June 9, 2004 |title=The 40th President: Between 2 First Families, A Complicated Rapport |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/09/us/40th-president-presidential-relations-between-2-first-families-complicated.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1982, Bush toured [[Africa]], the first instance of a high United States government official visiting the continent since the Reagan administration began. Bush told reporters that while he would allow for heads of state to dictate how each meeting would transpire, there was an expectation on his part for discussions on the independence of [[Namibia]], adding that the United States was going to retain the position of no settlement in Namibia until Cuban troops in [[Angola]] were withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/10/Vice-President-George-Bush-acting-as-the-presidents-personal/4018405752400/ |title=Vice President George Bush, acting as the president's personal... |first=Jim |last=Anderson |date=November 10, 1982 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, Bush met with [[United States Secretary of State]] [[George P. Shultz]] and [[Yuri Andropov]] in Moscow, Russia, to discuss human rights and arms reductions. Bush later said, "The meeting was frank, cordial and substantive. It gave both sides the opportunity to exchange views on the state of their relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/15/Vice-President-George-Bush-and-Secretary-of-State-George/2659406184400/ |title=Vice President George Bush and Secretary of State George... |first=Steven R. |last=Reed |date=November 15, 1982 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of January 1983, Bush began a seven-day tour of [[Western Europe]] intended to promote the arms reduction commitment being advocated for by the Reagan administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/31/world/bush-starts-7-nation-trip-in-bonn-aim-is-to-reassure-allies-on-arms.html |title=Bush Starts 7-Nation Trip In Bonn; Aim Is To Reassure Allies On Arms |date=January 31, 1983 |first=James M. |last=Markham |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a February 8 news conference in Paris, Bush said the United States' invitations for the Soviet Union to consent to a reduction in medium-range missiles were supported by Western Europe, which he stated had also consented to the deployment of new American missiles starting in the latter part of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/09/world/bush-in-paris-says-allies-commitment-on-missiles-remains-firm.html |title=Bush, In Paris, Says Allies' Commitment On Missiles Remains Firm |first=John |last=Vinocur |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Bush defended American nuclear arms policy when answering British Secretary General of the Committee on Nuclear Disarmament [[Bruce Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/world/bush-in-london-challenged-by-nuclear-foe.html |title=Bush, In London, Challenged By Nuclear Foe |first=John |last=Vinocur |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1983, Bush met with [[President of Romania]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], insisting during the meeting that President Reagan intended to push for arms reductions at the Geneva talks with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/18/Vice-President-George-Bush-met-Sunday-with-President-Nicholae/1371432705600/ |title=Vice President George Bush met Sunday with President Nicholae... |first=Cathy |last=Booth |date=September 18, 1983 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Bush said the United States wanted better relations with all countries within the [[Eastern Bloc]] though he stressed that NATO would retaliate in the event of any threatening of European military stability by the Soviets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/19/Vice-President-George-Bush-Monday-praised-Communist-Hungarys-human/2242432792000/ |title=Vice President George Bush Monday praised Communist Hungary's human... |first=Ruth E. |last=Gruber |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the vice president assailed the Soviet Union for the [[Berlin Wall]] and destroying the [[Korean Airlines Flight 007|Korean Air Lines jetliner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/09/21/Vice-President-George-Bush-today-accused-the-Soviet-Union/1835432964800/ |title=Vice President George Bush today accused the Soviet Union... |first=Ruth E. |last=Gruber |date=September 21, 1983 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1983 Bush flew to [[El Salvador]] and warned that country's military leaders to end their [[death squad]]s and hold fully free elections or face the loss of U.S. aid. "It is not just the President, it is not just me or the Congress.

Bush was assigned by Reagan to chair two special task forces, on [[deregulation]] and international drug smuggling. The deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules, making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise, in order to curb the size of the federal government. The drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the United States. Both were popular issues with conservatives, and Bush, largely a moderate, began courting them through his work.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

On June 14, 1984, Bush cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate in favor of the 10-warhead [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/14/Vice-President-George-Bush-cast-a-dramatic-tie-breaking-vote/3222456033600/ |title=Vice President George Bush cast a dramatic, tie-breaking vote... |first=Eliot |last=Brenner |date=June 14, 1984 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan and Bush [[1984 United States presidential election|ran for reelection in 1984]]. Their [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, [[Walter Mondale]], made history by choosing a woman, New York Representative [[Geraldine Ferraro]], as his running mate. She and Bush squared off in [[United States vice-presidential debate, 1984|a single televised vice presidential debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=27 |title=Bush-Ferraro Vice-Presidential Debate |date=October 11, 1984 |access-date=April 3, 2008 |publisher=The American Presidency Project |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617164446/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showdebate.php?debateid=27 |archivedate=June 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferraro served as a contrast to the Ivy-League educated Bush; she represented a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] district in [[Queens]], New York. This distinction and her popularity among female journalists left Bush at a disadvantage. Regardless, the Reagan-Bush ticket won in a landslide against the Mondale-Ferraro ticket. Early into his second term as vice president, Bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in 1988. By the end of 1985, a committee had been established and over two million dollars were raised for Bush.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

On July 13, 1985, Bush became the first vice president to serve as [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]] when Reagan underwent surgery to remove [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] from his [[Large intestine|colon]]; Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyd |first=Gerald M. |date=July 14, 1985 |title=Reagan Transfers Power to Bush For 8-Hour Period of 'Incapacity' |page=A1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/14/us/reagan-transfers-power-to-bush-for-8-hour-period-of-incapacity.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Reagan administration was shaken by a scandal when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to Iran. The officials had used the proceeds to fund the anti-communist [[Contras]] in Nicaragua, which was a direct violation of law. The scandal became known as the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. When news of the public embarrassment broke to the media, Bush, like Reagan, stated that he had been "out of the loop" and unaware of the diversion of funds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/iran-transcript.html |title=Transcript |work=The New York Times |date=June 30, 1997 |access-date=April 2, 2008 |format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this was later questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On |date=November 20, 2006 |access-date=April 3, 2008 |publisher=George Washington University}}&lt;/ref&gt; His diaries from that time stated "I'm one of the few people that know fully the details" and as a result of six pardons by Bush, the independent counsel's final report on the Iran–Contra affair pointedly noted: "The criminal investigation of Bush was regrettably incomplete."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB210/index.htm |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On |publisher=Gwu.edu |access-date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1986, Bush outlined the government's policy on the combating of terrorism. In an interagency task force report presented to President Reagan, Bush publicly stated that the strategy of the federal government was to retaliate without "wantonly" terminating human lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/07/world/bush-issuing-terror-report-affirms-current-us-policies.html |title=Bush, Issuing Terror Report, Affirms Current U.S. Policies |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1985, Bush had been planning a presidential run; he entered the Republican primary for President of the United States in October 1987.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U.S. Senator [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], U.S. Representative [[Jack Kemp]] of New York, former Governor [[Pete du Pont]] of [[Delaware]], and conservative Christian [[Televangelism|televangelist]] [[Pat Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shogan |first=Robert |date=February 9, 1988 |title=Politics 88 : Dole, Gephardt Win; Bush Third : Robertson Is a Surprise 2nd in GOP Polling |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-09/news/mn-41620_1_george-bush |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dionne Jr. |first=E.

Bush was considered the early frontrunner for the nomination, but he came in third in the Iowa caucus, behind winner Dole and runner-up Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/10/us/bush-and-simon-seen-as-hobbled-by-iowa-s-voting.html |title=Bush and Simon Seen as Hobbled by Iowa's Voting |date=February 10, 1988 |access-date=April 4, 2008 |work=The New York Times |first=R.

Apple Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as Reagan had done in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; With Dole ahead in New Hampshire, Bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;display_order=1&amp;content_type_id=57687&amp;mini_id=57351 |title=New Hampshire: Picking a President |publisher=The History Channel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424102704/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&amp;display_order=1&amp;content_type_id=57687&amp;mini_id=57351 |archivedate=April 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; he rebounded to win the state's primary. Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had anything to say to Bush, Dole said, in response to the ads, "yeah, stop lying about my record!" in an angry tone. This is thought to have hurt Dole's campaign to Bush's benefit. Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; Once the multiple-state primaries such as [[Super Tuesday]] began, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt;

As the [[1988 Republican National Convention]] approached, there was much speculation who Bush would choose to be his running mate. He selected little-known U.S. Senator [[Dan Quayle]] of [[Indiana]], who was favored by conservatives. Despite Reagan's popularity, Bush trailed Democratic nominee [[Michael Dukakis]], then [[Governor of Massachusetts]], in most polls.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/news/national/election2000/conventions/past.bushsenior.html |title=1988: George H. W. Bush Gives the 'Speech of his Life' |publisher=NPR |year=2000 |access-date=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush was occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to Reagan, but he delivered a well-received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention. Known as the "[[thousand points of light]]" speech, the presentation described Bush's vision of America. He endorsed the [[Pledge of Allegiance]], [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], and [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|gun rights]], and drew upon his long-standing Christian beliefs to support both [[school prayer|prayer in schools]] and [[United States anti-abortion movement|oppose abortion]].&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; The speech at the convention included Bush's famous pledge: "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/9/newsid_3655000/3655368.stm |title=1988: Bush wins with 'no new taxes' promise |access-date=April 4, 2008 |date=November 9, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElectoralCollege1988.svg|thumb|left|The 1988 presidential electoral votes by state]]
The general election campaign between the two men was described in 2008 as one of the dirtiest in modern times.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Bush blamed Dukakis for polluting the [[Boston Harbor]] as the Governor of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; Bush also pointed out that Dukakis was opposed to a law that would require all students to say the Pledge of Allegiance, a topic well covered in Bush's nomination acceptance speech.&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

Dukakis's unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates. Moderator [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]] asked Dukakis if he would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife, [[Kitty Dukakis|Kitty]], were raped and murdered.&lt;ref name="kittyd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debates.org/pages/trans88b.html |title=The Second Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate |date=October 13, 1988 |publisher=[[Commission on Presidential Debates]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406032116/http://www.debates.org/pages/trans88b.html |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dukakis's response of no, as well as a provocative ad about convicted felon [[Willie Horton]], contributed toward Bush's characterization of Dukakis as "soft on crime".&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt;

Bush defeated Dukakis and his running mate, [[Lloyd Bentsen]], in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], by 426 to 111 (Bentsen received one vote from a [[faithless elector]]).&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In the nationwide popular vote, Bush took 53.4% of the ballots cast while Dukakis received 45.6%.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; Bush became the first serving vice president to be elected president since [[Martin Van Buren]] in 1836 as well as the first person to succeed someone from his own party to the presidency via election to the office in his own right since [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

Early in his term, Bush faced the problem of what to do with leftover [[National debt of the United States|deficits]] spawned during the Reagan years. At $220&amp;nbsp;billion in 1990, the deficit had tripled since 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the [[101st United States Congress|Democratic controlled Congress]] to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut [[government spending]], and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to [[income tax|raise taxes]], Bush faced problems when it came to consensus building.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt;

In the wake of a struggle with Congress, Bush was forced by the Democratic majority to raise tax revenues; as a result, many Republicans felt betrayed because Bush had promised "no new taxes" in his 1988 campaign. Perceiving a means of revenge, Republican congressmen defeated Bush's proposal, which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500&amp;nbsp;billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and more spending, which alienated him from Republicans and gave way to a sharp [[United States presidential approval rating|decrease in popularity]]. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Near the end of the [[101st United States Congress|101st Congress]], the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the [[capital gains tax]], Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be a turning point in the Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt;

Coming at around the same time as the budget deal, America entered into a mild recession, lasting for six months. Many government programs, such as welfare, increased.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; As the unemployment rate edged upward in 1991, Bush signed a bill providing additional benefits for unemployed workers.&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; The year 1991 was marked by many corporate reorganizations, which laid off a substantial number of workers. Many now unemployed were Republicans and independents, who had believed that their jobs were secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Locin |first1=Mitchell |last2=Thomas |first2=Karen M. |date=October 2, 1991 |title=As politicians fight, jobless get angrier |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-10-02-9103300224-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By his second year in office, Bush was told by his economic advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he had done everything necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported that 14.2% of all Americans [[Poverty|lived in poverty]].&lt;ref name="ea" /&gt; At a press conference in 1990, Bush told reporters that he found foreign policy more enjoyable.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt;

[[File:Bush I approval rating.png|thumb|left|Bush's approval ratings (red) compared to his disapproval ratings (blue) for his four-year presidency]]

In the [[1990 State of the Union Address]], Bush revealed his interest in his administration spearheading the increase in American high school graduation rates to 90% along with making American students "first in the world" in the subjects of math and science by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/31/Highlights-of-President-Bushs-State-of-the-Union-speech/3977633762000/ |title=Highlights of President Bush's State of the Union speech |date=January 31, 2006 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/31/Bush-urges-deeper-troop-cuts-in-State-of-the-Union/9454633762000/ |title=Bush urges deeper troop cuts in State of the Union |first=Norman D. |last=Sandler |date=January 31, 1990 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in the White House East Room on April 18, 1991, Bush called for both public and private citizens to become involved with education reform: "To those who want to see real improvement in American education, I say there will be no renaissance without revolution. It's time we held our schools, and ourselves, accountable for results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/11/25/Bush-makes-plug-for-troubled-schools/2906250094671/ |title=Bush presents education reform package |first=Janet |last=Bass |date=April 19, 1991 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, Bush advocated for community participation in reforming the national education system and insisting America 2000 would fail "if we try to do it from Washington itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/3054 |title=Remarks to Education Leaders |quote=So, what we talk about in the America 2000 strategy, you put into action.

Bush became a life member of the [[National Rifle Association]] early in 1988 and had campaigned as a "pro-gun" candidate with the NRA's endorsement.&lt;ref name="Feldman2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Ricochet: Confessions of a Gun Lobbyist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zi5yAwWxa50C |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-13100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1989, he placed a temporary ban on the import of certain semiautomatic rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law |volume=1 |first=Gregg Lee |last=Carter |page=38 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-57607-268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action cost him endorsement from the NRA in 1992. Bush publicly resigned his life membership in the organization after receiving a form letter from the NRA depicting agents of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] as "jack-booted thugs." He called the NRA letter a "vicious slander on good people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Moral controversies in American politics: cases in social regulatory policy |first=Raymond |last=Tatalovich |author2=Byron W.

===Points of Light===
{{Main|Points of Light}}
President Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. He often used the "[[thousand points of light]]" theme to describe the power of citizens to solve community problems. In his 1989 inaugural address, President Bush said, "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good."&lt;ref name="President's Report"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Points of Light Movement: The President's Report to the Nation |publisher=Executive Office of the President, 1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Points_of_light_movement.html?id=cH8vlwSAjv0C |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StromThurmond GeorgeBush.jpg|thumb|left|President Bush presents Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in a ceremony in the Oval Office.]]

Four years later, in his report to the nation on The Points of Light Movement, President Bush said, "Points of Light are the soul of America. They are ordinary people who reach beyond themselves to touch the lives of those in need, bringing hope and opportunity, care and friendship. By giving so generously of themselves, these remarkable individuals show us not only what is best in our heritage but what all of us are called to become."&lt;ref name="President's Report" /&gt;

In 1990, the Points of Light Foundation was created as a nonprofit organization in Washington to promote this spirit of [[Volunteering|volunteerism]].&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perry |first=Suzanne |title=After Two Tough Years, New Points of Light Charity Emerges |journal=Chronicle of Philanthropy |date=October 15, 2009 |url=http://philanthropy.com/article/After-Two-Tough-Years-New/57753/ |access-date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Points of Light Foundation merged with the [[Hands on Network]] with the goal of strengthening volunteerism, streamlining costs and services and deepening impact.&lt;ref name=Edward&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edward |first=Deborah |title=Getting to Yes: The Points of Light and Hands On Network Merger |journal=RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service, the University of Texas at Austin |year=2008 |url=http://www.rgkcenter.org/sites/default/files/file/research/gettingtoyes.pdf |access-date=May 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061145/http://www.rgkcenter.org/sites/default/files/file/research/gettingtoyes.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Points of Light]], the organization created through this merger, has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies dedicated to volunteer service around the world. In 2012, Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth $635 million.&lt;ref name="Year in Review"&gt;{{cite web |title=Points of Light 2012 Year in Review |url=http://www.pointsoflight.org/sites/default/files/site-content/files/pol_endofyearappeal_5x8_webversion.pdf |publisher=Points of Light |access-date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] held a Presidential Forum on Service hosted by former President George H. W. Bush and Points of Light at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] Center on the campus of [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. The event celebrated the contributions of more than 4,500 Daily Point of Light award winners and honored President Bush's legacy of service and civic engagement.&lt;ref name="Presidential Forum"&gt;{{cite news |title=President Obama to Hold Presidential Forum on Service Hosted by former President George H.W.

In 2011, Points of Light paid tribute to President George H. W. Bush and volunteer service at Washington, D.C.'s [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]].

===Daily Point of Light Award===
President Bush created the Daily Point of Light Award in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems. The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations, both to honor them for their tremendous work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts. By the end of his administration, President Bush had recognized 1,020 Daily Points of Light representing all 50 states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for the [[Homelessness|homeless]].&lt;ref name="President's Report" /&gt; The Daily Point of Light continues to be awarded by Points of Light; up until his death President Bush continued to sign all of the awards.&lt;ref name=Leader-Telegram&gt;{{cite news |title=Health Matters 07/10/13 |url=http://www.leadertelegram.com/features/health/article_59336b2a-6092-5baa-b8c0-dab07e3ea301.html |access-date=July 11, 2013 |newspaper=Leader-Telegram |date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial appointments===
{{see also|George H. W. Bush Supreme Court candidates|List of federal judges appointed by George H. W. Bush}}
Bush made two appointments to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]&amp;nbsp;— [[David Souter]] in 1990, and [[Clarence Thomas]] in 1991. Additionally, he appointed 42 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals]] and 148 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Among these was [[Vaughn Walker]], a gay man who ruled that California's [[2008 California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]] amendment was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=reuters_20110406&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Levine|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-gaymarriage-judge-idUSTRE7356TA20110406|agency=Reuters |title=Gay judge never considered dropping Prop 8 case|access-date=April 6, 2011|date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also experienced a number of [[George H.

[[File:George H. W. Bush on telephone.jpg|thumb|Bush speaks on the telephone regarding Operation Just Cause as General [[Brent Scowcroft]] and Chief of Staff [[John H. Sununu]] look on, 1989]]

In the 1980s, Panamanian leader [[Manuel Noriega]], a once U.S.-supportive leader who was later accused of spying for [[Fidel Castro]] and using Panama to traffic drugs into the United States, was one of the most recognizable names in America and was constantly in the press. The struggle to remove him from power began in the Reagan administration, when economic sanctions were imposed on the country; this included prohibiting American companies and government from making payments to Panama and freezing $56&amp;nbsp;million in Panamanian funds in American banks. Reagan sent more than 2,000 American troops to Panama as well.&lt;ref name="rutgers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~hbf/panama.htm |title=Panama: Background and Buildup to Invasion of 1989 |access-date=April 11, 2008 |author=Franklin, Jane |year=2001 |publisher=Rutgers University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Reagan, Bush was able to remove Noriega from power, but his administration's unsuccessful post-invasion planning hindered the needs of Panama during the establishment of the young democratic government.&lt;ref name="texas"&gt;{{cite web |title=Prudence in Panama: George H.

In May 1989, Panama held democratic elections, in which [[Guillermo Endara]] was elected president; the results were then annulled by Noriega's government. In response, Bush sent 2,000 more troops to the country, where they began conducting regular military exercises in Panamanian territory (in violation of prior treaties). Bush then removed an embassy and [[Ambassadors of the United States|ambassador]] from the country, and dispatched additional troops to Panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion.&lt;ref name="rutgers" /&gt; Noriega suppressed an October [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempt and massive protests in Panama against him, but after a U.S. serviceman was shot by Panamanian forces in December 1989, Bush ordered 24,000 troops into the country with an objective of removing Noriega from power;&lt;ref name="secdef"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/cheney.htm |title=Richard B.

[[File:Bush Gorba P15623-25A.jpg|thumb|left|Bush and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in Helsinki summit in 1990]]

In 1989, just after the [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]], Bush met with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in [[Malta Summit|a conference]] on the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]]. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the [[Malta Summit]] to be a step in the right direction; General [[Brent Scowcroft]], among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be "premature" due to concerns where, according to [[Condoleezza Rice]], "expectations [would be] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [the U.S.] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." But European leaders, including [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev,&lt;ref name="dr rice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-24/rice1.html |publisher=George Washington University |access-date=April 11, 2008 |title=Interview with Dr. Condoleezza Rice |date=December 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that he did on December 2 and 3, 1989. Although no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation... This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/04/world/the-malta-summit-transcript-of-the-bush-gorbachev-news-conference-in-malta.html |title=The Malta Summit; Transcript of the Bush-Gorbachev News Conference in Malta |agency=Associated Press |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 11, 2008 |date=December 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting was received as a very important step to the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_4119000/4119950.stm |title=1989: Malta summit ends Cold War |access-date=April 11, 2008 |date=December 3, 1989 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another summit was held in July 1991, where the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I)]] was signed by Bush and Gorbachev in Moscow. The treaty took nine years in the making and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] by Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987. The contentions in START would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the USSR by about 35% over seven years, and the Soviet Union's land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s would be cut by 50%.

On August 2, 1990, Iraq, led by [[Saddam Hussein]], invaded its oil-rich neighbor to the south, [[Kuwait]]; Bush condemned the invasion&lt;ref name="pbs-gulfwar"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/cron/ |title=The Gulf War: A Chronology |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began rallying opposition to Iraq in the United States and among European, Asian, and Middle Eastern allies.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]; Fahd requested United States military aid in the matter, fearing a possible invasion of his country as well.&lt;ref name="pbs-gulfwar" /&gt; The request was met initially with [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] fighter jets. Iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal that would allow the country to take control of half of Kuwait.

Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. And American citizens abroad must be protected." He then outlined a fifth, long-term objective: "Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective&amp;nbsp;— a new world order&amp;nbsp;— can emerge: a new era&amp;nbsp;— freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony&amp;nbsp;... A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle.

Early on the morning of January 17, 1991, allied forces launched the first attack, which included more than 4,000 bombing runs by coalition aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/2625 Address to the Nation Announcing Allied Military Action in the Persian Gulf (January 16, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt; This pace would continue for the next four weeks, until a ground invasion was launched on February 24, 1991. Allied forces penetrated Iraqi lines and pushed toward [[Kuwait City]] while on the west side of the country, forces were intercepting the retreating Iraqi army. Bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere 100 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/2746 Address to the Nation on the Suspension of Allied Offensive Combat Operations in the Persian Gulf (February 27, 1991)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0227.html |title=Bush Halts Offensive Combat; Kuwait Freed, Iraqis Crushed |date=February 28, 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics labeled this decision premature, as hundreds of Iraqi forces were able to escape; Bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize U.S. casualties. Opponents further charged that Bush should have continued the attack, pushing Hussein's army back to Baghdad, then removing him from power.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the Iraqi government because it would have "incurred incalculable human and political costs...

Bush's approval ratings skyrocketed after the successful offensive.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Additionally, President Bush and Secretary of State Baker felt the coalition victory had increased U.S. prestige abroad and believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the coalition victory to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process. The administration immediately returned to Arab-Israeli peacemaking following the end of the Gulf War; this resulted in the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Conference]], later in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Middle East Review of International Affairs Journal Volume 6, No. 1 – March 2002 [http://www.rubincenter.org/2002/03/lasensky-2002-03-07/ Underwriting Peace in the Middle East: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Limits of Economic Inducements]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Somali Civil War====
{{Main|Somali Civil War}}
Faced with a humanitarian disaster in [[Somalia]] that was exacerbated by a complete breakdown in civil order, the United Nations had created the [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I|UNOSOM I]] mission in April 1992 to aid the situation through humanitarian efforts, though the mission failed.&lt;ref name=UNDP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosomi.htm |title=UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA I, UN Dept of Peacekeeping |publisher=United Nations |access-date=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush administration proposed American aid to the region by assisting in creating a secure environment for humanitarian efforts and UN Resolution 794 was unanimously adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] on December 3, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Security Council Resolution 794&lt;/ref&gt; A [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] president, Bush launched [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] the following day under which the United States would assume command in accordance with Resolution 794.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George H., Address to the Nation on the Situation in Somalia, 4/12/92&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting would escalate and continue into the Clinton administration.&lt;ref name=Atkinson94&gt;{{cite news |journal=The Washington Post ''(online, January 31)'' |author=Atkinson, Rick |date=1994 |title=Night of a Thousand Casualties |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/01/31/night-of-a-thousand-casualties/1f0c97b1-1605-46e5-9466-ba3599120c25/ | access-date=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Japan ====
During an April 28, 1989 appearance in the press room of the White House, Bush announced that the U.S. would continue a deal with Japan to produce the FSX advanced fighter jet. He said that promises had been made that American jobs and technology would be safe and the proposal would bolster security for both the U.S. and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-30/news/mn-2867_1_fsx-japan-s-ambassador-nobuo-matsunaga-japan-s-mitsubishi-heavy-industries |title=Bush Clears Way for FSX Fighter Deal With Japan |date=April 30, 1989 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, 1989, Bush signed a measure that guaranteed reparations to Japanese-Americans who were relocated into [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment camps]] during [[World War II]]. Congress authorized US$20,000 ({{Inflation|US|20000|1989|fmt=eq}}) for each survivor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-11-22/news/mn-164_1_bush-signs |title=Bush Signs Japanese-American Reparation Guarantee |date=November 22, 1989 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 1990, Bush met for an hour with former [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Noboru Takeshita]] to discuss shared economic issues and "the fact that their solution will require extraordinary efforts on both sides of the Pacific."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/03/12/Former-Japanese-Prime-Minister-Meets-Bush/7513637218000/ |title=Former Japanese Prime Minister Meets Bush |first=Norman D. |last=Sandler |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 1991, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] apologized to the United States for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The following day&amp;nbsp;— fiftieth anniversary of the attack&amp;nbsp;— Bush accepted Japan's apology for the event that drew the United States into World War II. Bush urged that progress be made in improving relations between the U.S. and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/12/07/Bush-says-US-appreciates-remorse-of-Japan/6434692082000/ |title=Bush says U.S. appreciates 'remorse' of Japan |publisher=UPI |date=December 7, 1991 |first=Thomas |last=Ferraro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
On June 18, 1990, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Marlin Fitzwater]] confirmed President Bush had sent [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Yitzhak Shamir]] a letter in which he congratulated the latter on his election and urged him to support the proposed "Shamir initiative for peace", which would involve the participation of Palestinian Arabians in local elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/06/18/Bush-congratulates-Shamir-pushes-peace-process/4351645681600/ |title=Bush congratulates Shamir, pushes peace process |publisher=UPI |date=June 18, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, Bush suspended American dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization for the latter's refusal to condemn the Palestinian guerrilla raid of an Israeli beach the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-21/news/mn-118_1_splinter-group |title=Bush Suspends Talks With PLO : Terrorism: President assails the organization's failure to denounce a splinter group's raid on an Israeli beach. |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=June 21, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1992, following a meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], Bush announced he would seek the approval of Congress to bestow Israel up to $10 billion in loan guarantees to assist the country with its absorbing of Soviet Union immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/12/Bush-strikes-Israel-loan-deal-with-Rabin/3144713592000/ |title=Bush strikes Irael loan deal with Rabin |first=Steven |last=Heilbronner |publisher=UPI |date=August 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/4655 |title=The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel in Kennebunkport |date=August 11, 1992 |quote=Literally hundreds of thousands of Jews from Ethiopia and from the former Soviet Union now make their homes in Israel; and this, more than anything else, is what the Jewish state is all about. In this regard, I am extremely pleased to announce that we were able to reach agreement on the basic principles to govern the granting of up to billion in loan guarantees. I've long been committed to supporting Israel in the historic task of absorbing immigrants, and I'm delighted that the Prime Minister and I have agreed to an approach which will assist these new Israelis without frustrating the search for peace. We can thus pursue these two humanitarian goals at one and the same time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NAFTA===
{{Main|North American Free Trade Agreement}}
[[File:Nafta.jpg|thumb|Standing: President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas]], President Bush, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]; Seated: [[Jaime Serra Puche]], [[Carla Anderson Hills|Carla Hills]], and [[Michael Wilson (Canadian politician)|Michael Wilson]] at the NAFTA Initialing Ceremony, October 1992]]
The Bush administration and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Brian Mulroney]] spearheaded the negotiations of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). The agreement would eliminate the majority of [[tariff]]s on products that were traded among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This would encourage trade among the countries. The treaty also restricted patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and outlined the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries.&lt;ref name="fedex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fedex.com/us/customersupport/ftn/faq/nafta.html?link=4 |publisher=Federal Express |title=Frequently Asked Questions: NAFTA |access-date=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush announced the completion of NAFTA during a Rose Garden appearance on August 12, 1992, calling it the "beginning of a new era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/08/12/Bush-announces-new-trade-pact-with-Mexico/2321509303014/ |title=Bush announces new trade pact with Mexico |first=Helen |last=Thomas |publisher=UPI |date=August 12, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA resulted in a loss of American jobs.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to Congress for a vote, thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change.&lt;ref name="nafta labor"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/nafta/nafta0401-04.htm |publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=April 11, 2008 |title=The NAFTA Labor Side Accord}}&lt;/ref&gt; While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/nafta.html |title=NAFTA |publisher=Duke University |access-date=July 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420094150/http://www.law.duke.edu/lib/researchguides/nafta.html |archive-date=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further. The American economy has grown 54% since the adoption of NAFTA in 1993, with 25&amp;nbsp;million new jobs created; this was seen by some as evidence of NAFTA being beneficial to the United States.&lt;ref name="wapo-nafta"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/29/AR2008022902608.html |title=Stop Hating on NAFTA |work=The Washington Post |author=Gutierrez, Carlos M |date=March 1, 2008 |access-date=April 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With talk in early 2008 regarding a possible American withdrawal from the treaty, [[Carlos Gutierrez|Carlos M. Gutierrez]], current [[United States Secretary of Commerce]], writes, "Quitting NAFTA would send economic shock waves throughout the world, and the damage would start here at home."&lt;ref name = "wapo-nafta" /&gt; But John J. Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, wrote in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' that "the [[Foreign trade of the United States|U.S. trade deficit]] with Canada and Mexico ballooned to twelve times its pre-NAFTA size, reaching $111&amp;nbsp;billion in 2004."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0321-31.htm |title=A Bad Deal on Free Trade |last=Sweeney |first=John J |work=The Boston Globe |access-date=April 11, 2008 |date=March 21, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915030224/http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0321-31.htm |archive-date=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/220/47255.html |title=A Bad Deal on Free Trade |last=Sweeney |first=John J |work=The Boston Globe |access-date=December 1, 2018 |date=March 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pardons===
{{Main|List of people pardoned by George H. W. Bush}}
In keeping with tradition, Bush issued a series of pardons during his last days in office. On December 24, 1992, he granted executive clemency to six former government employees implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal of the late 1980s, most prominently former Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]].&lt;ref name="scientists"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm |title=Bush pardons Weinberger, Five Other Tied to Iran-Contra |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421150512/http://www.fas.org/news/iran/1992/921224-260039.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush described Weinberger, who was scheduled to stand trial on January 5, 1993, for criminal charges related to Iran-Contra, as a "true American patriot".&lt;ref name="scientists" /&gt;

In addition to Weinberger, Bush pardoned Duane R. Clarridge, Clair E. George, [[Robert McFarlane|Robert C. McFarlane]], [[Elliott Abrams]], and Alan G. Fiers Jr., all of whom had been indicted and/or convicted of criminal charges by an [[United States Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Independent Counsel]] headed by Lawrence Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/pardon/bushgrants.htm |title=Pardons and Commutations Granted by President George H.

===1992 presidential campaign===

In early 1992, Bush announced that he would seek a second term. A coalition victory in the Persian Gulf War and high approval ratings made re-election seem likely.

Conservative political columnist [[Pat Buchanan]] challenged Bush for the Republican nomination. He shocked political pundits by finishing second, with 37% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. Bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues, in an attempt to undermine Buchanan's base.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; Once he had secured the nomination, Bush faced his Democratic challenger, [[List of Governors of Arkansas|Arkansas Governor]] [[Bill Clinton]]. Clinton attacked Bush as a politician who was not doing enough to assist the working middle-class and being "out of touch" with the common man, a notion reinforced by reporter [[Andrew Rosenthal]]'s false report that Bush was "astonished" to see a demonstration of a supermarket [[barcode reader|scanner]].&lt;ref name=Goldberg08 /&gt;&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.htm |title=Maybe I'm Amazed |date=April 1, 2001 |access-date=April 11, 2008 |publisher=Snopes.com |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527030747/http://www.snopes.com/history/american/bushscan.asp |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenthal92 /&gt;

His message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties' perceived fiscal irresponsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Perot Vote |publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College |access-date=April 23, 2008 |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/case/3pt/perot_vote.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perot later bowed out of the race for a short time, then reentered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/27/us/the-1992-campaign-the-independent-bush-aide-calls-perot-s-story-paranoid.html |title=The 1992 Campaign: The Independent; Bush aide calls Perot's story 'paranoid' |date=October 27, 1992 |access-date=April 14, 2008 |work=The New York Times |last=Holmes |first=Steven A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several key factors led to Bush's defeat. The ailing economy that arose from recession may have been the main factor in Bush's loss. On Election Day, 7 in 10 voters said that the economy was either "not so good" or "poor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=R. W. |last=Apple Jr. |authorlink=R. W.

Conservative Republicans pointed out that Bush's 1990 agreement to raise taxes contradicted his famous "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]" pledge. In doing so, Bush alienated many members of his conservative base, losing their support for his re-election. According to one survey, of the voters who cited Bush's broken "No New Taxes" pledge as "very important", two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Schmalz |title=Clinton Carves a Path Deep Into Reagan Country |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8173FF937A35752C1A964958260 |work=The New York Times |date=November 4, 1992 |access-date=May 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit, which has largely been attributed to the Reagan tax cuts and military spending of the 1980s. The tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval rating to the extent that it prevented it from reaching its highest level, 89%, by February 1991, during the [[Gulf War]], and four months after the tax vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/110499/the-illusory-power-grover-norquist The Illusory Power of Grover Norquist], Timothy Noah, November 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx Presidential Approval Ratings – Gallup Historical Statistics and Trends], Gallup.com&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Ivy League]] and prep school education led to warnings by advisors that his image was too "[[preppy]]" in 1980, which resulted in deliberate efforts in his 1988 campaign to shed the image, including meeting voters at factories and shopping malls, abandoning set speeches. Bush's campaign director [[Roger Ailes]] and others were concerned that Bush was seen as a "wimp." Bush put that image to rest when he displayed evident fury during an interview with [[Dan Rather]] on January 25, 1988.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

Although Bush became the first elected Republican president since Hoover in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]] to lose a reelection bid (facing a 34% approval rating leading up to the 1992 election), the mood did not last.

In 1993, Bush was targeted in an assassination plot when he visited Kuwait to commemorate the coalition's victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 people who were allegedly involved in using a car bomb in an attempt to kill Bush. Through interviews with the suspects and examinations of the bomb's circuitry and wiring, the FBI established that the plot had been directed by the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]]. A Kuwaiti court later convicted all but one of the defendants. Two months later, Clinton retaliated when he ordered the [[1993 cruise missile strikes on Iraq|firing]] of 23 [[cruise missile]]s at Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters in [[Baghdad]]. The day before the strike, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations [[Madeleine Albright]] went before the Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot. After the missiles were fired, Vice President [[Al Gore]] said the attack "was intended to be a proportionate response at the place where this plot" to assassinate Bush "was hatched and implemented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/longroad/etc/assassination.html |title=frontline: the long road to war: assassination |publisher=PBS |access-date=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1993, Bush and other living former presidents were invited back to the White House for an Arab-Israeli peace accord. They also made the case to Clinton for a repeal of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush |first=Jon |last=Meacham |page=543 |year=2015 |isbn=978-1400067657 |publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 gubernatorial elections, his sons George W. and Jeb concurrently ran for [[Governor of Texas]] and [[List of Governors of Florida|Governor of Florida]]. The elder Bush frequently telephoned campaign headquarters for updates on the race.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; George W. won his race against [[Ann Richards]] while Jeb lost to [[Lawton Chiles]].

In an October 22, 1994 speech in [[Cancún]], Mexico, Bush said history would vindicate him for not attempting to force Saddam Hussein out of power while in office: "The Mideast peace talks that offer hope to the world would never have started if we had done that.

=== During George W. Bush presidency ===
[[File:G &amp; B. Bush F-SD-03-15575.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|George and Barbara Bush, 2001]]
His eldest son, [[George W. Bush]], was inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States on January 20, 2001, and re-elected in 2004. Through previous administrations, the elder Bush had ubiquitously been known as "George Bush" or "President Bush", but following his son's election the need to distinguish between them has made [[retronym]]ic forms such as "George H. W. Bush" and "George Bush senior" and colloquialisms such as "Bush 41" and "Bush the Elder" much more common. H.W. Bush was traveling to [[Minnesota]] for a speaking engagement on the day of the [[September 11 attacks]]. George W. made multiple calls to get in contact with his father before the two men reconnected after the elder Bush had gone to a [[Brookfield, Wisconsin]] motel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=41: A Portrait of My Father |first=George W. |last=Bush |authorlink=George W.

In December 2002, George W. sought counsel from the elder Bush regarding Iraq and informed him of "my efforts to rally the Saudis, Jordanians, Turks, and others in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, pp. 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the fall of Baghdad, Bush praised George W. in an April 2003 email to the incumbent president.&lt;ref&gt;Meacham, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; In a September 14, 2003 interview with BBC, Bush stated his support for a continuation of his son's war against terrorism and the US was in a better state in terms of protecting itself from terrorism than two years prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2003/09/14/Ex-president-Bush-backs-war-on-terrorism/87711063557337/ |title=Ex-president Bush backs war on terrorism |date=September 14, 2003 |publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting Houston VA Medical Center on December 17, Bush told reporters of his satisfaction with the capture of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2003/12/17/Elder-Bush-says-capture-magical-moment/99301071700689/ |title=Elder Bush says capture magical moment |publisher=UPI |date=December 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Bush criticized the rampant criticism of the current times, reflecting that he did not receive such "day in and day out" during his presidency and named [[Keith Olbermann]] and [[Rachel Maddow]] of [[MSNBC]] as examples; he called the two "sick puppies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elder-bush-decries-lack-of-civility-in-politics/ |title=Elder Bush Decries Lack of Civility in Politics |date=October 16, 2009 |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during that month, on October 16, Bush joined President [[Barack Obama]] onstage at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] for a promotion of volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/us/politics/17obama.html |title=Two Presidents Share a Stage on the Subject of Service |date=October 16, 2009 |first=Peter |last=Baker |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Faith===
Bush was raised in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], though by the end of his life his apparent religious beliefs have been considered more in line with [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] doctrine and practices.&lt;ref name="Post-Faith"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Lori |date=December 1, 2018 |title=George H.W.

After his wife's death in April 2018, Bush released a statement through his spokesman, saying in part, "We have faith she is in heaven, and we know life will go on&amp;nbsp;— as she would have it.

===Health and longevity===
In 1991, ''The New York Times'' revealed that Bush was suffering from [[Graves' disease]], a non-contagious thyroid condition that his wife Barbara also had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Altman |first1=Lawrence |title=In Strange Twist, Bush Is Suffering From Same Gland Disease as Wife |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/10/us/in-strange-twist-bush-is-suffering-from-same-gland-disease-as-wife.html |access-date=June 5, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=May 10, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2000, Bush was standing at a reception for 90 minutes when he felt lightheaded.

In October 2017, during the [[Me Too movement]], actress [[Heather Lind]] accused Bush of [[groping]] her and telling an inappropriate joke.

===Legacy===
According to ''USA Today'', the legacy of Bush's presidency was defined by his victory over Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait, and for his presiding over the collapse of the USSR and unification of Germany. The paper said his political legacy would "continue years later through his son, George W. Bush, who became the 43rd president of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering Former President George H.W.

'''Guy Jackson''' (20 September 1921 – 18 June 1972) was a [[tennis]] player and businessman from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=10003700 ITF Pro Circuit Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

His work, comprising several volumes of poetry and two novels, is a mixture of influences from the diverse literary schools of Europe's [[Modernist literature|modernism]], and, unusually in the context of [[Romanian literature]], borrows heavily from [[German literature|German-born movements]] such as [[Expressionism]]. The [[autofiction]]al and cruel detail in Bonciu's narratives makes him a senior figure among Romania's own ''[[Trăirism|Trăirist]]'' authors, while its capture of the unnaturally grotesque also finds him as one of the country's [[Neoromanticism|Neoromantics]] and [[Surrealism|Surrealists]].

Opposed by the literary establishment when his [[Erotic literature|erotic]] subjects became more widely known, and further marginalized for his [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] origin, H. Bonciu was even prosecuted in the 1930s on grounds of "[[pornography]]". His work was banned by the local [[Fascism|fascist]] movements, and later selectively censored by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. The controversy, like his refusal to rally with any particular cultural movement of the [[interwar]], has touched the critical reception of his work, and has introduced a decades-long debate about its contextual value. While some scholars find Bonciu a necessary addition to the modern literary canon and a forerunner of [[postmodern literature]], others describe him as mediocre or pretentious.

==Biography==

===Bohemian life===
Bonciu was born in [[Iași]] to the Jewish couple Carol Haimovici and Ghizela Nadler.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.900; Rotman, p.174&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about his childhood other than the family's move to [[Bucharest]], which happened when he was still a toddler; it was in Bucharest that he completed his primary and secondary education.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; Bonciu may have been enrolled at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Frederick William University]] of [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc900"&gt;Călinescu, p.900&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this uncertain affiliation, it is known that Bonciu must have spent part of his youth in the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], and that such a cultural encounter shaped his entire approach to literature.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mvbexperiment"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Geo Șerban]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/images/articole/mvb32009.pdf "H. Bonciu între experiment și experiență"], in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', Nr. 3/2009, p.11 (republished by [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.262, 264-265, 266, 267, 272-274&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1997 article, literary historian [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]] assessed: "among the Romanian writers, only H. Bonciu has had the occasion to encounter proper ''[[Jugendstil]]''" (''see [[Symbolist movement in Romania]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.264&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young adult, Bonciu obtained his main income from trading in umbrellas and curtains.&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt; He made his literary debut in 1912, when he published in Bucharest's theatrical magazines ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'' and ''Cortina''.&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt; There was a pause in activity during most of [[World War I]], when Romania fought against Germany and the other [[Central Powers]]—he was possibly in enemy territory,&lt;ref name="gg262"&gt;Glăvan, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; but, judging by references in his novels, he may also have seen action in the [[Romanian Land Forces]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; One other story places Bonciu in [[Vienna]] during much of 1917. According to this account, the expatriate Romanian salesman met and closely befriended the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] poet-activist [[Endre Ady]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;

Bonciu was probably back in Bucharest in early 1918, as Romania was negotiating a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|peace with Germany]] (''see [[Romania during World War I]]''). His poems and translations from [[Peter Altenberg]] were taken up by the theatrical daily ''Scena'', put out in German-occupied Bucharest by dramatist [[A. de Herz]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gg262"/&gt; It has been suggested that Bonciu's avant-garde sympathies and stylistic rebellion has its roots in the period, making him part of the same wave as [[Tristan Tzara]] (Romanian inventor of [[Dada]]ism), but that he lost momentum by only making public his avant-garde work after 1930.&lt;ref name="gg262"/&gt;

In 1920, Bonciu resumed his contribution to ''Rampa'', where he published his translation of poems by [[Anton Wildgans]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt; That year, he also returned to Vienna, but was still included as a member of ''Rampa''{{'}}s editorial staff; in 1921, he inaugurated a long period of activity with another Romanian-based literary newspaper, ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]''.&lt;ref name="gg262"/&gt; Having established his reputation as a journalist, Bonciu became a regular columnist: his letters, headlined ''Mișcarea artistică de la noi și din străinatate'' ("The Art Movement in Our Country and Abroad"), ran in several national newspapers.&lt;ref name="cdcuviosul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Radinschi, [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/cuviosul-vin-rosu-de.html "Cuviosul vin roșu de la Uricani"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', June 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major periodicals who hosted his work over the next decade are ''[[Viața Românească]]'', ''[[Facla]]'', ''[[Azi (Romanian newspaper)|Azi]]'', ''Meridian'', and [[Isac Ludo]]'s ''ADAM'' review.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; He also began using a number of [[pen name]]s, including, in addition to ''H. Bonciu'', ''Sigismund Absurdul'' ("Sigismund the Absurd")—effectively, his literary [[alter ego]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/atentat_la_canonul_interbelic "Atentat la canonul interbelic"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 44/2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.505-506; Irimescu, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; The other pseudonym he used was ''Bon-Tsu-Haș''.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;

In 1924, Bonciu married a Gabriela Kimmel,&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt; living, until 1934, in relative isolation from the literary scene.&lt;ref name="gg262"/&gt; Early in the 1930s, the family had moved back to Iași, where Bonciu set up a new business in the production and distribution of [[Moldavian wine]]. On his vineyard, covering some 15 hectares outside of [[Miroslava, Iași|Miroslava]], the writer created sweet "Uricani wine", seen by some [[Oenology|oenologists]] as one of Romania's finest, and a very popular drink throughout the country.&lt;ref name="cdcuviosul"/&gt; The passion for wine-making later resulted in a friendship between Bonciu and celebrated actor-satirist [[Constantin Tănase]]; the latter acclimatized Uricani trunks at his own villa, in [[Balotești]].&lt;ref name="cdcuviosul"/&gt; Bonciu was a regular [[Gambling|gambler]] and drinker, who supplied the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] society of Iași with affordable wine. Humorist [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]], who attended this society, recalls: "Old folks in Iași may still remember Bonciu's devout wine, that every Iași inhabitant back in the day would gorge on at their own will, in Tuflii Café, for 2,50 [[Romanian leu|lei]] a bottle. [...] Just about every afternoon, the cart would stop on the dot at Unirii Square, facing Traian Café, where [Bonciu] would habitually play a game of chess. Waiting for his master, the gray-haired cart driver would fall asleep on his seat".&lt;ref name="cdcuviosul"/&gt;

===Main writing period===
According to his journalist colleague [[Emil Cerbu]], Bonciu's return to ''Rampa'' was both a literary revelation and the birth of a new poetic style: "He had sent in a poem a few days before. A [[sonnet]] made remarkable by the brutal force of its imagery. They told him it could not be published, because of one crude word that harmed the entire sonnet. The poet thereafter turned into another person, with another kind of poems. All of these had an internal structure never before seen in Romanian lyrical literature."&lt;ref name="gg262"/&gt; It was during the ''Rampa'' years that observers began referring to Bonciu's synthesis as a local manifestation of Expressionism, the German current having already found a dedicated promoter in Cerbu.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.384-385, 416&lt;/ref&gt; From this context were born H. Bonciu's poetry collections ''Lada cu năluci'' ("A Crate of Apparitions", 1932) and ''Eu și Orientul. Douăzeci și cinci de sonete'' ("I and the Orient. Twenty-five Sonnets", 1933). Both were published with [[Editura Vremea]] company.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1024; Crohmălniceanu, p.632&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lada cu năluci'' was printed in only 1,000 copies, each featuring Bonciu's autograph and a portrait of his by [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolese]] artist [[Alfons Walde]].&lt;ref name="svcarne"&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/carne_i_vnt2 "Carne și vînt"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 30/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, Bonciu became especially noted as the translator of works by Expressionists, [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and [[Neo-romanticism|Neoromantics]] from the area of [[German culture]]. Among others, they include Ady, [[Richard Beer-Hofmann]], [[Klabund]], [[Erich Mühsam]], [[Alfons Petzold]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Richard von Schaukal]] and [[Carl Spitteler]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt; Of these, his rendition of Rilke's "What Will You Do, God, When I Die?" has been singled out for its beauty by critic Simona Vasilache.&lt;ref name="svcarne"/&gt; Additionally, Bonciu published versions of poems by France's pre-Symbolist [[Charles Baudelaire]].&lt;ref name="svcarne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agtraduceri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adrian Grănescu, [http://www.revistavatra.ro/pdf/vatra_8_9-2010.pdf "Traduceri și traducători – note de lectură – însemnări de cititor"], in ''[[Vatra (Romanian magazine)|Vatra]]'', Nr. 8-9/2010, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;

His full translation of Wildgans' ''Die Sonette an Ead'', with the title ''Poeme către Ead'', came in 1933, also with Editura Vremea.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1024; Crohmălniceanu, p.632; Glăvan, p.262&lt;/ref&gt; The work won praise from essayist and literary chronicler [[Ovidiu Papadima]], who wrote for the magazine ''[[Gândirea]]'' that Bonciu was a "precious" and thoughtful translator, whose versions were more polished than Wildgans' originals.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1933-1934/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1933_1934_013_004.pdf "Cronica măruntă. ''Poemele către Ead''"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 4/1934, p.160 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bagaj...'' ("Luggage"), also known as ''Strania, dubla existență a unui om în patru labe'' ("The Strange Double Life of a Man on His All Fours")&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oc632"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.632&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Confesiunile unui om în patru labe'' ("The Confessions of a Man on His All Fours"),&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; was first published in 1934, marking Bonciu's beginnings as an eccentric novelist. Published by [[Editura Librăriei Leon Alcaly]],&lt;ref name="oc632"/&gt; its original jacket carries an enthusiastic introductory note, by the [[Modernist literature|modernist]] doyen, poet and journalist [[Tudor Arghezi]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gg263"&gt;Glăvan, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; The originals were liberally illustrated with reproductions of paintings and drawings by the late [[Vienna Secession]] artist [[Egon Schiele]].&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;

Allegedly, the novel was a commercial flop, only published in 500 copies.&lt;ref name="zo451"/&gt; Outside the modernist circles, Romanian critics were generally uninterested in ''Bagaj...'', or unaware that it even existed.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; Nevertheless, Bonciu continued to write and, in 1936, Alcaly issued his second novel: ''Pensiunea doamnei Pipersberg'' ("Mrs. Pipersberg's Boarding House").&lt;ref name="oc632"/&gt;

===Obscenity scandal and arrests===
The following period brought Bonciu into the spotlight, as soon as the traditionalist and [[far right]] sections of the media began depicting him as one of the most obscene modern Romanian authors. This controversy was in effect sparked by culture critic [[Nicolae Iorga]] and his ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'' journal.&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.261-262; Ornea, ''Anii treizeci'', p.444-446&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal intensified with time, and Bonciu saw himself included in lists of "[[Pornography|pornographers]]", alongside some major or minor modernist writers: Arghezi, [[Geo Bogza]], [[Mihail Celarianu]], [[Mircea Eliade]] etc. One such directory, in ''Neamul Românesc'', had Bonciu as the No. 1 obscene writer, with Bogza in second place and [[N. D. Cocea]] in at third.&lt;ref name="ggdesprep"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/despre_pornografie_ii "Despre pornografie" (II)], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 3/2007&lt;/ref&gt; In Bonciu's case, the accusations mingled anti-modernism and [[antisemitism]],&lt;ref name="pcblasfemia"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/tema-saptamanii/articol/blasfemia-si-drepturile-artei "Blasfemia și drepturile artei"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 119, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.261-262; Ornea, ''Anii treizeci'', p.421-465&lt;/ref&gt; only focusing on ''Bagaj...'' and simply ignoring the equally provocative content of ''Pensiunea''.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;

The accusations found some backing among government officials. Reportedly, Bonciu was first arrested for a short while in 1932, together with Bogza.&lt;ref name="pcpals"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Sesto-Pals-avangardistul-subteran*articleID_8764-articles_details.html "Sesto Pals, avangardistul subteran"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 179, July–August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ascboxa"&gt;{{ro icon}} Adina-Ștefania Ciurea, [http://www.romlit.ro/scriitori_n_boxa_acuzailor "Scriitori în boxa acuzaților"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 33/2003&lt;/ref&gt; They were held in [[Văcărești prison]], outside of Bucharest, and joined there by the avant-garde youth of ''Alge'' magazine, all of them disciples of Bogza.&lt;ref name="pcpals"/&gt; Two years later, the case was being revisited by his peers inside the [[Romanian Writers' Society]], where Bonciu's defense was taken by novelist [[Zaharia Stancu]] and critic [[Șerban Cioculescu]].&lt;ref name="ascboxa"/&gt; Around that date, [[Constantin Angelescu]], Romania's [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Minister of Public Instruction]], imposed state censorship on ''Pensiunea''.&lt;ref name="ggdesprep"/&gt;

In 1937, the state opened a case against Bonciu and Bogza, who were again taken into custody. As noted by the Surrealist writer [[Sașa Pană]], this came shortly after the [[Romanian Academy]], through the voice of conservative author [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești]], had openly demanded jail terms for both Bonciu and Bogza.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ovidiu Morar, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MORARiul7.html "Scriitorii evrei și 'corectitudinea politică' din România"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A while after, Bogza latter protested vehemently, calling the anti-modernist campaign an "offensive toward darkness and intolerance", while noting that the modest circulations of his and Bonciu's avant-garde work could not justify the scale of repression.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, ''Anii treizeci'', p.450-451&lt;/ref&gt; Bonciu found an unexpected backer in [[Eugen Lovinescu]], a respected intellectual leader on the moderate side of modernism. Lovinescu admired ''Bagaj...'' for its style, if not for its content, and strongly believed that artists in general were above [[Didacticism|didactic]] requirements.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; Another such voice was that of novelist [[Liviu Rebreanu]], who demanded from the Writers' Society a show of solidarity in condemning the arrests. His demand received backing from Stancu and Cioculescu.&lt;ref name="dhssr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Dumitru Hîncu, [http://www.romlit.ro/din_trecutul_s.s.r "Din trecutul S.S.R."], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 22/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest was a cause for celebration in the other camp. At the Writers' Society, Rebreanu's motion was defeated after a clash of opinions, which almost resulted in the resignation of Society President [[Nicolae M. Condiescu]].&lt;ref name="dhssr"/&gt; The guild's anti-Bonciu lobby included poet [[George Gregorian]] (who declared both detainees to be "pseudo-writers") and the formerly accused Eliade (who included himself among the opponents of "pornographic literature").&lt;ref name="dhssr"/&gt; Writing for the [[Fascism|fascist]] gazette ''[[Sfarmă-Piatră]]'', the formerly sympathetic reviewer Papadima signaled that "Haimovici Bonciu" and Aderca were "big pigs" supported by "the Jewish media", on whom the state needed to focus its efforts.&lt;ref name="zo451"/&gt; In a 1938 column for ''Gândirea'', Papadima also contended that Bonciu and the [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] Romanian novelist [[Damian Stănoiu]] were in reality demanding "marketing freedom". In Papadima's account, they abused the notion of artistic liberty, as embodied by the "high art" of Baudelaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1938/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1938_017_008.pdf "Cronica literară. Perpessicius, ''Dela Chateaubriand la Mallarmé''"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 8/1938, p.441 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonciu was released soon after, and, in an interview with ''Azi'' newspaper, described the censorship effort as futile.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, ''Anii treizeci'', p.455&lt;/ref&gt; He also gave a formal reply to the more critical of Lovinescu's pronouncements, writing a [[Parody|lampoon]] called ''Criticul de porțelan'' ("The Porcelain Critic").&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; This enraged Lovinescu, who then published a sarcastic note regarding Bonciu's public persona, the piece later known as ''Poetul absolut'', "The Absolute Poet". It describes Bonciu's "oriental looks", athletic frame and sporting passion ("he does not shy away from walking down Bucharest's streets dressed up in a [[ski suit]]"). According to Lovinescu, that persona clashes badly with Bonciu's demand for sensitivity: "[he] is the eternal convalescent of an unforgiving disease: literaturitis. Whatever subject one may wish to explore, [...] in less than five minutes the conversation, like in some kind of dance, retreats back to art, naturally his own art, to what he has written, writes, will write, to the torture that is his writing process, to his elevated concepts on beauty, to the eternity of art versus the lies of the present, and so on."&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;

===World War II and later life===
In parallel with his growth as a novelist, Bonciu became known to the literati as a prankster and eccentric social observer. In 1937, at the funeral of novelist [[Anton Holban]], Bonciu grabbed the public eye by seating himself in the coffin, his protest against "the inequities of the clergy".&lt;ref name="gc901"&gt;Călinescu, p.901&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, before the start of [[World War II]], he self-published his third poetry collection, called ''Brom'' ("Bromine").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1024; Crohmălniceanu, p.505, 632&lt;/ref&gt;

Antisemitism and fascism became official policies in Romania in the late 1930s (''see [[Holocaust in Romania]]''), and Bonciu found himself excluded from literary life for most of the war years. Under the regime of ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]], his entire work was officially banned throughout the country, alongside that of many other Jewish writers.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, p.174-175&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship trend found as its main opponent the literary historian and polemicist [[George Călinescu]], who made a point of assessing past Jewish contributions (Bonciu and Aderca's included), and presented it to the public in a 1941 treatise on Romanian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, p.175-176&lt;/ref&gt; During the subsequent press campaign targeting Călinescu, ''Gândirea'' accused him of having betrayed Romanian suffering under "the pointy claw of the [[Talmud]]". According to such notes, Bonciu's novels illustrated the "poisonous" influence of Jewish literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Petru P. Ionescu, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1941/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1941_020_008.pdf "''Istoria literaturii române''"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 8/1941, p.442 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

H. Bonciu's last work of poetry saw print in 1945, soon after war had ended, with Contemporană publishing house. It carries the title ''Requiem''.&lt;ref name="oc632"/&gt; He died in April 1950, some two years after a [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] had been imposed on Romania. He was in Bucharest,&lt;ref name="rcparola"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Radu Cosașu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/la-centru-si-la-margine/articol/o-parola-catre-un-vechi-complice-idin-exerciiile-de-oarecare-posteritatei "O parolă către un vechi complice"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 190, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; bedridden, suffering with terminal [[cancer]] and receiving farewell visits from others in his generation.&lt;ref name="gc901"/&gt; One of the last to attend was fellow author Aderca, who recorded Bonciu's bitter joke: "Do you know which is the most bearable of all ways of dying? [...] someone else's."&lt;ref name="gc901"/&gt;

==Work==

===Eclecticism and classification attempts===
For reasons unknown, H. Bonciu refused to openly affiliate with any of the many [[interwar]] literary factions which thrived in [[Greater Romania]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gg263"/&gt; In his 1937 companion to 20th century literature, Eugen Lovinescu described him as a paradoxical, outdated and eccentric author: "the eagerness for novelty, for situations and expressions dominates [in his novels]; but since the novelty dates back to the age of Expressionism, it is currently more outdated than the most up-to-date literature."&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.223-224&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2005, Simona Vasilache presented Bonciu as "a lonely dreamer, terrified by the world like a baby is of bad dreams".&lt;ref name="svkindersc"&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/kinderscenen "''Kinderscenen''"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher [[Paul Cernat]] also presented Bonciu as isolated from the Romanian avant-garde, and as such "perhaps a ''[[Francs-tireurs|franc-tireur]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Avangarda-literara-romaneasca-intr-o-noua-antologie*articleID_11686-articles_details.html "Avangarda literară românească într-o nouă antologie"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 237, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critic Gabriela Glăvan, Bonciu's literature is "hybrid" and "borderline" in that it combines "an Expressionism with avant-garde touches" with "slides into the [[Oneirology|oneiric]] and [[Surrealism]]. [...] His fragmentary poetic devices, alongside the uncertainty of his belonging to any literary genre, are sufficient elements for Bonciu's classification as an unusual author."&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.261&lt;/ref&gt; The same is noted by critic Florina Pîrjol, who reads in Bonciu "a strange mix of the Expressionistic grotesque and the Surrealistic tenderness."&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt; In his wartime biographical essay, George Călinescu further argues that Bonciu's overall contribution mixes together "[[Neoromanticism|Neoromantic]], [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalistic]] and Expressionistic elements. The tendency of personifying the great laws of existence, such as death, the unexpected move [...] into the realm of hallucination, the sarcastic and extravagant ''[[:Wiktionary:Witz|witz]]'' are all Romantic. The Expressionistic parts are the elevation of each moment into an idea, the obfuscation of things into symbolic smoke, the metaphysical interpretation of everyday tragedy. Beyond these, the habit of seeing dramas and issues in all moments of life comes from the German-Jewish writers of the [[Franz Werfel|Werfel]] type."&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt;

Ovid Crohmălniceanu also proposed that Bonciu is in fact an Expressionist by accident, whose actual literary models are the proto-Expressionism of [[Vienna Secession]] and (even older) currents born into [[Culture of Austria|Austrian culture]]. Bonciu, he argues, gained an Expressionist profile by performing his own, independent, mix of literary themes: [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] is borrowed from Neoromanticism, instinctual drive from Naturalism, subjectivity from [[Impressionist literature|Impressionism]], and "paneroticism" from Jugendstil and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.264-265; Grigorescu, p.417&lt;/ref&gt; Other literary historians presume the same connections. [[Dan Grigorescu]] suggests that Bonciu's Expressionism was mostly "exterior", spread over Jugendstil, Impressionism, Surrealism and various [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] mixtures;&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.416-417&lt;/ref&gt; Marian Victor Buciu focuses on Bonciu as a meeting point between the "Naturalist typology" and Expressionism, noting that his Surrealism is less supplied.&lt;ref name="mvbexperiment"/&gt; Nevertheless, Călinescu supposes an ideological link between Bonciu and the Romanian Surrealists at ''[[unu]]'' magazine, since a "man with hatstand head" sketch, by ''unu'' artists [[Jules Perahim]], illustrated one of Bonciu's works. In Călinescu's interpretation, the "grotesque" drawing brings to life "a moment of dementia", and this is analogous to Bonciu's own intentions: "H. Bonciu, who despises realism and claims to be writing 'with the red of my arteries and the green of my [[cerebrospinal fluid]]', works in the same hieroglyphic mode."&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.900. Perahim's sketch rendered on p.889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such nuances notwithstanding, H. Bonciu's contribution was readily annexed to the school of Romanian Expressionism. Dan Grigorescu traces the literary phenomenon to its source: "In what concerns H. Bonciu, critics have passed a more resolute judgment than on any other Romanian writer to have ever been considered a bearer of Expressionist ideas: he was without doubt the one who generated least debate."&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.416&lt;/ref&gt; After it became a point of reference, the definition of Bonciu's work as "Expressionist" created some debate among 20th-century scholars. The issue was notably raised by researcher [[Ovidiu Cotruș]], who found it improbable that Romanian Expressionism was as diverse as to reunite the mystical poetry of [[Lucian Blaga]] and the crude language of ''Bagaj...''. He therefore demanded some kind of critical revision.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.376&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to cultural historian [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], Bonciu remains Romania's only "integral Expressionist",&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Recuperari-si-trufandale-avangardiste*articleID_24396-articles_details.html "Recuperări și trufandale avangardiste"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 546, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; although, even in this context, Bonciu's work "did not record any significant [Expressionist] shakes".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Pop (literary historian)|Ion Pop]], [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna134.pdf "Domni, tovarăși, camarazi"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002142656/http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna134.pdf |date=2011-10-02 }}, in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 134, April 2008, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonciu and ''Trăirism''===
With his search for "[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]" in subject and expression, and despite his avant-garde credentials, Bonciu is sometimes included among the younger-generation ''[[Trăirism|Trăirists]]'', alongside [[Max Blecher]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Anton Holban]] or [[Mihail Sebastian]]. Crohmălniceanu, who finds an ultimate source of literary ''Trăirism'' in narratives by [[André Gide]], describes Bonciu's novels as "impressive literary documents" of the ''Trăirist'' movement.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.412-413&lt;/ref&gt; Described as the more experimental voice of this subgenre, and opposed to Holban's conventional approach,&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt; Bonciu was also repeatedly compared with a secondary figure in ''Trăirism'', the novelist [[Constantin Fântâneru]].&lt;ref name="imfantaneru"&gt;{{ro icon}} Igor Mocanu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/C.-Fantaneru.-Absurd-si-suprarealism-o-ingemanare-inedita*articleID_16790-articles_details.html "C.

Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_scriitor_de_raftul_doi "Un scriitor de raftul doi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 31/2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to reviewer Igor Mocanu, Bonciu, Blecher and Fântâneru share between them a transgression of avant-garde aesthetics and a taste for [[absurdism]]: "These three authors would create [...] a new way of making literature, which took a tiny bit from all the currents and movements of its time. We are dealing with books where, emerging out of an evidently surreal depictions, one comes across dialogues heavily impregnated with the absurd."&lt;ref name="imfantaneru"/&gt; The Bonciu–Blecher comparison is more controversial: various reviewers have noted that, while Bonciu visualizes the suffering of himself and others, Blecher records his real-life combat with [[Pott disease]].&lt;ref name="mvbexperiment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu, p.418&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bonciu's novels and his poetry, the sexual function is a tool of apparent liberation, man's only possible flight from existential despair.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.501; Glăvan, p.272-274; Grigorescu, p.417; Irimescu, p.49-50&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the 1937 scandal, Bonciu's breach of sexual convention in his literary subjects was especially criticized by mainstream literati. According to Călinescu, Bonciu suffered from literary "[[priapism]]", as well as being a "verbose" and "[[Sentimentality|sentimentalist]]" author.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt; In ''Poetul absolut'', Lovinescu accused Bonciu of "glaring tastelessness" and of promoting an "obsessive" eroticism.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; The erotic fragments, scandalous in their day, were seen with comparatively less displeasure by newer generations of exegetes. ''[[România Literară]]'' columnist [[Ion Simuț]] notes that they only cover a few pages of Bonciu's entire work, and that the imagery used is rarely "vulgar".&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; Looking back on the 1930s, literary theorist [[Ion Bogdan Lefter]] notes that, within the self-censoring Romanian literature, Bonciu was one of the very few who ventured to lift the "prude barrier" and actually depict the sexual contact,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Bogdan Lefter]], [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/63_viata-romaneasca-11-12-2009/4_viata-literaturii/492_bariera-pudorii.html "Bariera pudorii"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 11-12/2009&lt;/ref&gt; while Cernat suggests that Bonciu's original denunciators barely hid their politicized agenda: "a [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] accusation of Jewified, anti-national, pornography".&lt;ref name="pcblasfemia"/&gt;

Traditionally, Bonciu's writing style and mastery of the [[Romanian language]] have received both attention and praise. Lovinescu found these to be his validation as an artist. In ''Poetul absolut'', he alternated critique with professional respect, concluding that Bonciu's talent deserved "a better fate."&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; He was to elaborate on the topic in 1937, when he wrote: "The essential merit of [his] novels is a stylistic violence that is still restrained by the remarkable dignity of language and accuracy in the artistic finish. As for the substance, so to say: a sexual release, an obsession [...] haunts therein; the writer's art will not hide his desolation."&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; For Călinescu, one of Bonciu's interests as a storyteller is his ability to merge a [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] narrative and "piercing" realistic episodes; others are his "fine bitterness" and "personal note of humor", even when alternating with "sad clownings".&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt; Similar comments were made decades later by [[Nicolae Manolescu]], who rediscovered Bonciu as "a very talented writer",&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; and by Buciu, who writes that Bonciu's "imposing rhetorical competence" outweighed his "amateurism".&lt;ref name="mvbexperiment"/&gt;

This is contrasted by other verdicts. In 21st-century reviews, Bonciu was variously described as an author from the "second shelf"&lt;ref name="zoraftul"/&gt; or "bottom bench"&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/melancolia-bancii-goale.html "Melancolia băncii goale"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', February 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; of Romanian literary culture. Ion Simuț writes that Bonciu, a "minor writer", generally displays "the tricks and clichés of aesthetic and moral nonconformity."&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; Author Alina Irimescu recommends Bonciu for his depiction of life's "chaos", but concludes: "[he is at times] a middling writer, blinded by the tendencies of his time, who astounds and does not always have a more profound support."&lt;ref&gt;Irimescu, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Florina Pîrjol defines Bonciu's forte as being his portraiture, but notes that his narratives lack "dynamism and coherence".&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;

===Poetry===
Although he nominally took on the classical [[rhyme scheme]]s such as the [[sonnet]], Bonciu repeatedly disregarded them for convenience. Since the 1930s, various reviewers have consequently described him as semi-failed and lacking structure.&lt;ref name="gg262"/&gt; George Călinescu's is a mixed review: "H. Bonciu brings into his poetry a pathos of [[Diurnality|diurnal life]], pessimistic and sarcastic. His general tone is nonetheless shrill, because the author, although he masters the notion of poetry, lacks an artistic persona, being more of an intelligent amateur."&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.900-901&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2005, Simuț found Bonciu "outdated" and "utterly modest" as a poet, linking his work in the field with the late-19th-century [[Decadent movement]].&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; Previously, Călinescu had described Bonciu as "all too indebted" to [[Austrian poetry]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt;

Others have noted that Bonciu's main intent is in rendering the feeling of being crushed by evil nature, the violence of which requires the subversion of lyrical convention, and even of all rational dealings with his public.&lt;ref name="dg417"&gt;Grigorescu, p.417&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by Crohmălniceanu: "Everything [here] becomes a chemical chart for the despair which his clowning is striving to keep hidden from view."&lt;ref name="dg417"/&gt; The poems are, in Grigorescu's view, Bonciu's most Expressionistic creations.&lt;ref name="dg417"/&gt;

Crohmălniceanu sees Bonciu's work in [[lyric poetry]] as illustrating the sense of hopelessness, coldly disguised under allusions to [[sadomasochism]], or "the taste for maculation".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.504&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that the peak of such works is ''Brom'', where anxiety builds up at the thought of demonic forces about to "sweep us up".&lt;ref name="oc505"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.505&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers have made special note of "Living Words", the artistic credo found in ''Lada cu năluci'':
{{Verse translation|

Păunilor de soare mult orbiți,
Intrați, păunii mei! Intrați în lada
În care veți muri înăbușiți,
În care poate vă va crește coada,
S-o resfirați în vremea care vine,
Când viermii orbi vor sfâșia din prada

Peacocks so very blinded by the sun,
Come in, my boys! Into the crate
Where you will die a suffocated death,
Where you might get to grow your tails,
Unfolded as they'll be in times to come,
When blinded worms will tear into their prey,
That sorry thing that shall be left of me.}}

Also remembered is a poem which introduces (and is introduced by) the word ''bleah'', invented by Bonciu as an expression of absolute disgust.&lt;ref name="oc505"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rceugenia"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Radu Cosașu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/la-centru-si-la-margine/articol/eugenia-eugenia "Eugenia!

{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Când luna umbra ți-o culcă, merge cum merge,

When the moon settles down your shadow, it makes sense,
Until the black furniture goes with a crash,
Into drops of panic, the sauce of that moment spills out,

Bonciu's poems borrow their cultural symbols from very diverse sources. His taste for "an absurd and secretly terrifying mythology", in some Sigismund Absurdul pieces, is seen by Crohmălniceanu as a nod to the writings of [[Christian Morgenstern]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.505-506&lt;/ref&gt; "I and the Orient", the title of Bonciu's collected sonnets, is likely a reflection of Bonciu's debt to [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]]' ''[[The Ant People|India and I]]''.&lt;ref name="gc900"/&gt; Some poems of Bonciu's place artificial, medieval and knightly imagery over an existential moral—this, Vasilache notes, is one similarity between Bonciu and the modernist poet [[Emil Botta]].&lt;ref name="svcarne"/&gt; In one other case, discussing his romance with a Jewish girl, Bonciu references the [[Stereotypes of Jews|stereotypical image]] of his fellow [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] as "[[Red hair|ruddy]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Oișteanu]], ''Inventing the Jew. Antisemitic Stereotypes in Romanian and Other Central East-European Cultures'', [[University of Nebraska Press]], Lincoln, 2009, p.64.  {{ISBN|978-0-8032-2098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bagaj...''===
[[File:Trcka - Schiele neben Entwurf eines unausgeführten Freskos, 1914.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Egon Schiele]] posing with his fresco. 1914 photograph by [[Josef Anton Trčka]]]]
In his presentation of ''Bagaj...'', [[Tudor Arghezi]] argued of H. Bonciu: "From a sty of crude colors, with plenty of gilded gossamer rubbed into it, his thick and greasy brush [...] paints into the fresco of our spiritual bedlam".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.504; Glăvan, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felix Aderca]] too campaigned for the novel and its "pages of genius".&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; Another notable fan of the book was novelist and literary chronicler Mihail Sebastian, his ''Trăirist'' colleague,&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.263-264&lt;/ref&gt; although he noted that Bonciu's text was not a fully formed novel.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; The same was concluded by Călinescu, who once described Bonciu the novelist as the author of "[[Prose poetry|prose poems]]".&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; Other critics tend to rate ''Bagaj...'' as a poorly finished work, insisting on its centrifugal narrative—one such conservative voice was that of [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]], who still saluted Bonciu's decision to move into the genre of "Surreal prose", away from poetry.&lt;ref name="gg263"/&gt; Some students of Bonciu's work disagree: according to [[Adriana Babeți]], the "disconcerting amalgam" gives Bonciu his originality and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.265&lt;/ref&gt;

Later revealed as Bonciu's [[alter ego]],&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.264, 276; Irimescu, p.49-50&lt;/ref&gt; the narrator of ''Bagaj...'' focuses his attention on the more peculiar protagonist, Ramses Ferdinand Sinidis. The plot is, in fact, a [[story within a story]]: Bonciu reads through Sinidis' "black notebook", left unopened after its author was murdered. The killer is a Man with Copper Beak (''Omul cu ciocul de aramă''), whose confession to Bonciu is also rendered as a detailed story. The murder was carried out for an absurd reason, and the Man with Copper Beak is haunted by the memory. He does not regret Sinidis' death, but consumed by another, unwitting, murder: his improvised weapon has also pierced through a malevolent dwarf who lived in Sinidis' body, and whom Sinidis despised.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.501-504; Glăvan, p.265-272&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the pretext, the "black notebook" is an ample excursion into a sordid, self-destructive and peripheral environment, where real-life events merge with the purely fantastical. Vasilache sees in it a ''[[Wunderkammer]]'' comprising "violent initiations into the brutal life of the senses, interrupted then and now by brief mortuary rituals",&lt;ref name="svkindersc"/&gt; while Alina Irimescu likens it to [[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'', noting "the realm of the [[undead]] is [Bonciu's] favorite [[Literary topos|topos]]."&lt;ref&gt;Irimescu, p.49-50&lt;/ref&gt; According to Glăvan, the plot is "a trajectory of the ego's unraveling", with "a certified propensity toward the voluptuousness of self-annulment", and an (anti-)''[[Bildungsroman]]''.&lt;ref name="gg266"&gt;Glăvan, p.266&lt;/ref&gt; Sinidis depicts his cruel adolescence and [[Oedipus complex|Oedipus conflict]], his erotic experiences with two partners (the virginal heartthrob Laura, and the submissive mistress on the side), the trauma of a participation in [[World War I]], and a cynical case of [[bankruptcy]]. As a brief interlude in his self-destructive discourse, Sinidis makes eulogistic comments about a promised [[world revolution]], about "[[Bolshevik]]" ethics and a [[universal language]], but has to defend his ideas against the dwarf that lives inside him.&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.270-271&lt;/ref&gt; The creature then forces his host into an unloving marriage with Zitta, and Ramses' murder occurs just as he decides to end it; he and his murderer then make their way into an infernal [[brothel]]. In the closing episode of ''Bagaj...'', Sinidis accepts his spiritual deconstruction, and looks to an eternity of degrading and bestial sexual acts with the "sweet-fleshed" prostitute Peppa.&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.274-276. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.504&lt;/ref&gt;

Sindis' recurrent obsession is death, and he prophesies in detail about being an [[Out-of-body experience|out-of-body witness]] to his funeral service and incineration, content that the flames would also consume his parasite.&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.266-268. See also Crohmălniceanu, p.503-504&lt;/ref&gt; His tormented life is intertwined with those of desperate [[anti-hero]]es, including a [[gout]]-afflicted man who severs his own fingers, or a [[Driller (oil)|driller]] who was burned alive.&lt;ref name="gg269"&gt;Glăvan, p.269&lt;/ref&gt; When read as a camouflaged record of actual events in Bonciu's life, the novel reveals his claims about having been a witness to Vienna's artistic life under the [[Austria-Hungary|Double Monarchy]]: Viennese writers such as Altenberg, Petzold, Wildgans, [[Peter Hille]], [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]] appear as characters,&lt;ref name="svkindersc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.264, 272-273, 274&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Endre Ady]] is a literary prototype.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; In one section of the book, Ramses discovers the beautiful Hilda, who is a painter, a muse, and the living artwork of [[Egon Schiele]], and who ends up being eaten alive by her creator; before this happens, Hilda, Schiele and Ramses become entangled in a [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] ''[[ménage à trois]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.272-274&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[autofiction]]al element in ''Bagaj...'' was highlighted by Romania's other literati, beginning with [[Anton Holban]]'s review in ''[[Adevărul]]''. Holban gave praise to the work as a source of "delight", and first suggested that Bonciu belonged in the same category as [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]] or [[Axel Munthe]].&lt;ref name="gg263"/&gt; The Céline comparison has endured as popular in Romanian literary theory: Glăvan finds that both Bonciu and [[Max Blecher]], his more embittered generation colleague, are among the Romanian writers who found a model to follow in the ''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'';&lt;ref name="gg266"/&gt; according to Pîrjol, Céline and Bonciu have a "family resemblance".&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;

The main mix of influences, however, comes from the iconoclastic cultures of Secessionist Vienna and the [[Weimar Republic]], with whom Bonciu was personally familiarized. Exegetes have identified in ''Bagaj...'' the echoes of writers translated by Bonciu (Altenberg, Petzold, Wildgans), but also from other such sources, including Hille.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oc501; gg264"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.501; Glăvan, p.264&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Crohmălniceanu sees the novel as incorporating elements from a literary branch of the "[[New Objectivity]]" movement: Klabund, but also [[Erich Kästner]], as authors of "atrocious, sarcastic, grotesque and brutal realism".&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oc501; gg264"/&gt; Glăvan too sees an analogy between Sinidis' grim reflection on war and landscapes by "New Objectivity" master [[Otto Dix]].&lt;ref&gt;Glăvan, p.271&lt;/ref&gt; Others see the nightmarish protagonists as cultural echoes from the ''Bizarre Pages'' of Romanian [[Absurdism|absurdist]] author [[Urmuz]].&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mvbexperiment"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.900; Glăvan, p.265; {{ro icon}} Ligia Tudorachi, [http://lett.ubbcluj.ro/~studii/3-4/28.html "Ion Pop (coord.), ''Dicționar analitic de opere literare românești''"], in the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] ''[http://lett.ubbcluj.ro/~studii/revista.html Studii Literare]'', Nr. 3-4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pensiunea doamnei Pipersberg''===
In ''Pensiunea doamnei Pipersberg'', Bonciu preserves his narrator persona and revives Ramses Sinidis. The novel, variously read as a continuation&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; or a [[prequel]],&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.501-502&lt;/ref&gt; opens with the meeting between Ramses and the storyteller; Sinidis has been afflicted by muteness, but, at the very time of this encounter, a bizarre accident forces his voice back. The two then proceed to reconstruct the missing portions of Sinidis' life, an [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] exercise in which protagonist advises writer how to best perform his task.&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.501&lt;/ref&gt; The background themes are despair and solitude: Ramses is on the search for someone to share his existential burden,&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; and the narrative grows to include, according to Crohmălniceanu, an "entire gallery  of tormented yet hilarious faces".&lt;ref name="oc503"&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.503&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot is in large part focused on the eponymous "boarding house", in fact a brothel. There are three correspondents of the "black notebook", which obsess about the themes other than death: "Book of the Flesh", "Book of the Wine", "Book of the Soul".&lt;ref name="gg269"/&gt; The sexual act is again depicted in key moments of the book, showing Sinidis' first sexual experience, with a [[laundress]], or his later intercourse with "a cow-woman" (according to Simuț, these scenes are passionate but not in fact obscene).&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; The needy Lenny Pipersberg and her daydreaming prostitutes [[Reification (fallacy)|reify]] the feeling of inadequacy—the girl Nora despises the natural green of her hair, and kills herself in desperation.&lt;ref name="oc503"/&gt; According to Pîrjol, this is a book of "quasi-theatrical [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]", alternating the "cruel" and the "implausible-[[bucolic]]", especially adept at describing "abjection". The novel, she notes, is [[Antifeminism|antifeminist]], showing women piled up in Sinidis' collection of escapades, "as if in an [[Insect collecting|insect box]]."&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;

==Legacy==
According to researcher Alina Ianchiș, Bonciu's isolation and his lack of "self-affirmation" contributed to the ambiguous or dismissive assessments of his work by academic contemporaries.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; The writer only returned to critical attention in 1964, when Crohmălniceanu first lectured on him at the [[University of Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; His versions of Baudelaire's poems were included in a luxury edition of ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'', put together by writer [[Geo Dumitrescu]] (''Les Fleurs du mal. Florile răului'', [[Editura pentru literatură universală]], 1968).&lt;ref name="agtraduceri"/&gt; The following period witnessed a drop in receptivity or, in Alina Irimescu's words, a "historical void".&lt;ref name="ai49"/&gt; A reissue of his novels came only in 1984, care of [[Mircea Zaciu]] and Mioara Apolzan. This project suffered from the intervention of [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]], and the parts considered scandalous or political were simply bracketed out in the final printed edition.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="svkindersc"/&gt;

In the literary underground, Bonciu enjoyed some popularity among the ''[[Optzeciști]]'' writers—some of whom were disciples of Crohmălniceanu,&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt; trying to reconnect themselves with the 1930s avant-garde. Poet-novelist [[Mircea Cărtărescu]] became a noted supporter of Bonciu's reconsideration,&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; and listed him among the direct precursors of Romania's [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Irimescu, p.49; Florin Mihăilescu, ''De la proletcultism la postmodernism'', [[Editura Pontica]], Constanța, 2002, p.286.  {{ISBN|973-9224-63-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published later in Cărtărescu's life, the ''[[Orbitor]]'' cycle is seen by Irimescu as evidence of Cărtărescu's debt to Bonciu and Blecher.&lt;ref name="ai49"/&gt; Another member of the ''Optzeciști'' clubs, poet [[Florin Iaru]], has also been described as one in succession to Bonciu, particularly in what concerns the Expressionist imagery of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioan Holban, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/HOLBANnov5.htm "''Înnebunesc și-mi pare rău''"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sonia Larian]], a more senior author (but one whose work was only published in the 1980s), is also seen as a disciple of Bonciu, for her scenes of Jewish life in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/camera_ppuilor "Camera păpușilor"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 46/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonciu's comeback took place only after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|fall of communism in 1989]]. In subsequent years, his name was popularized by specialized dictionaries and encyclopedias, and in reinterpretative essays on literary history.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt; In 2000, Aius Publishers in [[Craiova]] released a third, uncensored, edition of his two novels, but the circulation was exceedingly small.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt; A year later, Bonciu failed to make the ''[[Observator Cultural]]'' "best Romanian novels" list, compiled from interviews with Romanian literary professionals. At the time, his absence was considered surprising by ''Observator Cultural'' editor [[Gheorghe Crăciun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Crăciun]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Temeri-si-comentarii-preferinte-si-liste-rezerve-si-excese*articleID_3387-articles_details.html "Temeri și comentarii, preferințe și liste, rezerve și excese"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 54, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Writers' Union of Romania|Writers' Union]] magazine ''[[România Literară]]'' published samples of Bonciu's poetry, within a special avant-garde issue.&lt;ref name="viieri&amp;azi"/&gt; At the same time, [[Polirom]] publishing house issued both ''Bagaj...'' and ''Pensiunea'' as a single edition. It carries a preface by Babeți, and is a conscious attempt to reassess Bonciu as one of the major Romanian writers of his time. The reception was lukewarm and the iconoclastic intent criticized by other specialists. [[Ion Simuț]] notes that, unlike Blecher, "H. Bonciu does not represent a real challenge to the consecrated hierarchy of interwar assets. From this side, there is no hope that one could modify the [literature] canon."&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt;

In the Bonciu chapter of his own companion to Romanian literature (published 2008), [[Nicolae Manolescu]] suggested that the author of ''Bagaj...'' was more gifted than consecrated novelists such as [[Gib Mihăescu]]. That pronouncement was questioned by Manolescu's younger colleague, [[Paul Cernat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=19&amp;nr=383 "Istoria critică și capriciile memoriei canonice (III)"], in ''[[Cuvântul (literary magazine)|Cuvântul]]'', Nr. 383&lt;/ref&gt; During a far-reaching literary debate of late 2008, Cernat has also criticized those postmodern authors who, in his view, overrate H. Bonciu and Constantin Fântâneru to the detriment of interwar classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Din-nou-despre-proza-noastra-tinara*articleID_20517-articles_details.html "Din nou despre proza noastră tînără"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 443, October 2008; [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Polemici-cordiale*articleID_20892-articles_details.html "Polemici cordiale"], in ''Observator Cultural'', Nr. 452, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Such conclusions were mirrored by other authors. As one of Bonciu's defenders, Irimescu sees him as one "condemned to endure outside the literary canon", who would not receive recognition "either because of the times, or because of the people."&lt;ref name="ai49"/&gt; Essayist Magda Ursache made particularly strong comments regarding perceived attempts at revising the canon "with the help of a hammer", to favor Bonciu and other avant-garde writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Nicolae Busuioc, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/BUSUIOCmar8.html "Amplificarea derutei spirituale?"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival of erotic prose in post-Revolution literature has also led reviewers to suggest that the "generation 2000" was, or could have been, influenced by ''Bagaj...'' or ''Pensiunea''.&lt;ref name="aiexcentric"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fpneaparat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isatentat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.revista22.ro/sa-ne-promovam-mortii-4008.html "Diferența specifică a celor mai buni"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 914, September 2007; [[Alex.

'''Habitability''' is the conformance of a [[House|residence]] or [[wikt:abode|abode]] to the implied [[warranty]] of habitability. A residence that complies is said to be '''habitable'''. It is an [[implied warranty]] or contract, meaning it does not have to be an [[express contract]], [[Covenant (law)|covenant]], or [[provision (contracting)|provision]] of a [[contract]].  There was no implied warranty of habitability for tenants at [[common law]] and the [[legal doctrine]] has since developed in many jurisdictions through housing laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landlord-Tenant Law|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/landlord-tenant_law|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duties of the Landlord|url=https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/duties-of-the-landlord|website=LawShelf|publisher=National Paralegal College|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Habitability is synonymous with '''tenantability'''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/is-tenantability-broader-than-habitability--1934626.html "Is tenantability broader than habitability?"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be habitable, such housing usually:
* must provide shelter, with working locks
* must be heated in the winter months (typically between October 1 and May 31 in the [[Northeastern United States]])&lt;ref&gt;In New York, see N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law § 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* must not be infested with [[vermin]], roaches, termites, or [[mold]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3898/is_200406/ai_n9435714 Mold in condominium: Negligent maintenance: Breach of warranty of habitability: Settlement: Verdict | Law Reporter | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York law==
Some states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]], have given additional statutory protections in addition to those created by [[caselaw]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.oag.state.ny.us/realestate/habitability.html N.Y.

# Lobby attendant service by a [[concierge]] or landlord &lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law §50-c&lt;/ref&gt;
# Elevator mirrors &lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law §51-b; NYC Admin. Code §27-2042&lt;/ref&gt;

# Protection from [[lead paint]] &lt;ref&gt;NYC Health Code §173.14;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Violation of the warranty of habitability results in [[constructive eviction]], whereby the [[landlord]] or [[wikt:Special:Search/lessor|lessor]] has, in effect, evicted the [[leasehold estate|tenant]] or [[lessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josephson|first1=Richard C.|title=The Implied Warranty of Habitability in Landlord-Tenant Relations|journal=William &amp; Mary Law Review|date=1971|volume=12|issue=3|page=580|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2742&amp;context=wmlr|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenant may remedy the problem,&lt;ref&gt;See N.Y.

McCann Company was an advertising agency that, as [[McCann Erickson]], grew to become the world’s largest with a global network of offices in more than 130 countries, providing advertising campaigns for brands including [[Standard Oil]] (Esso, Exxon), [[Vaseline]], [[Beech-Nut]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], [[Nabisco]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[General Motors]], [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], [[L’Oréal]], [[Bacardi]], [[Nestlé]] and [[MasterCard]].&lt;ref name=adageprofile&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-the-advertising-century/harrison-king-mccann/140240/ |title=Harrison King McCann |publisher=''AdAge'' |date=March 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

McCann was born in Maine on November 4, 1880 to a New England family that had settled in New Hampshire in the seventeenth century.
In 1902 he graduated from [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]], where he had worked on the student newspaper and been leader of the mandolin club.

During his high school and college years he worked for Hiram Ricker &amp; Sons, hotel proprietors in Poland Spring, initially as a bellboy and later as salesman for [[Poland Spring]] water. This job took him to the Poland Springs New York office.

Once in New York, McCann switched jobs, joining the Amsterdam Advertising Agency as copywriter in 1903. In the same year he was offered a position by the [[New York Telephone Company]], and put in charge of an experimental campaign to discover if advertising could prevent the company from losing customers to smaller competitors. By 1910, McCann was successfully running an in-house department of 100 staff.

McCann’s work for the New York Telephone Company attracted the attention of the Standard Oil Company, who recruited him to lead their in-house advertising department.  When the US Government ordered the break-up of the Standard Oil Company on monopoly grounds, McCann formed his own agency with Canadian efficiency expert Herbert Newton Casson to provide ad continuity.

The H. K. McCann Company opened its doors on Broadway, New York in 1912, with Standard Oil as its first account. By its second year it was handling over $200,000 worth of business. A network of offices across North America quickly followed. In 1928, McCann opened its first European offices in Berlin, London and Paris. In 1930, McCann merged with Alfred Erickson’s agency to form McCann-Erickson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Harrison McCann died on December 20, 1962 in a car crash in [[Old Westbury, New York]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Harrison King McCann, Wife Are Killed in Long Island Crash |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/12/22/archives/harrison-king-mccann-wife-are-killed-in-long-island-crash.html |quote=Harrison King McCann, honorary board chairman and former president of the McCann-Erickson advertising agency in New York, and his wife, Dorothy, were killed today in an automobile accident here. ... |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=December 22, 1962 |accessdate=2012-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Ad Agency Founder Dies in Car Crash |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8bBOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OQEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2603,1516302&amp;dq=mccann+advertising&amp;hl=en |quote= |newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=December 21, 1962 |accessdate=2012-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== McCann and the number thirteen ==

While [[triskaidekaphobia]] – fear of the number 13 – is a common, if usually mild phobia in the US, McCann felt that it was his lucky number.

He had begun his job with the New York Telephone Company on October 13, 1910, he made the decision to form his own agency on November 13, 1911, and he went on to weave the number into the lore of the agency. He often shortened the company name to The H K McCann Co to have the right number of letters. The agency’s famous and still used credo "Truth Well Told" also contains 13 letters, and whenever his growing agency moved to new buildings, McCann would insist on a thirteenth floor office.

When McCann-Erickson moved to the newly built 50 Rockefeller Plaza in 1939 he demanded a 13th floor, and placed his office on it. It remains the only building in the [[Rockefeller Center]] to have one.

== Legacy ==

As a distinguished [[Bowdoin College]] alumnus, Harrison King McCann is the namesake of a named professorial chair in the college's English department.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/namedprofessorsh00bowd/namedprofessorsh00bowd_djvu.txt Named professorships at Bowdoin College (Bowdoin College Bulletin, no. 399) (1976)]&lt;/ref&gt; Bowdoin professors endowed with this honor in more recent years include:

'''Hisham Talaat Moustafa''' ({{lang-ar|'''هشام طلعت مصطفى'''}}) is an Egyptian businessman who had been elected in 2004 to the [[Shura Council]] in the [[Parliament of Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Time-20090522"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1900311,00.html|title=Hisham Talaat Moustafa: Egypt's Condemned Tycoon|author=M.J. Stephey|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2010-09-08|date=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the former chairman and head of the Real Estate Branch of the [[Talaat Moustafa Group]], his net worth was estimated at $800 million in 2007.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-20090521"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/world/middleeast/22egypt.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2|title=Egyptian Tycoon Sentenced to Death for Murder|author=Michael Slackman|accessdate=2010-05-04|date=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on September 2, 2008 and found guilty on May 21, 2009 for his involvement in the [[murder]] of Lebanese singer [[Suzanne Tamim]], but his sentence to [[capital punishment|death]] by [[hanging]] was overturned on a [[legal technicality]].&lt;ref name="Reuters-20100304"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE62314M20100304|title=Egypt tycoon facing death, gets retrial|author=Yasmine Saleh|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[New trial|retrial]] in 2010, he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-20100928"&gt;{{cite news|last=El-Naggar|first=Mona|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/world/middleeast/29egypt.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=No Death Sentence for Tycoon in Egypt|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2010-09-28|date=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moustafa was released after 9 years on June 23, 2017 after receiving a presidential pardon.&lt;ref name=pardon/&gt;

==Background==
Born in the Egyptian city of [[Alexandria]] in 1959, Moustafa graduated in 1980 from the [[Alexandria University|University of Alexandria]]'s College of Commerce with an accounting degree. He is the youngest son of construction magnate [[Talaat Moustafa Group|Talaat Moustafa]] and is married with three children (in order of birth): Omar, Tarek, and Mohamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmg.star-ware.com/ExecutiveProfile/HishamTalaatMostafa/tabid/69/Default.aspx |title=TMG Executive Profile: Hisham Talaat Moustafa|publisher=[[Archive.org]]|accessdate=2008-06-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626204232/http://tmg.star-ware.com/ExecutiveProfile/HishamTalaatMostafa/tabid/69/Default.aspx |archivedate = 2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder case==
On September 2, 2008, Moustafa was charged in [[Cairo]] of arranging the murder of Lebanese singer [[Suzanne Tamim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Daily News Egypt]]|author=Sherine El Madany and Emad El-Sayed|url=http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16195|title=Hisham Talaat Moustafa referred to criminal court, TMG shares plunge 15.97 percent|date=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moustafa was stripped of his [[parliamentary immunity]].&lt;ref name="National-20100926"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100926/FOREIGN/100929692/1010/|title=Tamim murder suspects ‘alliance with the devil’|author=Nadia Abou el Magd|newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|accessdate=2010-09-27|date=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shares in Talaat Moustafa Group, one of Egypt's biggest real estate developers, fell sharply on the day of his arrest as reports of the indictment reached the [[stock market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/529752-property-tycoon-charged-over-tamim-killing|title=Property tycoon charged over Tamim killing|author=Jonathan Wright|newspaper=[[Arabian Business]]|accessdate=2008-09-03|date=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock had declined over the summer as rumors of Moustafa's involvement in the murder swirled through Egypt. In November 2008, the presiding judge issued a [[gag order]] on the publication of case details other than procedural decisions and the final verdict.&lt;ref name="Time-20090522" /&gt;

On May 21, 2009, Moustafa was found guilty of involvement in the murder through "incitement, agreement and assistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8060810.stm|title=Death sentences for Suzanne Tamim murderers|date=2009-05-21|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, he was sentenced to death by [[hanging]], along with former police officer [[Mohsen al-Sukkari]], who was paid $2 million to carry out the hit. Egypt's [[Grand Mufti]] [[Ali Gomaa|Sheikh Ali Goma'a]] upheld the verdict: "The court found no reason to have mercy on the defendants and decided to execute them unanimously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090727/NATIONAL/707269911/1011/NEWS|title=Tamim killers say they will appeal|date=2009-07-27|author=Nadia Abou el Magd|newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal was filed the day before the August 25 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://adweb.ad.atl.publicus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090825/NATIONAL/708249869|title=Appeals lodged over Tamim murder|author=Nadia Abou el Magd|newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrial===
On March 4, 2010, the Cassation Court of Egypt accepted an appeal for a [[new trial]] after concluding the original verdict had made mistakes of [[legal technicality]].&lt;ref name="Reuters-20100304" /&gt; The defense argued that co-defendant Al-Sukkari was not properly represented during his first questioning. Prosecutor Moustafa Khater responded to the finding by stating that Al-Sukkari did not ask for a lawyer.&lt;ref name="National-20100926" /&gt; The retrial began on April 26. On May 28, Tamim's family dropped its [[Lawsuit|civil suit]] against Moustafa and denied that they were paid any money in return. Judge Mahmoud el Khodeiry, former deputy chief of Egypt's appeals court, said this would have no effect on the murder case.&lt;ref name="National-201000530"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100530/FOREIGN/100520804/1002/|title=Tamim family drops civil suit|author=Nadia Abou el Magd|newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 25, prosecutors spent two hours delivering final retrial statements, arguing that they had evidence from 39 witnesses and mobile phone messages. Documents presented to the court included records of an attempt by Moustafa to freeze Tamim's bank account in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="National-20100926" /&gt; On September 28, 2010, the court re-sentenced Moustafa to a reduced penalty of 15 years' imprisonment. Political analysts were surprised that the judgment was issued before final statements were completed. Attorney [[Gamal Eid]] of the [[Arabic Network for Human Rights Information]] stated, "They did not even bother to go through the motions to save face. I do not trust that the judiciary is independent, and every day there is new proof of this."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-20100928" /&gt;

===Assault investigation===
In August 2010, Egyptian police opened an investigation of allegations that Moustafa had beaten his brother-in-law Ihab Mohamed Madi during the first week of [[Ramadan]]. Madi claimed that the beating began after he tried to intervene in an argument between his wife Sahar and Moustafa. Sahar, who is also Moustafa's sister,&lt;ref name="National-201000304"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100305/NATIONAL/703049848/0/SPORT|title=Court orders retrial in Tamim murder case|author=Nadia Abou el Magd|newspaper=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|accessdate=2010-08-25|date=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been noted as the only member of Moustafa's family to consistently attend his court hearings.&lt;ref name="Reuters-20100823"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE67M1JP20100823|title=Egyptian tycoon accused of beating brother in-law|author=Yasmine Saleh|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2010-08-25|date=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential pardon===
In June 2017, Moustafa was released after receiving a presidential pardon.&lt;ref name="pardon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hisham Talaat Mostafa released among 502 prisoners under presidential pardon|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/hisham-talaat-mostafa-released-among-502-prisoners-presidential-pardon/|work=Egypt Independent|date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His group had just bought 500 acres of land in Cairo's new capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/economy/2017/04/23/Talaat-Mostafa-buys-land-for-development-at-Egypt-s-new-capital.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Martin, Jr.''' (1740–1808) was a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Virginia militia]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], in which Martin's frontier diplomacy with the [[Cherokee|Cherokee people]] is credited with not only averting Indian attacks on the [[Scotch-Irish American]] and [[English American]] settlers who helped win the battles of [[Battle of Kings Mountain|Kings Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], but with also helping to keep the Indians' position neutral and from siding with the British troops during those crucial battles. Historians agree that the settlers' success at these two battles signaled the turning of the tide of the Revolutionary War—in favor of the Americans.
 
Martin was born in [[Caroline County, Virginia]], and later lived at Albemarle County and then at Henry County, Virginia, at his plantation, ''Belmont'', on [[Leatherwood Creek (Virginia)|Leatherwood Creek]] in Martinsville, not far from the plantation of his friend [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Patrick Henry]], ''[[Leatherwood Plantation]]''.

General Martin held many positions during his public life. As a very young man he first tried his hand at farming, next he worked for three years as an overseer on the huge plantation of his local Virginia kin, next he was a [[longhunter]], and an explorer on the frontier for friend Patrick Henry, then an early pioneer and builder of [[Martin's Station]] in the "wild west," a surveyor of the KY/NC and TN/VA borders, an Indian agent/Indian fighter for Patrick Henry, a member at peace treaties with the Indians, and along with Dr. Thomas Walker, Joseph Martin named the Cumberland region and the [[Cumberland River]], he served as a member of the legislatures of Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina, he was lifelong friends with Gen. Thomas Sumter, he was also friends and brothers-in-law with Col. Benjamin Cleveland (both married Graves sisters), he was unsuccessfully nominated by Patrick Henry to the position of the first governor of the Southwest Territory, was the holder of some 80,000 acres across the Southeastern U.S. at one point. The city of [[Martinsville, Virginia]], was named in his honor during his lifetime.

But Joseph Martin Jr., the son of the English immigrant, was not cut out for a Virginia gentry planter's life. "Gambling was a favorite pastime." Martin's son, Revolutionary War officer Col. William Martin, in his accounts of his father's life in the, "[[Lyman Draper]] Manuscript Collection," writes that although his father gambled, he was not much of a drinker and let his son in on his secret; Martin sometimes pretended to over-drink so he might appear to be drunk in order that fellow gamblers would let down their guard. As a youth, Joseph Martin ran off from an apprenticeship during the [[French and Indian War]] of 1756, and joined the army at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], where he served alongside another Virginia youth, [[Thomas Sumter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvIOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%22general+joseph+martin%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=-Cd6Sf60DpeMlQTVoNm-Bg#PPA164,M1 |title=The Magazine of History with Notes and Queries, Vol. VIII, William Abbatt (ed.), New York, 1908 |publisher=Google Books |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his early army service, Martin lit out for the rigors of the frontier, where he dressed in buckskin and was an early real estate speculator, trapper and fur trader and Indian fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Although Joseph Martin inherited from his father over 300 acres of land as well as a half-interest in a plantation on a tributary of the [[Potomac River]] that Joseph Martin Sr. held jointly with Col. Francis Warner of [[Essex County, Virginia|Essex County]], the son elected to dress in buckskin and spend his time inland on the frontier.[http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/MARTIN/2000-11/0975121791]&lt;/ref&gt;
But this time on the frontier was after Martin had bought a large plot of land in Henry County with his earnings working for three years as an overseer for an uncle. Martin also gained 20,000 acres of land from Patrick Henry in a surveying contest at Powell Valley. Martin's youthful adventures on the frontier were grist for later stories... some of which were written by Martin's political foes and were slanted to paint a picture of him in an unkind light. One writer, a fan of Martin's political enemy, called him lazy and refused to describe him by his military ranking. General Joseph Martin may have been many things in his lifetime, but a quick study of his history and his accomplishments show that he was far from lazy. Eventually the soldiering, trapping and Indian fighting transformed the young Martin into a fearsome explorer.

Among Martin's earliest excursions on the frontier was one made on behalf of family friend Dr. Thomas Walker. Martin's son, Revolutionary War officer Col. William Martin, describes the naming of the area and the river in a letter to historian [[Lyman Draper]], "A treaty with the Cherokees was held at [[Fort Chiswell, Virginia]] on New River, then a frontier. On the return of the chiefs home, Dr.[Thomas] Walker, a gentleman of distinction, and my father, [General] Joseph Martin, accompanied them. The Indians being guides, they passed through the place now called Cumberland Gap, where they discovered a fine spring. They still had a little rum remaining, and they drank to the health of the Duke of Cumberland. This gave rise to the name of Cumberland Mountain and Cumberland River."{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In 1769, Martin journeyed to [[Powell River (Tennessee River)|Powell's Valley]] to attempt a settlement, a full {{convert|100|mi|km}} ahead of any previous settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6npr_LGJH-cC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;dq=%22col.+william+martin%22+tennessee&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J6eMitmFIN&amp;sig=o0u3xyXnr4Iw5hUIJeb_vbVVOxc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aYC5ScO6FJX2MJrf_J4I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA75,M1 |title=The Life of Daniel Boone, Lyman Copeland Draper, Ted Franklin Belue, Stackpole Books, 1998, ISBN 0-8117-0979-5 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and his party&amp;nbsp;– which included his brother Brice and Mordecai Hord&lt;ref&gt;Born in [[Caroline County, Virginia]], Mordecai Hord was also an early settler of Henry County, where he settled on his plantation named ''Hordsville''. Hord owned 'vast tracts of land' in Powell's Valley, which he explored along with Joseph Martin.[https://books.google.com/books?id=VztVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22mordecai+hord%22+virginia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2nRc1UspmG&amp;sig=Ggmv26zmwxxeVgjtc0NDsUt11HE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J6q5Sda4H5GYsAPlgPE-&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA15,M1] The two shared many of the same friends, including Patrick Henry, an executor of Hord's will along with Hord's brother-in-law Col.

But in the foray to Powell's Valley, Martin had established his credentials as a hard-bitten explorer. [[Daniel Boone]] and his party of explorers were stunned in 1769 when, upon their arrival in Powell's Valley, they discovered that Martin and his 20-man party had beaten them there. It was beyond the farthest reaches that Boone and his [[long hunter]]s had explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZVFS2-dNa4C&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq='DANIEL+BOONE%22+%22JOSEPH+MARTIN'&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w_Uxu-Q6b0&amp;sig=Ckx-q430m8Hoaeginc7awUgylT0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nw-7SYTeMpC6M579gbYI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result |title=In the Footsteps of Daniel Boone, K.

By 1775, when North Carolina merchant [[Richard Henderson (American pioneer)|Richard Henderson]] purchased an immense tract of land from the Cherokees to found the short-lived [[Transylvania (colony)|Transylvania colony]], in what is today [[Kentucky]], Henderson turned to Martin as his agent in Powell's Valley.&lt;ref&gt;In exchange for acting as agent for the Transylvania colony, Martin was granted by founder Henderson preferential rights to Martin's land claim in Powell Valley.[https://books.google.com/books?id=8eFSK4o--M0C&amp;pg=PA612&amp;dq=%22thomas+walker%22+%22joseph+martin%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=gZ29SZT4HpLakATw_uCDAw]&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of several such roles that the explorer, accustomed to trapping, [[Longhunter|longhunting]] and traveling in the Appalachian wilderness inhabited by the [[Cherokee]], would hold over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPAI3Tegbl0C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22thomas+walker%22+%22joseph+martin%22&amp;ei=rYm9SamdO5vgkAT6-6TSCw |title=Historic Sullivan: a history of Sullivan County, Tennessee, with brief biographies of the makers of history, By Oliver Taylor, Published by The Overmountain Press, 1988, ISBN 0-932807-33-X |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An experienced longhunter and Indian trader, Martin continued to traffic in skins as late as 1781, when two Native Americans attempting to deliver skins to Martin at his Long Island settlement were slain by colonists.[https://books.google.com/books?id=-uB4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA365&amp;lpg=PA365&amp;dq=%22martin's+station%22+virginia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NFh8exuTdL&amp;sig=dluFc2CtfBQ4fexH4ES6m3Tm0v4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pnfVSo-1CY_kswPXxYHpAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22martin's%20station%22%20virginia&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin's Station stood along the Wilderness Trail near [[Rose Hill, Lee County, Virginia|Rose Hill, Virginia]]. The first fort was built in 1769, but Martin's party were attacked by the local Native Americans. He returned a few years later in 1775 and built a new "Martin's station". Again he was attacked by the Indians and had to leave. Moving closer to the [[Cumberland Gap]], he built another new "Martin's Station", his third, in 1783. The small fort provided protection plus supplies for hunters and immigrant families moving into Kentucky. He was  able to finally sell his fort and lands in [[Powell County, Kentucky]] in 1788, and moved back to the town in [[Henry County, Virginia]], that would soon be re-named in his honor: Martinsville.

A "fourth" Martin's station was recently constructed at the [[Wilderness Road State Park]]. "Builders of the hand hewn log replica, constructed in 2002, used only the kinds of tools that Martin would have used in the wild frontier in the later 1700s. Workers carted logs into the construction site with oxen and then used ropes and horses to set those logs in place. At times, [[Historical reenactment|reenactors]] came on the scene and made the construction yet authentic by staging spontaneous Indian attacks."&lt;ref&gt;Tennis, Joe.

[[File:J L Robertson General Joseph Martin 1788.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Letter from [[James Robertson (explorer)|James Robertson]], founder of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to Joseph Martin, Jr., 1788]]
"Martin was a robust figure in the history of the early frontier," according to the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] guide to the Old Dominion. "He was born in Albemarle County in 1740, ran away to fight Indians at 17, became an Indian agent, land agent, and officer of militia, fighting Indians all up and down the frontier. In 1774 he came to Henry County, established himself at Belle Monte on Leatherwood Creek, for nine years sat for his district in the general assembly, and in 1793 was made a brigadier general of state militia.  He was a brawny, picturesque man, more than six feet tall and the father of 18 children; wore buckled knee breeches and a great beard, braided and thrust inside his shirt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2VzSg9hfp0C&amp;pg=PA611&amp;dq=%22general+joseph+martin%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=SCt6SZPaNpOmkQTouqTUBg |title='&amp;#39;Virginia: A Guide to the Old Dominion'&amp;#39;, Virginia Writers' Project, Federal Writers' Project, Oxford University Press, New York, 1956 |publisher=Google Books |date=January 1, 1972 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 1777, Martin was commissioned by Governor Patrick Henry as Agent and Superintendent for Indian Affairs for the State of Virginia. (Martin served in the same capacity with the state of [[North Carolina]] from 1783 to 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eFSK4o--M0C&amp;pg=PA612&amp;dq=%22thomas+walker%22+%22joseph+martin%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=gZ29SZT4HpLakATw_uCDAw |title=The Kentucky Encyclopedia, John E.

Henry instructed Martin that he was "to reside at some place in that Nation in order to negotiate and direct all things relating to the Commonwealth and which concern the interest thereof, using your best endeavors from time to time to preserve peace with that Nation and to cultivate their present good Disposition." It was an appointment Martin would continue to hold until 1789.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/genjosmartin/PUSEY.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:34:46 An Unsung Hero of the Virginia Frontier, Dr. William Allen Pusey, The Filson Club, February 3, 1936, geocities.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] it was the efforts of Joseph Martin (then a Major) that helped prevent the [[Overhill Cherokee]] from launching widespread attacks on American colonists, which [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] agents had attempted to incite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ei0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22james+madison%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mn26kyR23X&amp;sig=I-tPYJ-0XYS7wyG9N8gwF4yKjtc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h5XGSaqUNYmQtQPs1t3jBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA570,M1 |title=History of the Cherokee Indians and Their Legends and Folk Lore, Emmet Starr, The Warden Company, Oklahoma City, 1921 |publisher=Google Books |date=October 1, 2004 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the British capture of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and [[Augusta, Georgia]] in 1778–1779, English goods made their way to the Cherokee on the [[Savannah River]], prompting some tribesmen to rejoin the English cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7C6ZJGHLPCIC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=%22patrick+henry%22+%22joseph+martin%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=gPq_Se31EInAlQSRxNSFCA |title=The American Revolution in Indian country: crisis and diversity in Native American communities, Colin Gordon Calloway, Frederick Hoxie, Neal Salisbury, Cambridge University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-521-47569-4 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin's diplomacy with the Cherokees in 1780–81, wrote the American Historical Association, enabled the [[Continental Army]] to achieve victory over the English at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], thus hastening the end of the conflict. On the eve of the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]], in February 1781, General [[Nathanael Greene]] wrote Martin and seven other officers&amp;nbsp;– including [[John Sevier]], [[Arthur Campbell (Virginia)|Arthur Campbell]],  and [[William Christian (Virginia)|William Christian]]&amp;nbsp;– appointing them agents to treat with the Cherokees and Chicasaws "to afford the Said Tribes of Indians every mark of our good disposition towards them."

At the same time&amp;nbsp;– and complicating Martin's legacy&amp;nbsp;– Martin and his sons were prime movers behind the settlement of [[Tennessee]] by removing obdurate Cherokees from the territory.&lt;ref name =Annual/&gt;

By the end of the Revolution, Martin's place as chief colonial Indian agent seemed secure. In January 1780, [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia governor]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] directed Martin to negotiate with the Cherokees to secure land around a new fort being overseen by General [[George Rogers Clark]] at the mouth of the Ohio River ([[Fort Jefferson (Ohio)|Fort Jefferson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SBCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22thomas+jefferson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n7n19BHaXP&amp;sig=vVXR6hd2o-ntr9vh4uK3O_EU6KY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9rmzS9rWK5O4NZzoyPoJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwBzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joseph%20martin%22%20%22thomas%20jefferson%22&amp;f=false |title=George Rogers Clark Papers, 1771–1781|author=George Rogers Clark|editor=[[James Alton James]]|publisher=Illinois State Historical Library|location=Springfield, Illinois|year=1912|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1783, the [[State of Virginia]] built a new fort at the [[Cumberland Gap]], replacing an older fort which was adjudged to lie within the boundaries of [[North Carolina]]. The new Virginia fort was designed as the primary residence for Martin while he was in the region on official business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSUSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=%27DANIEL+BOONE%22+%22JOSEPH+MARTIN%27&amp;lr=&amp;ei=7T27SaUdj8CVBM6HmdML#PPA380,M1 |title=History of Southwest Virginia, 1746–1786, Washington County, 1777–1870, Lewis Preston Summers, J.

Later, in a twist overlooked by most historians, Martin corresponded with [[Alexander McGillivray]], the leader of the [[Muscogee Creek|Creek]] Indians, who had [[Loyalist]] sentiments. In 1788 a letter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Joseph|title=Letter, 1788 Nov. 8, Tugoloe [i.e., Tugaloo] to Alexander McGillory [i.e., McGillivray]|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/zlna/id:tcc057|website=Southeastern Native American Documents, 1730-1842|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Martin to McGillivray was intercepted in which Martin professed to be interested in settling abroad. When the letter was discovered, the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] launched an investigation into Martin's conduct. But he was later exonerated when it turned out that he was acting as a spy on Patrick Henry's instructions to ferret out the nature of McGillivray's ties to the Spanish, who were then active in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_n6Cm3qjX0C&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22patrick+henry%22&amp;ei=HJ65SfeGCIjClQTz8sSiBQ#PPA344,M1 |title=The Conquest of the Old Southwest: The Romantic Story of the Early Pioneers Into Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, 1740–1790, Archibald Henderson, The Century Company, New York, 1920 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"General Martin's conduct so far as I could discern in that affair was really praise-worthy," Henry wrote to [[United States Senator]] from Virginia [[Richard Henry Lee]].

General Martin and Governor Patrick Henry kept a long-running correspondence through the years, some of which concerned real estate speculation. Other letters recounted Martin's dealings with the Indian tribes, as well as settlement efforts in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hwLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22patrick+henry%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FxCfxmMUlR&amp;sig=Hbj-jyV0kf5TQtmUBMT-fX05wFM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LJy5SdnYD5GYsAPB_9w-&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA28,M1 |title=Letters from Joseph Martin to Patrick Henry, Publications of the Southern History Association, Vol. VI, Published by the Association, Washington, D.C., 1902 |publisher=Google Books |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1790, Patrick Henry wrote Joseph Martin concerning a real estate investment, holding out that the hope, Henry noted, that Martin might finally capitalize on his long service to Virginia. "After all the Hazards you have run," Henry wrote, "that you have not acquired so much property as many others would have done in your situation, I was desirous to throw something in your way by which some fine lands would have been offered to you in our purchase." &lt;ref name="WWHv3" /&gt;{{rp|409}}

==Career as an Indian agent==
[[File:Joseph Martin Henry Lee.gif|thumb|left|175px|Letter from Joseph Martin, Jr. to Virginia Governor [[Henry Lee III|Henry Lee]] discussing [[Powell Valley]], ca 1791]]
Ultimately, General Martin lost his appointment as chief Indian agent. Martin's "manner of treating with the Indians necessarily prevented his appointment," Senator Richard Henry Lee informed Patrick Henry in September 1789. "At present no such office as a standing Indian agent is appointed. The Government of the Western Territory is charged with such affairs."&lt;ref name="WWHv3" /&gt;{{rp|404}}

In some quarters Martin was seen as too lenient with the Indians, especially after an incident in 1786&lt;ref&gt;The previous year, in April 1785, Patrick Henry first warned Joseph Martin that the encroachment of settlers of the secessionist [[State of Franklin]], by usurping Cherokee lands without payment, was upsetting arrangements previously reached between the state of Virginia and the tribe. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eB5CAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22patrick+henry%22&amp;ei=lrW5Sf_5Go-qkATYy937Cw#PPA294,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; when several young Cherokee warriors were said to have murdered two white settlers near [[Clinch Mountain]]. The killings set off calls for retribution within the [[secessionist]] State of Franklin, and Martin found himself trying to mediate the dispute, and calm the settlers, while trying to prevent the angry Cherokees from joining with the Creeks.&lt;ref&gt;Early in the creation of the [[State of Franklin]], Joseph Martin had been elected by the Franklin Council to serve on the new colony's [[Privy Council]], but Martin wrote Henry that he had rejected the post, thinking that it would conflict with his duties as a Virginia agent to the Indians.[https://books.google.com/books?id=FpcLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA275&amp;dq=%22patrick+henry%22+%22joseph+martin%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=zf-_ScKyC5DSkwSRqYmwCQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Martin did little to disguise his contempt for the authorities of the State of Franklin, who, Martin wrote Henry, "immediately marched into the above mentioned Town, where they killed one Young [Indian] woman, and Shot Several others."&lt;ref name="WWHv3" /&gt;{{rp|373}}

But Martin himself had not hesitated to wield military power against the Cherokees, especially when they killed several colonists at the instigation of Loyalist and English agents during the Revolution. In 1781, following a running battle between Indian forces and those of the colonists, [[Colonel]] [[Arthur Campbell (Virginia)|Arthur Campbell]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Campbell County, Tennessee]] was named for Virginia legislator Arthur Campbell.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Sevier]] and Martin addressed a letter to the Indian chiefs, warning them about their actions. "You know you began the war," the bulletin began, "by listening to the bad councils of the [[King of England]] and the falsehoods told you by his agents." Further hostilities, the three colonial leaders warned, would result in a military campaign against the Indian villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSUSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=%27DANIEL+BOONE%22+%22JOSEPH+MARTIN%27&amp;lr=&amp;ei=7T27SaUdj8CVBM6HmdML#PPA346,M1 |title=History of Southwest Virginia, 1746–1786, Washington County, 1777–1870, Lewis Preston Summers, J.

Hill Printing Company, Richmond, Virginia, 1903 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years later, in 1788, Martin again fought the Overmountain [[Cherokee]], as well as the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]], in a battle at [[Lookout Mountain]], during the [[Cherokee–American wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oehdFaphbYoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA286&amp;lpg=RA2-PA286&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+tennessee+general+assembly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EHv1KqvDtc&amp;sig=b2zu5MdD-mv0JBVt2X_mfvZ46hA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=apS8SZ21EZKWsQOXu4yeAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA121,M1 |title=The History of Hamilton County and Chattanooga, Tennessee, Vol. II, Zella Armstrong, The Overmountain Press, 1993, ISBN 0-932807-99-2 |publisher=Google Books |date=September 15, 2003 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But having eventually struck a hard-won peace with the tribes, Martin bridled at the actions of the [[State of Franklin]]. Henry empathized with Martin, writing the General in May 1785 that "the disorderly behavior of the Franklin people, as they call themselves, gives me concern. If they will not be subservient to the Rules and Regulations respecting Indian affairs, which prevail in all the States, they must expect none of the advantages of the Union."&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Martin and others saw the conduct of the State of Franklin settlers, who urged secession from the new union, as endangering much of what had been accomplished on the frontier. They also saw it in economic terms as driving a wedge between the newly created states and perhaps encouraging encroachment by the always-feared Spanish interests, especially on the Mississippi and in the western territories. As large land speculators, this fear was probably uppermost in the minds of many Virginia gentry.[https://books.google.com/books?id=eB5CAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22patrick+henry%22&amp;ei=lrW5Sf_5Go-qkATYy937Cw#PPA374,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Partisans of the State in N[orth] Carolina afterwards found him obnoxious to their views," former Governor Henry wrote Virginia Senator [[William Grayson]] in urging Martin's reappointment in 1789, "and as I believe often endangered his Life For his duty called him to discourage their Disorderly conduct [and] thwart their favorite Schemes." Henry then commended Martin for his efforts to impose restraints upon the actions of the State of Franklin settlers, whose "frequent Butcherys of Indians &amp; Refinement in cruelty sufficiently characterize these people who are Mr Martins decided Foes."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i5RADFeMCg8C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=%22patrick+henry%22+%22joseph+martin%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=7QTASduzMpvukQSQsKDwCw |title=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. XIV-No. 1, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, Virginia, 1906 |publisher=Google Books |date=May 1, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Happy While United colonial medal.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Happy While United'', bronze medals struck by [[State of Virginia]] in 1780, carried by Martin for distribution to Cherokee allies of Virginia colonists fighting British rule]]
Martin's attempts to restrain the [[State of Franklin]] settlers from a more-belligerent course made Martin unacceptable in some quarters, where he was seen as too 'soft' on the tribesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Joseph|title=[Letter] 1785 Sept. 19, Chotee [i.e., Chota ?] to Gov[ernor of North Carolina, Richard] Caswell|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/zlna/id:ch013|website=Southeastern Native American Documents, 1730-1842|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin also became controversial in some quarters are the [[Treaty of Hopewell]] in 1785, when Martin, [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]] and [[Benjamin Hawkins]], acting as government agents, concluded treaties with the Cherokees and the Choctaws. The Cherokee treaty particularly engendered later enmity from the Indian signatories, as well as the colonial state governments. The Indians saw the treaty as a thinly-veiled land grab, and the state governments saw the treaty as an attempt to encroach on local government authority, and attempts were made in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to void it. "No action of Martin's life brought down on him more condemnation than this [the Hopewell Treaty]," wrote historian Stephen B. Weeks of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGOSEXzyo-oC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22thomas+jefferson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vPixDB826K&amp;sig=Z7koXYwkWX5JWybeb7hqNVlHJJA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vsGzS7WjHJHYNaOEwJsJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAUQ6AEwADhk#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joseph%20martin%22%20&amp;f=false |title=Joseph Martin, Stephen B.

Consequently, his appointment as agent was not renewed, despite Henry's repeated entreaties to political allies for Martin's reinstatement.

Later Judgments on Martin's career as an Indian agent have been mixed. Writing in 1894, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] called Martin "a firm friend of the red race, [who] had earnestly striven to secure justice for them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FHcOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA321&amp;lpg=PA321&amp;dq=%22general+joseph+martin%22+knox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SG0gOrfymG&amp;sig=VVb3G92503J9D37KDZS58vvea9E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=A0TvS4_4PIX2sgPvlej0Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22general%20joseph%20martin%22%20knox&amp;f=false The Winning of the West: The Founding of the Trans-Alleghany Commonwealths 1784–1790, Vol. 3, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1894]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative service==
In his peripatetic life on the frontier, Martin was called upon to serve in the legislatures of several states. He served as a member of the [[North Carolina]] Convention called to approve the [[United States Constitution]], and served several times in the [[North Carolina General Assembly]]. Martin was subsequently elected to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], until he finally chose to retire because of advanced age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSUSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=%27DANIEL+BOONE%22+%22JOSEPH+MARTIN%27&amp;lr=&amp;ei=7T27SaUdj8CVBM6HmdML#PPA749,M1 |title=History of Southwest Virginia, 1746–1786, Washington County, 1777–1870, Lewis Preston Summers, J.

During his time in the Virginia legislature, Martin was one of the primary supporters of [[James Madison]]'s [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josephmartinchapter.org/josephmartin.html |title=Biography of Joseph Martin, General Joseph Martin Chapter, Tennessee Society of the Sons of the American Revolution |publisher=Josephmartinchapter.org |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his military service in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Martin was elected to the Georgia legislature in 1783.

Martin was also initially a member of the [[Watauga Association]], which supported the founding of the State of Franklin. Martin subsequently resigned his membership when he saw that it might compromise his role as Indian agent.

In 1799, Martin and his old friend Major John Redd of Henry County served as the two county representatives on the Virginia commission relating to the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMPyo8TrY-IC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+%22thomas+jefferson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1oVQdcq2u4&amp;sig=YZFu0ukQaLhlU-IKWeWBqKXexTg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yM6zS821OpWINv3woJEJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAjhu#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The Virginia Report of 1799–1800 Touching the Alien and Sedition Laws; Together with the Virginia Resolutions of December 21, 1799, Originally published by J.W.

==Family life, legacy, and descendants==
Gen. Joseph Martin, Jr.'s first wife was Sarah Lucas. They were both born in Virginia and together had five children, including Revolutionary War officer, Col. William L. Martin, who eventually moved to Smith County, in Middle Tennessee. 

After Sarah Lucas Martin's death, Joseph Martin, Jr. married Susannah Graves in Henry County, Virginia. They had 12 children, all of whom were born in Virginia, including: Col. Joseph Martin of Henry County, Va. He was one of five of Gen. Martin's sons who served in the [[War of 1812]].

Another Martin son, and veteran of the War of 1812, was Patrick Henry Martin. He was a young, trained lawyer, and died a bachelor on his trip home after the war. He was named in honor of Gen. Martin's friend and neighbor, Governor Patrick Henry. Gen. Martin's son, Capt. Lewis Graves Martin, also a veteran of the War of 1812, moved from Henry County, Virginia to Rutherford/Cannon County in Middle Tennessee, in 1816, where he married Belinda Rucker (daughter of Gideon Rucker, Sr. &amp; Joyce Reade; both of whom were born in Va. and moved to Middle Tennessee). They had a large family before Belinda's death in the late 1830s. Capt. Lewis G. Martin remarried and removed to Missouri in 1840. Another Martin son, and veteran of the War of 1812, was Thomas Martin. He also moved to Middle Tennessee where he married Georgia Carr (daughter of Dabney Carr). Alexander Martin, another son and veteran of the War of 1812, also moved to Middle Tennessee. He married Elizabeth Carr (daughter of John Fyndall Carr, also a Tennessean from Virginia), and after some years, moved to Missouri. Another son of Gen. Martin and Susannah Graves was Esq. Judge John C. Martin, who also moved to Middle Tennessee in the days following the War of 1812, where he became a judge and chairman of the Cannon County courts, and served five terms as county executive. He was also responsible for the construction of the original Cannon County court house, erected in 1830. He married Sophia Rucker, sister to his brother Lewis' wife, Belinda.

Other children of Gen. Martin include: Martha Martin Cleveland, Elizabeth Martin Waller (1768 - 1805), Brice Martin (1770 - 1856), Jesse Martin (1786 - 1836), and Susan Martin King (1799 - 1867). 

Gen. Martin also had two children with his half-[[Cherokee]], [[common-law marriage|common law wife]] ("frontier wife"), Elizabeth Ward, daughter of frontiersman Bryant Ward and his wife Nancy, "the beloved woman of the Cherokee." One of their children may have been Nancy Martin Hildebrand (1778 - 1837).

The Native Indian connection of two members of the Martin family has created some confusion for some Martin genealogy researchers; Gen. Joseph Martin's brother, Capt. John "Jack" Calvin Martin, Sr., of his N.C. Rock House Plantation, a.k.a. Rock Castle Plantation, is often confused with his brother Gen. Joseph Martin. Capt. John "Jack" Martin, Sr. moved from Virginia to N.C. with his brother William Martin, Sr.. In N.C. Capt. John "Jack" Martin, Sr. married a Miss Emory, who was half Native American. She died early in their marriage. Her widower, "Jack," then married her sister, a second Miss Emory. This same Capt. John "Jack" Martin, Sr. and his Emory wife were the parents of a John Calvin Martin, Jr. who served as a judge on the supreme court of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, although he was only 1/4 Cherokee. This Oklahoma judge was the older cousin of the Tennessee judge of the same name; the son of Gen. Joseph Martin and wife Susannah Graves, as mentioned earlier; Esq. Judge, John C. Martin of Tennessee. There were two Martin cousins with the same name who both served as judges. Although they were born many miles and many years apart, their identities are sometimes confused by modern researchers looking at the names alone.

Another brother of Gen. Joseph Martin, William Martin, Sr., was the father of Gen. William "Buck" Martin, Jr., who served in the War of 1812 on Andrew Jackson's staff.

Gen. Martin, after helping adjudicate the western boundary line between [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]], and Virginia as far as the [[Cumberland Mountains]], retired to his plantation ''Belmont'' on [[Leatherwood Creek (Virginia)|Leatherwood Creek]], which he had purchased in 1796 from [[Benjamin Harrison V]] of [[Berkeley Plantation]], which was originally built by a Capt. John Martin who was possibly the great-uncle of General Joseph Martin. General Joseph Martin died at his plantation on December 18, 1808, and was buried there in the family cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99ERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA113|title=Reminiscences of Western Virginia, Major John Redd, The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. VII, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, Va., 1899 |publisher=Google Books |date=May 1, 2009 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/genjosmartin/cemetery1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:34:52 The Martin Family Cemetery on Belmont(e) Plantation, geocities.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Buried in the family graveyard are three other Joseph Martins: [[Colonel]] Joseph Martin, son of the general, his son Joseph, and his grandson Joseph, who lived at ''Greenwood'' plantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3f7i_buckMC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+albemarle+county&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R9KuWTlFV3&amp;sig=-Z-ujkPnmEbndunZDIc4m26h55w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XnTVSsH5K5H6sQOx_8TaAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Tennessee Records: Tombstone Inscriptions and Manuscripts, Jeannette Tillotson Acklen, Reprinted by Heritage Books, 2007, ISBN 978-0-7884-2144-0 |publisher=Google Books |date=June 1, 1980 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Colonel William Martin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Col.

==Toby's freedom==
General Joseph Martin, Jr. [[History of slavery in Virginia|owned a slave]] named 'Toby' from the time Toby was about 25 years old, and in his letters to historian [[Lyman Draper]], Martin's son Col. William Martin told Draper that Toby, "a bright mulatto, a little under middle stature, of great physical powers, as well as mental" had served his father for many years and had distinguished himself in several battles. It was General Martin's intention, noted his son, that Toby [[Manumission|be freed]] at Joseph Martin's death, but the General died [[intestate]].

Taking note of the General's affection for his longtime servant, as well as the Martin's family members' sentiments toward Martin's constant companion, the family elected "by mutual consent" to leave Toby out of the inventory of General Martin's [[Estate (law)|estate]], and Toby "has ever since been free, and has made himself a good estate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdQRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA443&amp;lpg=PA443&amp;dq=%22joseph+martin%22+tennessee+general+assembly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PVDvovvYQ9&amp;sig=uZx4aJxTeYFMn9fC-X9MBuxH2O0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8n-8SfyWHZnMsAPMnY2eAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA446,M1 |title=Publications of the Southern History Association, Vol. IV, Published by the Association, Washington, D.

'''Kering S.A.''' ({{IPA-fr|kɛːʁiŋ|lang}}) is an international luxury group based in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It owns [[luxury goods]] brands, including [[Gucci]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Balenciaga]], [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]], [[Bottega Veneta]], [[Boucheron]] and [[Brioni (fashion)|Brioni]], [[Pomellato]].

The company was founded in 1963. It was known as '''Pinault S.A.''' until 1994, as '''Pinault-Printemps-Redoute''' from 1994 to 2005, as '''PPR''' from 2005 to 2013, and became Kering in 2013. It has been quoted on [[Euronext Paris]] since 1988 and has been a constituent of the [[CAC 40]] index since 1995. The company has been headed by [[François-Henri Pinault]] since 2005.

== History ==
=== Building a retail empire with wood ===
In 1963, with a loan from his family and a bank, [[François Pinault]] opened the ''Établissements Pinault'' in [[Brittany]] (France) and specialized in timber trading. The company grew organically and through successful acquisitions. In 1988, Pinault S.A. was listed on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]], multiplying the group’s financial power.

In 1989, it purchased 20% of [[CFAO]], a French distribution conglomerate active throughout [[Africa]]. In 1990, Pinault S.A. and CFAO merged, and François Pinault became head of the newly formed group. This accelerated its acquisitions in the retail sector: [[Conforama]] (French furniture retailer) in 1991, [[Printemps]] (department stores in Paris) in 1992, which also owned 54% of [[La Redoute]] (French mail-order shopping retailer), and [[Fnac]] (French bookstore, multimedia and electronics retailer) in 1994. To align the group’s identity with its new activities, it was renamed Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) in 1994.

=== Offloading retail assets to invest in luxury ===
[[File:PPR SA.svg|thumb|right|Former logo of the company, when it was known as PPR (Pinault-Printemps-Redoute)]]
In 1999, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute purchased a controlling 42% stake of the [[Gucci group]] for $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/05/27/europe/gucci/|title=Gucci fades on court ruling|website=Cnn.com|date=27 May 1999|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Gucci deal, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute also acquired the brand [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/20/business/fi-19096|title=Gucci Group Agrees to Sell 40% Stake to French Retailer|website=Latimes.com|date=20 March 1999|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1999/11/16/gucci-to-buy-parent-of-yves-saint-laurent/1971b749-2e0c-448f-86b3-57dd492b6999/|title=Gucci to Buy Parent Of Yves Saint Laurent|website=Washingtonpost.com|date=16 November 1999|author=Sri Ramakrishnan|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It confirmed this new strategy with its following acquisitions, which included the French high-jewelry house [[Boucheron]] (2000), the Italian leather goods maker [[Bottega Veneta]], and the fashion house [[Balenciaga]] (2001). In 2001, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute also signed strategic partnerships with ex-[[Givenchy]] fashion designer [[Alexander McQueen]] and with [[Stella McCartney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeil |first1=Peter |last2=Riello |first2=Giorgio |date=19 May 2016 |title=Luxury: A Rich History |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsowDAAAQBAJ |language= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191640278|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a new strategy for the group, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute offloaded its assets in the retail sector one after the other: Pinault Bois et Matériaux, upon which the whole group developed and grew, was acquired in 2003 by the British group [[Wolseley plc|Wolseley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citywire.co.uk/money/ooh-la-la-wolseley-gets-heavy-in-france/a247731|title=Ooh la la, Wolseley gets heavy in France|website=Citywire.co.uk|date=24 April 2003|author=Joanne Wallen|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, François Pinault handed over the helm of [[Groupe Artémis|Artémis]], the family holding company that controlled Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and other assets ([[Château Latour]], [[Christie’s]], etc.), to his son François-Henri. In 2004, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute acquired almost all of the remaining shares of the [[Gucci group]] to reach a 99.4% ownership of the Italian luxury company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2004/03/23/ppr-moves-to-buy-last-30-of-gucci-group/|title=PPR moves to buy last 30% of Gucci Group|website=Nypost.com|date=23 March 2004|author=Suzanne Kapner|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, François-Henri Pinault chose a hands-on approach to managing Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and decided to take over the position of CEO.&lt;ref name="nyt curtain"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/t-magazine/the-man-behind-the-curtain.html|title=The Man Behind the Curtain|website=Nytimes.com|date=15 February 2013|author=Joshua Levine|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group officially changed its name to PPR.

The divestment of the group’s retail assets continued: Le Printemps (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-ppr.html|title=As sales fall, PPR works to unload Printemps|website=Nytimes.com|date=20 June 2006|author=Sara Gay Forden, Jacqueline Simmons|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conforama (2011), CFAO and Fnac (2012), and La Redoute (2013). In the meantime, PPR acquired the [[Sowind Group]] (owner of Swiss high-end watchmaker [[Girard-Perregaux]]) and the Italian bespoke tailor [[Brioni (fashion)|Brioni]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204190704577026011411533018|title=PPR Buys Menswear Brand Brioni|website=Wsj.com|date=8 November 2011|author=Christina Passariello|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian group [[Pomellato]] (Pomellato and Dodo jewelry brands),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwd.com/accessories-news/jewelry/kering-acquires-pomellato-6906980/|title=Kering Acquires Pomellato|website=Wwd.com|date=24 April 2013|author=Luisa Zargani, Miles Socha|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese jeweler [[Qeelin]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fashionunited.com/executive/management/ppr-acquires-majority-stake-in-chinese-qeelin-20121112490803|title=PPR acquires majority stake in Chinese Qeelin|website=Fashiounited.com|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fashion designer [[Christopher Kane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/christopher-kane-bought-by-ppr-majority-stake-acquisition|title=PPR Buys Majority Stake In Christopher Kane|website=Vogue.co.uk|date=15 January 2013|author=Ella Alexander|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and luxury watch manufacturer [[Ulysse Nardin]] (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethdoerr/2014/07/30/kering-previously-ppr-gucci-group-acquires-ulysse-nardin/|title=Kering (Previously PPR, Gucci Group) Acquires Ulysse Nardin|website=Forbes.com|date=30 July 2014|author=Elizabeth Doerr|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PPR also developed a Sport &amp; Lifestyle portfolio with the acquisition of [[Puma SE|Puma]] in 2007,&lt;ref name="nyt curtain"/&gt; [[Cobra Golf]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgolf.com/newswire/browse/62896-Puma-acquires-Cobra-Golf-and-announces-becoming-Cobra-Puma-Golf|title=Puma acquires Cobra Golf and announces becoming Cobra-Puma Golf|website=Worldgolf.com|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Volcom]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/ppr-to-buy-sportswear-company-volcom/?_r=0|title=PPR to Buy Volcom, a Sportswear Maker|website=Nytimes.com|date=2 May 2011|author=Chris V.

===Kering, a new luxury company===
[[File:Hôpital Laennec de Paris ext 1.JPG|thumb|right|The company's head office in [[Paris]] at 40 rue de Sèvres, formerly the [[:fr:Hôpital Laennec de Paris|Hôpital Laennec]]]]
On March 22, 2013, PPR changed its name to Kering in order to fully achieve the group’s shift towards luxury goods.  Pronounced {{IPA-fr|kɛːʁiŋ|}}, to sound like the English word "[[wikt:caring#English|caring]]", the new name is a reference to the Pinault family’s region of origin, [[Brittany]], where ''[[wikt:kêr#Breton|kêr]]'' means "home". The new logo has an [[owl]] as its emblem, a bird that can rotate its head 270 degrees, giving it extraordinary vision, and François Pinault’s favorite animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/business/global/ppr-to-show-breton-roots-with-rebranding-as-kering.html|title=PPR to Show Breton Roots With Rebranding as Kering|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes official"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2013/06/18/its-official-ppr-becomes-kering-reportedly-in-talks-to-acquire-richard-mille/|title=It's Official: PPR Becomes Kering; Reportedly In Talks To Acquire Richard Mille|website=Forbes.com|date=18 June 2013|author=Anthony DeMarco|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, [[Alessandro Michele]], an unknown accessories designer, was named creative director of Gucci, and quickly revitalized the brand’s creativity, fashion relevance, and profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d9f408e1-8022-32c3-b3d5-8b510da100ac|title=Kering reports strongest revenue growth since 2012|website=Ft.com|date=10 February 2017|author=Harriet Agnew|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg surge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-26/kering-shares-surge-after-gucci-s-strongest-growth-in-20-years|title=Gucci's Latest Revival Fueled by Sequins Rather Than Sex|website=Bloomberg.com|date=26 April 2017|author=Robert William|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2014 to 2017, Gucci's sales doubled from 3,497.2 million euros to 6,211.2 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/bof-exclusive-marco-bizzarri-on-guccis-remarkable-turnaround|title=Marco Bizzarri on Gucci’s Remarkable Turnaround|website=Businessoffashion.com|date=27 October 2016|author=Limei Hoang|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, following [[Hedi Slimane]]’s four-year success at the creative helm of Yves Saint Laurent, Kering named a new creative director, [[Anthony Vaccarello]], to pursue the evolution of the brand while maintaining its growth pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashionista.com/2017/02/kering-sales-full-year-2016|title=10 months after Hedi Slimane's departure, Yves Saint Laurent is still Kering's big money-maker|website=Fashionista.com|date=10 February 2017|author=Maura Brannigan|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Kering named Georgian-born designer [[Demna Gvasalia]] as creative director of [[Balenciaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/02/demna-gvasalia-reinvigorates-balenciaga-with-strategic-disrespect|title=Demna Gvasalia reinvigorates Balenciaga with strategic disrespect|website=Theguardian.com|date=2 October 2016|author=Jess Cartner-Morley|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Kering announced it has agreed to sell its shares of [[Stella McCartney]] to its eponymous owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2018/03/kering-offloads-entire-stake-stella-mccartney/|title=Kering offloads entire stake in Stella McCartney|website=Retailgazette.co.uk|date=29 March 2018|author=Ben Stevens|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, Kering announced its intention to sell the sportswear company [[Volcom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/kering-to-sell-volcom|title=Kering to Sell Volcom|website=Businessoffashion.com|date=6 April 2018|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, Kering also offloaded its shares of [[Puma SE|Puma]], retaining a minor 15.7%, thus becoming a pure player in luxury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.just-style.com/news/kering-officially-spins-off-puma_id133534.aspx|title=Kering officially spins off Puma|website=Just-style.com|date=16 May 2018|author=Beth Wright|accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commitments ==
=== Sustainability ===
In April 2012, Kering committed to a 4-year plan aiming to significantly reducing its impact on the environment. The group defined a set of quantifiable targets covering both environmental and social issues, and developed the Environmental Profit &amp; Loss account (E P&amp;L) to measure its progress.&lt;ref name="bof report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/bof-exclusive-kering-goes-public-with-sustainability-report-revealing-progress-and-pain-points|title=Kering Goes Public with Sustainability Report, Revealing Progress and Pain Points|website=Businessoffashion.com|date=3 May 2016|author=Kate Abnett|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After publishing its 2016 sustainability report,&lt;ref name="bof report"/&gt; Kering announced its new sustainability program, targeting a 40% reduction of its global environmental impact by 2025, a strategy aligned with the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/fashion/franois-henri-pinault-kering-sustainability.html|title=François-Henri Pinault, Kering Chief, on Why Green Is the New Black|website=Nytimes.com|date=25 January 2017|author=Elizabeth Paton|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/business_models/libby_maccarthy/kering_transform_luxury_industry_next_gen_sustainable|title=Kering to Transform Luxury Industry with Next-Gen Sustainability Strategy|website=Sustainablebrands.com|date=26 January 2017|author=Libby MacCarthy|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kering Foundation===
{{main article|Kering Foundation}}
The Kering Foundation is committed to defending women’s dignity and rights by combating violence against women and promoting women’s empowerment. Since 2009, the Foundation initiated 47 partnerships with NGOs and supported many social projects oriented towards women’s rights.

Many brands have their own philanthropic projects with the support of the Kering Foundation. Gucci launched its project ''Chime for Change'', an international campaign to raise funds for women’s emancipation, focusing on education, health and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/28/chime-for-change-campaign-beyonce-help-girls-run-the-world_n_2784192.html |title=Chime For Change Campaign, Beyoncé Launch Initiative To Help Girls Run The World |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date= 2013-01-03|accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Tax evasion by Marco Bizzarri ===

In 2018 a network of international journalists, the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC), received leaked documents that provide insight into Kerings tax evasion strategies. The CEO of Gucci, Marco Bizzarri, by contract received a net salary of 8 million Euros. To pay as little tax as possible for this salary a special strategy was formed by Kering. That included a residence in Switzerland and two contracts for Bizzarri, one in Italy and one in Luxemburg. The salary was then paid by a shell corporation in Luxemburg. Using this strategy € 9,49 million gross gained Bizzarri € 8,04 net income.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/gucci-chef-marco-bizzarri-mogelte-millionengehalt-an-der-steuer-vorbei-a-1190037.html&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement Kering said that it's methods were within given laws.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kering-gucci-tax/kering-says-gucci-boss-tax-compliant-in-italy-after-report-idUSKBN1FF2SN&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible tax evasion ===
 
In November 2017 Italian authorities opened a criminal investigation into a tax case involving Kering and its flagship brand Gucci. The inquiry included a raid on Gucci offices in Florence and Milan. The authorities were looking into whether Gucci should have paid as much as 1.3 billion Euro in past domestic taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/kering-gucci-tax-investigation.html|title=kering-gucci-tax-investigation|website=nytimes.com|date=16 March 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including France and UK, the amount of possible tax evasion by Kering is considered to be up to 2.5 billion Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/evasion-fiscale/article/2018/03/16/le-groupe-francais-de-luxe-kering-aurait-soustrait-2-5-milliards-d-euros-d-impots-selon-mediapart_5272324_4862750.html|title=le-groupe-francais-de-luxe-kering-aurait-soustrait-2-5-milliards-d-euros-d-impots-selon-mediapart|website=lemonde.fr|date=21 March 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2012, [[compLexity Gaming]] announced that Lee would be retiring from professional gaming, ending a career spanning over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complexitygaming.com/news/3631/ compLexity NaDa Announces Retirement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823212356/http://www.complexitygaming.com/news/3631/ |date=23 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Ogsnada.jpg|thumb|right|Yun-yeol in 2011]]
Lee first became known when he participated in an ITV game special where amateur players were pitted against professional players. Lee was the amateur and beat the player Chrh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=38559&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, Lee made his debut as a pro gamer by winning three KPGA tours in three consecutive seasons all in a year's time. When the KPGA tour became the [[MBCGame StarCraft League]], the KPGA tours were deemed equal to MSL wins, resulting in Lee being granted the golden badge, an award for winning three MSLs. Lee topped his KPGA Tour wins with a victory in the Panasonic OnGameNet Starleague. Afterwards Lee went into a slump; though he continued to be a strong player and came in second or first place in various leagues and tournaments, Lee did not win an MSL or OSL until the IOPS Ongamenet Starleague in 2004 or 2005. However, not long afterwards, Lee would enter the darkest period in his career. On 18 July 2005, FiFo reported that Lee's father had been killed in an automobile accident when an intoxicated driver performed an illegal U-turn and collided with his father's vehicle.&lt;ref name="teamliquid.net"&gt;http://www.teamliquid.net/blogs/viewblog.php?topic_id=65799&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lee eventually returned to pro-gaming he began his return to the top. In December 2007, Lee was once again the number one-ranked pro gamer in the KeSPA rankings. It had been a full two years and five months since he had stopped performing in July 2004. Lee's comeback culminated in his victory in the 2006 2nd ShinHan Bank OnGameNet StarLeague. In his winner's interview, Lee dedicated his victory to his father, saying "Yes, it is my first time winning the finals with my mother seated as the audience. But, for this very victory, I give it all to my father, though he didn't make it. From now on, I will do my best for my mother."&lt;ref name="teamliquid.net"/&gt; This victory not only marked a successful comeback performance, but also was Lee's third OSL win, him becoming the first player in history to earn the OSL's Golden Mouse trophy and was Lee's sixth major title win, making him the then most accomplished ''Brood War'' player in the game's history.

In 2007, Lee signed a three-year contract with [[WeMade FOX]] for approximately 690,000 [[United States dollars|USD]].&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Donald |title=Sex, Fame and PC Baangs: How the Orient plays host to PC gaming’s strangest culture |work=PC Gamer UK |date=2005-04-01 |url=http://rossignol.cream.org/?p=284 |accessdate=2006-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202060802/http://rossignol.cream.org/?p=284 |archivedate= 2 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his contract with the organization expired in 2010, Lee announced his intentions to fully switch to ''StarCraft II''. Only after his retirement from ''Brood War'' was he equaled by [[Lee Young-Ho|Lee "Flash" Young-Ho]] for the most achievements in StarCraft: Broodwar. He joined the Korean team and gamer house of Old Generations and quickly became one of the strongest names in the ''StarCraft II'' scene, competing in the [[GOMTV Global StarCraft II League]] Season 2. There he advanced to the round of 8 before being defeated by [[Lim Yo-Hwan|Lim "BoxeR" Yo-Hwan]]. The following season Lee made it to round of 8 again, but was defeated by Lee "MarineKingPrime.WE" Jung-Hoon, losing 3 to 0.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=185712&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2010|10|31}} On July 15, 2011, [[SK Gaming]] announced a joint partnership with Old Generations, allowing for Lee and his teammate, [[Jang Min Chul|Jang "MC" Min Chul]], to be sponsored for international events on behalf of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/33952-SK_acquires_MC_and_NaDa_in_oGs_deal|title=SK acquires MC and NaDa in oGs deal|date=2011-07-15|last=Shields|first=Duncan|publisher=[[SK Gaming]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership between Old Generations and SK Gaming ended on January 13, 2012, with Lee remaining with the former, while Jang remained with the latter until his contract expired at the end of January.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1484">'''Literary activism''' is a form of protest and critique aimed at [[corporate publishing]] houses and the literary fiction/nonfiction that they publish. The progenitors of literary [[activism]] are the members of the [[Underground Literary Alliance]]. This group of writers is notorious for its protests, which have included making formal complaints against [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] grants given to already-wealthy authors, crashing New York literary readings, and maintaining a website which reports weekly on the perceived [[corruption]] and lack of integrity of the current literary world.

Acts of literary activism can also include editing and bringing out writers' work in online and print journals and through book publishers, reading and reviewing that work, writing essays about it, teaching it, talking it up, urging others to launch journals and indies presses, running reading series, laboring in arts administration, coordination innovative writing conferences, launching local writing groups, posting about authors and texts they love on their blogs or via other social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Olsen|Olsen, Lance]] (2012).

Sir Louis, who was considered the wealthiest person in Nigeria at the time, was Nigeria's first recorded [[Millionare]]; and was the founder of Ojukwu Transport, Ojukwu Stores and Ojukwu Textiles. At his peak, he was the first and founding President of The Nigerian Stock Exchange as well as President of The African Continental Bank. He was also either Chairman or on the board of directors of some of Nigeria's most profitable companies such as Shell Oil Nigeria Limited, Guinness Nig. Ltd, Nigerian National Shipping Lines, Nigerian Cement Factory, Nigerian Coal Corporation, Costain West Africa Ltd, John Holt, Nigerian Marketing Board amongst others. He won a parliamentary seat during the nation's first republic. He attended a primary school in [[Asaba, Nigeria|Asaba]] and the Hope Waddell Institute. His son [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu]] was a Nigerian military Governor and the President of the secessionist state of [[Biafra]].

==Life and career==

In 1936 he met Bishop John Cross Anyogu - then a parish priest at Nnewi. Louis was a Roman Catholic. 

Ojukwu started his professional career at the [[Agricultural]] department before leaving to join [[John Holt Plc|John Holt]] as a [[Tire|tyre]] sales clerk. He also incorporated a textile company in [[Onitsha]] to supplement his income during this period, already exhibiting a little bit of his entrepreneurial spirit. While at John Holt, he noticed the severe strain a lack of adequate transportation had on Eastern [[textile]] traders. He later left John Holt to create a transport company to improve the trading environment for Nigerian traders. As a transporter he was a tireless worker and meticulous to detail; he was usually the first to inspect his transport vehicles for oil and leakages. Apart from his work ethic, his success was also oiled by the economic boom after [[World War II]], working with the [[West African Railway Company]] and the newly inaugurated produce boards, he provided his fleet for commodity transportation and for other traders use. As a transporter he had his own transport company (Ojukwu Transport Limited)which was the first major transport company to move the easterners to Lagos from the Asaba end of the Niger river after they might have crossed over from Onitsha on a boat.

During the 1950s, he diversified his interest, bought some industries, invested heavily in the real estate sector and became a director in numerous major corporations including the state-owned [[Nigerian National Shipping Line]]. He was a member of the board of [[Nigerian Coal Corporation]], [[Shell Oil]], [[D'Archy]], and [[African Continental Bank]]. 

During the period of pre-independence and in the [[Nigerian First Republic|First Republic]], Ojukwu was an active member and donor to the political party, [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons|NCNC]]. He was a one-time member of the House of Representative. In 1958, he was chairman of the Eastern Region Development Corporation and the Eastern Regional Marketing Board.{{sfn|Sklar|1963|p=450}} On May 1, 1953, he was appointed head of an NCNC peace committee and given power to choose most of the committee's members. The committee was charged with the responsibility of restoring peace in the regional House of Assembly. His views on policy were a little bit capitalistic and right of [[Azikiwe|Zik's]] socialist undertones.{{sfn|Sklar|1963|p=180}} He was a co-author of a report on the Economic Mission to Europe and North America with Azikiwe, the report recommended the investment of extra funds from the produce marketing board in a regional bank and public corporations to stimulate economic development.{{sfn|Sklar|19638|p=447}}
Ojukwu died in 1966, just a year before the [[Nigerian civil war]]. His son [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu]] was the leader of the secessionist state of [[Biafra]].

The '''Peruvian Amazon Company''', also called the '''Anglo-Peruvian Amazon Rubber Co''',&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt; was a [[rubber boom]] company that operated in Peru in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Based in [[Iquitos, Peru|Iquitos]], it became notorious for the ill treatment of its indigenous workers in the Amazon Basin, whom its field forces treated as virtual slaves. The company's practices were exposed in 1913 by the investigative report of British consul-general [[Roger Casement]] and an article and book by journalist [[W. E. Hardenburg]].

The [[Julio César Arana|Arana Brothers]] company, who had sought capital in London, were fused with the PAC in 1907.&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt;
[[Julio César Arana]] ran the company in Peru.&lt;ref name=merc1/&gt; Its British Board of Directors included [[Kaye baronets|Sir J. Lister Kaye]].&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;

The company operated in the area of the [[Putumayo River]],&lt;ref name=merc1/&gt; a river that flows from the [[Andes]] to join the [[Amazon River]] deep in the tropical jungle. This area was contested at the time among  [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and it was inhabited by numerous [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous people]].&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt;

The company participated in abuses and criminal actions against laborers in the area, with its overseers using force and even killing to suppress the workers. An investigative report by Roger Casement, British consul, exposed the abuses, embarrassing British members of the company's board. They put pressure on Arana to improve operations. A movement grew to stop the abuse and eventually led to the end of the company. The Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society was one of the activist groups working to stop the abuses.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;

W. E. Hardenburg wrote a scathing article in the British magazine ''[[Truth (British periodical)|Truth]]''. The British government in 1910 sent the [[consul-general]] [[Roger Casement]] to investigate. His report also denounced the operations of the PAC. A 1912 book by Hardenburg, which contained edited extracts of Casement's report, was described by its editor as "perhaps the most terrible page in the whole history of commercialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Hardenburg |first = W. E. |editor = C. Reginald Enock |year = 1912 |title = The Putumayo: The Devil's Paradise |location = London |publisher = T. Fisher Unwin |at = [https://archive.org/stream/putumayodevilspa00hardrich#page/n9/mode/2up Preface] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Select Committee of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] published a paper on the investigations in 1913. The British Board of Directors was considered not criminally liable under the [[Slave Trade Act#United Kingdom|Slave Trade Acts]].&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt; However, the Parliament and others moved to tighten up anti-slavery laws. World War I interrupted this work.&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt;

Among the findings by the various investigatory parties were widespread [[debt bondage]], [[slavery]], torture, mutilation, and many other crimes in the Amazonian Rubber industry, with the Putumayo area being but one example. Religious leaders such as Manuel Polit, Bishop of Cuenca in Ecuador, denounced these activities and worked to reform the system.&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt; Organizations such as the Sociedad Pro-Indigena also worked to improve conditions for indigenous workers. The area governments also attempted to implement measures to control the abuses, but it was difficult in the large, sparsely populated countryside, which had few road connections to major cities.&lt;ref name=EB1922/&gt;

Arana was appointed liquidator in September 1911,&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28539|page=7306|date=6 October 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28539|page=7307|date=6 October 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company was forced into closure by a judge in 1913.&lt;ref name=merc1/&gt; After the company was closed, the receiver stated that the shareholders would receive nothing, and the creditors would receive small amounts. He blamed the downfall on the British directors,&lt;ref name=advert1/&gt; the Chairman of whom was known as [[J. Russell Gubbins]].&lt;ref name=lg/&gt;

'''''Project Space Station''''' is a game published in 1985 by [[HESware]], originally written for  the [[Commodore 64]] home computer, then ported to the [[Apple II series]] and [[PC compatible]]s.

==Summary==
In the game the player is put in control of [[NASA]] and tasked with building and maintaining a space station and generating enough money with commercial contracts to make up for an anemic yearly budget. This can be seen as a discrete set of phases, except that they all proceed simultaneously. The exception is at the beginning of the game where the player has unlimited time in the planning phase before the game clock starts.

In the planning phase, the player first allocates the funds they have to various budget items, like crew selection, station modules, and research and development. Then they choose their crew, who have intrinsic task sets (like piloting and physics), and varying levels of competence and compatibility with other potential employees. From there the player purchases equipment like space suits and satellites, and station modules like laboratories and solar arrays. Then they schedule their launches using the two space shuttles available (''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', though the initial release used the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']]), and have their budget approved. In the final stage of the planning phase the player can create a simulated station with an unlimited number of parts, and without dealing with the later constrictions of the EVA.

The launch phase has the player decide whether launch conditions are stable enough to merit launch. If they give the implicit go-ahead, they engage in a light arcade sequence where the player attempts to keep the shuttle on course throughout its orbital burn. The more successful the player is, the closer the shuttle will be to the station.

Once the shuttle is in orbit, the player is tasked to assemble the components they brought up (or to fire off any satellites they have contracts for) in the Extra-Vehicular Activity, or EVA phase. Here the player directly controls an Orbital Construction Pod, a small ship with mechanical arms that an astronaut can use to move large equipment. Being careless here could have consequences as the pod or equipment may become damaged, and it may run out of fuel and become stranded until another pod can rescue it.  Consequences were not limited to equipment damage: Stranded astronauts in pods could die when oxygen ran out.  Other crew hazards included solar flares, which could kill astronauts on the station or shuttle if precautions (using an emergency module in station design) were not taken.  Crew died in reverse alphabetical order from solar flares.

The player then transfers crew to and from the space station and assigns them to research tasks. Completing these tasks awards the player with government contracts that supplement NASA's budget. A math bug (or intentional cheat) in the game allowed an infinite supply of money, if the player allocated more than $10,000K to any budget. For example, if $800k is spent, the budget would be recalculated to $19,200K instead of $9,200, as expected.

Finally the player lands the shuttle. After determining that landing conditions are adequate, the player again keeps the shuttle on course as it turns from the station and enters its descent. Skill here determines how close the shuttle will be to the optimal point from the runway. After this the player controls the shuttle with a simple landing simulator viewed from the side. The more abrupt or overshot the landing, the more damage will be done to the shuttle and the longer it will need to be repaired before it can venture out on another mission.

The game is played using a menu system. Every option can be queried for in-game help, and every major task has a tutorial that simulates that task without the consequences of failure, and sometimes with additional assistance (like being able to pause a landing attempt). Another major feature is the message system that alerts the player when there are changes to mission status, wherever the player might be within the menu system.

'''''Stratton's Independence, Ltd. v. Howbert''''', 231 U.S. 399 (1913),&lt;ref name=supreme&gt;{{ussc|name=Stratton's Independence, Ltd. v. Howbert|link=|volume=231|page=399|pin=|year=1913}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, was a case before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] that addressed the question of [[Corporate tax|corporate taxation]].

==Case==
The case was argued on October 21, 1913, and decided on December 1, 1913.

Stratton's Independence, Limited, a British corporation that owned and operated mines in [[Colorado]], sued in a district court to recover taxes it had paid under protest in accordance with the provisions of the [[Corporation Tax Act of 1909]]. During the year 1909, the firm had had gross sales of $284,682.85 and costs of $190,939.42, resulting in a profit of $93,743.43. In 1910, the figures had been similar. &lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

===Plaintiff's argument===
Stratton's contended that the mining and sale of [[ore]] was an essentially different sort of activity than manufacturing, because it involved the depletion and sale of capital, and should therefore not be taxed in the same way, because taxing the sale of ore amounted to taxing capital.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

===Majority opinion===
[[Justice Pitney]], in the majority opinion, stated that the case raised three questions. The first was whether or not the Corporate Tax Act applied to mining corporations. The second question raised was whether or not proceeds from mining activities constituted "income" by the definition of the act. The final question related to whether or not ore sales were considered income and therefore if the mining corporation could deduct the value of the ore in place before it was mined as depreciation. The court answered the first two questions in the affirmative, but not the third. Mining, Justice Pitney argued, is generally comparable to manufacturing, and is certainly a business; hence, the gains from this activity should be considered income for the purposes of taxation.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

[[Chief Justice White]], [[Justice McKenna]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Justice Holmes]] dissented on the third question.&lt;ref name=supreme/&gt;

==Significance==
The case represented one of the Supreme Court's early attempts to define the term “income.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Rosenberg| first =Joshua; Daher, Dominic| title =The Law of Federal Income Taxation| work =Hornbook Series| url =https://books.google.no/books?id=iFvaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;lpg=PT104&amp;dq=Stratton%27s+Independence,+Ltd.+v.+Howbert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=plswoeGCL9&amp;sig=ZAwMU6xERSdHJPTaaU4T2fMgCoc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYsZDwrOHNAhVC1ywKHU6kAC0Q6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Stratton's%20Independence%2C%20Ltd.%20v.%20Howbert&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Pitney's description of income as “the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined” has been widely quoted, as has his comment that “the corporation tax act of 1909 was not intended to be and is not, in any proper sense, an [[income tax]] law.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tax-freedom.com/WhatIsIncome.htm | title=What Is Constitutional Taxable Income ? | work=Tax Freedom | accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tax-freedom.com/WhereDoesIncomeComeFrom.htm | title=WHERE DOES INCOME COME FROM ? | work=Tax Freedom | accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has been cited (unsuccessfully) in such cases as ''[[Hill v. United States]]'' and ''[[Cameron v. Internal Revenue Service]], in support of the argument that a tax on an individual's income is unconstitutional, even though the decision in Stratton did not rule either corporate or individual income tax unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFvaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;lpg=PT104&amp;dq=Stratton%27s+Independence,+Ltd.+v.+Howbert+income&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=plsyn9KEQ9&amp;sig=Xc6B-rGgUe9JopYQ6RQYMC9crVU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtmKW_qJfOAhUB04MKHV-eBFQQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Stratton's%20Independence%2C%20Ltd.%20v.%20Howbert%20income&amp;f=false | title=The Law of Federal Income Taxation | publisher=Hornbook | author=Rosenberg, Joshua; Daher, Dominic | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLxBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=Stratton%27s+Independence,+Ltd.+v.+Howbert+income&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TU41Zz_VYP&amp;sig=0NR2DknaS7l8GzYgUvYk94mcemQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtmKW_qJfOAhUB04MKHV-eBFQQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Stratton's%20Independence%2C%20Ltd.%20v.%20Howbert%20income&amp;f=false | title=Federal Income Tax Laws Correlated and Annotated | publisher=John Byrne &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denny''' (2 April 1818 – 25 December 1909)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of the Salvation Army : 1904-1914 |last=Wiggins |first=Arch R. |year=1964 |publisher=Nelson |isbn= |volume= v. 5 |page=261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Irish people|Irish]] bacon merchant, a self-described "pork philanthropist". Although not a member of the [[Salvation Army]], he supported it financially. His philanthropic activities also included support for education. In April 1868, he married Mary Jane Noel (1829-1887), daughter of [[Baptist Wriothesley Noel]]. In 1893, he married the evangelist [[Elizabeth Hope]], who was 24 years his junior.

==Salvation Army==
Denny was one of a small group of wealthy benefactors who sustained the Salvation Army in its early years. He attended meetings called in 1877 by [[Samuel Morley (MP)|Samuel Morley]], another benefactor, to discuss differences with [[William Booth]], after which he continued to provide financial support despite continuing to disagree with Booth about doctrine and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The General: William Booth |last=Bennett |first=David Malcolm |year=2003 |publisher=[[Xulon Press]] |isbn=978-1-59467-206-4 |page=122–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His support included, in 1881, paying the first year's rent on the organisation's headquarters at 101 [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]] in [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Salvation Army year book |year=1961 |publisher=[[Salvation Army|Salvationist Publishing and Supplies]] |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and supporting the establishment of the Army in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Short Life of Catherine Booth the Mother of the Salvation Army |last=[[Frederick Tucker (Salvation Army)|St George De Lautour Booth-Tucker]]|first=Frederick |year=2005 |publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-4179-6984-5 |page=342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882 he contributed to the repayment of debts incurred for the building of barracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Salvation Army |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3408744|work=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=10 July 1882 |accessdate=2009-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational philanthropy==
In 1890 Denny provided most of the funding for the buildings occupied by [[University of Greenwich|Woolwich Polytechnic]] and served as chairman of its board from 1891 to 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=London Higher: The Establishment of Higher Education in London |last=Floud |first=Roderick |author2=Sean Glynn  |year=1998 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-485-11524-6 |pages=180–181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">A '''theatre consultant''' is a [[consultant]] who specializes in the design of facilities for the [[performing arts]], equipment for those facilities and the operation of [[theatre]].

Professional consultants provide unbiased, functionally sound, practical consulting and design services for performance and public assembly facilities of all kinds.[[Architects and owners | Owners and architects]] use their expertise to programme, plan and help with the construction of these kinds of complicated buildings. Their [[professional organization]] in the [[United States]] is the [[American Society of Theatre Consultants]] (ASTC). The [[United Kingdom British | international]] equivalent organisation is the [[Society | Institute]] of Theatre Consultants [[(STC)| (IoTC)]].  There are also many Theatre Consultants that are not members of these organisations.  Unlike the practice of architecture or engineering, theatre consulting is not regulated by [[professional license, but the Institute of Theatre Consultants accredits Theatre Consultants on the basis of proven work, operates a Code of Practice and provides training to members]].

Consultants are generally expert in building codes and the requirements of the American with Disabilities Act as related to theatres, auditoria, and concert halls.  They typically provide detailed design for special theatre systems such as performance lighting systems, [[Fly system|stage rigging]], orchestra pit lifts, seating (fixed and movable), acoustical canopies and more.  Some theatre consulting firms also provide acoustical and/or audio-visual '''consulting''', although those are specialties in their own right.

Theatre Consultants may work directly for a facility or organisation, or they may be contracted as a specialty (sub)consultant for a Project Architect or Engineer.  Services can range from programmatic planning for the development of new facilities, planning for the refurbishment or repurposing of existing facilities, or just (re)design or assessment of specific production systems.

''For declaration of conformity see [[Conformance mark]]''

'''Type approval''' or '''certificate of conformity''' is granted to a product that meets a minimum set of regulatory, technical and safety requirements.  Generally, type approval is required before a product is allowed to be sold in a particular country, so the requirements for a given product will vary around the world. Processes and certifications known as ''type approval'' in English are generally called '''[[homologation]]''', or some cognate expression, in other European languages.

[[Compliance (regulation)|Compliance]] to type-approval requirements can be denoted by a third-party marking on the back of the product (e.g. ABS, [[Technischer Überwachungsverein|TÜV]], UL, CSA, [[Kiwa NV|KIWA]]), or by a type-approval certificate obtained by a manufacturer and kept on file.  The [[CE mark]] found on the back of many electronic devices does not mean that the product has obtained type approval in the [[European Union]]. The CE mark is the manufacturer's declaration that the system/assembly meets the minimum safety requirements of all the directives (laws) applicable to it, and of itself, does not signify any third party involvement in the design or testing of a system/assembly. Many of the New Approach{{explain|date=October 2018}} safety directives do not mandate third party involvement at all (e.g. LVD, EMD), and the ones that do (e.g. PED, MDD, ATEX) only require notified body (NoBo) involvement above a certain degree of risk category. When the risk category mandates this involvement, the CE Marking on the system/assembly will be followed by the NoBo number, which right to use is granted by the NoBo after the required design review, testing or auditing, as spelled out in the Conformity Assessment options of each directive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150510230524/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/cemarking/about-ce-marking/index_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in [[China]] type approval is denoted by the [[China Compulsory Certificate|CCC mark]].

Type approval is not a term confined to a particular [[industry]]. Type approval requirements exist for products as diverse as marine equipment, mobile phones, [[automotive industry]], or medical equipment. Type approval simply means that the product is certified to meet certain requirements for its ''type'', whatever that may be.

==Automotive industry==
{{Main|Motor vehicle type approval|Vehicle category}}
Vehicle type approval is the confirmation that production samples of a design will meet specified performance standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/vehicletype/index.asp VCA Offices] Retrieved 08/29/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, there are two systems of type approval in Europe. The first one is based on the EC directives and regulates the approval of whole vehicles, vehicle systems, and separate components. The second one is part of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe regulations (UNECE) and also regulates the approval of whole vehicles, vehicle systems, and separate components. Recent changes to the requirements have seen the General Safety Regulation (GSR) EC661/2009 amending Directive 2007/46/EC by substituting the equivalent UNECE regulations in place of the EC directives. In effect the directives are being replaced by UNECE regulations. This now makes compliance with the UNECE regulations for type approval submissions compulsory from 1 November 2012 and compulsory for all vehicles entering to service from 1 November 2014.

The new [[framework Directive (disambiguation)|framework directive]] ([[Directive 2007/46/EC]] establishing a framework for the approval of [[motor vehicle]]s and their [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]s, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles)&lt;ref name="Framework Directive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive) Text with EEA relevance|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:263:0001:01:EN:HTML|work=EUR-Lex.europa.eu - Access to European Union law|date=09/10/2007|publisher=publications.europa.eu - Publications Office of the European Union|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; rules the approval schemes of the new motor vehicles and their trailers in the [[European Union]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motor Vehicle Approval Schemes |url=http://www.nsai.ie/index.cfm/area/page/information/motorvehicleapproval |work=Ireland: [[National Standards Authority of Ireland]] |publisher=NSAI.ie |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617234922/http://www.nsai.ie/index.cfm/area/page/information/motorvehicleapproval |archivedate=June 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[European Community Whole Vehicle Type Approval]] (ECWVTA), this currently applies to [[automobile|passenger cars]].  from 29 October 2012, ECWVTA was extended to cover all new road vehicles and their trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EC Whole Vehicle Type Approval - Introduction|url=http://www.vca.gov.uk/vehicletype/ecwvta-framework-directive.asp|work=UK [[Vehicle Certification Agency]], [[Department for Transport]]|publisher=VCA.gov.uk|date=24 September 2009|accessdate=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) regulations.
* [[National Small Series Type Approval]] (NSSTA) - the key advantages of this scheme are that some technical requirements may be reduced in comparison with ECWVTA; however, the number of vehicles that can be manufactured are limited.
* [[Individual vehicle approval]] (IVA) (previously [[single vehicle approval]])

==Telecommunications==
Each jurisdiction that regulates communications requires all types of equipment, and especially radio communications equipment, that are not specifically exempted (by reason of low power output, for instance) to be tested for conformance to local regulations before it is approved for use in that jurisdiction.  Such conformance might include power and noise characteristics, use of permitted frequencies only, frequency stability, and various other electrical parameters.

==Certificates of conformity, conformance or compliance==

===American commerce===
A certificate of conformance [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/certificate-of-conformance.html is defined in American commerce] as a document certified by a competent authority that the supplied good or service meets the required specifications. A certificate of conformance is a lot/datecode specific certification that provides traceability of the goods back to the point of manufacture. 

===American nuclear business===
A certificate of conformity may be required of vendors of goods to nuclear generating stations to get the vendor to legally commit to stating compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

===European commerce===
A CoC or EC Certificate of Conformity is equal to a declaration of the conformity with the type approval of EC. It is produce to ensure the free movement of cars within the European Union, specifically for those cars that are subject to homologation or registration.

A CoC is a producer’s declaration car or motorcycles comply with the given approved type. This document contains information about the vehicle and its producer’s identification, type approval number, other technical specifications. The content of a CoC is defined by the European regulation (Amendment IX, Regulation 92/53). Vehicles which do not comply with the EU specification (as vehicle manufactured for the U.S. or Japanese market) and older vehicles that have not been given the type approval of the EC yet, cannot have an existing CoC. Similarly, it is not possible to issue a CoC for converted vehicles; in this case another technical document might help register your car. Only car and motorcycles are eligible.

====History and legislation====
Certificates of conformity have been defined in EU’s Single Internal Market and Type Approval Directive (EC-92). EU’s single internal market became official on 1 January 1993. Part of the "EC-92" effort was to remove the technical barriers preventing the free movement of products within the EU market. The greatest impact of this effort has been in the area of standards in the automotive sector. The EU Commission is seeking to harmonise the automotive, technical and environmental standards between all the member states. EU legislation defines the standards in the areas of noise, particle emissions and safety. In addition, the EU’s Directive on Type Approval (EU Council Directive 92/53) eliminates the need for national type approval requirements by establishing one set of rules for automobiles and their components throughout the EU. This directive aims at the clarification of the type approval procedure for motor vehicles, separate technical units (i.e., trailers), and components.

It simplifies the documentation, designates the type approval number of a separate technical unit by a certificate of conformity, and defines the vehicles, individual technical units, and components. Certificates of conformity, as specified in Annex IX of EU Directive 92/53, will be required for an automobile to enter into service. For component approvals, an endorsement that is issued under the relevant regulations by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is recognised as equivalent to an approval granted under comparable EU legislation. In March 1992, the EU Council formally adopted the few remaining pieces of component-related legislation that are necessary to make the whole-vehicle type approval a reality for passenger cars. In June 1992, EU member state officials approved the adoption of EU legislation creating a single system for the certification of passenger cars, in turn defining the safety, and other technical, requirements. Legislation established an EU type approval system to replace the national schemes of the twelve member states. In 1996, the EU type approval system became mandatory.

Vehicles with an EU type approval can be marketed anywhere in the European Community. Therefore, a vehicle only needs to receive the type approval certification in one EU country in order to be accepted in all of the other member countries. To receive a type approval, products may either be brought to a testing facility or manufacturers may opt to maintain their own testing equipment. Nevertheless, US and EU automobiles still must be certified to this single set of rules by an authorised member state agency. A similar system was adopted for the type approval of two- and three-wheeled vehicles, which became effective on 1 January 1994.

'''Zahi W. Khouri''' is a [[Palestinian-American]] businessman and entrepreneur, who is best known for his involvement in numerous business ventures in the [[Palestinian territories]].

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Khouri was born into a [[Palestinian Christian]] family in 1938 in the city of [[Jaffa]], then part of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. His family fled the city during the Arab invasion of the coast during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], along with the majority of its [[Arab]] inhabitants, becoming [[Palestinian refugee]]s in neighboring [[Lebanon]]. Khouri has described himself as "a faithful Christian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khouri|first1=Zahi|title=The Palestine Romney doesn’t know|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-palestine-romney-doesnt-know/2012/08/09/5de0bcdc-e235-11e1-98e7-89d659f9c106_story.html|accessdate=2016-03-01|work=The Washington Post|date=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khouri lived in Lebanon until the 1960s, when he moved to [[Germany]] to pursue an advanced degree.&lt;ref name="IMEU"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://imeu.net/news/article003098.shtml |title=Zahi Khouri: Businessman and Entrepreneur |publisher=IMEU |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2015-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012105807/http://imeu.net/news/article003098.shtml |archive-date=12 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khouri earned a [[Master's degree]] in [[Engineering]] from the Stuttgart Institute of Technology, before going on to receive an [[M.B.A.]] from the [[European Institute of Business Administration]], [[INSEAD]] in [[Fontainebleau]], [[France]].&lt;ref name="IMEU"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100820032229/http://www.intram.com/executive_bios.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In 1967, he moved to the [[United States]], where he settled in [[Richmond, Virginia]] and built a career in [[international business]].&lt;ref name="IMEU"/&gt; "Mr. Khouri was an Executive Board Member of the Olayan Group in [[Saudi-Arabia]] (as CEO of Olayan Saudi Holdings) and NY (as CEO of Olayan Development Co) for over 20 years. He also holds a number of civic positions among others, the Chairman of NGO Development Center (NDC) in [[Jerusalem]], the Palestine Business Committee for Peace and Reform (PBCPR) in Washington, the Carter Advisory body in Palestine and Chairman of the local chapter of Partners for New Beginning, affiliated with Aspen Institute".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130415151438/http://psdpal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=161:zahi-w-khouri&amp;catid=68:board-of-directors&amp;Itemid=84&amp;lang=en] &lt;/ref&gt;

Following the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in 1993, which granted limited sovereignty to the [[Palestinians]] in parts of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], Khouri moved back to [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] in order to establish business ventures there along with several other Palestinian entrepreneurs. He helped establish the Palestinian Development and Investment Company (PADICO), the largest Palestinian investment company, as well as the Palestinian National Beverage Company, which manufactures and markets [[Coca-Cola]] products under official [[Franchising|franchise]] in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He was also the CEO of [[Jawwal]], the only Palestinian telecommunications company and cellular service provider.&lt;ref name="IMEU"/&gt;

Khouri has been an outspoken critic of the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation]] of the Palestinian territories and has met with American government officials as a representative of the Palestinian business community to voice concern over the effects of the Israeli occupation and embargo on the Palestinian economy. He has also published editorials in major U.S. newspapers condemning Israeli practices and calling for equal rights for Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khouri |first=Zahi |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061110/news_lz1e10khouri.html |title=A simple road to Middle East peace |publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
