'''Arnaut''' (ارناود) is a [[Turkish language|Turkish]] [[ethnonym]] used to denote [[Albanians]]. ''Arvanid'' (اروانيد), ''Arnavud'' (آرناوود), plural: ''Arnavudlar'' (آرناوودلار): modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: '''''Arnavut''''', plural: ''Arnavutlar''; are ethnoyms used mainly by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and contemporary [[Turkish people|Turks]] for Albanians with ''Arnavutça'' being called the [[Albanian language]].&lt;ref name="Theissen90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anscombe200688"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Arnavudca". ''[http://www.osmanlicayazilisi.com/osmanlica-sozluk-madde-39184.html Osmanlıcayazılışı]''. Retrieved 16 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KerslakeGoksel321"&gt;{{harvnb|Kerslake|Göksel|2014|pp=321}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
These ethnonyms are derived from the Greek term ''[[Arvanites]]'' and entered Turkish after the syllable cluster ''van'' was rearranged through metathesis to ''nav'' giving the final Turkish forms as ''Arnavut'' and ''Arnaut''.&lt;ref name="Theissen90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malcolm, Noel 1998, p.29"&gt;Malcolm, Noel. "Kosovo, a short history". London: Macmillan, 1998, p.29 "The name used in all these references is, allowing for linguistic variations, the same: 'Albanenses' or 'Arbanenses' in Latin, 'Albanoi' or 'Arbanitai' in Byzantine Greek. (The last of these, with an internal switching of consonants, gave rise to the Turkish form 'Arnavud', from which 'Arnaut' was later derived.)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia; Jeffrey E. Cole - 2011, Page 15, "Arbëreshë was the term self-designiation of Albanians before the Ottoman invasion of the 15 century; similar terms are used for Albanian origins populations living in Greece ("Arvanitika," the Greek rendering of Arbëreshë) and Turkey ("Arnaut," Turkish for the Greek term Arvanitika).&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in [[Greek language]] the name ''Arvanitis'' was derived from the original name ''Alvanitis'' [Άλβανίτης] (in return derived from ''Alvanos'' [Άλβάνος]).&lt;ref name="Theissen90"/&gt; The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] borrowed their name for Albanians after hearing it from the [[Byzantine Greeks]].&lt;ref name="Malcolm, Noel 1998, p.29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liakos, Antonis. (2012) Hellenisms: culture, identity, and ethnicity from antiquity to modernity. p. 230. "The term "Arvanite" is the medieval equivalent of "Albanian." it is retained today for the descendants of the Albanian tribes that migrated to the Greek lands during a period covering two centuries, from the thirteenth to the fifteenth."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries due to socio-political disturbances by some Albanians in the Balkans the term was used as an ethnic marker for Albanians in addition to the usual [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]] religious terminology to identify people in Ottoman state records.&lt;ref name="Anscombe200688"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anscombe772"/&gt; While the term used in Ottoman sources for the country was ''Arnavudluk'' (آرناوودلق) for areas such as Albania, Western Macedonia, Southern Serbia, Kosovo, parts of northern Greece and southern Montenegro.&lt;ref name="Anscombe200688"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006|pp=88}}. "This Albanian participation in brigandage is easier to track than for many other social groups in Ottoman lands, because Albanian (''Arnavud'') was one of the relatively few ethnic markers regularly added to the usual religious (Muslim-Zimmi) tags used to identify people in state records. These records show that the magnitude of banditry involving Albanians grew through the 1770s and 1780s to reach crisis proportions in the 1790s and 1800s."; p.107. "In light of the recent violent troubles in Kosovo and Macedonia and the strong emotions tied to them, readers are urged most emphatically not to draw either of two unwarranted conclusions from this article:  that Albanians are somehow inherently inclined to banditry, or that the extent of Ottoman "Albania" or ''Arnavudluk'' (which included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia) gives any historical "justification" for the creation of a "Greater Albania" today."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anscombe772"&gt;{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|p=772}}. "In this case, however, Ottoman records contain useful information about the ethnicities of the leading actors in the story. In comparison with 'Serbs', who were not a meaningful category to the Ottoman state, its records refer to 'Albanians' more frequently than to many other cultural or linguistic groups. The term 'Arnavud' was used to denote persons who spoke one of the dialects of Albanian, came from mountainous country in the western Balkans (referred to as 'Arnavudluk', and including not only the area now forming the state of Albania but also neighbouring parts of Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro), organized society on the strength of blood ties (family, clan, tribe), engaged predominantly in a mix of settled agriculture and livestock herding, and were notable fighters — a group, in short, difficult to control. Other peoples, such as Georgians, Ahkhaz, Circassians, Tatars, Kurds, and Bedouin Arabs who were frequently identified by their ethnicity, shared similar cultural traits."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolovos41"&gt;{{harvnb|Kolovos|2007|p=41}}. "Anscombe (ibid., 107 n. 3) notes that Ottoman "Albania" or ''Arnavudluk''... included parts of present-day northern Greece, western Macedonia, southern Montenegro, Kosovo, and southern Serbia"; see also ''El2''. s.v. "Arnawutluk. 6. History" (H. İnalcık) and Arsh, ''He Alvania''. 31.33, 39-40. For the Byzantine period. see Psimouli, ''Souli''. 28."&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Turkish ''Arnavutluk'' refers only to the Republic of Albania.&lt;ref name="Emin917"&gt;{{harvnb|Emin|2014|pp=9–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically as an exonym the Turkish term ''Arnaut'' has also been used for instance by some Western Europeans as a synonym for Albanians that were employed as soldiers in the Ottoman army.&lt;ref name="Malcolm233"&gt;{{harvnb|Malcolm|2009|pp=233}}. "And a further complication is introduced by the term "Arnaut", which could he used as a synonym for "Albanian", hut tended to suggest those Albanians (in the ethnic-linguistic sense) who acted as soldiers for the Ottomans — though these, it should be noted, included Catholic Albanians as well as Muslim ones. (When early reports refer to the local Ottoman forces, such as the force led by Mahmut Begolli [Mehmet Beyoğlu], pasha of Peja, they usually state that they consisted largely of Arnauts. Those Serb historians who claim that the terms Arnaut and Albanian did not mean ethnic Albanians, when applied to the supporters of Piccolomini, seem to have no difficulty in accepting that they did have that meaning, when applied to those fighting against him.)"&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Arnā'ūṭ'' (الأرناؤوط) also entered the [[Arabic]] language as an exonym for Albanian communities that settled in the Levant during the Ottoman era onward, especially for those residing in Syria.&lt;ref name="Norris209210"&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|1993|pp=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Arnaut'' (Арнаут), plural: ''Arnauti'' (Арнаути) has also been borrowed into Balkan [[South Slavic languages]] like Bulgarian and within Serbian the term has also acquired pejorative connotations regarding Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;Murati 1991, p. 71. "emri etnik a nacional e shqiptarëve, përkundër trajtës së drejtë sllave Albanci, tash del të shqiptohet si Šiptari e Šipci me një konotacion përbuzës negativ, ashtu siç është përdorur në krye të herës te serbët edhe në kohën e Jugosllavisë së Vjetër bashkë dhe me formën Šiftari e Arnauti me po të njëtat konotacione pejorative. [ethnic name or the national one of Albanians, despite the right Slavic term Albanci, now appears to be pronounced as Šiptari of Šipci with a connotation that is contemptuously negative, as it is used in the very beginning of the Serbs era at the time of the old Yugoslavia together and the form Šiftari and Arnauti which have the same pejorative connotations.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Theissen90"&gt;{{harvnb|Theißen|2007|p=90}}. "Der ursprüngliche Name Άλβανίτης (abgeleitet von Άλβάνος) wurde im Neugriechischen zu Άρβανίτης… In türkischer Vermittlung erfuhr die Silbe -''van''- eine Metathese zu -''nav''-, so dass die türkische Form des Namens für die Albaner arnavut bzw. arnaut Lautet. In dieser Form gelangte das Wort ins Bulgarische (BER I/1971: 15). [The original name Άλβανίτης (derived from Άλβάνος) was established in Modern Greek to Άρβανίτης .... In Turkish the syllable was experienced and mediated as -''van''- and by metathesis to -''nav''- so that the Turkish form of the name for the Albanians became respectively Arnavut or Arnaut. In this form, the word came into Bulgarian (BER I / 1971: 15).]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drzavnojstampariji347"&gt;{{harvnb|Državnoj štampariji|1878|p=347}}. "зову Арнаут, Арнаутка, па од тог назива доцније им потомци прозову се Арнаутовићи. [...] Арнаучићи зли, пакосни и убојити."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Ottoman era, the name was used for ethnic [[Albanians]] regardless of their religious affiliations, just like it is today.&lt;ref name="Malcolm233"/&gt;

In Ukraine, Albanians who lived in [[Budjak|Budzhak]] and who later also settled in the Azov Littoral of [[Zaporizhia Oblast]] are also known as ''Arnaut''. The city of [[Odessa]] has two streets: ''Great Arnaut Street'' and ''Little Arnaut Street''.&lt;ref name=ethnography&gt;[http://life.pravda.com.ua/travel/2014/05/13/167467/ Seven ethnographical miracles of Ukraine].

Baron '''Alexander von Bach''' (German: ''Alexander Freiherr&lt;ref&gt;{{German title|Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Bach''; 4 January 1813, [[Loosdorf]], Austria - 12 November 1893, [[Schöngrabern]], Austria) was an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] politician. His most notable achievement was instituting a system of centralized control at the beginning of the reign of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Born in Loosdorf, Lower Austria, he came from a legal background, with his father holding a judicial office.&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Bach, Alexander, Baron|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 24 he was made a [[doctor of laws]], and then entered the Imperial service, where he remained for nine years.  Seen as an up-and-coming, young radical, [[Adolph Schwarzenberg]] noted that 'his motto must have been "to improvise is to change, to be perfect is to change often"'.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzenberg. A. ''Prince Felix zu Schwarzenberg''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1946. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, he was a well-known [[Liberalism|liberal]] lawyer, and was first called a "minister of barricades", before he served as Minister of Justice in 1848 and 1849, and then moving on to Minister of the Interior from 1849 to 1859.

=== Minister of the Interior (1849-1859) ===
Although he favored a departure from the absolute system of [[Metternich]], Bach was not prepared to go so far as the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutionaries of 1848]] wished. In his views, he has been called a man who was 'quite wonderfully unprincipled' and so could change his position often.&lt;ref&gt;Crankshaw, E. The Fall of the House of Habsburg. London: Longmans, 1963. p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed him to be driven into conservative ranks by popular opposition: he gradually adhered to [[Conservatism|conservative]] views, endorsing the centralizing constitutional program of [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg|Prince Schwarzenberg]] in March 1849, thus further inflaming [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] sentiments.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the impact of his reforms on Hungary has been the contest of many historical debates. Some viewed the Revolution as far more productive in recreating the Hungarian "national identity",&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. J. P. ''The Habsburg Monarchy: 1809-1918''. London: Hamish Hamilton, 1948. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas some contemporaries of later Hungarian revolutions saw the systems created by Bach as the foremost driver in [[Hungarian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Magyar Revolution Believed to be Near’. The New York Times. (8 October 1905).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Schwarzenberg in 1852, he largely dictated policy in Austria and [[Hungary]]. Bach centralized administrative authority for the [[Austrian Empire]], but he also endorsed [[reactionary]] policies that reduced [[freedom of the press]] and abandoned public trials. He represented later the [[Enlightened absolutism|Absolutist]] (or ''Klerikalabsolutist'') direction, which culminated in the concordat of August 1855 that gave the [[Roman Catholic Church]] control over education and family life. This period in the history of the Austrian Empire would become known as the era of "neo-absolutism", or [[Bach's absolutism]].

Bach was created [[Baron]] (''Freiherr'') in 1854. He was also the guardian of Science Academy (''Akademie der Wissenschaften'') in 1849–59.

=== Later life ===
His fall in 1859 was highly caused by the failure in the Italian war against the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and [[Napoleon III]]. His reforms of the military had led to industrialization being foregone to the army, with barracks taking place of factories and infrastructural expansion, weakening.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. J. P. op. cit. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving his position, Bach served as Ambassador to the [[Holy See]] in 1859-1867 before dying in seclusion in 1893.

'''Bertram William Mathyson Francis Stevens''' (8 October 1872 – 14 February 1922) was Australian journal editor (''Single Tax''; ''Native Companion''; ''Art in Australia''; ''Lone Hand''); literary and art critic; and anthologist (''An Anthology of Australian Verse'' [which contained five poems by [[Henry Lawson]]]; ''The Golden Treasury of Australian Verse'').&lt;ref name=adb&gt;Ken Stewart, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120090b.htm Stevens, Bertram William Mathyson Francis (1872 - 1922)]', [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 12, [[Melbourne University Press|MUP]], 1990, pp 77-78. Retrieved 10 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens was born at [[Inverell, New South Wales]], the eldest child of William Mathison Stevens and his wife Marian, ''née'' Cafe, from [[Queanbeyan]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; By 1882 Stevens moved with his family to [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], [[Sydney]] where he was educated at public schools. Stevens was an avid reader and developed a wide knowledge and culture. In 1895 he began a fifteen-year period as a solicitor's clerk and it was intended that he should study law. During this time Stevens worked as a freelance journalist, coming into contact with a number of literary figures, he edited ''My Sundowner and other Poems'' (1904) by [[John Farrell (poet)|John Farrell]] with a memoir. Stevens prepared ''An Anthology of Australian Verse'' (1906), in which he was hampered by copyright restrictions, but he had a much freer hand in ''The Golden Treasury of Australian Verse'' (1909), the first anthology of Australasian verse of any importance. In the same year he had the difficult task of succeeding [[Alfred Stephens]] as editor of the 'Red Page' of ''[[The Bulletin]]''. [[David Scott Mitchell]] gave him access to his library of Australiana.

At the end of 1911 Stevens became editor of the [[Lone Hand (magazine)|Lone Hand]] and conducted this journal for seven years. In 1916 Stevens was one of the founders and joint-editor (with [[Sydney Ure Smith]]) of ''[[Art in Australia]]'' until his death. He also did literary criticism for ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' and other journals, published editions of Australian poets, prepared other anthologies, and edited books on leading Australian artists. Much of his literary work is listed in Serle's ''Bibliography of Australasian Poetry and Verse'' and Miller's ''Australian Literature''. 

Stevens campaigned for the land policies of [[Henry George]], temporarily winning Henry Lawson to the cause. He was a founding member of the [[Dawn and Dusk Club]] in 1899 and of the Casuals Club in 1906.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Stevens was deeply involved with attempts at rehabilitating Henry Lawson at [[Yanco, New South Wales]] and [[Edwin Brady]]'s property at [[Mallacoota, Victoria]].

Stevens died suddenly of cerebral haemorrhage and chronic nephritis at Sydney, on 14 February 1922.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; He left a widow, two sons and a daughter. [[Henry Lawson]] wrote a warm confessional tribute in ''The Bulletin''.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; At the time of his death he was vice-president of the New South Wales Institute of Journalists. He had been preparing ''A History of Australian Literature'' for some years before his death, but this was never published. Many of his papers are at the [[Mitchell Library (Australia)|Mitchell library]], Sydney.

'''Bob Larson''' (born May 28, 1944) is an American radio and television evangelist, and a pastor of Spiritual Freedom Church in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Larson has authored numerous books critical of [[rock music]] and [[Satanism]].

==Life and career==
Larson was born in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]], the son of Viola (née Baum) and Earl Larson.&lt;ref name=hcr&gt;{{Cite book|last=Melton|first=J. Gordon|authorlink=|title=Religious leaders of America: a biographical guide to founders and leaders of religious bodies, churches, and spiritual groups in North America|publisher=Gale Research|year=1999|location=|page=321|url=|isbn=0-8103-8878-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ett&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|title=Personals|page=4|publisher=McCook Daily Gazette|date=1998-01-13|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H6cgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6WgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2969,1083213&amp;dq=native-former-mccook-resident&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[McCook, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=hcr/&gt;

Larson plays guitar; he has claimed his early experiences as a musician led to his concerns about [[occult]] and destructive influences in rock music.&lt;ref name="Cornerstone"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jon Trott |year=1993 |title=Bob Larson's Ministry Under Scrutiny |journal=Cornerstone |volume=21 |issue=100 |pages=18, 37, 41–42 |issn=0275-2743 |url=http://www.cornerstonemag.com/features/iss100/larson.htm |accessdate=2006-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610035955/http://cornerstonemag.com/features/iss100/larson.htm |archivedate=2006-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later incorporate his guitar playing into some of his sermons. In the 1960s, the focus of Larson's preaching centered mainly on the leftist political ideology, sexually suggestive lyrics, Eastern religious mysticism, and antisocial behavior of many of the era's rock musicians.

==Debates with Satanists==
During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Bob Larson repeatedly debated, interviewed, and confronted Satanists, during the period known as the [[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|Satanic panic]]. On two separate occasions he hosted [[Nikolas Schreck]] (a gothic rock musician) and [[Zeena LaVey]] (once the spokesperson for the [[Church of Satan]] and later a priestess in the [[Temple of Set]]). During their first encounter the pair defended Satanism, while in 1997, during their second appearance, they defended [[Setianism]]. Larson debated the pair, and at times attempted to convert them without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

== ''"Talk Back"'' with Bob Larson ==
In 1982, Larson launched ''"Talk Back",'' a two-hour weekday call-in show geared mainly toward teenagers and frequently focused on teen-oriented topics such as [[role-playing game]]s and rock music. By this time Larson had come to embrace [[contemporary Christian music]], including styles such as [[Christian metal|heavy metal]] and [[Christian rap|rap]], and actively promoted the music and artists on his show.

By the late 1980s, in what would come to define his later ministry, Larson was often heard performing [[exorcism]]s of callers on the air. The subjects of Satanism and [[Satanic ritual abuse]] were frequent topics of discussion. [[Death metal]] performer [[Glen Benton]] of  [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] became a regular caller.

Larson tried his hand at writing fiction: ''Dead Air'' (1991) was largely ghost-written by Lori Boespflug and Muriel Olson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stollznow |first=Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=2013 |title=God Bless America |publisher=[[Pitchstone Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-939578-00-6 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His later novels ''Abaddon'' (1993) and ''The Senator's Agenda'' both linked [[Satanic ritual abuse]] to political corruption; the latter was largely written by Larson and his second wife. However, a former vice president of BLM (Bob Larson Ministries), Lori Boespflug, claimed that much of ''Dead Air'', though presented as Larson's work, is actually her own. Supporting these claims is a letter from Larson's lawyer that warns Larson of his "potential liability to Lori", anticipating that "the role Lori has played" would lead her to "demand recognition and/or profit participation" in respect to ''Dead Air'' and its sequels.&lt;ref name="Cornerstone"/&gt;

In 2004, Larson returned to the radio airwaves after a two-year absence with a daily talk show heard on a network of radio stations and simulcast and archived on the Internet.

Today, Larson remains active. His ministry professes to offer an alternative counseling outlet to people who have problems with violence, self-mutilation, multiple personality disorders, Satanic ritual abuse, or molestation.

==Exorcism==

In 2013 [[Vice (magazine)|Vice magazine]] taped a video of Larson's visit in several small towns in [[Ukraine]] where he performed exorcisms together with three young women - his 18-year-old daughter Brynne Larson and her friends Tess and Savannah Sherkenback (18 and 21 respectively, collectively known as The Teenage Exorcists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Charlet Duboc]]|title=Teenage Exorcists|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/Fringes/teenage-exorcists-full-length|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Teenage Exorcists consequently published a reply to Vice Media's video stating that they "question the journalistic integrity of this Vice Media story and are disappointed by how we were falsely portrayed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teenage Exorcists Respond to Vice Media Report|url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/TEENAGE-EXORCISTS-respond-to-VICE-MEDIA-report.html?soid=1101641219446&amp;aid=TjPe54s5R9c|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larson also offers to perform exorcisms over Skype (for a donation of $295).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gupta|first1=Prachi|title="The Daily Show’s" Jessica Williams gets an exorcism via Skype|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/10/14/must_see_morning_clip_jessica_williams_gets_an_exorcism_via_skype/|website=[[Salon (website)]]|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Skype exorcisms were featured in a segment on the satirical program ''The Daily Show'' in 2014, in which he told correspondent Jessica Williams, “Skype is a great technology to stare down the Devil, to go after him and to kick him back to hell.” Later in the same segment, however, he indicated that "tweeting an exorcism would be ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Daily Show’s" Jessica Williams gets an exorcism via Skype|url=http://www.cc.com/shows/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart/cast/jessica-williams/pfgsc0/the-exorcist---skype-edition/|website=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrow made his Major League debut on April 3 against the [[Oakland Athletics]], pitching one scoreless inning.

Morrow went 3-4, with a 4.12 ERA in 60 appearances striking out 66 batters and walking 50. He held opposing hitters to a .243 batting average, including .221 against right-handed batters. He set a club rookie record with 18 [[hold (baseball)|hold]]s, breaking old record of 13 set by [[Ed Vande Berg]] in {{mlby|1982}}. Morrow had the fourth most appearances by a rookie reliever in club history with 60 and fifth most strikeouts with 66. Among [[American League]] rookie relievers Morrow ranked second in strikeouts, third in appearances and fourth in ERA.

On April 23, he earned his first major league win against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], allowing one hit in career-high three and one third innings pitched. He recorded 18 and two thirds consecutive scoreless innings from April 20 to June 8. During the streak he went 2-0 while holding opposing batters to a .103 average. He also recorded another scoreless streak of 17 innings pitched over 15 outings from July 17 to August 24. Morrow held opponents scoreless in 44 of 60 outings.

After missing two weeks of spring training in 2008 due to a sore shoulder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kffl.com/player/15027/MLB|title=Brandon Morrow, SP, Toronto Blue Jays|publisher=KFFL.com|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrow was optioned to the Mariners minor league affiliate Double-A [[West Tenn Diamond Jaxx|West Tennessee]] on March 30. Morrow was recalled to the Seattle bullpen 17 days afterwards when Mariners starter [[Érik Bédard]] was placed on the 15-day [[disabled list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/mariners/2008/04/morrow_called_up.html|title=Morrow called up|last=Baker|first=Geoff|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=April 16, 2008|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Seattle's regular [[Closer (baseball)|closer]] [[J. J. Putz]] became injured on June 12, Morrow took over his duties. Including a closing appearance on June 11, Morrow [[Save (baseball)|saved]] 8 games in 8 tries, before a July 10 opportunity when he gave up two solo [[home run]]s to the [[Oakland Athletics]] to acquire his first blown save. He had only given up 2 [[Run (baseball)|runs]] all year prior to that, and had 40 strikeouts in 36.2 innings pitched, and a very low ERA of 1.76 and WHIP of 0.88.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=ESPN Player Stats|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=28734|accessdate=April 17, 2013|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, Morrow was optioned to Triple-A to become a starting pitcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Seattle Weekly: The Bright Spot in an Awful Season|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2008-08-13/news/the-bright-spot-in-an-awful-season.php/1|accessdate=August 18, 2008|publisher=[[Seattle Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrow made his first MLB start on September 5, against the [[New York Yankees]]. Morrow went 7{{fraction|2|3}} [[No-hitter|no-hit]] innings in his first major league start and was 4 outs away to being just the second player to throw a no hitter in their MLB starting debut only to see [[pinch hitter]] [[Wilson Betemit]] end his bid. The Mariners went on to win the game 3-1 giving Morrow his first win as a starter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Seattle Post-Intelligencer: Morrow's first start for M's will be against Yankees|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/archives/147185.asp?source=rss|accessdate=August 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009====
On March 29, {{mlby|2009}} the Mariners announced that Morrow would no longer be used as a [[starting pitcher]]; instead, he would move into a relief role with the organization. Morrow, who has [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/baseball/2012/05/14/blue_jays_brandon_morrow_embraces_being_a_role_model_for_diabetics.html|title=Blue Jays' Brandon Morrow embraces being a role model for diabetics|last=Bailey|first=Sue|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers|date=May 14, 2012|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledged that his diabetes was a factor in the decision, saying that it was easier to balance his [[blood sugar]] in a relief position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/baseball/mlb/03/29/mariners.morrow.ap/index.html|title=Morrow headed to Seattle bullpen|publisher=SI.com|date=March 29, 2009|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrow began the season as the [[closer (baseball)|closer]] and earned five saves through the end of April. However, he was placed on the disabled list on May 2 after he developed right biceps tendinitis. [[David Aardsma]] served as closer in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090502&amp;content_id=4533332&amp;vkey=news_sea&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sea|title=Mariners closer Morrow lands on DL|last=Street|first=Jim|publisher=MLB.com|date=May 2, 2009|accessdate=April 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225003253/http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090502&amp;content_id=4533332&amp;vkey=news_sea&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sea|archivedate=February 25, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After coming off the disabled list Morrow returned to the starting rotation, making six starts before being optioned to the Triple-A [[Tacoma Rainiers]] to develop back into a more rounded starting pitcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090711&amp;content_id=5827214&amp;vkey=news_sea&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sea|title=About face: Morrow returns to Minors|last=Street|first=Jim|date=July 11, 2009|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, Morrow pitched a four hit shutout against the [[Iowa Cubs]]. During that game Morrow struck out two, walked one and threw 59 of 96 pitches for strikes. Morrow retired 10 straight batters early in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2009665621_taco15.html|title=Brandon Morrow throws four-hit shuout for Rainiers|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=August 14, 2009|accessdate=April 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604094722/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2009665621_taco15.html|archivedate=June 4, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, Morrow was called up to the Mariners. He was to start at least one game, so manager [[Don Wakamatsu]] could assess Morrow's progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090909&amp;content_id=6880948&amp;vkey=news_sea&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=sea&amp;partnerId=rss_sea|title=Lacking depth, Mariners summon Morrow|last=Street|first=Jim|publisher=MLB.com|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30, Morrow gave up one hit and walked two hitters in 8 shutout innings against the [[Oakland Athletics]]. The Mariners won the game 7-0.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On December 22, 2009, the Mariners traded Morrow to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for pitcher [[Brandon League]] and minor league outfielder Johermyn Chávez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/comments.jsp?ymd=20091222&amp;content_id=7841362&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tor|title=Jays, Mariners to swap League, Morrow|last=Bastian|first=Jordan|date=December 22, 2009|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrow's first season in Toronto was the first of his major league career as a full-time member of a starting rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/baseball/2011/02/25/17412966.html|title=Morrow learning how to pitch - and that's scary|last=Fidlin|first=Ken|publisher=TorontoSun.com|date=February 25, 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto's coaching staff altered Morrow's delivery in a similar fashion to the way [[Roy Halladay]]'s delivery was altered during his first years with the Blue Jays. The switch from an over-the-top arm motion to a lower-angle arm slot was believed to have contributed to an increased command of his pitches. He was also encouraged to reduce his pitch velocity and try to induce weak contact, again much in the same way Halladay was taught during his tenure in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/bluejays/2008-05-08-jayshalladay_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip | work=USA Today | first=Paul | last=White | title=Innings-eater Halladay gives Jays bullpen holiday | date=May 9, 2008|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/2011/03/01/morrow_development_davidi/|title=MLB Insider: Secret of Jays' Morrow success|last=Davidi|first=Shi|publisher=SportsNet.ca|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some struggles with inconsistency during the early stages of the alterations, statistics show that his production stabilized as the season progressed and he managed to produce favorable results on a regular basis before the end of the season, including a stellar 17 strikeout, one hit performance that was a candidate for MLB.com's [[This Year in Baseball Awards|This Year in Baseball]] Performance of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/awards/y2010/tyib/index.jsp|title=This Year in Baseball Awards|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IMG 6637 Brandon Morrow.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Morrow pitching for the Blue Jays in 2011]]
On August 8, Morrow was one out away from a [[no-hitter]] against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] when [[Evan Longoria]] hit an infield single. It would have been the first no-hitter by a Blue Jay since [[Dave Stieb]]'s no-hitter on September 2, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=300808114&amp;teams=tampa-bay-rays-vs-toronto-blue-jays|title=Tampa Bay Rays vs. Toronto Blue Jays - Box score - August 8, 2010|publisher=ESPN.com|date=August 8, 2010|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the one-hitter for his first [[complete game]] while compiling 17 strikeouts, a career high for Morrow in a game and one strikeout shy of the team record 18 strikeouts set by [[Roger Clemens]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100808&amp;content_id=13191556&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tor|title=Morrow racks up 17 K's, nearly no-hits Rays|last=Bastian|first=Jordan|publisher=MLB.com|date=August 8, 2010|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Game Score]] metric devised by [[Sabremetrics|sabremetrician]] [[Bill James]], this tied for the fourth-highest rated pitching performance since 1920, with a game score of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/4786/no-hitting-is-such-sweet-morrow|title=Near no-hitting is such sweet Morrow|publisher=ESPN.com|date=August 8, 2010|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, the Blue Jays announced that after his next start, Morrow would be shut down for the season to protect his arm. He pitched more innings in 2010 (146⅓) than in any of his previous seasons. He finished the season with a 10–7 record, 4.49 ERA, and 178 strikeouts. Morrow was nominated as one of 2010's "Ten People Making a Difference in Diabetes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/01/prweb4950574.htm|title=dLife Top 10 Awards Honor Those Making a Difference in Diabetes|publisher=prweb.com|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011====
Morrow, who was expected to be the Jays' No. 2 starter in the pitching rotation, began the season on the 15-day disabled list with right forearm inflammation. He made his regular-season debut on April 23 against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], pitching 5⅓ innings, giving up 3 hits, 2 runs, 2 walks and 10 strikeouts.

For the first time since being traded, Morrow returned to the home stadium of his former team, the Seattle Mariners, to start against them on August 17. Morrow recorded the win, pitching 6 innings and striking out 12 batters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_08_17_tormlb_seamlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=tor|title=Morrow's dozen K's keep Mariners at bay|last=Chisholm|first=Gregor|publisher=MLB.com|date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrow became the first pitcher in major league history to pitch 100 innings in one season without the team recording a double play behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Zwolinski | first = Mark  | title = Baseball Notes: Call It One | newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] |page=S6  | date = August 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, after 173⅓ innings dating back to August 28, 2010, [[Desmond Jennings]] of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] grounded into Morrow's first double play in 30 starts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_09_23_tormlb_tbamlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=tor|title=Morrow deals blow to Rays' playoff chances|last=Chisholm|first=Gregor|publisher=MLB.com|date=September 23, 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would end up being Morrow's only double play induced in the season, but also the only double play Jennings would ground into all season. Morrow finished the season with an 11–11 record, 4.79 ERA, and 203 strikeouts. He led the league in strikeouts over 9 innings with 10.2.

====2012====
On May 3, in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], Morrow threw a three-hit complete game shutout. The following night, teammate [[Henderson Álvarez]] also threw a complete game shutout. Morrow and Álvarez thus became the first Blue Jays starters to throw back-to-back shutouts since [[Jack Morris]] and [[Al Leiter]] did so on June 16 and 17, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_05_04_tormlb_anamlb_1#gid=2012_05_04_tormlb_anamlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=tor|title=Alvarez deals Toronto's second straight shutout|last=Chisholm|first=Gregor|publisher=MLB.com|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrow established a career high in complete games and shutouts (with 2 each) on May 19, throwing a three-hit shutout against the [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/mlb/story/?id=396345|title=Morrow throws complete game shutout, Blue Jays blank Mets|publisher=TSN.ca|date=May 19, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He improved that mark on June 6 against the [[Chicago White Sox]], throwing a complete game two-hit shutout.

Morrow experienced "stabbing pain" during the first inning of his June 11 start while pitching to [[Bryce Harper]], the second hitter in the [[Washington Nationals]] lineup. After delivering three pitches to Harper, Morrow left the game with a strain of the left oblique muscles. No timetable was given for Morrow's return to the rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washington.nationals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120611&amp;content_id=33144022&amp;vkey=news_tor&amp;c_id=tor|title=Morrow strains oblique, will undergo tests|last=Chisholm|first=Gregor|publisher=MLB.com|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrow returned from the 60-day disabled list on August 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120824&amp;content_id=37265428&amp;notebook_id=37299564&amp;vkey=notebook_tor&amp;c_id=tor|title=Hechavarria, Gose sent down to Triple-A|work=MLB.com|last=Chisholm|first=Gregor|date=August 24, 2012|accessdate=August 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311070218/http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120824&amp;content_id=37265428&amp;notebook_id=37299564&amp;vkey=notebook_tor&amp;c_id=tor#|archive-date=2014-03-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 124⅔ innings, he finished the season with a 10–7 record, 2.96 ERA, and 103 strikeouts.

On March 18, manager John Gibbons confirmed that Morrow would be the team's fifth starter, citing a need to give him more time to prepare for the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/mlb/story/?id=446628|title=Blue Jays manager Gibbons confirms Morrow as fifth starter|work=TSN.ca|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After struggling to open the season, including a start on April 26 where he walked 8 Red Sox batters over 2{{frac|2|3}} innings, Morrow was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 3 with a sprained right index finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/brandon-morrow-put-on-dl-by-blue-jays-santos-out-as-closer-1.2631189|title=Brandon Morrow put on DL by Blue Jays, Santos out as closer|last=Harrison|first=Doug|work=CBC.ca|date=May 3, 2014|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day his injury was determined to be a more severe torn tendon sheath in his right hand, and he was transferred to the 60-day DL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/blue-jays-place-rhp-morrow-on-disabled-list/|title=Blue Jays place Morrow on 60-day DL|last=Davidi|first=Shi|work=[[Sportsnet]]|date=May 3, 2014|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrow made his first rehab appearance on August 27 with the [[Dunedin Blue Jays]], pitching one scoreless inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140827&amp;content_id=91707222&amp;notebook_id=91812468&amp;vkey=notebook_tor&amp;c_id=tor|title=Morrow tosses scoreless frame in rehab outing|last=Chisholm|first=Gregor|work=MLB.com|date=August 27, 2014|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was activated from the 60-day DL and added to the Blue Jays active roster on September 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/pompey-tweets-hes-been-called-up-by-jays/|title=Pompey, Norris among 9 called up by Blue Jays|last=Davidi|first=Shi|work=[[Sportsnet]]|date=September 1, 2014|accessdate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, the Blue Jays declined Morrow's $10 million 2015 option, making him a free agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jaysjournal.com/2014/11/01/blue-jays-decline-options-dustin-mcgowan-brandon-morrow/|title=Blue Jays Decline Options on Dustin McGowan, Brandon Morrow|last=Matheson|first=Keegan|work=jaysjournal.com|date=November 1, 2014|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brian Wade Grant''' (born March 5, 1972) is a retired American [[basketball]] player. He played the [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and [[Center (basketball)|center]] positions for five teams during 12 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]]. He was known for his tenacious [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] and blue-collar defense. During his career, he played with the [[Sacramento Kings]] (where he made First Team All-Rookie in the [[1994–95 NBA season|1994–95 season]]), [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Phoenix Suns]].

==Early life==
Grant grew up in the small, rural community of [[Georgetown, Ohio]], near the [[Ohio River]] about 40 miles southeast of [[Cincinnati]]. During summers, he spent most of his time working at area farms, cutting, housing, and stripping tobacco, digging potatoes and baling hay. He played basketball at [[Georgetown High School (Ohio)|Georgetown High School]],&lt;ref name="newsdemocrat.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsdemocrat.com/news/sports/2947801/Gtown-holds-Black-and-Gold-Night |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328010640/http://newsdemocrat.com/news/sports/2947801/Gtown-holds-Black-and-Gold-Night |archivedate=2014-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in anonymity until [[Xavier University (Cincinnati)|Xavier University]]'s basketball office began receiving anonymous calls stating that they should take a look at Grant. Xavier assistant coach [[Dino Gaudio]] finally scouted Grant, followed by visits from XU head coach [[Pete Gillen]].&lt;ref name="xtra.xavier.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xtra.xavier.edu/xavier-magazine/brian-grant-a-new-life/|title=Brian Grant - Xavier Magazine|author=|date=|website=xtra.xavier.edu|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622011025/http://xtra.xavier.edu/xavier-magazine/brian-grant-a-new-life/|archivedate=22 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgetown High's gymnasium has since been renamed Brian Grant Gymnasium.&lt;ref name="newsdemocrat.com"/&gt;

==College career==
Grant played basketball at Xavier University, but the anonymity quickly faded. After four seasons at Xavier, Grant was second on the all-time leading scorers' list with 1,719 points. He was twice named [[Midwest Collegiate Conference]] Player of the Year. All four seasons at Xavier he led the Musketeers in rebounding, and was third on the all-time leading rebounding list with 1,080. He was named to the [[Associated Press]] honorable mention All-American team in his junior year, after ranking second in the nation in field goal percentage with 65.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/xavi/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2012-13/misc_non_event/12-13-mbb-guide-records.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327203930/http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/xavi/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2012-13/misc_non_event/12-13-mbb-guide-records.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was inducted into the Xavier Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999 and became one of only four basketball players to have his jersey retired, in a ceremony held in 2011.&lt;ref name="xtra.xavier.edu"/&gt;

== NBA career ==

===Sacramento Kings===
Grant was selected in the first round, eighth overall, in the [[1994 NBA draft]] by the Sacramento Kings. In his rookie season he started in 59 out of 80 games, averaging 13.2 points a game with 7.5 rebounds. The following year, he started in 75 out of 78 games, increasing his scoring average to 14.4 points a game as the Kings made the playoffs. The Kings lost in four games to the top-seeded [[1995–96 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]] in the [[1996 NBA Playoffs|first round]], with Grant averaging 9.8 points per game for the series. He signed a five-year, $29 million contract, but due to injuries appeared in only 24 games in the 1996–1997 season, and the Kings did not make the playoffs.

===Portland Trail Blazers===
Grant opted out of the deal following the 1997 season to sign a six-year, $56 million deal with the [[1997–98 Portland Trail Blazers season|Portland Trail Blazers]]. In his first year with the Trail Blazers he started in 49 of 61 games as the team made the playoffs but lost in the [[1998 NBA Playoffs|first round]] to the [[1997–98 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] 3 games to 1. Grant averaged 13.2 points and 10.7 rebounds a game for the series. The 1998–1999 season was shortened to 50 games because of a league lockout, and Grant started 46 of 48 games with a scoring average of 11.5 points a game and a team high 9.8 rebounds per game.  The Trail Blazers won the Pacific Division, swept the [[1998–99 Phoenix Suns season|Phoenix Suns]] in the first round of the [[1999 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] and defeated the previous Western Conference Champion [[1998–99 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] in six games in the second round.  In the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers were swept by the league-leading [[1998–99 San Antonio Spurs season|San Antonio Spurs]]. Grant started all 13 playoff games and averaged 13.2 points with 9.2 rebounds.

Prior to the 1999–2000 season, Portland acquired veteran all-star [[Scottie Pippen]], and coach [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.|Mike Dunleavy]] decided to use Grant as a reserve behind rising all-star [[Rasheed Wallace]], who would go on to have a career year during the season as the Trail Blazers won 59 games and the second seed in the Western Conference.  Portland opened the [[2000 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] with a 3-1 first-round win over the [[1999–2000 Minnesota Timberwolves season|Minnesota Timberwolves]], with Grant and Wallace both being used as defensive options against [[Kevin Garnett]].  Grant was used in a similar fashion against [[Karl Malone]] and the [[1999–2000 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] in the second round, with Portland advancing in five games. In the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers faced the [[1999–2000 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] led by Pippen's former [[Chicago Bulls]] coach [[Phil Jackson]] and the duo of [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Kobe Bryant]]. The teams split the first two games before the Lakers took games 3 and 4 to take a 3–1 series lead, but Portland responded with a win on the road in game 5 and a home win in the sixth game to set up a seventh game with a trip to the [[NBA Finals]] on the line.  Despite taking a double-digit lead into the fourth quarter, the Lakers rallied and won the game, eliminating Portland.  Grant averaged 5.4 points and 5.8 rebounds throughout the 2000 playoff run.

After two years as the starting PF and one year as the Blazers' number one big man off the bench, Grant once again opted out of his deal to become a free agent, hoping to land a starting job elsewhere.

===Miami Heat===
In the summer of 2000 Grant signed a 7-year $86 million deal with the [[2000–01 Miami Heat season|Miami Heat]], despite coming off season averages of 7.5 ppg and 5.5 rpg. The deal raised eyebrows, but Heat President and GM [[Pat Riley]] insisted that Grant was the missing piece to the Heat's championship puzzle, along with other recently acquired players [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]]. Weeks before the start of the season Miami's all-star center [[Alonzo Mourning]] was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease forcing Riley to play Grant at center despite usually playing at the power forward position. Grant responded by putting up a career season of 15.2 ppg, 8.8 rpg, and a career high 79.7% at the foul line.  Miami won 50 games, and Mourning returned to the team in late March, but were swept in the [[2001 NBA Playoffs|first round]] by the younger [[2000–01 Charlotte Hornets season|Charlotte Hornets]].  Grant averaged 10 points and 8 rebounds for the series.

In the 2001–2002 season, with the anticipated return of Mourning to the lineup, Grant returned to his natural power forward position. Grant started in 72 games for Miami averaging 9.3 points and 8 rebounds a game for the season, but the Heat failed to reach the [[2002 NBA Playoffs|postseason]]. The next year signaled a rebuilding era for the team, as the Heat won just 25 games with Grant averaging 10.3 points a game along with a career high 10.2 rebounds, which placed him at fifth in the league in rebounds per game.  He also finished the season 4th in total rebounds, 5th in defensive rebounds, and 10th in the league in field goal percentage at .509 percent, all personal bests. The Heat once again found themselves in the lottery, and would select [[Dwyane Wade]] in the draft to join sophomore [[Caron Butler]] before acquiring free agent [[Lamar Odom]] in the offseason. Alonzo Mourning, who did not play in the 2003 season, left the team and signed with the [[2003–04 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey Nets]], leaving Grant as the team's best option at the center position.  Just prior to the 2003–2004 season, another major franchise change occurred, as Pat Riley stepped down as coach.  He would be replaced by longtime assistant [[Stan Van Gundy]].

The 2003–2004 season proved to be a major success for the rebuilding franchise, as the Heat overcame an 0-7 start to eventually make the playoffs as the 4th seed in the East led by the play of Odom, Jones and Wade. Grant started 76 games at center and averaged 8.7 points and 6.9 rebounds a game.  In the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], the Heat defeated the [[2003–04 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]], who had relocated from Charlotte, in a challenging 7 game series in which the home team won every game.  In the second round the Heat faced the top seeded [[2003–04 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]], who took the first two games in Indiana before the Heat won two straight games at home to tie the series at two games apiece, including a game three victory led by Grant`s 16 rebounds. The Pacers would win the next two games to advance however, defeating the young Heat team considered to have much promise heading into the future.  Grant averaged 7.1 points and 8.6 rebounds a game throughout the postseason.

===Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns===
During the summer of 2004, the Heat traded Grant (along with [[Caron Butler]], [[Lamar Odom]], and a future first-round draft pick) to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for superstar [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. Grant would play one year for the rebuilding Lakers, playing in a total of 69 games and starting in 8 with career low averages of 3.8 points and 3.7 rebounds a game. That off-season Grant was released and signed with the Phoenix Suns. He would go on to only appear in 21 games for the Suns, including 5 games in their playoff run which resulted in wins against the Lakers, and the [[2005–06 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]] before falling to the [[2005–06 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]] in the Western Finals.  Following the season Grant was traded in the [[2006 NBA draft]] to the [[2006–07 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] with the rights to [[Rajon Rondo]] in exchange for a future first-round draft pick.

===Charity work===
Brian Grant is well known for his contributions to the communities in various cities. Grant served as the Oregon and Southwest Washington spokesperson for Ronald McDonald House Charities when he was with the Portland Trail Blazers. Grant and Ronald McDonald House Charities teamed up in July 1999 to hold "Brian's Bash" – a celebrity golf tournament in Portland – to raise money for seriously and terminally ill children.

During his time as an NBA player, he started his own foundation in order to assist seriously ill children, as well as their families, and under-privileged youth. These numerous acts of selflessness and generosity were recognized by the NBA in 1999 when he was awarded the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award. A few of the programs that The Brian Grant Foundation has launched are the "Scholastic Attendance Program", the "Christmas Adopt-A-Family Program", the "Thanksgiving Dinner Distribution Program" with Pazzo's Restaurant, Mother's Against Gang Violence, the TLC Soup Kitchen, and the "Brian Grant Free Summer Basketball Clinics" in Portland, Oregon, and Georgetown, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;http://google.com/search?q=cache:1iVXFNghh_sJ:www.brianbergerpr.com/ar_bg_exec_dir.html+brian+grant+foundation&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from the NBA and moving his family back to his adopted hometown of Portland, Oregon, Grant was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in November 2008.   With new friends in Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali, who share the disease with Brian, he decided to recreate the Brian Grant Foundation; this time, with a new focus and mission. The new charity supports efforts toward the education and awareness of Parkinson's disease in order to increase earlier diagnosis, educate patients and their families, and provide a viable forum for people affected by the disease. The mission of the foundation is to help those impacted by Parkinson's to live active and fulfilling lives.The foundation hosts an annual fundraiser, Shake It Till We Make It, to raise money to provide support and resources for all those affected by Parkinson's disease. Shake It Till We Make It is a two-day celebrity gala and golf tournament hosted in Portland, Oregon.

The Brian Grant Foundation partners up with other foundations, such as the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center, to support and fund research dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease and to finding improved therapies for people living with Parkinson's disease.

===Health===
In November 2005, after talking with a neurologist at [[OHSU]], Brian Grant was diagnosed with early-onset [[Parkinson's disease]]. Through discussions and encouragement by well-known Parkinson's sufferers [[Michael J. Fox]] and [[Muhammad Ali]], Grant publicized his diagnosis in 2009.&lt;ref name="parkisons-diagnosis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=4174877 |title=Former NBA star Brian Grant deals with diagnosis of Parkinson's disease |author=[[Ric Bucher]] |work=[[ESPN.com]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61AMJw7XF?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=4174877 |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Manx folklore]], a {{Lang|gv|'''buggane'''}} (or ''boagane'')&lt;ref&gt;Spelling used in ''[[The Deemster]]''&lt;/ref&gt; was a huge [[ogre]]-like creature native to the [[Isle of Man]]. Some have considered them akin to the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] [[troll]].

==Manx folklore==
[[File:The medieval chapel of St. Trinian's, near Crosby - geograph.org.uk - 58337.jpg|thumb|Roofless St. Trinian's]]
A [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]], the buggane's natural form is described as "covered with a mane of coarse, black hair; it had eyes like torches, and glittering sharp tusks".&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/sm1911/index.htm Morrison, Sophia. ''Manx Fairy Tales'', David Nutt, London, 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;
===St Trinian's Church===
{{main|St Trinian's Church}}
The most famous story recounts a buggane who found himself an inadvertent stowaway on a ship bound for [[Ireland]]. Determined to return to the Isle of Man, he caused a storm and guided the ship towards the rocky coast of Contrary Head. His plan was interdicted through the intervention of St. Trinian. Invoked by the captain with a promise to build a chapel in his honour, the saint guided the ship safely into [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel Harbour]]. Incensed, the buggane screamed, "St. Trinian should never have a whole church in Ellan Vannin."&lt;ref name=Callow&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/phy/phy18.htm Callow, Edward. "The Buggane's Vow", ''The Phynodderre and Other Legends of the Isle of Man'', J. Dean and Son, London, 1882]&lt;/ref&gt; When the chapel came to be built, three times the local people put a roof on, and three times the buggane tore it off.

As magical creatures, bugganes were unable to cross water or stand on hallowed ground.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;

The ''Buggan ny Hushtey'' lived in a large cave near the sea and was known for having no liking for lazy people.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Sophia. "Buggane ny Hushtey, the Buggane-of-the-Water: A Manx Folktale", ''Folklore'', Vol. 34, No. 4 (Dec. 31, 1923), pp. 349-351 {{jstor|1256555}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should not be confused with the [[Cabyll-ushtey]], the Manx [[water horse]].

Bugganes were occasionally called upon by the [[fairy|fairies]] to punish people that had offended them. The buggane of [[Glen Maye]] would have pitched a lazy housewife into a waterfall for putting off baking until after sunset, had she not cut loose the strings of her apron to escape.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; The buggane from Gob-na-Scuit was known for tearing the thatch off the haystacks, puffing the smoke down chimneys, and pushing sheep over the edge of the brooghs (a steep bank or grassy cliff).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feegan.com/fltales/fltales2.html "Old Nance and The Buggane", Feegan's, IOM]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finn MacColl and the Buggane===
In Manx legend, the Irish giant [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (Finn MacCool) crossed over to Mann and settled near Cregneash. The buggane from Barrule came to do battle, but Finn did not want to fight. Fionn's wife, Oonagh, disguised Fionn as a baby and tucked him in a cradle. When the buggane saw the size of the 'baby', he thought that its father, Fionn, must be a giant among giants, and so he left. They eventually met near [[Rushen|Kirk Christ Rushen]] and fought from sunrise to sunset. Fionn had one foot in the Big Sound, and so made the channel between the [[Calf of Man]] and [[Kitterland]], and the other foot was in the Little Sound, and so he made the narrow channel between Kitterland and the main island. The buggane was standing at Port Erin. He came off victorious and slashed Fionn awfully, so that he had to run to Ireland. Fionn could walk on the sea, but the buggane could not, so he tore out a tooth and threw it at Fionn. It hit him on the back of the head, and then it fell into the sea and became what is now called [[Chicken Rock]]. Fionn turned round and roared a mighty curse, "My seven swearings of a curse on it!" "Let it lie there for a vexation to the sons of men while water runs and grass grows!"
And so it has.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; The Irish version of the story has Finn's adversary a giant from [[Scotland]].

'''Dean Snell''' is a [[Plastics engineering|plastics engineer]] and designer of many name brand golf balls, including [[Titleist Pro V1]] and [[TaylorMade|TaylorMade TP]]. He is the founder of Snell Golf, a company where he designs and sells namesake golf ball.&lt;ref name="SouthCoastToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Urbon|first1=Steve|title=New Bedford golf ball start-up has big target in its sights|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20150224/NEWS/150229669|accessdate=8 May 2018|publisher=South Coast Today|date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a brief career as a professional in the [[American Hockey League]]. 

==Early life and education==

Snell attended [[New Bedford High School]] before attending [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] on a hockey scholarship. He graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Plastics Engineering.&lt;ref name="MBOnline"/&gt; He later played Junior-A level amateur hockey and then for the  [[Hershey Bears]] in the American Hockey League.&lt;ref name="MyGolfSpy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barba|first1=John|title=Dean Snell: Golf's Matador|url=https://mygolfspy.com/dean-snell-golfs-matador/|accessdate=8 May 2018|publisher=MyGolfSpy|date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
[[File:Titleist Pro v1 golf balls.jpg|thumb|right|Titleist Pro v1 golf balls designed by Dean Snell.]]
Prior to his work in the golf industry, Snell spent time with BF Goodrich in its Aerospace and Defense Division where he worked on F-14 and F-15 fighter jets.&lt;ref name="SanDiegoUnionTribune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Figueroa|first1=Marc|title=TaylorMade engineer helped change industry with Titleist Pro V1 ball|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-taylormade-engineer-helped-change-industry-with-2006aug06-story.html|accessdate=8 May 2018|publisher=The San Diego Union Tribune|date=6 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined Titleist in the late 1980s and developed a number of patents for the company, including for the Pro V1.&lt;ref name="SanDiegoUnionTribune"/&gt; Snell worked for [[Titleist]] for seven years.&lt;ref name="MBOnline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blondin|first1=Alan|title=After years in industry, Snell takign sing at own golf ball business|url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/sports/golf/article98937667.html|accessdate=8 May 2018|publisher=Myrtle Beach Online|date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snell left Titleist in 1996 and went to work for TaylorMade where he was vice president of golf ball research and development.&lt;ref name="MyGolfSpy"/&gt; When he joined the company, it only had one golf ball patent and no one assigned to ball research and development.&lt;ref name="SanDiegoUnionTribune"/&gt; He was given freedom within the company which grew to approximately 60 research and developers by 2006. During his time there, he designed the TaylorMade TP golf ball which was used on the [[PGA Tour]] by players such as [[Sergio García]] and [[Justin Rose]].&lt;ref name="SanDiegoUnionTribune"/&gt;  He left the company in 2014.&lt;ref name="MyGolfSpy"/&gt;

After leaving TaylorMade, Snell began designing his own golf ball line under his new company Snell Golf.&lt;ref name="SouthCoastToday"/&gt;

[[Suharto]] (8 June 1921&amp;nbsp;– 27 January 2008) was the second [[President of Indonesia]], having held the office for 31 years from 1967 following [[Sukarno|Sukarno's]] removal until his resignation in 1998.

Suharto was born in a small village, Kemusuk, in the Godean area near [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], during the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Soeharto, as related to G. Dwipayana and Ramadhan K.H. (1989), ''Soeharto: Pikiran, ucapan dan tindakan saya: otobiographi'' (Soeharto: My thoughts, words and deeds: an autobiography), PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada, Jakarta. {{ISBN|979-8085-01-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in humble circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;See the details in Chapter 2, 'Akar saya dari desa' (My village roots), in Soeharto, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  His [[Javanese people|Javanese]] Muslim parents divorced not long after his birth, and he was passed between foster parents for much of his childhood. During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], Suharto served in Japanese-organised Indonesian security forces. [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesia's independence struggle]] saw him joining the newly formed Indonesian army. Suharto rose to the rank of major general following Indonesian independence.

==Early life==

Suharto was born on 8 June 1921 during the [[Dutch East Indies]] era, in a plaited bamboo walled house in the hamlet of [[Kemusuk]], a part of the larger village of Godean. The village is {{convert|15|km|mi}} west of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], the cultural heartland of the [[Javanese people|Javanese]].&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born to ethnic Javanese parents of peasant class, he was the only child of his father's second marriage. His father, Kertosudiro had two children from his previous marriage, and was a village irrigation official. His mother Sukirah, a local woman, was distantly related to [[Hamengkubuwana V|Sultan Hamengkubuwono V]] by his first concubine.&lt;ref&gt;''Tempo'' (Jakarta), 11 November 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suharto and Ibu Tien.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Official Portrait of Suharto and First Lady Siti Hartinah.]]

Five weeks after Suharto's birth, his mother suffered a nervous breakdown and he was placed in the care of his paternal great-aunt, Kromodirjo.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 10"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1980|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kertosudiro and Sukirah divorced early in Suharto's life and both later remarried. At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother who had remarried a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 10" /&gt; In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yield farming area near [[Wonogiri]]. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 11"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1980|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school (''schakelschool''), living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquinted with Darjatmo, a ''dukun'' ("guru") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt; Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back with his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee [[Muhammadiyah]] middle school in the city of [[Yogyakarta]] until 1939.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=1–6"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many Javanese, Suharto had [[Javanese name|only one name]].&lt;ref name=globe&gt;Haskin, Colin, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/article663945.ece "Suharto dead at 86"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 27 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called “[[Hajji|Haji]]” or “el-Haj Mohammed Suharto” but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling "Suharto" reflects modern Indonesian spelling although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was "'''Soeharto'''" and he preferred the original spelling. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling 'Suharto' while the Indonesian government and media use 'Soeharto'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Politics and the press in Indonesia | last=Romano | first=Angela Rose | page=ix | year=2003 | isbn=0-7007-1745-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suharto's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as [[Sukarno]] in that he is believed to have had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little to no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=1–6"/&gt;

==Military career==

===World War II and Japanese occupation===

{{See also|Japanese occupation of Indonesia}}

Suharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1980|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) in June 1940, and undertook basic training in [[Gombong]] near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, pages 13"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1980|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from short training at KNIL ''Kaderschool'' in [[Gombong]] to become sergeant, and was posted to KNIL reserve battalion in [[Cisarua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Dutch surrender to the [[Dutch East Indies Campaign|invading Japanese forces]] in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, pages 13" /&gt; On October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve at the rank of ''shodancho'' (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese ''[[bushido]]'', or "way of the warrior", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suharto was posted at a [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] coastal defence battalion at [[Wates, Kulon Progo|Wates]], south of Yogyakarta, until he was admitted for training for company commander (''chudancho'') in [[Bogor]] from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in [[Surakarta]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Madiun]]. The Japanese surrender and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] in August 1945 occurred when Suharto was posted at remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of [[Mount Wilis]]) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of failed [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] rebellion of February 1945 in [[Blitar]], led by [[Supriyadi]].

===Indonesian National Revolution===

{{See also|Indonesian National Revolution}}

Two days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared Indonesian independence]], and were appointed president and vice-President respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment in accordance with orders from the Japanese command and returned to Yogyakarta.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 14"&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1980|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto helped to establish a fighting unit together with a former PETA colleague, Umar Slamet. This unit was amalgamated into the newly formed Indonesian armed forces (''Tentara Keamanan Rakjat / TKR'') which was established on 5 October 1945. His leadership skills in leading several attacks against Japanese soldiers in [[Yogyakarta]] area to seize their weapons led to Suharto's promotion to major. He was given command of newly formed Battalion X of Regiment I, which was in turn part of Division IX led by Colonel Sudarsono. By October 1945, this division has secured full control of [[Yogyakarta]] area by forcing the surrender of remaining Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref name="McDonald 1980, p. 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ELSON4"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, namely returning Dutch and assisting British forces. Suharto led his Battalion X when it was sent northwards to repel British advance towards Yogyakarta from British-occupied port of [[Semarang]]. In a series of battles at [[Magelang]] and [[Ambarawa]] lasting from late-October to December 1945, Republican forces forced the British to retreat to the confines of [[Semarang]]. Suharto's battle performance attracted attention of [[Sudirman]], the Republican armed forces commander, who promoted him to lead newly formed Regiment III of Division IX (2,250 men) with rank of lieutenant-colonel on early 1946. On May 1946, Suharto's umbrella Division IX was amalgamated into new Division III under leadership of newly promoted Major-General Sudarsono. On 17 May 1946, the British handed-over control of [[Semarang]] to the Dutch T ("Tijger") Brigade. Suharto participated in a battle at [[Kendal]] where Division III successfully halted a southward advance by the Dutch brigade. As evidence of Suharto's increasing stature, on June 1946 Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirdjo invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian nationalist forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer of Republican capital from [[Jakarta]] to [[Yogyakarta]] on January 1946 exposed the armed units there to civilian political intrigue, most notably the "3 July Affair". [[Sukarno]] government's decision to commence negotiations with the Dutch caused much opposition from various Indonesian factions, which coalesced into a group called PP (''Persatoean Perdjoangan'') led by communist politician [[Tan Malaka]]. PP's opposition to negotiation with the Dutch received sympathy from many sections of the armed forces, including its commander [[Sudirman]] and Suharto's direct superior Major-General Sudarsono. On 27 June 1946, Sudarsono ordered the kidnapping of Prime Minister [[Sutan Sjahrir]] who was leading the negotiations with the Dutch. When [[Sukarno]] issued order for Sudarsono's arrest, the plot leader took refuge in Suharto's regimental headquarters at the outskirts of Yogyakarta, bringing the kidnapped [[Sjahrir]] with him. Suharto, while providing protection to his superior Sudarsono, was also secretly in contact with [[Sudirman]] to find-out whether the commander decided to support Sudarsono's kidnapping plot. When Sudirman indicated that Sukarno has convinced him not to support Sudarsono, Suharto helped loyal government forces to arrest Sudarsono and release the kidnapped [[Sjahrir]] on 3 July 1946, hence protecting himself from the subsequent purge of Division III in the aftermath of the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3 July Affair led to further restructuring of Division III. By August 1946, Suharto was head of Yogyakarta-based 22nd Regiment, one of the six regiments of Division III (now named the "[[Kodam IV/Diponegoro|Diponegoro Division]]") which is responsible for the [[Central Java]] area. According to Dutch intelligence reports, by mid-1947, Suharto's regiment consisted of four battalions who were regularly rotated northwards to the frontlines surrounding [[Semarang]] to help contain the Dutch forces there. Dutch intelligence reported that Suharto was assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of [[opium]] through the territory he controlled with the help of Chinese-Indonesian merchant [[Liem Sioe Liong]] to be bartered with weapons, clothes, food, and other supplies.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=20–25"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=20–25,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 1947, the Dutch launched [[Operatie Product]], a military invasion into Republican-held areas. In [[Central Java]], the Dutch T-Brigade pushed the Republican forces from [[Semarang]] to [[Magelang]] before a [[United Nations]]-brokered ceasefire was announced on 4 August. Suharto led his troops in the defence against this assault, and later was regularly rotated as frontline commander responsible for guarding the ceasefire line ([[Van Mook Line]]) north of Yogyakarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 December 1947, Suharto married [[Siti Hartinah]] (known as Madam Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt; The couple had six children: [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati (Titiek, born 1959), [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]] (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964).

The signing of highly disadvantageous [[Renville Agreement]] on January 1948 resulted in evacuation of 35,000 Republican fighters from the Dutch-occupied side of the ceasefire line into the shrunk Republican-controlled territory. To control the unwieldy myriad of armed groups proliferating the Republican areas, Prime Minister [[Mohammad Hatta]] undertook rationalisation of the armed forces. On April 1948, Division III ("Diponegoro Division") was reduced from 16,000 to 7,000 men. Suharto was reshuffled as commander of Brigade III of the Division III, commanding four battalions. The unpopular rationalisation policies met often bloody resistance from many factions of the Republican forces, which again coalesced around the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) under the leadership of [[Musso]] who recently returned from the Soviet Union. On late-September 1948, PKI-linked armed units seized control of [[Madiun]] in East Java and declared a "Soviet Republic of Indonesia" in opposition of Sukarno and Hatta. On 22 September, Republican commander [[Sudirman]] sent Suharto to communist-occupied Madiun to meet Musso in an unsuccessful attempt to reach a peaceful reconciliation. On 30 September, loyal troops launched assault on Madiun, which resulted in the killing of Musso and total defeat of the rebels by end-October 1948. Suharto's brigade participated in anti-communist operations in the areas east of [[Yogyakarta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 1948, to take advantage of the Republic's weak situation following the communist rebellion, the Dutch launched "[[Operatie Kraai]]", designed to destroy the Republic once and for all. This invasion, initiated with an airborne assault on [[Yogyakarta]], resulted in the capture of Sukarno, Hatta, and other Republican civilian leaders. Meanwhile, the Republican army was forced into the countryside to wage guerrilla resistance inline with [[Sudirman]]'s ''Wehrkreise'' strategy.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=20–25"/&gt;

Suharto, leaving his pregnant wife behind in Dutch-occupied Yogyakarta, led guerrilla operations from the rural areas south of the city. On 28 December 1948, Division III commander Colonel Bambang Sugeng divided [[Central Java]] into three defence areas ("''Wehrkreise''"). Suharto was appointed to command ''Wehrkreise'' III, consisting of two battalions operating in the areas surrounding [[Yogyakarta]], with its headquarters at the Menorah hills in [[Bantul]] area. From January to February 1949, the Dutch T-Brigade incurred losses of 44 dead and 129 wounded from guerrilla attacks in areas under Suharto's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In dawn raids on 1 March 1949, Suharto's forces and local militia re-captured large parts of [[Yogyakarta]] city, holding it until noon.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Suharto's later accounts had him as the lone plotter, although other sources say Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] of Yogyakarta and the Division III commander ordered the attack. However, [[General Nasution]] said that Suharto took great care in preparing the "General Offensive" ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''Serangan Umum''). The attack proved that the Dutch was very far from winning the guerrilla war. International opinion condemned the Dutch violation over internationally brokered [[Renville Agreement]], with the United States and United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to re-commence negotiations. These pressures resulted in [[Roem-van Roijen Agreement]] of 7 May 1949, whereby the Dutch agreed to release captured Republican leaders and return area surrounding Yogyakarta to Republican control in exchange of ceasefire. Suharto was responsible for the take-over of [[Yogyakarta]] city from the withdrawing Dutch forces on 29 June 1949. On 9 July 1949, Suharto led the welcoming parade for recently released Republican leaders (including Sukarno and Hatta) to Yogyakarta while the following day he led similar parade for tuberculosis-ridden [[Sudirman]] back into the city from his rural guerrilla base. On 27 December 1949, the Dutch surrendered sovereignty to the [[United States of Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=29–38,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-Independence military career ===

[[File:Suharto family.jpg|thumb|Suharto with his wife and six children in 1967.]]

By 1950, Suharto served as commander of Brigade X ("Garuda Mataram Brigade") of Diponegoro Division, consisting of four battalions of around 800 men each. On April 1950, Suharto led this brigade to [[Makassar]] as part of expeditionary force to suppress a rebellion of former KNIL supporters of the Dutch-established [[State of East Indonesia]] led by Andi Azis ([[Makassar Uprising]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1980|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in [[Makassar]], Suharto became acquainted with his neighbours the Habibie family, whose eldest son [[B. J. Habibie]] would later become Suharto's vice-president and went on to succeed him as president. Suharto's brigade later engaged in the difficult mission of disarming and integrating both former KNIL soldiers and former pro-Republican guerillas into the army. His brigade defeated an unruly former guerrilla unit under Arief Rate (who was killed) and hostile former KNIL soldiers in heavy urban combat in Makassar city centre during June 1950, losing seventeen men killed in action. Suharto and his brigade returned to Central Java on September 1950 with the successful dissolution of [[State of East Indonesia]] into newly formed Unitary Republic of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=49–52"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1951, Suharto was appointed to lead enlarged Pragola Brigade (consisting of nine battalions) based in [[Salatiga]]. On December 1951, one of Suharto's battalions (Battalion 426) which consisted of former Islamic militias, rebelled in support of ongoing [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] insurgency in West Java. From late-December 1951 to late-January 1952, Suharto led "''Operasi Merdeka Timur V''" which successfully defeated the rebellious battalion in vicious fighting in [[Klaten]] area. Remnants of Battalion 426 joined Darul Islam insurgents operating in northwestern part of [[Central Java]] which were only defeated in 1957.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=49–52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1980|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1953, Suharto was appointed commander of Infantry Regiment III consisting of four battalions (3,704 men) based in [[Surakarta]], organizing its participation in battling Darul Islam insurgents in northwestern Central Java and anti-bandit operations in [[Mount Merapi]] area. He also sought to stem pervasive leftist sympathies amongst his troops (one of his leftist-leaning subordinates in this period was [[Untung Syamsuri|Untung bin Sjamsuri]] who would later lead the [[30 September Movement]] in 1965). His experience in this period left Suharto with deep distaste for both Islamic and communist radicalism which he believed could be countered only with material and financial sufficiency on the part of the people.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=52–55"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=52–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 1956 Suharto was promoted to command the [[Kodam IV/Diponegoro|Diponegoro Division]] with the rank of colonel, based in [[Semarang]] and responsible for Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces. Upon a series of anti-Jakarta "regional coups" by military commanders in Sumatera and Sulawesi islands, and the subsequent declaration of martial law (''Staat van Oorlog en Beleg'') by President [[Sukarno]] on March 1957, Suharto became regional martial law administrator for the two provinces. With wide-ranging power over civilian affairs in his hands, Suharto began organizing various fund-raising activities to finance his poorly paid troops under the coordination of the division's "finance and economic office". Developing on the fund-raising tactics he used during the revolutionary war, Suharto established charitable organizations ("''jajasan''") which would receive "donations" from all enterprises operating in the provinces as well as levying "unofficial tax" on provision of goods and services. With the aid of ethnic-Chinese businessmen such as [[Bob Hasan]], Suharto organized bartering of sugar and copra to [[Singapore]] in exchange with much-needed food supplies. By 1959, Suharto's ''jajasan''s had acquired capital of Rp 75,750,800 (equivalent to 1959 US$1,683,351 and a current value of US$13.3 million).&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=52–55"/&gt;

The defeat of the PRRI-Permesta rebellions (in which Suharto's divisional soldiers were heavily involved) was followed by President [[Sukarno]]'s decree of 5 July 1959 concentrating power at the president. As part of re-assertion of central government control, army chief General [[Abdul Haris Nasution]] launched a nationwide crackdown on regional military corruption, including Suharto's commercial activities in Central Java. On July 1959, Nasution sent army internal audit chief Brigadier-General Sungkono to audit financial dealings of Diponegoro Division. The investigation found that while some of the proceeds from Suharto's ''jajasan''s were used for charitable purposes, most of the money raised could not be accounted for responsibly. On 1 November 1959, Suharto was removed from his divisional command and was instructed to attend army staff and command training (SSKAD, now SESKOAD) in [[Bandung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McDonald|1980|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this setback, Suharto's past services and strong backers meant that his future career remained undisturbed. While in Bandung he was promoted to brigadier-general on January 1960. Suharto graduated from SSKAD on December 1960 with a thesis on greater military role in political, economic, and social development of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt; He was then appointed as operational deputy to army chief-of-staff based in [[Jakarta]]. On March 1961, he was given an additional command, as head of the army's new general reserve force called ''Tjadangan Umum Angkatan Darat / TJADUAD'' (later renamed [[KOSTRAD|Komando Strategis Angkatan Darat / KOSTRAD]]), a ready-reaction air-mobile force. Additionally, he was appointed to lead the new army air-defence command (''Komando Pertahanan Udara Angkatan Darat / KOHANUDAD'') on October 1961.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;

On 9 January 1962, Suharto was promoted to the rank of major-general and appointed to lead Mandala Command, a joint army-navy-air force command of 42,000 soldiers formed the organize the military aspect of the campaign to win [[Netherlands New Guinea]] (whom Indonesians referred to as "West Irian"), from the Dutch who were preparing it for independence outside of Indonesia, contrary to the provisions of [[Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference]] of 1949.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt; His position as Mandala commander, based in [[Makassar]], provided martial-law power over [[Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands]], and [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] covering 5 million square kilometres. Suharto organized infiltration of around 3,000 Indonesian soldiers into the disputed territory by air and sea, although these infiltrators were mostly dropped deep in the jungle with no effect on Dutch control over population centers. With massive Soviet armaments and even manpower aid, Suharto formulated a highly risky plan to invade and capture Dutch military headquarters in [[Biak]] using 25,000 soldiers in an airborne and amphibious operation code-named ''Operasi Djajawidjaja'' set for 15 August 1962. However, Suharto received orders to abort the operation while he was already in-place at advanced headquarters in [[Peleng]] island, off Sulawesi. On 15 August, under heavy American pressure, the Dutch signed the [[New York Agreement]] whereby control over West Irian was relinquished to [[UNTEA]] (United National Temporary Executive Authority) on October 1962. On 1 May 1963, UNTEA handed-control of the territory to Indonesia. On that day, Suharto led a "victory parade" of Indonesian soldiers in front of President [[Sukarno]] at West Irian's capital Sukarnapura (formerly Hollandia, now [[Jayapura]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=80–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disbandment of Mandala Command on May 1963, Suharto returned to [[Jakarta]] to his post as KOSTRAD (formerly TJADUAD) commander. As evidence of his seniority, he was appointed as deputy head of army advisory board on senior-level promotions (WANDJAKTI) on July 1963. Again showing his penchant for commercial dealings, Suharto used his KOSTRAD command to establish several ''jajasan''s which ostensibly functioned to raise funds to cover KOSTRAD's operational needs. On April 1964, Suharto established ''Jajasan Darma Putra'', which over-time acquired shares in raft of businesses from transportation, banking, and manufacturing sectors (such as [[Mandala Airlines]] and Bank Windu Kentjana).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, [[Sukarno]] gradually shifted the country to the left by promoting the growth of [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) in order to counter the power of the military within his [[Guided Democracy]] system. On May 1964, Sukarno declared [[Konfrontasi|military confrontation]] against newly formed [[Malaysia]], with the stated objective of establishing "State of North Kalimantan" under leadership of [[North Kalimantan Communist Party]]. To organize the military aspect of this confrontation, Sukarno formed the Vigilance Command (''Komando Siaga / KOGA'') commanded by [[Indonesian Air Force|air force]] commander [[Omar Dhani]]. On October 1964, KOGA was transformed into Vigilance Mandala Command (''Komando Mandala Siaga / KOLAGA'') with wide-ranging martial law powers over the islands of [[Sumatera]] and [[Kalimantan]] which borders [[Malaysia]]. Dhani remained as KOLAGA commander, while Suharto was appointed as KOLAGA first deputy with authority over operational affairs. KOLAGA organized infiltration of Indonesian soldiers and volunteers (as well as Malaysian communists) into Malaysia where they engaged in jungle warfare with British and Commonwealth soldiers deployed to protect the nascent Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=90–93"&gt;{{harvnb|Elson|2001|pages=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While publicly supportive of Sukarno's confrontation policy, the army leadership was very reluctant to commit to the military confrontation against Malaysia, which they considered to benefit only the PKI at expense of the military. Additionally, the army was slighted by appointment of airforce commander Dhani, a known communist sympathiser, as KOLAGA commander. Army chief Lieutenant-General [[Ahmad Yani]] and Suharto ensured that the best-prepared troops and vital supplies remained in Java to ensure no escalation of the conflict. This strategy was supported by army commander in [[North Sumatera]], Colonel [[Kemal Idris]], who was an avowed anti-communist. However, the army commander in [[Kalimantan]], Brigadier-General Mustafa Sjarif Supardjo, was a committed communist sympathiser who strongly resented the army headquarters' barely disguised sabotage policy. He would later become a key participant in the [[30 September Movement]] against top army leadership. Unlike Yani who barely disguised his disapproval of confrontation policy, Suharto managed to maintain his public appearance as enthusiastic supporter of Sukarno's anti-Malaysian policies.&lt;ref name="Elson 2001 pages=90–93"/&gt;

On August 1964, Suharto authorised KOSTRAD's intelligence officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Ali Murtopo]], to send several officers (including future Armed Forces chief [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]]) to spread secret peace-feelers to the Malaysian government. Suharto's position in KOLAGA also provided him with more sinister commercial opportunity in organizing the smuggling of rubber, timber, and other primary products from North Sumatera to Malaysia using ethnic-Chinese fishermen.&lt;ref name="SMH_McDONALD" /&gt;

==Biography==

Parsons was the daughter of [[Henry Clews]], a wealthy [[New York City|New York]] [[banker]], and Lucy Madison Worthington. Her brother, Henry Clews, Jr. was an [[artist]]. On September 1, 1900, in [[Newport, Rhode Island]],&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |title= Miss Clews is Married |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E06EFDA1039E733A25751C0A96F9C946197D6CF |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Newport, Massachusetts |date=1900-09-02 |page=5 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |language= |trans-title=|quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; she married future three-term [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congressman|congressman]] [[Herbert Parsons (New York politician)|Herbert Parsons]], an associate and political ally of [[United States President|President]] [[Teddy Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Robert C | title = Cartoon of the Day | work = HarpWeek | publisher = HarpWeek, LLC | url = http://www.harpweek.com/09Cartoon/BrowseByDateCartoon.asp?Month=November&amp;Date=16 | accessdate =  2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her husband was a member of Congress, she published two then-controversial books under the [[pseudonym]] John Main.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Parsons, Elsie Clews | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online | year = 2007 | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058571 | accessdate = 2007-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons became interested in anthropology in 1910.&lt;ref name="ECPP" /&gt; She believed that [[folklore]] was a key to understanding a culture and that anthropology could be a vehicle for social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.andreageyer.info/revolttheysaid/p.html|title=Revolt, They Said|website=www.andreageyer.info|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work ''Pueblo Indian Religion'' is considered a classic; here she gathered all her previous extensive work and that of other authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gladys A. Reichard |title=The Elsie Clews Parsons collection Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society vol. 94, No. 3, Studies of Historical Documents in the Library of the American Philosophical Society |date=June 20, 1950 |pages=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, marred by intrusive and deceptive research techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strong|first=Pauline|year=2013|title=Parsons, Elsie Clews.|url=|journal=Theory in Social and Cultural Anthropology, ed. R. Jon McGee and Richard L. Warms,|volume=2|pages=609–612|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is, however, pointed to by current critical scholars as an archetypical example of an "Antimodern Feminist" thinker, known for their infatuation with Native American Indians that often manifested as a desire to preserve a "traditional" and "pure" Indian identity, irrespective of how Native Peoples themselves approached issues of modernization or cultural change. Grande (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;134){{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} argues that her racist and objectivizing tendencies towards indigenous peoples of the Americas is evidenced, for example, by her willingness to change her name and appropriate a Hopi "identity" primarily to increase her access to research sites and participants (Jacobs 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;102).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

== Feminist Ideas ==
Parsons feminist beliefs were viewed as extremely radical for her time. She was a proponent of trial marriages, [[Uncontested divorce|divorce by mutual consent]] and access to reliable contraception, which she wrote about in her book ''The Family'' (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Until Choice Do Us Part|last=Eby|first=Clare Virginia|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=022608597X|location=Chicago and London|pages=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote about the effects society had on the growth of individuals, and more precisely the effect of gender role expectations and how they stifle individual growth for both women and men. ''The Family'' (1906) was met with such back-lash she published her second book ''Religious Chastity'' (1913) under the pseudonym "John Main" as to not affect her husband, [[Herbert Parsons (New York politician)|Herbert Parsons]] political career. Her ideas where so far ahead that only after her death did they begin to be discussed. This has led to her becoming recognized as one of the early pioneers of the [[feminist movement]]. Her writings and her lifestyle challenged conventional gender roles at the time and helped spark the conversation for [[gender equality]].

'''Erich Mußfeldt''', (18 February 1913 – 24 January 1948) was a German [[War crime|war criminal]], an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] NCO who served in two [[extermination camps]] during [[World War II]] in [[occupied Poland]] - [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]].&lt;ref name="Koslov"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cairn.info/zen.php?ID_ARTICLE=EUFOR_357_0029 | title=Vous lisez.

He was retried by the [[Supreme National Tribunal]] at the [[Auschwitz Trial]] in [[Kraków]], and found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]]. Muhsfeldt was sentenced to death by hanging in December 1947, and executed on 24 January 1948.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/WarCrime4.html | title=Auschwitz Trial (November-December 1947) | publisher=Jewish Virtual Library.org | work=The Holocaust | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-04-23 | author=AHF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhsfeldt was a baker in civilian life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pamiec.pl/pa/form/r80515825887,MUHSFELDT-alias-MUSSFELDT.html|title=MUHSFELDT alias MUSSFELDT - Załoga SS KL Auschwitz -  Pamięć.pl - portal edukacyjny IPN|author=|date=|website=pamiec.pl|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his service in the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverbände]]'' he was reportedly married with one son. The fate of his wife is unclear. According to [[Miklós Nyiszli]],&lt;ref name="Nyiszli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auschwitz.dk/Nyiszli.htm |title=An eyewitness from Auschwitz: book citations online |work=The Holocaust documents.

==World War II atrocities==
Originally Muhsfeldt served with the German ''[[Schutzstaffel#SS-Sonderkommandos|SS-Sonderkommando]]'' at [[Auschwitz I]] in 1940. He was transferred to the work/extermination camp at [[Majdanek]] on 15 November 1941. He was involved in the final mass shooting of the camp's remaining Jewish inmates known as the [[Operation Harvest Festival]] or "Erntefest". It was the largest single-day, single-camp massacre of [[the Holocaust]],&lt;ref name="ushmm-Majdanek"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007298 | title=Soviet forces liberate Majdanek | publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, DC | work=Lublin/Majdanek: Chronology | date=May 11, 2012 | accessdate=2013-04-13 | author=USHMM}}&lt;/ref&gt; totalling 43,000 in three nearby locations.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://history1900s.about.com/cs/persecution/a/erntefest.htm | title=Aktion Erntefest | publisher=About.com Education | work=20th Century History | accessdate=2013-04-16 | author=Jennifer Rosenberg | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227225342/http://history1900s.about.com/cs/persecution/a/erntefest.htm | archivedate=2016-12-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Majdanek]] camp was liquidated, he transferred back to [[Auschwitz]], where he then served as supervising ''SS'' officer of the Jewish ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' in Crematorium II and III in [[Auschwitz|Auschwitz II (Birkenau)]].

Upon his return to Auschwitz, Muhsfeldt had an unusual relationship with renowned Jewish-Hungarian pathologist [[Miklós Nyiszli]], who was forced to carry out autopsies on behalf of [[Josef Mengele]].&lt;ref name="Nyiszli"/&gt; Nyiszli survived the war and later gave evidence about what happened at Auschwitz. Nyiszli described one incident when Muhsfeldt came to him for a routine check-up, after shooting 80 prisoners in the back of the head prior to their cremation. Nyiszli commented that Muhsfeldt's blood pressure was high, and inquired as to whether this could be related to the recent increase in "traffic", as the mass murder of newly arrived victims was euphemistically called. Muhsfeldt replied angrily that it made no difference to him, whether he shot one person or eighty. If his blood pressure was too high, it was because he drank too much he said.&lt;ref name="Nyiszli"/&gt;

Nyiszli described an exceedingly rare occurrence, in which an inmate girl 15 or younger due to highly unusual circumstances, managed to survive the gas chamber and, with medical help from Nyiszli and others after she was discovered alive, was partially recovering. Nyiszli took up her case with Muhsfeldt asking that her life be spared. Muhsfeldt replied "There's no way of getting round it, the child will have to die." Nyiszli explains that "Half an hour later the young girl was led, or rather carried, into the furnace room hallway, and there [Muhsfeldt] sent another in his place to do the job. A bullet in the back of the neck..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auschwitz.dk/Mengele/id26.htm|title=An Eyewitness|author=|date=|website=auschwitz.dk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war had ended, Muhsfeldt was arrested and charged by the War Crimes Group, European Command initially. He was retried in [[Kraków]] by the [[Supreme National Tribunal]] in 1947, where he was [[sentenced to death]] for his war crimes. He was executed by hanging on 24 January 1948.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary"/&gt;

Muhsfeldt appears as a minor character in the 1983 [[James A. Michener|James Michener]] novel [[Poland (novel)|Poland]].

The family of [[Angela Merkel]], the [[Chancellor of Germany]], is of [[Germans|German]] and [[Poles|Polish]] descent. Merkel was born Angela Dorothea Kasner on 17 July 1954 in [[Hamburg]]. The Kasner name is derived from Jan Kaźmierczak, a Pole from [[Poznań]] who lived in the 18th century. Merkel's grandfather changed the name to Kasner in 1930. Merkel has been married twice, and kept the name of her first husband Ulrich Merkel. Angela Merkel's family was extensively discussed in a 2013 biography.&lt;ref&gt;Kornelius, Stefan (2013).

The '''1969 reelection campaign of Ferdinand Marcos''', the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|10th]] [[President of the Republic of the Philippines]], started in July 1969 when incumbent President Ferdinand Marcos was unanimously nominated as the Presidential candidate of the Nacionalista Party, and concluded when the [[Philippine presidential election, 1969|1969 Philippine presidential election]] concluded with Marcos winning an unprecedented second full term as [[President of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Kasaysayan, The Story of the Filipino People Volume 9:A Nation Reborn. |publisher=Asia Publishing Company Limited |year=1998 |editor-last=Magno |editor-first=Alexander R. |location=Hong Kong |chapter=Democracy at the Crossroads}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Fernando Lopez as his vice president, he ran against the Liberal Party slate of, Sergio Osmena, Jr and Genaro Magsaysay.&lt;ref name="Joaquin2013"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853430289 |title=Reportage on the Marcoses, 1964-1970 |last=Nick, |first=Joaquin, |publisher=Anvil Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=9789712728174 |location=Mandaluyong City, Philippines, |oclc=853430289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Ferdinand Marcos won his first campaign for the Philippine Presidency in November 1965, and was inaugurated just before new year's day in December the same year.  Under the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines which was in force at the time, Marcos was supposed to be allowed a maximum of two four year terms as President.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

== Formal Nomination ==
The formal beginning of the 1969 campaign can be dated to the July 1969 meeting of the Philippines' Nacionalista Party, in which Ferdinand Marcos was formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate.  A meeting of the party's ruling junta had met a week earlier to assure that the nomination would be unanimous.&lt;ref name="Joaquin2013"/&gt;

== "Guns, goons, and gold" ==
With his popularity already beefed up by debt-funded spending, Marcos' popularity made it very likely that he would win the election, but he decided, as National Artist for Literature [[Nick Joaquin]] reported in the [[Philippines Free Press]], to "''leave nothing to chance''."&lt;ref name="Joaquin2013"/&gt;  Time and Newsweek would eventually call the 1969 election the "''dirtiest, most violent and most corrupt''" in Philippine modern history, with the term "Three Gs", meaning "''guns, goons, and gold''"&lt;ref name="Parsa2000"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=41_EXD1hWlgC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=guns+goons+and+gold+1969&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sGho6THhb_&amp;sig=TJpjktRQxR42AWagVnCEAlDV4h8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrluSkiJnbAhUIJJQKHVcjDr8Q6AEwDXoECAEQbg#v=onepage&amp;q=guns%2520goons%2520and%2520gold%25201969&amp;f=false |title=States, Ideologies, and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of Iran, Nicaragua, and the Philippines |last=Parsa |first=Misagh |date=2000-08-17 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521774307 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/philippinen/50071.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined&lt;ref name="SunStarEditorial20160229"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/60678/ |title=Editorial: Protecting the vote |last=editorial-protecting-vote-459796 |date=2016-02-29 |work=Sunstar |access-date=2018-05-22 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe administration's election tactics of vote-buying, terrorism and ballot snatching.&lt;ref name="DeQuiros1997"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39051509|title=Dead aim : how Marcos ambushed Philippine democracy|last=Conrado.|first=De Quiros,|date=1997|publisher=Foundation for Worldwide People's Power|others=Foundation for Worldwide People Power (Manila, Philippines)|isbn=9719167033|location=Pasig City|oclc=39051509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos used the military and the government bureaucracy for his campaign, with members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines participating in putting up campaign propaganda.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

Marcos also launched USD50 million worth in infrastructure projects in an effort to curry favor with the electorate.&lt;ref name=Burton1989&gt;{{Cite book |title=Impossible Dream: The Marcoses, the Aquinos, and the Unfinished Revolution. |last=Burton  |first=Sandra  |publisher=Warner Books  |year=1989 |isbn=0446513989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rapid campaign spending was so massive that it would be responsible for the Balance of Payments Crisis of 1970, whose inflationary effect would cause social unrest leading all the way up to the proclamation of Martial Law in 1972.&lt;ref name=Balbosas1992&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Balbosa |first=Joven Zamoras |date=Second Semester 1992 |title=IMF Stabilization Program and Economic Growth: The Case of the Philippines |journal=Journal of Philippine Development  |volume=XIX|issue=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cororaton1997"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Cororaton |first=Cesar B.  |title=Exchange Rate Movements in the Philippines |journal=DPIDS iscussion Paper Series 97-05. |pages=3, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcos was reported to have spent PhP 100 for every PhP 1 that Osmena spent, using up PhP 24 Million in Cebu alone.&lt;ref name="DeQuiros1997"/&gt;

=== Election violence ===
The most violent election-related incidents took place in Batanes, where Philippine Constabulary officers, paramilitary groups, and hired guns essentially took over the island, and motorcycle-riding thugs rode around terrorizing voters and Comelec officials, and beating up opposition leaders.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

== Results ==
Presidential, legislative and local elections were held on November 11, 1969, resulting in an unprecedented second full term as [[President of the Philippines]] for Incumbent President Marcos. Incumbent Vice President [[Fernando Lopez]] was also elected to a third full term as [[Vice President of the Philippines]]. Twelve other candidates ran for president, however ten of those were widely considered "nuisance candidates," and did not garner a significant number of votes in the election.

== In popular media ==
* The 1977 [[Eddie Romero]] classic [[Banta ng Kahapon]] starring  [[Vic Vargas]], [[Bembol Roco]], [[Roland Dantes]] and [[Chanda Romero]] was set during the 1969 campaign period.

'''Franco-Ontarians''' ({{lang-fr|Franco-Ontariens}} or ''Franco-Ontariennes'' if female) are [[French Canadian]] or [[francophone]] residents of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]]. They are sometimes known as "''Ontarois''".

There are more than 600,000 francophones residing in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2018/11/21/ford-has-delivered-a-slap-in-the-face-to-ontarios-francophones.html|title=Ford has delivered a slap in the face to Ontario’s francophones {{!}} The Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2016 Canadian [[census]], there were 550,600 people living in Ontario who declared French their first official language spoken, 490,715 people who declared French their mother tongue, and 277,045 Ontarians who declared French as the language they speak most often at home.&lt;ref name=census2016/&gt; Over 1.4 million Ontarians reported themselves as bilingual, and 1.3 million Ontarians reported French ethnic origins. French-speaking Ontarians constitute the largest French-speaking community in Canada outside Quebec, as well as the largest minority language group within Ontario, and French is the fourth most common ethnic background in the province after English, Scottish and Irish.

The francophone population is concentrated primarily in [[Eastern Ontario]], in [[Ottawa]], [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]] and many rural farming communities, and in [[Northeastern Ontario]], in the cities of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]] and [[Timmins]] and a number of smaller towns, but can also be found in smaller numbers throughout the province. Other communities with notable francophone populations are [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[London, Ontario|London]], [[St. Catharines, Ontario|St. Catharines]], [[Lakeshore, Ontario|Lakeshore]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Penetanguishene]] and [[Welland]].

Ottawa, with 128,620 francophones, has the province's largest Franco-Ontarian community by size. Among the province's major cities, [[Greater Sudbury]] has the largest proportion of Franco-Ontarians to the general population at 29 per cent, and Timmins has the largest proportion among the smaller sized cities at 41 per cent. [[Prescott and Russell United Counties, Ontario|Prescott and Russell United Counties]] has the highest proportion of Franco-Ontarians to the general population among the province's census divisions, with about two-thirds of the population being francophone.

Some smaller communities in Ontario have a francophone majority. These include [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]], [[Kapuskasing]], [[Smooth Rock Falls, Ontario|Smooth Rock Falls]], [[Embrun, Ontario|Embrun]], [[St. Charles, Ontario|St. Charles]], [[West Nipissing|Sturgeon Falls]], [[Rockland, Ontario|Rockland]], [[Casselman, Ontario|Casselman]], [[Dubreuilville]], [[Vankleek Hill, Ontario|Vankleek Hill]] and [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury]].

==Early settlement==

The French presence in Ontario dates from the mid-17th century.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Early settlements in the region include the Mission of [[Sainte-Marie among the Hurons]] at [[Midland, Ontario|Midland]] in 1649, [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Sainte Marie]] in 1668, and [[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]] in 1701. Southern Ontario was part of the ''Pays d'en-haut'' (Upper Country) of [[New France]] and was later part of the province of Quebec until Quebec was split into [[The Canadas]] in 1791. However, prior to the [[Articles of Capitulation of Quebec]], which handed control of New France from [[France]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], modern-day Ontario had only very limited European settlement, apart from a few military forts. Modern Franco-Ontarians are instead descended primarily from people who moved to Ontario from Quebec or [[New Brunswick]] in the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Franco-Ontarian identity==    
The term ''Franco-Ontarian'' has two related usages which overlap closely but are not identical: it may refer to francophone residents of Ontario, regardless of their place of birth, or to people of French Canadian ancestry ''born'' in Ontario, regardless of their primary language or current place of residence.

In popular usage, the first meaning predominates and the second is poorly understood. Although most Franco-Ontarians meet both definitions, there are notable exceptions. For example, although [[Louise Charron]] was the first native-born Franco-Ontarian appointed to the bench of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], she was preceded as a francophone judge from Ontario by [[Louise Arbour]], a [[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecer]] who worked in Ontario for much of her professional career as a lawyer and judge. As a result, both women have been referred to as "the first Franco-Ontarian Supreme Court justice", although the technically correct practice is to credit Charron, Franco-Ontarian in both senses, with that distinction.

Conversely, two of the most famous [[rock music|rock]] musicians from Ontario, [[Avril Lavigne]] and [[Alanis Morissette]], are Franco-Ontarian by the second definition but not by the first, since they were born to Franco-Ontarian parents but currently live outside Ontario and work primarily in English. Former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] was born in Windsor to a Franco-Ontarian father from [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]] and an anglophone mother, although many Canadians consider him a Quebecer as he represented a [[Montreal]] [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] in Parliament.

Both meanings can be politically charged. Using the second to the exclusion of the first may be considered offensive to some in that it excludes francophones born in or with [[ethnic origin]]s from other countries, such as [[Haiti]], [[Vietnam]] or [[Tunisia]], from the Franco-Ontarian community. Using the first to the exclusion of the second obscures the very real ethno-cultural distinctions that exist between Franco-Ontarians, Québécois, [[Acadians]], [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] and other Canadian francophone communities, and the pressures toward assimilation into the [[English Canadian]] majority that the community faces. As a result, the complex political and sociological context of ''Franco-Ontarian'' can only be fully understood by recognizing both meanings and understanding the distinctions between the two.

The Franco-Ontarian identity is further split into three groups according to historical waves of settlement and immigration.  The first wave of settlement in the Detroit/Windsor area came in the 18th century, under French rule.  Most settlers then came from what is now Quebec, including both full French and Métis.  A second wave came in the 19th and early 20th centuries to the areas of Eastern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario.  This was an immigration wave, in the sense that Ontario was primarily British and mainly English-speaking, but the migrants can also be considered settlers, because they founded many villages or settled within already existing francophone communities.  In the [[Ottawa Valley]], in particular, some families have moved back and forth across the Ottawa river for generations (the river is the border between Ontario and Quebec), which results in a complex borderland identity. In the city of [[Ottawa]] some areas such as Vanier and Orleans have a rich Francophone heritage, with families often having members on both sides of the [[Ottawa River]].

The third and most recent wave consists of Quebecers and other francophones ([[Haiti]]ans, [[Maghreb]]ans, Europeans, etc.) who move to the larger cities and often preserve their original identity (Québécois, Haitian, etc.) as their primary cultural affiliation. Franco-Ontarians may also have historical ties to more than one of these three groups, which blurs the lines between these distinctions. Intermarriage between Franco-Ontarians and people of other ethnic or cultural backgrounds is also quite common. 

The term "Ontarois", following the convention that a francophone minority is referred to with ending of -ois, is sometimes used to distinguish French-speaking Ontarians, while the general term for Ontarian in French is ''Ontarien''.

==Government==
[[File:Ontario French service areas.png|thumb|250px|right|Map of French service areas in Ontario. Dark blue indicates areas designated in their entirety; light blue indicates areas that include designated communities.]]
Although Ontario as a whole is not officially [[bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]], the Ontario government's [[French Language Services Act]] designates 25 areas of the province where provincial ministries and agencies are required to provide local French-language services to the public. An area is designated as a French service area if the francophone population is greater than 5,000 people ''or'' 10% of the community's total population. Due to the 5,000 population threshold, large cities that are actually overwhelmingly anglophone (and may also have several widely-spoken [[Immigration to Canada|immigrant]] languages) with virtually no obvious francophone element due to very low percentages, such as [[Toronto]] (population 2,731,571) or [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]] (population 593,638) are nevertheless still subject to the Act.    

The French Language Services Act applies to provincial government services only. It does not require municipal governments to provide bilingual services. Municipal governments may, however, provide French language services at their own discretion.

The following [[List of Ontario census divisions|census divisions]] (denoted in dark blue on the map) are designated areas in their entirety:
* [[Algoma District]]
* [[Cochrane District]]
* [[Greater Sudbury]]
* [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]
* [[Nipissing District]]
* [[Ottawa]]
* [[United Counties of Prescott and Russell|Prescott and Russell United Counties]]
* [[Sudbury District]]
* [[Timiskaming District]]
* [[Toronto]]

The following census divisions (denoted in light blue on the map) are not fully designated areas, but have communities within their borders which are designated for bilingual services:

*[[Chatham-Kent]]: [[Tilbury, Ontario|Tilbury]], [[Dover Township, Ontario|Dover Township]], [[Tilbury East, Ontario|Tilbury East Township]]
*[[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]]: [[Lakeshore, Ontario|Lakeshore]], [[Tecumseh, Ontario|Tecumseh]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]
*[[Frontenac County]]: [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]
*[[Kenora District]]: [[Ignace, Ontario|Ignace]]
*[[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]]: [[London, Ontario|London]]
*[[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara Regional Municipality]]: [[Port Colborne]], [[Welland]]
*[[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]]: [[Mississauga]], [[Brampton]]
*[[Renfrew County]]: [[Laurentian Valley, Ontario|Laurentian Valley]], [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], [[Whitewater Region, Ontario|Whitewater Region]]
*[[Simcoe County]]: [[Essa, Ontario|Essa]], [[Penetanguishene]], [[Tiny, Ontario|Tiny]]
*[[United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry|Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry United Counties]]: [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], [[North Glengarry, Ontario|North Glengarry]], [[North Stormont, Ontario|North Stormont]], [[South Glengarry, Ontario|South Glengarry]], [[South Stormont, Ontario|South Stormont]], [[Winchester, Ontario|Winchester]]
*[[Thunder Bay District]]: [[Greenstone, Ontario|Greenstone]], [[Manitouwadge, Ontario|Manitouwadge]], [[Marathon, Ontario|Marathon]], [[Terrace Bay, Ontario|Terrace Bay]]

The most recent addition to the list of designated areas is the city of Kingston. It was named in May 2006, and after the three-year implementation period provided for by the French Language Services Act, officially became a bilingual service centre in 2009.

The [[Office of Francophone Affairs]] is the government agency responsible for ensuring that French language services are provided. Francophones who live in non-designated areas can also receive French language services by directly contacting the Office of Francophone Affairs in Toronto, or in the nearest designated community. The cabinet minister currently responsible for the Office of Francophone Affairs is [[Marie-France Lalonde]].

The judicial system in Ontario is officially bilingual in all areas, although in some parts of the province a legal matter involving francophones may have to be transferred to another region where francophone services are more readily available. A francophone who wishes to be served in French by the judicial system cannot be refused this transfer if he or she cannot be served locally in French.

There are 44 municipalities in Ontario which are officially or functionally bilingual at the municipal level. Most of these are members of the [[Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario]], or ''AFMO''.

On April 26, 2010, the Ontario government designated September 25 as Franco-Ontarian Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofa.gov.on.ca/en/news-100426.html |publisher=Government of Ontario |date=April 26, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-25 |title=September 25 Is Now Franco-Ontarian Day |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114180147/http://www.ofa.gov.on.ca/en/news-100426.html |archivedate=November 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This date was chosen as it represented the anniversary of the official raising of the Franco-Ontarian flag in 1975.

==Education==
In the past, the Ontario government was often much less supportive of and often openly hostile toward the Franco-Ontarian community. [[Regulation 17]], passed in 1912, forbade French-language instruction in Ontario schools. Although the regulation itself was rescinded in 1927, the government continued to refuse funding for French language high schools until the latter half of the 1960s. As a result, francophones had to pursue high school education in English, pay tuition to private high schools (which few Franco-Ontarian families could afford), or simply stop attending school after Grade 9.&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Wallace and Ashley Thomson, ''Sudbury: Rail Town to Regional Capital''. [[Dundurn Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55002-170-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, several generations of Franco-Ontarians grew up without formal education since the dropout rate for francophones was quite high during this period. Franco-Ontarians thus opted for jobs which did not require reading and mathematical skills, such as mining and forestry, and were virtually absent from white collar jobs. Sociologically, it meant that education was not a value transmitted to younger Franco-Ontarians. Although this has changed dramatically since the advent of funding for francophone high schools in the 1960s, according to the 2001 census, francophones in Ontario still tend to have a lower level of education than the general population.

Further, those who do have higher levels of education often pursue job opportunities in larger cities, particularly Ottawa or even Montreal, which can create a barrier to economic development in their home communities. As well, even today many students of Franco-Ontarian background are still educated in anglophone schools. This has the effect of reducing the use of French as a first language in the province, and thereby limiting the growth of the Franco-Ontarian community; in the [[Canada 2006 Census]], for example, 40 per cent of residents of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] reported themselves as able to speak or understand French, but only 16 per cent of the city's population reported actually using the French language in their daily lives and barely one per cent of the city's population reported themselves as being exclusively francophone.

Ontario now has eight French-language [[Roman Catholic]] [[school boards]] and four French-language [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] boards. Each of these school boards serves a significantly larger [[catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] than an English-language school board in the province, due to the smaller francophone population.

Currently, Ontario has two exclusively francophone [[List of Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology|community colleges]], [[La Cité collégiale]] in Ottawa, with a second campus in Hawkesbury, and [[Collège Boréal]] in Sudbury, with additional campuses in several Northern Ontario communities, and one in Toronto. Collège Boréal also operates a network of student access centres throughout the province to promote its programs and services. A third college, [[Collège des Grands-Lacs]] in Toronto, ceased operations in 2002, and its programs and services are now the Toronto campus of Collège Boréal. The [[Ontario Agricultural College]] has a francophone campus in Alfred.

Ontario has four universities which offer instruction in both English and French: [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Laurentian University]] in Sudbury, the [[Dominican University College]] in Ottawa, and the [[University of Ottawa]]. [[York University]] in Toronto has a bilingual [[federated school|federated college]], [[Glendon College]], although the university is otherwise an anglophone institution. Laurentian University has a federated college, [[Université de Hearst]], which, although not a fully independent university, is the only exclusively francophone university-level institution in the province. In 2015, MPP [[France Gélinas]] introduced a private member's bill to mandate the creation of a fully independent French-language university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernlife.ca/news/localNews/2015/05/26-french-language-university-sudbury.aspx "Ontario needs a French university? Bien sûr, Gélinas says"]. ''[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]]'', May 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and media==
The primary cultural organization of the Franco-Ontarian community is the [[AFO (Canada)|Assemblée de la francophonie de l'Ontario]], or AFO, which coordinates many of the community's cultural and political activities.

===Franco-Ontarian flag===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Trillium]] --&gt;
[[File:Franco-Ontarian flag.svg|thumb|Franco-Ontarian flag]]
The [[Franco-Ontarian flag]] consists of two bands of green and white. The left portion has a solid light green background with a white [[fleur-de-lys]] in the middle, while the right portion has a solid white background with a stylized green [[trillium]] in the middle. The green represents the summer months, while the white represents the winter months. The trillium is the floral symbol of Ontario, while the fleur-de-lys represents the [[French-Canadian]] heritage of the Franco-Ontarian community. The green color on the flag is [[Pantone]] 349.

The flag was created in 1975 by Gaétan Gervais, history professor and Michel Dupuis, first year political science student, both from Laurentian University.&lt;ref&gt;"Sudbury celebrates 30 years with Franco-Ontarian flag". ''[[Sudbury Star]]'', September 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially recognized by the Ontario PC government as the emblem of the Franco-Ontarian community in the Franco-Ontarian Emblem Act of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_01f05_e.htm Franco-Ontarian Emblem Act of 2001].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Les Monuments de la francophonie d'Ottawa===
The historical park, also known as Les Monuments de la francophonie d'Ottawa, was built by the francophone community to commemorate francophone contribution in the development and well being of the City of Ottawa.  The first of six Monuments de la francophonie d'Ottawa designed by Edward J. Cuhaci represents the first homes and the founding of Bytown. The next five monuments, each progressing uphill,  highlight business achievements that were crucial to the prosperity of Ottawa economy. The seventh monument, an unfinished granite block, symbolizes future developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuhaci.com/index.php/projects/heritage/210-monument-de-la-francophonie-dottawa|title=Edward J Cuhaci and Associates Architects Inc - Monument de la francophonie d’Ottawa|first=|last=cuhaci|website=www.cuhaci.com|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag is 5 x 10 m and was raised on a 27 m pole.

===Language===
The dialects of French spoken in Ontario are similar to, but distinct from, [[Quebec French]] and constitute part of the greater [[Canadian French]] dialect. Due to the large English majority in the province, English loanwords are sometimes used in the informal or slang registers of Franco-Ontarian French. While English loanwords occur to a large extent in many varieties of French in Canada and Europe, there has been more of a conscious effort in Quebec to eliminate anglicisms.

In addition, the majority of Franco-Ontarians are, out of necessity, functionally or fluently bilingual in English, a fact that encourages borrowing, as does the fact that the English language has a greater prestige in the province from its being a majority language. Franco-Ontarian communities with a small francophone population tend to have more English-influenced French, and some younger speakers there may feel more comfortable using English than French. On the other hand, the French spoken in French-dominant Ontarian communities (such as Hearst and Hawkesbury), or in those communities near the Quebec border (such as Ottawa), is virtually indistinguishable from Quebec French.

Furthermore, improved access to publicly funded French-language schools and the establishment of bilingual universities and French language community colleges has improved French-language proficiency in younger populations.

===Folklore===
Franco-Ontarians retain many cultural traditions from their [[French Canadian]] ancestry. For example, unmarried elder siblings ''dansent sur leurs bas'' (dance on their socks) when their younger siblings get married. [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] Franco-Ontarians attend ''messe de minuit'' (midnight mass) on [[Christmas Eve]]. Many Franco-Ontarians also enjoy late night feasts/parties on Christmas Eve, called ''[[réveillon]]'', at which [[tourtière]] is a common dish.

===Media===
Ontario has one francophone daily newspaper, ''[[Le Droit]]'' in Ottawa. However, several other communities in Ontario are served by francophone community weekly papers, including ''[[L'Express de Toronto]]'', ''[[Le Voyageur]]'' in Sudbury, ''[[L'Action (London, Ontario)|L'Action]]'' in London/Sarnia, ''[[Le Rempart]]'' in Windsor and ''[[Le Journal de Cornwall]]''. Important historical publications include Sudbury's ''[[L'Ami du peuple (Canadian newspaper)|L'Ami du peuple]]'', published from 1942 to 1968.

The province has two [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]] stations, [[CBOFT-DT]] in Ottawa and [[CBLFT-DT]] in Toronto, which previously had rebroadcast transmitters throughout the province but remain available provincewide on basic cable. Both stations carry identical programming broadcast from [[Montreal]], except for local news. CBOFT produces a newscast for broadcast only in the Ottawa area, while CBLFT produces another serving the rest of the province. The network formerly also operated [[CBEFT]] in Windsor, which was shut down in 2012.

The provincial government operates [[TFO]], a sister channel to [[TVOntario]], which is available provincewide via mandatory carriage on basic cable or satellite packages and via online streaming. In 2003, TFO produced and aired ''[[Francoeur]]'', the first Franco-Ontarian ''[[téléroman]]''. In 2008, TFO also began airing the first Franco-Ontarian [[sitcom]], ''[[Météo+]]'' — itself, in part, a satire of the Franco-Ontarian community's relative lack of access to local French-language media. In 2012, the production team behind ''Météo+'' launched ''[[Les Bleus de Ramville]]''.

The Quebec-based francophone network [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] as well as specialty channels [[TV5 Québec Canada]] and [[Ici RDI]] are available on all Ontario cable systems, as these channels are mandated by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] for carriage by all Canadian cable operators. Where there is sufficient local demand for French-language television, Ontario cable systems may also offer French-language channels such as [[V (TV network)|V]], [[Ici ARTV]], [[MusiquePlus]] and [[Réseau des sports|RDS]], although these channels only have discretionary status outside Quebec and are typically offered only on a [[digital cable]] tier rather than in basic cable packages.

On radio, the Franco-Ontarian community is served primarily by Radio-Canada's [[Ici Radio-Canada Première]] network, which has originating stations in Ottawa ([[CBOF-FM|CBOF]]), Toronto ([[CJBC (AM)|CJBC]]), Sudbury ([[CBON-FM|CBON]]) and Windsor ([[CBEF]]), with rebroadcasters throughout Ontario. ''[[Ici Musique]]'', Radio-Canada's arts and culture network, currently broadcasts only in Ottawa ([[CBOX-FM|CBOX]]), Toronto ([[CJBC-FM]]), Sudbury ([[CBBX-FM|CBBX]]), [[Kitchener-Waterloo]] (CJBC-FM-1) and Windsor (CJBC-FM-2), with an additional transmitter licensed but not yet launched in Timmins.

Non-profit francophone community stations exist in several communities, including Penetanguishene ([[CFRH-FM|CFRH]]), Hearst ([[CINN-FM|CINN]]), Kapuskasing ([[CKGN-FM|CKGN]]), Cornwall ([[CHOD-FM|CHOD]]), Ottawa ([[CJFO-FM|CJFO]]) and Toronto ([[CHOQ-FM|CHOQ]]). Many [[campus radio]] stations air one or two hours per week of French-language programming as well, although only [[CHUO-FM|CHUO]] at the University of Ottawa and [[CKLU-FM|CKLU]] at Laurentian University are officially bilingual stations.

Francophone commercial radio stations exist in Sudbury ([[CHYC-FM|CHYC]]), Timmins ([[CHYK-FM|CHYK]]) and Sturgeon Falls/North Bay ([[CHYQ-FM|CHYQ]]); all three stations are owned and operated by [[Le5 Communications]], and air distinct locally-targeted morning shows while operating for the remainder of the day as a shared region-wide simulcast with each station originating some of the common programming. Ottawa francophones are served by the commercial radio stations licensed to [[Gatineau]], and many other Eastern Ontario communities are within the broadcast range of the Gatineau and [[Montreal]] media markets. One station in [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury]] ([[CHPR-FM|CHPR]]) airs a few hours per week of locally oriented programming, but otherwise simulcasts a commercial station from Montreal.

===Film===
Through their proximity to Gatineau or Montreal, Ottawa and the communities east of it toward Montreal are the only regions in Ontario which have regular access to French-language theatrical films. However, [[Cinéfest]] in Sudbury and the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] include francophone films in their annual festival programs, the Toronto-based [[Cinéfranco]] festival programs a lineup consisting entirely of francophone films, and community groups in many smaller communities offer French film screenings from time to time. Francophone films also air on TFO and Radio-Canada.

===Theatre and music===
Nine professional theatre companies offer French language theatrical productions, including five companies in Ottawa ([[Théâtre du Trillium]], [[Théâtre de la Vieille 17]], [[Vox Théâtre]], [[Théâtre la Catapulte]] and [[Créations In Vivo]]), one in Sudbury ([[Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario]]) and three in Toronto ([[Théâtre Corpus]], [[Théâtre La Tangente]] and [[Théâtre Franglais de Toronto]]). There are also numerous community theatre groups and school theatre groups.

Annual music festivals include [[La Nuit sur l'étang]] in Sudbury and the [[Festival Franco-Ontarien]] in Ottawa. Notable figures in Franco-Ontarian music include [[Robert Paquette]], [[Marcel Aymar]], [[En Bref]], [[Chuck Labelle]], [[Les Chaizes Muzikales]], [[Brasse-Camarade]], [[Swing (Canadian band)|Swing]], [[Konflit Dramatik]], [[Stéphane Paquette]], [[Damien Robitaille]] and [[CANO]].

The song "Notre Place" by [[Paul Demers]] and François Dubé, long considered an unofficial anthem of the Franco-Ontarian community after it was written for a gala to celebrate the passage of the French Language Services Act in 1986, was legally designated as the community's official anthem by the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1019975/notre-place-devient-lhymne-officiel-des-franco-ontariens ''Notre place'' devient l'hymne officiel des Franco-Ontariens]. [[CBC News|Ici Radio-Canada]], March 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www5.tfo.org/onfr/la-chanson-notre-place-reconnue-hymne-officiel-des-franco-ontariens/ La chanson «Notre Place» reconnue hymne officiel des Franco-Ontariens]. [[TFO]], March 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishing and literature===
Ontario has seven francophone [[publishing]] companies, including Sudbury's [[Prise de parole]], Ottawa's [[Editions Le Nordir]] and [[Les Éditions David]].

Notable Franco-Ontarian writers include [[Lola Lemire Tostevin]], [[Daniel Poliquin]], [[Robert Dickson (writer)|Robert Dickson]], [[Jean-Marc Dalpé]], [[François Paré]], Gaston Tremblay, [[Michel Bock]], [[Doric Germain]], [[Fernand Dorais]] and [[Hédi Bouraoui]]. The [[French-language]] scholar [[Joseph Médard Carrière]] was Franco-Ontarian.

==Political aspects==
In the late 1980s, several Ontario towns and cities, most famously [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], were persuaded by the [[Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada]] to declare themselves ''English-only'' in the wake of the ''French Language Services Act'' and the [[Meech Lake Accord]] debate. This was considered by many observers to be a direct contributor to the resurgence of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]] in the 1990s, and consequently to the [[Quebec referendum, 1995|1995 Quebec referendum]]. (See also [[Sault Ste. Marie language resolution]].)

Quebec writer [[Yves Beauchemin]]  once controversially referred to the Franco-Ontarian community as ''"warm corpses"'' (« cadavres encore chauds ») who had no chance of surviving as a community. In a similar vein, former Quebec Premier [[René Lévesque]] referred to them as "dead ducks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;se=gglsc&amp;d=5008170864&amp;er=deny|title=The Drama of Identity in Canada's Francophone West&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2004, a Toronto lawyer successfully challenged a "no left turn" traffic ticket on the basis that the sign was not bilingual in accordance with the 1986 ''French Language Services Act''. The judge in ''R. v. Myers'' ruled that the traffic sign was not a municipal service, but instead was regulated under the provincial ''Highway Traffic Act'' and therefore subject to the bilingual requirements of the ''French Language Services Act''.&lt;ref name=petruzzo&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2011/2011onca386/2011onca386.html "R. v. Petruzzo, 2011 ONCA 386 (CanLII)"]. [[CanLII]], May 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As this was a lower court ruling, it did not affect any other court. However the implication of the decision was that many traffic signs in bilingually designated areas of Ontario would be invalid. It was feared that the ruling would have a similar effect as the Manitoba Language Rights ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1985/1985rcs1-721/1985rcs1-721.html Manitoba Language Rights ruling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905065558/http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1985/1985rcs1-721/1985rcs1-721.html |date=2009-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in this case forcing municipalities to erect new bilingual road signs at great expense and invalidating millions of dollars in existing tickets before the courts. The City of Toronto appealed the ruling. At the appeal hearing both parties asked the court to enter a plea of guilty. A guilty verdict was entered even though no arguments were made by either side on the merits of the case.&lt;ref&gt;2005 CarswellOnt 10019&lt;/ref&gt; The situation created a legal vacuum for several years, during which numerous defendants used the bilingual signage argument to fight traffic tickets. The precedent was overturned by the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] in a 2011 case, ''R. v. Petruzzo'', on the grounds that the ''French Language Services Act'' specifically states that municipalities are not required to offer services in French, even in provincially regulated areas such as traffic signage, if the municipality has not specifically passed its own bylaw governing its own provision of bilingual services.&lt;ref name=petruzzo /&gt;

Ontario's Minister of Francophone Affairs, [[Madeleine Meilleur]], became the province's first cabinet minister to attend a [[La Francophonie|Francophonie]] summit in 2004, travelling to [[Ouagadougou]] with counterparts from Quebec, [[New Brunswick]] and the federal government. Meilleur also expressed the hope that Ontario would someday become a permanent member of the organization. On November 26, 2016, Ontario was granted observer status by La Francophonie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/la-francophonie-observer-status-1.3869354 La Francophonie grants observer status to Ontario]. [[CBC News]] Toronto, November 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2005, [[Clarence-Rockland]] became the first Ontario city to pass a bylaw requiring all new businesses to post signs in both official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarencerockland.ihostez.com/contentengine/document.asp?ID=2981|title=Clarence Rockland - Document Center|website=clarencerockland.ihostez.com|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarence-Rockland is 60 per cent francophone, and the city council noted that the bylaw was intended to address the existence of both English-only and French-only commercial signage in the municipality.

In 2008, the provincial government officially introduced a French [[licence plate]], with the French slogan "Tant à découvrir" in place of "Yours to Discover", as an optional feature for drivers who wished to use it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2008/05/30/c6469.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html "Ontario Introduces French Licence Plate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918094952/http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2008/05/30/c6469.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html |date=2009-09-18 }}, May 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the government faced controversy during the H1N1 flu pandemic, when it sent out a health information flyer in English only, with no French version published or distributed for the province's francophone residents.&lt;ref name=commissioner&gt;[http://www.thesudburystar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3145691 "New bill to change who French language commissioner reports to"]. ''Sudbury Star'', May 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, MPP [[France Gélinas]] introduced a [[private member's bill]] in May 2011 to have the provincial Commissioner of French Language Services report to the full [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] rather than exclusively to the Minister of Francophone Affairs.&lt;ref name=commissioner /&gt;

In 2018, the provincial government of [[Doug Ford]] announced several government cutbacks that impacted the Franco-Ontarian community, including ending the position of the French Language Services Commissioner and transferring its responsibilities to the office of the [[Ontario Ombudsman]], reducing the status of the [[Ministry of Francophone Affairs]] from a full ministry to a government office, and cancelling funding announced by the prior government of [[Kathleen Wynne]] for the creation of the French-language university.&lt;ref name=backlash&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-doug-ford-backtracks-after-days-of-backlash-over-cuts-to-institutions/ "Doug Ford backtracks after days of backlash over cuts to francophone institutions"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive backlash to the announcement, Ford reversed course, announcing that the commissioner position would be retained and that the office of francophone affairs would be restored to a full government ministry, although he did not restore funding for the university.&lt;ref name=backlash/&gt; The actions led to one franco-Ontarian MPP, [[Amanda Simard]], leaving his caucus to sit as an independent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/amanda-simard-mpp-progressive-conservative-1.4925179 "MPP Amanda Simard leaving PCs, will sit as an independent"]. [[CBC News]] Ottawa, November 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this period, governments in [[Quebec]] began to fly the [[Franco-Ontarian flag]] as a gesture of solidarity. The flag was hoisted at [[Montreal City Hall]] on November 23,&lt;ref&gt;[https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/franco-ontarian-flag-flies-over-montreal-city-hall-as-ford-softens-stance-on-french-services-1.4190313 "Franco-Ontarian flag flies over Montreal city hall as Ford softens stance on French services"]. [[CFCF-DT|CTV Montreal]], November 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] on December 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/franco-ontarian-flag-to-fly-outside-quebec-national-assembly "Franco-Ontarian flag to fly outside Quebec National Assembly"]. ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', November 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5120">'''George Franklin Dales Jr.''' (August 13, 1927 &amp;ndash; April 25, 1992), was an archaeology professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and later the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he chaired the South and Southeast Asian Studies department. He was considered a leading expert on [[Indus valley]] peoples and their languages.

==Early life==
Dales was born in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]. He received his bachelor's degree in classical studies in 1953 from the [[University of Akron]].&lt;ref name=cal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb7c6007sj&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00009&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=|title=George Franklin Dales Jr., South Asian Archaeology: Berkeley|publisher=[[University of California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, he earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]  from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he studied the history, art and archeology of the ancient Middle East and the cuneiform scripts of the Sumerian, Akkadian and Hurrian languages.&lt;ref name=dales&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDB1739F937A15757C0A964958260|title=George F. Dales Jr. Is Dead at 64; Archeologist Studied Indus Ruins|author=Saxon, Wolfgang|date=April 24, 1992|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of his Ph.D. dissertation was ''Mesopotamian and Related Female Figurines: Their Chronology, Diffusion and Cultural Functions.''&lt;ref name="cal"/&gt;

==Career==
Dales served in the Marine Corps in China from 1945-48. He spent 30 seasons of archeological excavations, starting at [[Nippur]] in 1957. Later, he excavated a number of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sites.&lt;ref name="dales"/&gt; In 1959, he conducted an archeological survey in the Bandar Abbas region of southern Iran. In 1960, he made a coastal survey (along with his wife Barabara, T. Cuyler Young, Jr and [[Mohammed Rafique Mughal|M.R. Mughal]]) that showed archeological evidence of trade routes on the Makran coast of Pakistan. In 1964-65, he excavated at [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] for one season. Between 1973 and 1979, Dales excavated at the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] site of Balakot. From 1961-63 he was a special lecturer at the University of Toronto, Canada. He then returned to the University of Pennsylvania as Assistant (1963–66) and then Associate (1966–72) Curator-in-Charge of the South Asia section of The University Museum, with concurrent appointments as Assistant and Associate Professor in the South Asia Regional Studies Department (where he was Co-Chairman in 1970-71).&lt;ref name="cal"/&gt;

===At the University of California, Berkeley===
In 1972, Dales joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley as a member of the Department of Near Eastern Studies. A year later this appointment was adjusted to a half-time appointment in the Department of Near Eastern Studies and a half-time appointment in the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies. This latter arrangement permitted him to offer courses in both ancient Near Eastern and ancient South Asian archaeology and history. From April 1979 through December 1980, he chaired the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies. He was also the Chairman of Berkeley's Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies from 1980-1982.&lt;ref name="dales"/&gt;

===Harappa Archeological Research Project===
In 1986, he became one of the co-directors of the Harappa Archeological Research Project, involving a number of universities and institutions. He died in 1992 at [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]].

==Works==
Dales published more than 80 articles and monographs. His works include ''Excavations at Mohenjo-Daro, Pakistan: The Pottery'' (1986), co-authored with his student, Jonathan Mark Kenoyer.  This work was published by the University of Pennsylvania. The definitive account of his 1960 survey on the Makran coast of Pakistan, written in the form of an illustrated journal was the last manuscript to be completed by him before his death. This latter work was published by the Archaeological Research Facility of the University of California, Berkeley, in 1992, entitled, ''Explorations on the Makran coast, Pakistan: A search for paradise''.&lt;ref name="cal"/&gt;

A '''hermit''' ([[adjectival form]]: '''eremitic''' or '''hermitic''') is a person who lives in [[seclusion]] from society, usually for religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/hermit|title=hermit definition - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hermit|title=hermit Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/hermit|title=hermit - meaning of hermit in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English - LDOCE|website=www.ldoceonline.com|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermits are a part of several sects of Christianity, and the concept is found in other religions as well.

==Description==
In [[Christianity]], the term was originally applied to a Christian who lives the eremitic life out of a religious conviction, namely the [[Catholic spirituality#Desert spirituality|Desert Theology]] of the [[Old Testament]] (i.e., the 40 years wandering in the desert that was meant to bring about a change of heart).{{cn|date=April 2017}}

In the Christian tradition the eremitic life&lt;ref&gt;Marina Miladinov, ''Margins of Solitude: Eremitism in Central Europe between East and West'' (Zaghreb: Leykam International, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; is an early form of [[Monk|monastic living]] that preceded the monastic life in the [[cenobium]]. The [[Rule of St Benedict]] (ch. 1) lists hermits among four kinds of [[monk]]s. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], in addition to hermits who are members of [[religious institute]]s, the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] (canon 603) recognizes also [[Consecrated life#Other forms of consecrated life|diocesan hermits]] under the direction of their [[diocesan bishop|bishop]] as members of the [[Consecrated life#Other forms of consecrated life|consecrated life]]. The same is true in many parts of the [[Anglican Communion]], including the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the US, although in the canon law of the Episcopal Church they are referred to as "solitaries" rather than "hermits".

Often, both in religious and secular literature, the term "hermit" is also used loosely for any Christian living a [[wikt:secluded|secluded]] prayer-focused life, and sometimes interchangeably with [[anchorite|anchorite/anchoress]], [[recluse]] and "solitary". Other religions, for example, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] ([[Sufism]]), and [[Taoism]], also have hermits in the sense of individuals living an ascetic form of life.

In modern colloquial usage, "hermit" denotes anyone living apart from the rest of society, or simply participating in fewer social events, for any reason.

==Etymology==
The word ''hermit'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''ĕrēmīta'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Deremita eremita], Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐρημίτης (''erēmitēs''), "of the desert",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29rhmi%2Fths ἐρημίτης],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn comes from ἔρημος (''erēmos''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29rh%3Dmos ἔρημος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; signifying "desert", "uninhabited", hence "desert-dweller"; adjective: "eremitic".

==History==

===Tradition===
In the common Christian tradition the first known Christian hermit in Egypt was [[Paul of Thebes]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 3rd century), hence also called "St. Paul the first hermit". His disciple [[Antony of Egypt]] (fl. 4th century), often referred to as "Antony the Great", is perhaps the most renowned of all the very early Christian hermits owing to the biography by his friend [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. An antecedent for [[Egypt]]ian eremiticism may have been the [[Syrian]] solitary or "son of the covenant" ([[Aramaic]] ''bar qəyāmā'') who undertook special disciplines as a [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003094121/http://www.monachos.net/monasticism/monastic_beginnings.shtml|title=The Origins and Motivations of Monasticism|date=3 October 2002|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]] some [[Carmelite]] hermits claimed to trace their origin to [[Jewish]] hermits organized by [[Elijah]].

[[Christian]] hermits in the past have often lived in isolated [[Monastic cell|cells]] or [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitages]], whether a natural [[cave]] or a constructed dwelling, situated in the [[desert]] or the [[forest]]. People sometimes sought them out for spiritual advice and counsel. Some eventually acquired so many [[Apprenticeship|disciples]] that they no longer had physical solitude.

The early Christian [[Desert Father]]s wove baskets to exchange for bread. In [[medieval]] times hermits were also found within or near cities where they might earn a living as a gate keeper or ferryman.

From the [[Middle Ages]] and down to modern times eremitical monasticism has also been practiced within the context of religious institutes in the [[Christian]] West. For example, in the [[Catholic Church]] the [[Carthusians]] and [[Camaldolese]] arrange their monasteries as clusters of hermitages where the monks live most of their day and most of their lives in solitary prayer and work, gathering only relatively briefly for communal prayer and only occasionally for community meals and recreation. The [[Cistercian]], [[Trappist]] and [[Carmelite]] orders, which are essentially communal in nature, allow members who feel a [[Vocation|calling]] to the eremitic life, after years living in the [[cenobium]] or community of the monastery, to move to a cell suitable as a hermitage on monastery grounds. This applies to both their [[monk]]s and their [[nun]]s. There have also been many hermits who chose that vocation as an alternative to other forms of monastic life. In the 11th century, the life of the hermit gained recognition as a legitimate independent pathway to salvation. Many hermits in that century and the next came to be regarded as [[saint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Licence, ''Hermits and Recluses in English Society 950–1200'', (Oxford, 2011),p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anchorites===
{{Main article|Anchorite}}
The term "anchorite" (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀναχωρέω}} ''anachōreō'', signifying "to withdraw", "to depart into the country outside the circumvallate city") is often used as a [[synonym]] for hermit, not only in the earliest written sources but throughout the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. "A person who has withdrawn or secluded themself from the world; usually one who has done so for religious reasons, a recluse, a hermit."&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the anchoritic life, while similar to the eremitic life, can also be distinct from it. [[Anchorite]]s lived the religious life in the solitude of an "anchorhold" (or "anchorage"), usually a small hut or "cell", typically built against a church.&lt;ref&gt;McAvoy, LA., ''Anchoritic Traditions of Medieval Europe'', Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd, 2010, p. 2.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ceU1Wa_2VZIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=anchorite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6p6iU5m6CYvX7Aa4lIDIAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&amp;q=cell&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The door of an anchorage tended to be bricked up in a special ceremony conducted by the local [[bishop]] after the anchorite had moved in. Medieval churches survive that have a tiny window ("squint") built into the shared wall near the [[Sanctuary#Altar|sanctuary]] to allow the anchorite to participate in the [[liturgy]] by listening to the service and to receive [[Holy Communion]]. Another window looked out into the street or cemetery, enabling charitable neighbors to deliver food and other necessities. Clients seeking the anchorite's advice might also use this window to consult them.&lt;ref&gt;Dyas, E., Edden, V. and Ellis, R., ''Approaching Medieval English Anchoritic and Mystical Texts'', DS Brewer, 2005, p. 10-12.[https://books.google.com/books?id=aPmVPjBu3nsC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=anchorite&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6p6iU5m6CYvX7Aa4lIDIAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cell&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Christian life==

===Catholic Church===
Catholics who wish to live in eremitic monasticism may live that [[vocation]] as a hermit:
* in an eremitical order (for example [[Carthusian]], [[Camaldolese]]), but in both cases under obedience to their religious superior (see below), or as an [[Oblate]] affiliated with the [[Camaldolese]] or
* as a diocesan hermit under the canonical direction of their [[Diocesan bishop|bishop]] (canon 603, see below).
There are also lay people who informally follow an eremitic lifestyle and live mostly as solitaries.&lt;ref&gt;Dubay, T., ''And You Are Christ's: The Charism of Virginity and the Celibate Life'', Ignatius Press, 1987, Ch. 9.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZC13EV785MsC&amp;pg=PT71&amp;dq=eremitic+catholic+canon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tOCiU4zELa7B7AaI_ID4Aw&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eremitic members of religious institutes====
[[File:Kerkzomerpiep.jpg|thumb|Church of the hermitage "[[Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden]]" in [[Warfhuizen]], [[Netherlands]]]]

In the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]] have their own regulations concerning those of their members who feel called by God to move from the [[Cenobium|life in community]] to the eremitic life, and have the permission of their religious superior to do so. The [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law (1983)]] contains no special provisions for them. They technically remain a member of their [[institute of consecrated life]] and thus under obedience to their religious superior.

The [[Carthusian]] and [[Camaldolese]] orders of monks and nuns preserve their original way of life as essentially eremitical within a cenobitical context, that is, the monasteries of these orders are in fact clusters of individual hermitages where monks and nuns spend their days alone with relatively short periods of prayer in common.

Other orders that are essentially cenobitical, notably the [[Trappists]], maintain a tradition under which individual monks or nuns who have reached a certain level of maturity within the community may pursue a hermit lifestyle on monastery grounds under the supervision of the abbot or abbess. [[Thomas Merton]] was among the Trappists who undertook this way of life.

====Diocesan hermits (canon 603)====
The earliest form of Christian eremitic or anchoritic living preceded that as a member of a religious institute, since [[cenobium|monastic communities]] and religious institutes are later developments of the [[Monk|monastic life]]. Today an increasing number of Christian faithful feel again a [[vocation]] to live the eremitic life, whether in the remote countryside or in a city in stricter separation from the world, without having passed through [[cenobium|life in a monastic community]] first. Bearing in mind that the meaning of the eremitic vocation is the [[Catholic spirituality#Desert spirituality|Desert Theology]] of the [[Old Testament]] (i.e., the 40 years wandering in the [[Zin Desert|desert]] that was meant to bring about a change of heart), it may be said that the desert of the [[Urban area|urban]] hermit is that of their heart, purged through [[kenosis]] to be the dwelling place of God alone.

So as to provide for men and women who feel a [[vocation|calling]] to the eremitic or anchoritic life without being or becoming a member of an [[Institute of Consecrated Life|institute of consecrated life]], but desire its recognition by the Roman Catholic Church as a form of [[Consecrated life#Other forms of consecrated life|consecrated life]] nonetheless, the [[Code of Canon Law]] '''1983''' legislates in the Section on Consecrated Life (canon 603) as follows:

{{quote|§1 Besides [[Institute of Consecrated Life|institutes of consecrated life]] the church recognizes the eremitic or anchoritic life by which the Christian faithful devote their life to the praise of God and salvation of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of solitude and assiduous prayer and penance.

§2 A hermit is recognized by law as one dedicated to God in consecrated life if he or she publicly professes in the hands of the diocesan bishop the three evangelical counsels, confirmed by vow or other sacred bond, and observes a proper program of living under his direction.}}

Canon 603 §2 therefore lays down certain requirements for those who feel a [[vocation]] to the kind of eremitic life that is recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as one of the "other forms of consecrated life". They usually are referred to as "diocesan hermits".

The norms of canon 603 do not apply to the many other Catholic faithful who live alone and devote themselves to fervent prayer for the love of God without however feeling [[vocation|called by God]] to seek recognition of their prayerful solitary life from the Roman Catholic Church by entering the [[consecrated life]].

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] of 11 October '''1992''' (§§918–921) comments on the eremitic life as follows:

{{quote|From the very beginning of the Church there were men and women who set out to follow Christ with greater liberty, and to imitate him more closely, by practicing the [[evangelical counsels]]. They led lives dedicated to God, each in his own way. Many of them, under the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit]], became hermits or founded religious families. These the Church, by virtue of her authority, gladly accepted and approved.

Bishops will always strive to discern new gifts of consecrated life granted to the Church by the Holy Spirit; the approval of new forms of consecrated life is reserved to the [[Apostolic See]]. (Footnote: Cf. CIC, can. 605).
...
Without always professing the three evangelical counsels publicly, hermits "devote their life to the praise of God and salvation of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of solitude and assiduous prayer and penance". (Footnote: CIC, can. 603 §1)

They manifest to everyone the interior aspect of the mystery of the Church, that is, personal intimacy with Christ. Hidden from the eyes of men, the life of the hermit is a silent preaching of the Lord, to whom he has surrendered his life simply because he is everything to him. Here is a particular call to find in the desert, in the thick of spiritual battle, the glory of the Crucified One.}}

[[Catholic Church]] norms for the consecrated eremitic and [[Anchorite|anchoritic]] life (cf. canon 603) do not include [[Charity (virtue)|corporal works of mercy]]. Nevertheless, every hermit, like every Christian, is bound by the law of charity and therefore ought to respond generously, as his or her own circumstances permit, when faced with a specific need for [[Charity (virtue)|corporal works of mercy]]. Hermits, like every Christian, are also bound by the law of work. If they are not financially independent, they may engage in cottage industries or be employed part-time in jobs that respect the call for them to live in solitude and silence with extremely limited or no contact with other persons. Such outside jobs may not keep them from observing their obligations of the eremitic vocation of stricter separation from the world and the silence of solitude in accordance with canon 603, under which they have made their [[Religious vows|vow]].

Although canon 603 makes no provision for associations of hermits, these do exist (for example the "Hermits of Bethlehem" in Chester NJ and the "Hermits of Saint Bruno" in the US; see also [[lavra]], [[skete]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Bamberg Anne, ''Ermite reconnu par l’Église. Le c. 603 du code de droit canonique et la haute responsabilité de l’évêque diocésain'', in ''Vie consacrée'', 74, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;104–118 and ''Entre théologie et droit canonique : l’ermite catholique face à l’obéissance'', in ''Nouvelle revue théologique'', 125, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;429–439 or ''Eremiten und geweihtes Leben. Zur kanonischen Typologie'', in ''Geist und Leben'', 78, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;313–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Poustiniks ====
Not all the Catholic lay members that feel that it is their [[vocation]] to dedicate themselves to God in a prayerful solitary life perceive it as a vocation to some form of consecrated life. An example of this is life as a [[Poustinia#Poustinik|Poustinik]], an Eastern Catholic expression of eremitic living that is finding adherents also in the West.

===Anglican Communion===
Many of the recognised religious communities and orders in the [[Anglican Communion]] make provision for certain members to live as hermits, more commonly referred to as solitaries. One [[Church of England]] community, the [[Society of St. John the Evangelist]], now has only solitaries in its British congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fsje.org.uk/fsj.html |title=Society of St John the Evangelist |publisher= Fellowship of St John Trust Association |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglicanism also makes provision for men and women who seek to live a single consecrated life, after taking vows before their local bishop; many who do so live as solitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.singleconsecratedlife-anglican.org.uk/solitaries.php |title = Solitaries who are not members of a Religious community |last= |first= |author= |publisher = Single Consecrated Life |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 1 August 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Handbook of Religious Life, published by the Advisory Council of Relations between Bishops and Religious Communities (ACRBRC), contains an appendix governing the selection, consecration, and management of solitaries living outside recognised religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Religious Life |first= |last= Advisory Council of Relations between Bishops and Religious Communities|edition= Fifth (revised) |chapter=  |volume= |location= London|publisher= Canterbury Press|publication-date= 2012|page= 194|isbn= 9781853116186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Canon Law of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], those who make application to their diocesan bishop and who persevere in whatever preparatory program the bishop requires, take vows that include lifelong celibacy. They are referred to as solitaries rather than hermits. Each selects a bishop other than their diocesan as an additional spiritual resource and, if necessary, an intermediary.

At the start of the twenty-first century the Church of England reported a notable increase in the number of applications from people seeking to live the single consecrated life as Anglican hermits or solitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/08/religion.world |title = Britain's growing band of religious hermits |last= |first= |author= |publisher = The Guardian |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 1 August 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Serafim and a bear.jpg|thumb|St. [[Seraphim of Sarov]] sharing his meal with a bear]]

===Eastern Christianity===
In the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Rite Catholic Church]]es, hermits live a life not only of prayer but also of service to their community in the traditional [[Eastern Christian]] manner of the [[poustinia|poustinik]]. The poustinik is a hermit available to all in need and at all times.

In the Eastern Christian churches one traditional variation of the Christian eremitic life is the semi-eremitic life in a [[lavra]] or [[skete]], exemplified historically in [[Scetes]], a place in the Egyptian desert, and continued in various sketes today including several regions on [[Mount Athos]].

==Other religions==

[[File:Sadu Kathmandu Pashupatinath 2006 Luca Galuzzi.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Sadhu]]s, Hindu hermits]]

From a [[religion|religious]] point of view, the solitary life is a form of [[asceticism]], wherein the hermit renounces worldly concerns and pleasures. This can be done for many reasons, including: to come closer to the [[deity|deity or deities]] they worship or revere, to devote one's energies to self-liberation from [[saṃsāra]], etc. This practice appears also in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sufism]]. [[Taoism]] also has a long history of ascetic and eremitical figures. In the ascetic eremitic life, the hermit seeks solitude for [[meditation]], [[contemplation]], [[prayer]], self-awareness and personal development on physical and mental levels; without the distractions of contact with human society, [[sex]], or the need to maintain socially acceptable standards of [[cleanliness]], [[clothing|dress]] or communication. The ascetic [[discipline]] can also include a simplified [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and/or [[manual labour|manual labor]] as a means of support.{{clear left}}

[[File:Orlando Furioso 3 crop.jpg|thumb|In ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', Angelica meets a hermit]]

* In medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], the [[knight-errant]] frequently encounters hermits on his [[quest]]. Such a figure, generally a [[wise old man]], would advise him. Knights searching for the [[Holy Grail]], in particular, learn from a hermit the errors they must repent for, and the significance of their encounters, dreams, and visions.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', pp. 179–81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evil [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] would sometimes pose as hermits, to explain their presence in the wilds, and to lure heroes into a false sense of security. In [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', both occurred: the knight on a quest met a good hermit, and the sorcerer [[Archimago]] took on such a pose.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis|Lewis, C. S.]], ''Spenser's Images of Life'', p. 87, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; These hermits are sometimes also vegetarians for ascetic reasons, as suggested in a passage from [[Sir Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte D'Arthur|Le Morte d'Arthur]]'': "Then departed Gawain and Ector as heavy (sad) as they might for their misadventure (mishap), and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. And when they were (had) come up, they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a little courtelage (courtyard), where Nacien the hermit gathered worts (vegetables), as he had tasted none other meat (food) of a great while."&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Malory, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' 16.3&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of vegetarianism may have also existed amongst actual medieval hermits outside of literature.
* Hermits can appear in [[fairy tale]]s in the character of the [[donor (fairy tale)|donor]], as in ''[[Făt-Frumos with the Golden Hair]]''.
* Hermits appear in a few of the stories of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''. One of the most famous stories, the tenth story of the third day, involves the seduction of a young girl by a hermit in the desert near [[Gafsa]]; it was judged to be so obscene that it was not translated into English until the 20th century.
* The main character of [[Tolstoy]]'s short story "[[Father Sergius]]" is a Russian nobleman who turns to a solitary religious life and becomes a hermit after he learns that his fiancee was a discarded mistress of the [[czar]].
* English musician [[John Renbourn]] released an album and song titled ''The Hermit''. The album cover shows a man similar to the images printed on [[Tarot]] decks.
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in his influential work ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', created the character of the hermit Zarathustra (named after the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[prophet]] [[Zoroaster|Zarathushtra]]), who emerges from seclusion to extol his philosophy to the rest of humanity.
* In the late 18th century, some English noblemen would have "[[ornamental hermit]]s" living on their land, for instance in a [[folly]]. The hermit would be paid, provided with food and water, and given a skull, a book and an hourglass.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, G., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aV1x0rMca4QC&amp;dq=ornamental+hermits&amp;q=%22skull%2C+the+emblem%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22skull%2C%20the%20emblem%22&amp;f=false ''The Hermit in the Garden: From Imperial Rome to Ornamental Gnome''], Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these ornamental hermits did not talk to the servants, but simply repeated a phrase in Latin. Most grew beards and did not cut their nails. Notable places with ornamental hermits included [[Painshill]] and [[Hawkstone Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringing Church Bells to ward off Thunderstorms, 2009. 978-0956204608&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]] is first introduced to the audience as an old hermit, seen by most of the characters as a very dangerous, wizard. Later, the story reveals that his first name is Obi-Wan, and that he  went into exile for political reasons, though it also provided spiritual training, since he was a warrior monk in his youth. The story also portrays [[Yoda]], another [[Jedi]], as a wizard or hermit. The seventh installment of the series, ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', reveals that [[Luke Skywalker]] also went into exile to live as a hermit.
* In the ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' series, the character [[Jason Voorhees]] was believed to have died after he drowned as a child. However, this later changed when it turned out that he survived and lived life as a hermit—only to enter a murderous rage when he witnesses the death of his mother seemingly years later (which was during the events of the original film).
* In the [[anime]] ''[[Dragon Ball (franchise)|Dragon Ball]]'', a martial-arts master named [[Muten Roshi]] is often referred to as a Turtle Hermit, despite the fact that over the course of the series characters are often visiting or even living in his island home.
* [[Monty Python]] performed a sketch about two hermits, who agree at the beginning, "There's no point frigging your life in idleness and trivial chit-chats," but the conversation quickly degenerate into gossip about their hermit neighbors and their caves, as if it were ordinary suburban gossip. It ends with one character saying, "It's still better being a hermit, at least you meet people," and the other responding, "Oh yes, I wouldn't go back to public relations."
* The primary antagonist of ''[[Yogi's First Christmas]]'' is a character by the name of Herman the Hermit. He is a solitary, misanthropic individual who hates Christmas, and who "only wants to be left alone."
* Along the southern rim of the [[Grand Canyon]] there is a popular location known as [[Hermit's Rest]], at the end of [[Hermit Road (Arizona)|Hermit Road]]. The location was named for [[Louis Boucher]]. Around 1891, Boucher, a Canadian-born prospector, staked claims below present-day Hermit's Rest. With help, Boucher carved a trail into the canyon and for years lived alone at nearby [[Dripping Springs, Grand Canyon|Dripping Springs]]. He has been described as a kind, gentle soul. Though not a true hermit, Boucher is the "hermit" for whom local features around the southern rim are named.
* In the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', John Black's long lost father, Yo Ling, lives in seclusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3085">'''Hossam El-Gheriany''' (born 1941) is an [[Egypt]]ian judge. Winning recognition as a champion of [[judicial independence]] in the regime of [[President Mubarak]], he became head of the Supreme Judicial Council and the Court of Cassation. Today he also heads the [[Constituent Assembly of Egypt]] and is president of the [[National Council for Human Rights]].

==Life==
Born in [[Sharqiya Governorate]] in the [[Nile Delta]], Hossam El-Gheriany gained a BA in law from the [[University of Alexandria]] in 1962. He  worked for the public prosecutor's office for twelve years, witnessing [[Nasser]]'s 1969 attack on the judiciary. He became a judge in 1974. Gaining varied experience as a judge - including two years in [[Libya]] and some time in the [[United Arab Emirates]] - he became a chancellor in Egypt's [[Court of Cassation (Egypt)|Court of Cassation]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=Osman&gt;Ahmed Zaki Osman, [http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egypt%E2%80%99s-troubled-judiciary-gheriany-stands-savior In Egypt’s troubled judiciary, Gheriany stands as a savior], ''[[Egypt Independent]]'', 24 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Hossam El-Gheriany, [[Yahya al-Refai]] and [[Ahmed Mekki (political)|Ahmed Mekky]] organized a conference, attended by [[President Mubarak]], calling for the [[independence of the judiciary]]. In 2005 he wrote a report criticizing illegal interventions by the government in amending the way the president is elected. He criticized Mubarak for rigging the referendum over [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|the multi-candidate presidential election of 2005]], as well as [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2005|the subsequent parliamentary election]]. After Mubarak's regime referred two judges to a disciplinary board for their "outspoken criticism", Gheriani mobilized judges in their support.&lt;ref name=Osman/&gt;

Elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of Egypt]], Gheriany was nominated president of the assembly at its first meeting on 18 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Masry Al-Youm, [http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/gheriany-heads-constituent-assembly Gheriany heads Constituent Assembly], 18 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later he threatened resignation, holding and winning a vote of confidence on his Constituent Assembly presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Masry Al-Youm, [http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/constituent-assembly-head-threatens-resignation Constituent Assembly head threatens resignation], ''[[Egypt Independent]]'', 26 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012 the [[Shura Council]] appointed Gheriany President of the [[National Council for Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/51982/Egypt/Politics-/Whos-who-in-Egypts-reshuffled-Human-Rights-Council.aspx Who's who in Egypt's reshuffled Human Rights Council], ''[[Ahram Online]]'', 4 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, he was invited to join the [[Prospect Theatre Company]] to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', and he firmly established himself as one of the country's foremost classical actors. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and the [[National Theatre of Great Britain]]. He achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the [[Richard III of England|titular King]] in ''[[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]]'' (1995), [[James Whale]] in ''[[Gods and Monsters (film)|Gods and Monsters]]'' (1998), [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]], and [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' trilogies.

==Early life==
McKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in [[Burnley]], Lancashire,{{sfn|Barratt|2006|p=1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckellen.com/life/per.htm|title=Sir Ian McKellen Personal Bio - Prior to launch of his website|first=Keith|last=Stern/CompuWeb|website=www.mckellen.com|accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen, a civil engineer. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.&lt;ref name="from-the-beginning" /&gt; Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to [[Wigan]]. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to [[Bolton]] in 1951, after his father had been promoted.&lt;ref name="from-the-beginning" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pierless&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pierless Youth|url=http://www.mckellen.com/writings/pierless.htm|accessdate=5 January 2014|magazine=The Sunday Times Magazine|date=2 January 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that "only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal."&lt;ref name=pierless /&gt; When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of [[11 September attacks]], McKellen said: "Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/14/entertainment/et-ian-mckellen14 | title=Full Interview with McKellen | accessdate=8 January 2014 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Matea | last=Gold | date=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his [[coming out]] as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a member of the [[Quakers|Religious Society of Friends]], he said, "Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6694627/Sir-Ian-McKellen-Not-telling-parents-I-was-gay-remains-my-greatest-regret.html | title=McKellen about his stepmother | accessdate=8 January 2014 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Stephen | last=Adams | date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great-great-grandfather Robert J.

W. Braun, ''The Lord of the Films'' (ECW Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], where he read English literature.&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]''.

===Theatre===

McKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the [[Belgrade Theatre]], as Roper in ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'', although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's ''Cymbeline'' had gone on commercial sale as part of the [[Argo Records (UK)|Argo]] Shakespeare series.&lt;ref name="trowbridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Drabble"/&gt;

After four years in regional [[repertory|repertory theatres]] he made his first [[West End theatre|West End]] appearance, in ''A Scent of Flowers'', regarded as a "notable success".&lt;ref name="trowbridge" /&gt; In 1965 he was a member of [[Laurence Olivier]]'s National Theatre Company at the [[Old Vic]], which led to roles at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre|Chichester Festival]]. With the [[Prospect Theatre Company]], McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Richard II (directed by [[Richard Cottrell]]) and Marlowe's Edward II (directed by [[Toby Robertson]]) at the Edinburgh festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-toby-robertson-obe-theatre-director-1-2400165| publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' | accessdate=16 September 2013 | date=6 September 2012 | title= Obituary: Toby Robertson, OBE, theatre director | first=Alasdair | last= Steven | work=The Scotsman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and the [[Royal National Theatre]], where he played several leading Shakespearean roles, including the title role in ''[[Macbeth]]'' (which he had first played for [[Trevor Nunn]] in a "gripping...out of the ordinary" production, with [[Judi Dench]], at Stratford in 1976), and [[Iago]] in ''[[Othello]]'', in award-winning productions directed by Nunn.&lt;ref name="trowbridge"/&gt; Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn.

In 2007 he returned to the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], in productions of ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[The Seagull]]'', both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he appeared in a very popular revival of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' at London's [[Haymarket Theatre]], directed by [[Sean Mathias]], and playing opposite [[Patrick Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821225446926|title=McKellen &amp; Stewart Wait in Haymarket Godot|last=Paddock|first=Terri|date=31 October 2008|publisher=Whatsonstage.com|accessdate=8 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616065547/http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821225446926|archivedate=16 June 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/arts/08iht-LON8.html|title=McKellen and Stewart Deliver a 'Godot' With a Difference|last=Wolf|first=Matt|date=7 May 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate =8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is Patron of [[English Touring Theatre]] and also President and Patron of the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]], an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littletheatreguild.org/our-patron-sir-ian-mckellen-ch/|title=The Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain|publisher=Littletheatreguild.org|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August 2012, he took part in the [[2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics|London Paralympics]], portraying [[Prospero]] from ''[[The Tempest]]''.&lt;ref name=paralympics-opening&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19411225|title=BBC News – Paralympics: Games opening promises 'journey of discovery'|work=BBC News | date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 17 May 2006 interview on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' with the ''Da Vinci Code'' cast and director, [[Matt Lauer]] posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.&lt;ref name="suspend"/&gt; McKellen responded, "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie&amp;nbsp;– not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." He continued, "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it".&lt;ref name="suspend"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/blog/2006/05/17/ian-mckellen-unable-to-suspend-disbelief-while-reading-the-bible/ |title="Ian McKellen Unable to Suspend Disbelief While Reading the Bible." |accessdate=20 May 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614150617/http://www.usmagazine.com/blog/2006/05/17/ian-mckellen-unable-to-suspend-disbelief-while-reading-the-bible/ |archivedate=14 June 2006  }} ''Us Weekly''. 17 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of [[Ricky Gervais]]' comedy series ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', where he played himself directing Gervais' character [[Andy Millman]] in a play about gay lovers.

==Personal life==
McKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from [[Bolton]], began their relationship in 1964.&lt;ref name="tiscali-biog"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/ian_mckellen_biog.html |title=Ian McKellen profile at Tiscali |work=Tiscali Film and TV |accessdate=11 April 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217093636/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/ian_mckellen_biog.html |archivedate=17 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972.

This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. Mathias later directed McKellen in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with [[Evgeny Lebedev]], purchasing the lease of [[The Grapes, Limehouse|The Grapes]] public house in Narrow Street.&lt;ref name=thegrapes&gt;"[http://thegrapes.co.uk/history.php The Grapes History]", thegrapes.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT activism==

===LGBT rights campaigning===
[[File:McKellen 2010.jpg|thumb|McKellen at [[Manchester Pride]] 2010]]

While McKellen had made his [[sexual orientation]] known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he [[coming out|came out]] to the general public, in a programme on [[BBC Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;An archived recording of the programme is online: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12012.shtml "''Third Ear'': Section 28"], BBC Radio 3, 27 January 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The context that prompted McKellen's decision&amp;nbsp;– overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career&amp;nbsp;– was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as [[Section 28]], was then under consideration in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]].&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality "... as a kind of pretended family relationship".&lt;ref name="4letter"&gt;{{cite news|date=20 January 2000|publisher=BBC|title=When gay became a four-letter word|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/611704.stm|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a [[BBC Radio 3]] programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist [[Peregrine Worsthorne]], declared himself gay.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/gay_rights/12012.shtml "''Third Ear'': Section 28"], BBC Radio 3, 27 January 1988&lt;/ref&gt; McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author [[Armistead Maupin]].&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the [[Stonewall riots]], McKellen commented, &lt;blockquote&gt;I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelsohn, Scott, [http://bombsite.com/issues/65/articles/2189 "Ian McKellen"], ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Fall 1998. Retrieved on [18 July 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He has said of this period: &lt;blockquote&gt;My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.&lt;ref name="advocate-2001" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.

In 2003, during an appearance on ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'', McKellen claimed when he visited [[Michael Howard]], then [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Environment Secretary]] (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, "Fuck off, I'm gay."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3266571.stm 10 things we didn't know this time last week]. BBC News. 14 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives [[David Wilshire]] and Dame [[Jill Knight, Baroness Knight of Collingtree|Jill Knight]], who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckellen.com/writings/activism/8807section28.htm|title='Section 28'|publisher=Ian McKellen Official Website|date=1 July 1988|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ian McKellen at Europride 2003 Parade.jpg|thumb|McKellen at [[Europride]] 2003 in [[Manchester]]]]

McKellen has continued to be very active in [[LGBT rights]] efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented that:
{{quote|I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about – [[nuclear weapon]]s (against), religion ([[atheist]]), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckellen.com/activism/index.htm|title=Activism|publisher=Ian McKellen Official Website|accessdate=13 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McKellen is a co-founder of [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]], an LGBT rights [[Lobbying|lobby]] group in the United Kingdom, named after the [[Stonewall riots]].&lt;ref name="albert" /&gt; McKellen is also patron of [[LGBT History Month]],&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; [[Pride London]], Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, [[The Lesbian &amp; Gay Foundation]],&lt;ref name="high"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgf.org.uk/sir-ian-mckellen|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719022428/http://www.lgf.org.uk/sir-ian-mckellen|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 July 2011|title=Aim High|publisher=the Lesbian &amp; Gay Foundation|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FFLAG]] where he appears in their video "Parents Talking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fflag.org.uk|title=Home|author=Toby|work=fflag.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, at the closing ceremony of the [[Gay Games]], he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, "I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena": This nickname, given to him by [[Stephen Fry]], had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.&lt;ref name="advocate-2001"/&gt; In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckellen.com/events/sfpride.htm|title=SF Pride 2002 {{!}} San Francisco {{!}} Ian McKellen|date=n.d.|website=www.mckellen.com|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, [[Sue Sanders]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbthistorymonth.org.uk/prelaunch.htm|title=LGBT History Month 2007 PreLaunch|publisher=LGBT History Month|date=20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he became a patron of [[The Albert Kennedy Trust]], an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.&lt;ref name="albert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akt.org.uk/latest-news.htm|title=Ian McKellen becomes the Albert Kennedy Trust's new patron|publisher=The Albert Kennedy Trust|date=5 January 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211033940/http://www.akt.org.uk/latest-news.htm|archivedate=11 February 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/oxfordshire/4754409.stm |title=Sir Ian becomes gay pride patron |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a [[gay bar]]; the programme immediately ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hudson|first1=Chrys|title=Ian McKellen's gay comment causes a stir on Singaporean TV|url=http://www.gmax.co.za/feel07/10/22-ianmc.html|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=GMax.co.za|date=22 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523050230/http://www.gmax.co.za/feel07/10/22-ianmc.html|archivedate=23 May 2012|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, he was named in ''[[Out (magazine)|Out'']]{{'s}} annual Out 100 list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://out.com/out100/nominees_8.asp "Ian McKellen."] ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]''. December 2008. Retrieved 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, McKellen extended his support for [[Liverpool]]'s [[Homotopia Liverpool (festival)|Homotopia festival]] in which a group of gay and lesbian [[Merseyside]] teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/03/10/ian-mckellen-backs-liverpool-anti-homophobia-effort|title=Ian McKellen backs Liverpool anti-homophobia effort|publisher=Pink News|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, he called [[Sergey Sobyanin]], Moscow's mayor, a "coward" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Advocate.com Editors |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/05/26/McKellan_Calls_Moscow_Mayor_a_Coward |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528124620/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/05/26/McKellan_Calls_Moscow_Mayor_a_Coward/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 May 2011 |title=McKellen Calls Moscow Mayor a Coward &amp;#124; News |publisher=The Advocate |accessdate=18 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity work===
In April 2010, along with actors [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] and [[Eleanor Bron]], McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support [[Age UK]], the charity recently formed from the merger of [[Age Concern]] and [[Help the Aged]]. All three actors gave their time free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/19/age-uk|title=Hollywood actors star in Age UK ad|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=19 April 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|February 2011 Christchurch earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10710623 |title=Cricket: 'Fill the Basin' teams named |publisher=The New Zealand Herald |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cricket-basin&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood vs Wellywood fills The Basin|url=http://www.newzealand.com/travel/media/press-releases/2011/march-2011/tourism-news_hollywood-vs-wellywood-fills-basin_press-release.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203115058/http://www.newzealand.com/travel/media/press-releases/2011/march-2011/tourism-news_hollywood-vs-wellywood-fills-basin_press-release.cfm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 February 2014|work=New Zealand.com|publisher=Tourism New Zealand|accessdate=22 January 2014|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McKellen is an honorary board member for the New York and Washington, DC based organization Only Make Believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Panoptic Artifex – Christopher Baima &amp; Greg Sweet |url=http://www.onlymakebelieve.org/who/honorary-board/ |title=Honorary Board |publisher=Only Make Believe |date=15 September 2013 |accessdate=5 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231035245/http://onlymakebelieve.org/who/honorary-board/ |archive-date=31 December 2013 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20643724,00.html |title=Ian McKellen Makes Magic...

McKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour "Shakespeare, Tolkien, and You!", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RadioLIVE|url=http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Sir-Ian-McKellen-on-fundraising-for-the-Isaac-Theatre-Royal/tabid/506/articleID/27273/Default.aspx|title=Sir Ian McKellen on fundraising for the Isaac Theatre Royal|publisher=MediaWorks|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at [[Park Theatre (London)]], donating the proceeds to the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0307-1235| last = Cavendish| first = Dominic| title = Ian McKellen at Park Theatre review: the secret of his success is not lofty knightliness but spry mateyness| work = The Telegraph| accessdate = 24 July 2017| date = 3 July 2017| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/ian-mckellen-park-theatre-review-secret-success-not-lofty-knightliness/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islam Yahyayevich Timurziev''' ({{lang-ru|Ислам Яхьяевич Тимурзиев}}; 9 January 1983 – 31 August 2015) was an [[Ingush people|Ingush]]  amateur boxer from Russia best known for winning the European superheavyweight title in 2006.

==Career==
Born in [[Nazran]], [[Ingushetia]], Timurziev started boxing in 1996. He is a skilled offensive fighter with impressive power in both hands but has defensive weaknesses. He won the U-17 European Championship in 1999, and the Junior European Championships in 2001.

He added the military world title in 2003, and won the 2004 Russian national title, but only after he helped his national team winning the [[Boxing World Cup|Nations World Cup]] by beating Cuban [[Odlanier Solis]] (Olympic Champion at 201&amp;nbsp;lbs) on points. Later that year he was out with cancer, his compatriot [[Roman Romanchuk (boxer)|Roman Romanchuk]] participated in the world championships.

In 2006, Timurziev made a comeback claiming the [[2006 European Amateur Boxing Championships|European title]] with wins over [[Roberto Cammarelle]], [[Kubrat Pulev]] and [[Robert Helenius]].
At the [[Boxing World Cup|World Cup]] in Baku, Timurziev was pulled out by his corner in a rematch by his nemesis Odlanier Solis. This also granted Cuba a 6-5 win of the cup.

Timurziev was in bad form early on in 2007, losing in the Russian championships against the unsung [[Denis Sergeev]] (19:22).

But at the [[2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] in Chicago he reached the semi-finals among others with several first round wins and a points victory over American [[Michael Hunter (American boxer)|Michael Hunter]]. He was unable to advance further, suffering from acute appendicitis, thus granting [[Roberto Cammarelle]] a win on walkover, and earning the bronze medal.

Timurziev was regarded as the favorite at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in his weightclass as the Cubans were lacking a star in this class after Solis had defected. He was defeated though by Great Britain's [[David Price (boxer)|David Price]] through a knockout in the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/13/olympicsboxing.olympics2008|title=Olympics: David Price knocks out European champion Islam Timurziev|last=Mitchell|first=Kevin|date=13 August 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in hospital of [[sepsis]] on 31 August 2015, following a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.segodnya.ua/boxing/byvshiy-bokser-olimpiyskoy-sbornoy-rossii-skonchalsya-v-vozraste-32-let-645450.html Бывший боксер олимпийской сборной России скончался в возрасте 32 лет]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J. R. Kealoha''' (died March 5, 1877) was an American [[Union Army]] soldier of [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] descent. Considered one of the "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War", he was among a group of more than one hundred documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaiʻi-born combatants who fought in the [[American Civil War]] while the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]] was still an independent nation.

Kealoha enlisted in the [[41st United States Colored Infantry]], a [[United States Colored Troops|USC regiment]] formed in [[Pennsylvania]]. Participating in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], he and another Hawaiian soldier met the Hawaiʻi-born Colonel [[Samuel C. Armstrong|Samuel Chapman Armstrong]], who recorded their encounter in a letter home. With the 41st USCT, Kealoha was present at the surrender of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865. After the war, Kealoha returned to Hawaiʻi. He died on March 5, 1877, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Honolulu's [[Oahu Cemetery|Oʻahu Cemetery]].{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=138–141}}&lt;ref name="Cole2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy and contributions of Kealoha and other Hawaiian participants in the American Civil War were largely forgotten except in the private circles of descendants and historians, but in later years there was a revival of interest in the Hawaiian community. In 2010, these "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War" were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] in Honolulu.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015c|pages=161–163}} In 2014, through another local effort, a grave marker was dedicated over J. R. Kealoha's burial site, which had remained unmarked for 137 years.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=138–141}}&lt;ref name="Cole2014" /&gt;

==Life==
After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]] under King [[Kamehameha IV]] declared its neutrality on August 26, 1861.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015a|pages=132–135}}{{sfn|Kuykendall|1953|pages=57–66}} Many [[Native Hawaiian]]s and Hawaiʻi-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. Native Hawaiians participating in the American wars during its period of independence was not unheard of. Individual Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the [[War of 1812]], and even more served during the American Civil War.{{sfn|Schmitt|1998|pages=171–172}} Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaiʻi's ties to [[New England]] through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].{{sfn|Manning|Vance|2014|pages=145–170}}{{sfn|Okihiro|2015|pages=88–89}}&lt;ref name="Vance&amp;Manning" /&gt;

Nothing is known about the life of J. R. Kealoha before the war. He enlisted in 1864 as a [[Private (rank)|private]] and was assigned to the [[41st United States Colored Troops|41st Regiment United States Colored Troops]] (USCT), a colored regiment formed in [[Camp William Penn]], [[Pennsylvania]], between September 30 and December 7, 1864, under the command of Colonel [[Llewellyn F. Haskell]].{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=138–141}}{{sfn|Cox|2013|pages=489–490}}{{sfn|Bates|1871|pages=1066–1080}} Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to the [[United States Colored Troops|colored regiments]] because of their dark skin color and the segregationist policy in the military at the time.&lt;ref name="Vance&amp;Manning" /&gt;{{sfn|Raphael-Hernandez|Steen|2006|page=321}} Kealoha is one of the few Hawaiian soldiers of the Civil War whose real name is known;&lt;ref name="Davis2014" /&gt; many combatants served under anglicized pseudonyms because they were easier for English-speaking Americans to pronounce than [[Hawaiian language]] names. They were often registered as ''[[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|kanakas]]'', the 19th-century term for Hawaiians and [[Pacific Islander]]s, with the "[[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]]" (Hawaiʻi) noted as their place of origin.&lt;ref name="Vance&amp;Manning"&gt;{{harvnb|Vance|Manning|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samuel C. Armstrong on horseback (PP-67-5-036).jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Samuel C. Armstrong|Samuel Chapman Armstrong]] was one of the highest-ranking Hawaiian combatants in the Civil War and was in command of the 9th USCT and 8th USCT.]]

From October 1864 to April 1865, Kealoha fought in the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign, better known as the [[Siege of Petersburg]].{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=138–141}}&lt;ref name="Cole2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HPU" /&gt; During the campaign, Kealoha and another Hawaiian named Kaiwi, of the [[28th Regiment United States Colored Troops]], came across [[Samuel C. Armstrong|Samuel Chapman Armstrong]], a son of an [[Richard Armstrong (Hawaii)|American missionary]] and a native of [[Maui]].&lt;ref name="Vance&amp;Manning" /&gt;{{sfn|Raphael-Hernandez|Steen|2006|page=321}}&lt;ref name="Maui"&gt;{{harvnb|Von Buol|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong wrote of the encounter in a letter home that was later published in the Hawaiian missionary newspaper ''The Friend'' in 1865:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yesterday, as my orderly was holding my horse, I asked him where he was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He proved to be a full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.&lt;ref name="Armstrong1865"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kealoha survived months of [[trench warfare]] during the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign and fought with the 41st USCT at the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]]; he was present at the surrender of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] and the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.&lt;ref name="Cole2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HPU"&gt;{{harvnb|Hawai’i Pacific University|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 41st USCT regiment was mustered out of service on November 10, 1865, at [[Brownsville, Texas]], and was discharged December 14, 1865, at Philadelphia.{{sfn|Cox|2013|pages=489–490}}{{sfn|Bates|1871|pages=1066–1080}} Kealoha's enlistment of service is not present in any existing records or history from the 41st USCT regiment. Historians Justin Vance and Anita Manning speculate that "it is possible that his service is noted under a different name" or his name was never recorded because only the muster-out rolls from the regiment were returned to the Adjutant General's office after the unit disbanded.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=138–141}}{{sfn|Bates|1871|pages=1066–1080}}

After the war, Kealoha returned to Hawaiʻi. He died on March 5, 1877, and was buried with eighteen other Native Hawaiians in an unmarked grave in Section 1, Lot 56 of the [[Oahu Cemetery|Oʻahu Cemetery]], [[Honolulu]].{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=138–141}}&lt;ref name="Drewes2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Drewes|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Territory of Hawaii|Hawaii Territorial period]], Kealoha's Civil War service was recorded by the United Veterans Service Council (UVSC), a precursor of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA), which included his name in their records as a "Deceased Veteran" and listed the location of his burial.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015b|pages=138–141}}&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{harvnb|Kozlovich|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
[[File:Grave marker of J. R. Kealoha (d. 1877).jpg|thumbnail|right|Grave marker of J. R. Kealoha. Adorned with sacred [[Alyxia oliviformis|maile]] [[lei (garland)|lei]], a koa branch and other offerings after the dedication ceremony]]
For 137 years, Kealoha's burial site remained unmarked until a Hawaiian group affiliated with the organization Hawaiʻi Civil War Round Table, consisting of Anita Manning, Nanette Napoleon, Eric Mueller, and Justin Vance, started an effort to give him a grave marker.&lt;ref name="Cole2014" /&gt; Historian Anita Manning, a member of this group, had discovered the records containing Kealoha's name at the Hawaii State Archives in 2011. It listed his service in the war and the location of his burial place, but when Manning went to the site of his grave, she was disappointed by the absence of a headstone.&lt;ref name="Davis2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning" /&gt; Giving the reason for the significance of Kealoha's service, Manning stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kealoha represents many Hawaiian men and men from Hawaii who served in the Civil War who knew what they were getting into, who took a risk, and we all are the beneficiaries of that work and risk that they took ... We owe it to them to recognize that service.&lt;ref name="Cole2014" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The group petitioned the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for a marker for Kealoha but the Department denied the request because there was no next of kin to approve the request. A 2009 policy change enacted in 2012 required that only next of kin could request VA memorials.&lt;ref name="Cole2014" /&gt; After the request's denial, Honor Life Memorials, a local monument maker, donated a granite marker for Kealoha.&lt;ref name="Davis2014" /&gt;{{sfn|Kozlovich|Napoleon|2014}}

The marker was formally dedicated and unveiled on October 25, 2014.&lt;ref name="Davis2014" /&gt;{{sfn|Manning|2014}}{{sfn|Iwamoto|2014}} Dressed in period costumes, members of the Hawaiʻi Civil War Round Table and others took part in the dedication ceremony at Oʻahu Cemetery. The ceremony was marked by military honors and a gun salute by a unit of Civil War re-enactors. [[Hawaiian religion|Hawaiian]] minister Kahu Silva presided over the dedication ceremony, and in accordance with [[Culture of the Native Hawaiians|traditional Hawaiian customs]], the consecrated marker was adorned with a sacred ''[[Alyxia oliviformis|maile]] [[lei (garland)|lei]]'' and a [[Acacia koa|''koa'']] branch, representing "Kealoha's noble qualities of bravery, courage and valor."{{sfn|Silva|2014}} The marker is inscribed with his name, regiment, death date, and the Hawaiian and English text: "He Koa Hanohano, a brave and honorable soldier".&lt;ref name="Drewes2014" /&gt;

Other Hawaiian veterans of the Civil War are honored in Honolulu's [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] with a bronze memorial plaque that was erected in 2010 in recognition of the "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War", the more than one hundred documented Hawaiians who served with the Union and the Confederacy.{{sfn|Vance|Manning|2015c|pages=161–163}}&lt;ref name="Cole2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, researchers have identified 119 documented Hawaiian and Hawaiʻi-born combatants from historical records. The exact number remains unclear because of the lack of records.&lt;ref name="Davis2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Punaboy2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Punaboy|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 48 identified Native Hawaiian combatants, including [[James Wood Bush]] and [[Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman]], Kealoha is the only one buried in Hawaii whose gravesite is known.&lt;ref name="Cole2014" /&gt; According to Hawaiian news reporter Chelsea Davis, Kealoha has come to "represents all the men of Hawaii who took up arms in America's Civil War but who have been forgotten."&lt;ref name="Davis2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''Jabez Huntington''' (7 August 1719 – 5 October 1786) was a merchant and politician from [[Connecticut Colony]].

Jabez Huntington graduated from [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1741, engaged in the [[West India]] trade, and amassed a fortune. After 1759 he was frequently a member of the legislature, speaker for several years, and also a member of the council. At the beginning of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he owned a large amount of shipping, and lost heavily by the capture of his vessels. He was among the most active on the committee of safety during the war; and in the September 1776 session of the Connecticut assembly he and [[David Wooster]] were appointed Major Generals.  On the death of Wooster in 1777 Jabez was placed in charge of the entire Connecticut militia.  His great exertions in the patriot cause and his heavy losses impaired his physical and mental powers, and he was thus compelled to resign his employments in 1779.&lt;ref name=EBH&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntington|first=Elijah B.|title=Genealogical Memoir of the Huntington Family|authorlink=Elijah Baldwin Huntington|year=1863|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Jabez was born on 7 Aug 1719 in [[Norwich, Connecticut]] to Joshua and Hannah (Perkins) Huntington.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, p84&lt;/ref&gt;  He married first Elizabeth (20 Jan 1741 - 1 Jul 1745), the daughter of Samuel and Elizabeth (Tracy) Backus. They had two children, [[Jedediah Huntington|Jedediah]] in 1743, and Andrew who was born the month before his mother's death.  He married his second wife, Hannah Williams (23 Jul 1726 - 25 Mar 1807) of [[Pomfret, Connecticut]], on 10 Jul 1746.  They had six children: Joshua, Hannah (died at age eight), Ebenezer, Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah.&lt;ref name="Huntington, pages=161-168"&gt;Huntington, pages=161-168&lt;/ref&gt; Jabez died on 5 Oct 1786 at Norwich.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, p108&lt;/ref&gt;

Jabez's son [[Jedidiah Huntington]] also served in the American Revolution, and after it was over was collector of customs at [[New London, Connecticut]], for many years.

Jabez's son, Andrew Huntington (born 21 June 1745; died 7 April 1824) engaged in commercial pursuits, and in 1795 was a manufacturer of paper at the falls of Norwich. He was judge of probate in his district in 1813. During the American Revolution he was a commissary of brigade.

Jabez's son Joshua Huntington (born in Norwich, 16 August 1751) began business with his father. After the [[Battle of Lexington]], he commanded a company of 100 men of the town, and joined [[Israel Putnam|Putnam]]'s brigade. Subsequently, he was ordered by the [[Continental Congress]] to build a frigate of 36 guns, which was constructed in the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames]] at Gale's Ferry in 1777.

Jabez's son [[Ebenezer Huntington]] served in the American Revolution and then became a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Huntington, pages=161-168"/&gt;

'''Justin Meyer''' (born '''Raymond Meyer''', 11 November 1938{{spaced ndash}}6 August 2002) was an American vintner, enologist, and monk of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]]. He was the founder along with [[Ray Duncan]] of [[Silver Oak Cellars]] in 1972, a successful winery based in the [[Napa Valley]] and [[Alexander Valley]]. Today Duncan's sons [[David Duncan (vintner)|David Duncan]] and Tim Duncan run Silver Oak Cellars, as well as [[Twomey Cellars]], established in 1999. Meyer sold his share of the company to Duncan in 2001.&lt;ref name="CB0112"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobizmag.com/articles/colorado-business-hall-of-fame-ray-duncan|title=Colorado Business Hall of Fame: Ray Duncan|publisher=''[[ColoradoBiz]]''|date=1 January 2012|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CB0509"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobizmag.com/articles/the-cult-of-cabernet|title=The cult of cabernet|publisher=''[[ColoradoBiz]]'', accessed via [[HighBeam Research]]|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=19 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110231430/http://www.cobizmag.com/articles/the-cult-of-cabernet/|archivedate=10 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of California's top wine experts, he was President of the [[American Vineyard Foundation]] in the 1990s and also held numerous other positions in the wine industry. The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' cites Meyer as "one of the legends of the Napa Valley".&lt;ref name="SFC0407"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/wine/article/SON-OF-SILVER-OAK-The-scion-of-one-of-Napa-s-2566425.php|title=SON OF SILVER OAK / The scion of one of Napa's biggest legends makes a name for himself in Mendocino County with Meyer Family Cellars|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''|date=6 April 2007|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Meyer was born Raymond Meyer on 11 November 1938 in [[Bakersfield, California]].&lt;ref name="NYT0802"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/us/justin-meyer-63-winemaker-renowned-for-his-cabernet.html|title=Justin Meyer, 63, Winemaker Renowned for His Cabernet|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just out of high school, he became a monk of the Christian Brothers, and changed his first name to Justin. He taught Spanish at a Christian Brothers high school in [[Sacramento]] and in 1964 was apprenticed to winemaker Brother Timothy at their winery, [[Greystone Cellars]], in [[St. Helena, California]] in the [[Napa Valley]].&lt;ref name="LAT0802"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/10/local/me-meyer10|title=Justin Meyer, 63; Founder of Napa Valley's Silver Oak Cellars|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=10 August 2002|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT0802"/&gt; At one point the Christian Brothers ran 6 wineries and were the largest brandy producers in the world according to Meyer.&lt;ref name="NYT0802"/&gt;

===Career===
[[File:Justin Meyer and Ray Duncan.jpg|thumb|right|Meyer with Silver Oak Cellars co-founder, [[Ray Duncan]]]]

He left the Christian Brothers in 1972, and became president of V&amp;E Consulting and Management Company.&lt;ref name="Australian Viticulture"&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Viticulture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6e1JAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=Winetitles : printed by Hyde Park Press|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Meyer met Colorado entrepreneur [[Ray Duncan]] who had purchased a 750 acre plot of land in the [[Napa Valley]] of northern California, which was formerly the Oakville Dairy farm, as an investment in growing and selling grapes.&lt;ref name="Moss1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Austin Peter|title=Cole's insiders guide to the wines &amp; vines of Napa County|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pviE-7_jhOAC|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=March 1991|publisher=Cole Pub.

Meyer would provide his winemaking, cultivation and Californian market expertise while Duncan provided the financial backing.&lt;ref name="CB0907"/&gt;

The pair bottled their first vintage Cabernet Sauvignon in 1972, aging the wine in the old Keig Dairy barn on the original plot of land Duncan purchased.&lt;ref name="KushmanBeal2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kushman|first1=Rick|last2=Beal|first2=Hank|title=A Moveable Thirst: Tales and Tastes from a Season in Napa Wine Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tT9ufpJfsMC&amp;pg=PA247|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=16 April 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-79386-1|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made the decision to produce only Cabernet Sauvignon and to attempt to produce the finest in the world,&lt;ref name="MartinMartin2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Don W.|last2=Martin|first2=Betty Woo|last3=Sebastiani|first3=Sam|title=The Best of the Wine Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHmAOJmWmF0C|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=2 March 2005|publisher=DiscoverGuides|isbn=978-0-942053-43-2|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenkert2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenkert|first=Erika|title=Frommer's Portable California Wine Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zX1_FyV0c3MC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=19 July 2006|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-04313-4|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; to age the wine exclusively in American oak barrels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-jennings/california-cabernet_b_1572869.html|author=Jennings, Richard|title=Silver Oak: Reappraising a California Cabernet Icon |publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer said of the reason for deciding to concentrate on one wine, "it was kind of a reaction to my days at Christian Brothers, where we made so many wines it was hard to do them all right, and it was kind of in keeping with what I thought — that Cabernets were what Napa and Sonoma did best, so why not devote our attention to that. This is a pretty common concept in France."&lt;ref name="CB0509"/&gt; According to noted wine critic [[Robert M.

Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Justin Meyer4.jpg|thumb|Meyer enjoying a glass of wine]]
Meyer died of a heart attack at the age of 63 while on vacation in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains near [[Lake Tahoe]] on August 6, 2002.&lt;ref name="Vineyard &amp; Winery Management"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vineyard &amp; Winery Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO5IAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=26 March 2013|year=2002|publisher=Vineyard &amp; Winery Management|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT0802"/&gt; A memorial service was held at Silver Oak four days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92043544.html|title=Justin Meyer dead at 63|publisher=''[[Wines &amp; Vines]]'', accessed via [[HighBeam Research]]|date=1 September 2002|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death, [[Jim Wolpert]], the head of the department of viticulture and enology at [[University of California Davis]] said, "The debt of gratitude that we in the research community owe to him is immeasurable. He will be missed in ways that I don't think we all understand yet. There was no question about his reputation. His approach was always a no-nonsense, no-politics approach. He never let the main issues get sidetracked."&lt;ref name="WV1102"/&gt; [[John De Luca]], President of the Wine Institute said "I'm not sure people truly perceive his extraordinary impact on the wine industry. He is one of the defining figures, one of the great figures in wine of our time."&lt;ref name="WV1102"/&gt; Patrick Gleeson, executive director of the American Vineyard Foundation, who Meyer had mentored as a young lad said, "His vision and love for wine has undoubtedly made him a living legacy amongst friends, peers and those in the industry. Justin's passing will not diminish the influence he has had on the wine industry and hopefully it will inspire others to follow in his footsteps."&lt;ref name="WV1102"/&gt;

'''Louis Paul Jonas''' (July 17, 1894 – February 16, 1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Paul Jonas|url=http://www.wildlifeart.org/collection/artists/artist-louis-paul-jonas-233/|publisher=National Museum of Wildlife Art|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American sculptor of [[wildlife]], [[taxidermist|taxidermist, and natural history exhibit designer]].

Born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], Jonas moved to the United States at the age of 12 and went to work at his brothers' taxidermy studio, Jonas Brothers, in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver, Co]].  Later he moved to New York City, where studied under [[Carl Akeley]], a noted field naturalist, taxidermist, and animal sculptor.  There, they created the [[African elephant]] group in the center of Akeley Hall at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonas' Wildlife Sculpture in Big Demand|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19831003&amp;id=ogshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YXMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2739,663459|publisher=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=August 4, 2014|pages=2|date=October 3, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15282">A '''millwright''' is a high-precision [[Master craftsman|craftsman]] or [[tradesman]] who installs, dismantles, repairs, reassembles, and moves machinery in factories, power plants, and construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sokanu.com/careers/millwright/|title=Millwright|author=|date=|work=sokanu.com|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the name suggests, the original function of a millwright was the construction of [[flour mill]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[papermill|paper mills]] and [[fulling|fulling mills]] powered by [[watermill|water]] or [[windmill|wind]], mostly of wood with a limited number of metal parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Since both of these structures originated from antiquity, millwrighting could be considered, arguably, as one of the oldest engineering trades and the forerunner of the modern mechanical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unionmillwright.com/|title=Union Millwrights  Machine Erectors,|author=|date=|work=UnionMillwright.com|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage, a millwright is engaged with the erection of machinery. This includes such tasks as leveling, aligning and installing machinery on foundations or base plates and setting, leveling and aligning [[electric motor]]s or other power sources such as turbines with the equipment, which millwrights typically connect with some type of [[coupling]].

The term ''millwright'' (also known as ''industrial mechanic'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itabc.ca/program/industrial-mechanic-millwright|title=Industry Training Authority (ITA)|author=|date=|work=itabc.ca|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is mainly used in the United States, Canada and [[South Africa]] to describe members belonging to a particular trade. Other countries use different terms to describe tradesmen engaging in similar activities. 
Related, but distinctly different crafts, include [[machinist]]s and [[mechanic]]s.

==History==

===Before the modern era===
Originally, millwrights were specialized [[carpenter]]s who completely designed and constructed mills. Having a working knowledge of [[driveshaft]]s, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s, [[Gear train|gearing]] and [[Belt (mechanical)|mechanical belts]], they executed every type of engineering operation in the construction of these mills. They designed the patterns of the water wheel systems, carved their gear mechanisms, and finally erected the mill machines &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unionmillwright.com/history.html|title=Millwright History|first=Ron|last=Oliver|date=|work=UnionMillwright.com|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hellenistic period]] [[Greeks|Greek]] millwrights invented the two main components of watermills, the waterwheel and toothed gearing. Greeks, along with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], were the first to operate undershot, overshot and breastshot waterwheel mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oleson|1984|pp=325ff.}}; {{harvnb|Oleson|2000|pp=217–302}}; {{harvnb|Donners|Waelkens|2002|pp=10–15}}; {{harvnb|Wikander|2000|pp=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim millwrights adopted the Greek watermill technology from the [[Byzantine Empire]], where it had been applied for centuries in those provinces conquered by the Muslims. They used several solutions to achieve the maximum output from watermills, by either mounting them to [[pier]]s of [[bridge]]s to take advantage of the increased flow or by using a shipmill, a type of watermill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of ships [[Mooring (watercraft)|moored]] in [[midstream]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm HistoryofSciences.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225091836/http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm |date=2007-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In Medieval Europe, millwrights built the first industrial mills which introduced new innovative uses of waterpower. A survey of the types introduced in Western Europe was conducted by Adam Robert Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Robert Lucas, 'Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds. A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe', ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 46, (January 2005), pp. 1–30 (17).&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, in the late 14th century, the millwrights were known as ''jiang'' and ''kong'' (a special term for artisan-engineers) and existed at an early age. They learned their craft on the shop floor, in a kind of apprentiship scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[William Fairbairn|Sir William Fairbairn]], a millwright of the late 19th century, wrote in his "Treatise on Mills and Millwork", "...the millwright of the late centuries was an itinerant engineer and mechanic of high reputation. He could handle the axe, the hammer, and the plane with equal skill and precision...he could set out and cut in the furrows of a millstone with an accuracy equal or superior to that of the miller himself." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Fairbairn, William | 
title= Treatise on Mills and Millwork, Part I |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5zkDAAAAQAAJ |year=1863 |publisher=Longmans, Green and Company |location=London| access-date=14 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
The introduction of the steam engine and the increasing importance of iron and steel changed the global industrial landscape.
It created specialisation and the birth of new trades ([[Turning|turners]], [[fitter (occupation)|fitters]], machine makers, and [[mechanical engineer]]s). It also changed the traditional job of the millwright.

As James F. Hobart wrote in his book ''Millwrighting'', "The ancient type of millwright has passed away. He has gone with the old time carpenter and obsolete shoemaker - the former with 500 pounds of molding planes and woodworking tools, the latter with nothing but pegging and sewing awls, hammer, and knife..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Hobart, James F. (James Francis) | title=Millwrighting | publication-date=1919 | publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company, inc.; [etc., etc.] | edition=2nd ed., rev. and enl | url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Millwrighting_1000179923/11 | access-date=14 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 20th century, the trade adapted to the change. Modern millwrights work with [[steel]] and other materials and must often combine the skills of other mechanical trades in order to successfully install industrial machinery or to assemble machines from pre-fabricated parts.  Modern millwrights must also be able to read [[blueprints]] and other [[schematics]] to aid them in the construction of complex systems. Millwrights are frequently [[trade union|unionized]], with estimated numbers of around 45% in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unionstats.com/ unionstats.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern millwrights==

===General characteristics===
Millwrights install, maintain, repair and troubleshoot stationary industrial machinery and mechanical equipment in sites such as factories, production plants and recreational facilities.However, the exact duties of a millwright vary depending on whether they are unionized or not, with union rules typically being more restrictive than non-union situations, which may have their own [[job description]].

On a typical job millwrights:&lt;ref name="tradesecrets"&gt;{{cite web|author=Government of Alberta|title=Tradesecrets  - Millwright|url=https://tradesecrets.alberta.ca/trades-occupations/profiles/016/|access-date=4 January 2017|work=Tradesecrets|publisher=[[Alberta]] Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* read diagrams and schematic drawings and service manuals to determine work procedures
* operate rigging equipment and dollies to place heavy machinery and parts
* fit bearings, align gears and shafts, attach motors, and connect couplings and belts to precise tolerances
* align and test equipment, and make any necessary adjustments
* perform predictive and operational procedures
* repair or replace defective parts
* service and repair hydraulic and pneumatic systems
* may do some tack welding (a weld that is adequate in size to temporarily hold components in place until it can be completely welded by a registered apprentice welder or a journeyman welder) and fabrication as well as maintain an inventory of replacement parts.

Modern standards of practice for millwrights also require working:
* within precise limits or standards of accuracy 
* at heights without fear
* using of logical step-by-step procedures in work
* planning, solving problems and decision-making based on quantifiable information.

===Areas of specialty===
Millwrights by nature of their profession have to be extremely well versed in many aspects of construction/demobilization. They may install a [[conveyor]] system at an airport one week and the following week work at an [[industrial wastewater treatment]] plant.

====Power industry====
Millwrights in the power generation industry can assemble, set, [[wikt:align|align]] and balance [[turbines]] or [[rotor (turbine)|rotor]]s, as well as install pumps, valves, cranes, fans, and travelling screens.  Millwrights also perform critical lifts involving major components to be flown level at up to and within .005 inch (5 thousandths of an inch). Because of their training and expertise, Millwrights are generally chosen to work on tasks associated with flying and setting heavy machinery.

====Training and education====
Millwrights are also in demand as teachers for vocational programs, both at the high school level and in post-secondary institutions. Many high schools feature fabrication courses that include metal work, where the experience of a qualified millwright is valuable. Often, these millwrights are paid a premium based on their years of field experience.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Training===
Millwrights must have a good understanding of [[fluid mechanics]] ([[hydraulics]] and [[pneumatics]]), and all of the components involved in these processes, such as [[valve]]s, [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s, [[pump]]s and [[Gas compressor|compressors]].

They are also trained to work with a wide array of precision tools, such as vernier calipers, micrometers, dial indicators, levels, gauge blocks, and optical and laser alignment tooling.

Most millwrights are educated through [[apprenticeship]] programs where they receive a combination of classroom education along with a good deal of on-the-job training. For example, in [[Alberta]], the term of apprenticeship for a millwright is four years (four 12-month periods) including a minimum of 1560 hours of on-the-job training and site weeks of technical training each year.&lt;ref name="tradesecrets"/&gt;

Within the Steelworkers Union, known as the United Steelworkers or USW,the largest Industrial Union in North America, there is also a mix of both classroom and on-the-job training. Upon successful completion of required testing in blueprints, hydraulics, pneumatics, rigging, pipefitting, welding, burning, gears, couplings, and other various types of mechanical fasteners and machinery, as well as mobile equipment and other heavy machinery, a Millwright must also have 10 years of experience and seniority before being allowed to acquire one's Journeyman card from the International Union.

Apprentices are usually paid a percentage of the average millwright's wage, and this percentage increases with experience.

A typical training course, to qualify as a millwright, may include, among others, the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccer.org/millwright millwright]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Shaft alignment]] 
* [[Rigging (material handling)|Rigging]]
* [[Welding]]
* [[Machining]]
* [[Electrical wiring]]
* [[Steel]] fabrication
* [[Conveyor system]]s
* [[Steam turbine]] installation
* [[Gas turbine]] installation
* [[Blueprint]] basic, intermediate and advanced
* [[Safety]] basic, intermediate and advanced
* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]] 
* [[Associates degree]] classes

==South Africa==
In South Africa, the millwright trade (especially focused on the mining sector) enjoys a far more versatile description than in most other countries. {{fact|date=September 2016}}
Fields wherein South African millwrights may operate include:
* Low-, medium- and high-voltage electrical fault finding, installation, and maintenance. 
* PLC maintenance, installations, operations and fault finding. 
* Fitting; installation and maintenance of most mechanical equipment, as well as hydraulic and pneumatic systems.
* Steelworks, rigging,
* and various other miscellaneous fields all depending on the site, company, Mine Health and Safety Act, personal interest and specialization.

At most trades training centers, prospective millwright artisans are required to have a certain level of theoretical certification (e.g. N3-Nated- certificate) and psychometric characteristics, judged by thorough testing, in order to qualify for the foundation practical and theoretical technical training.

After being trained in a multitude of different fields, novice, unqualified Millwrights enter in an apprenticeship for "on-the-job" training. There they work alongside all available artisans regardless of trade, depending on the institution. Once they meet a structured quota of experience and pass the necessary modules, apprentices have two months to prepare for their practical Trade Test. After they passed, they receive the certification and status of a qualified Millwright Tradesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://financialresults.co.za/2011/exxaro_ar2010/pr-sp-human-resources.html|title=Exxaro Integrated Annual Report 2010 - Human resources|author=|date=|work=FinancialResults.co.za|access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Once millwrights qualify, they have the opportunity to qualify as technicians, engineers, planners, foremen and many other routes requiring mainly electrical and mechanical expertise.

Many millwrights choose to enter the private sector to work on a contractual basis.

==Prominent historical millwrights==
A number of prominent early-modern [[civil engineer]]s originally trained as millwrights, including:
* [[James Brindley]]
* [[John Rennie (father)|John Rennie]] 
* [[William Fairbairn]]
* [[Oliver Evans]], a prominent American millwright who published a manual for millwrights workers

'''Naddod''' ({{lang-non|Naddoðr}} or ''Naddaðr'', {{lang-is|Naddoður}}, {{lang-fo|Naddoddur}}, literally "studded") was a [[Norsemen|Norse]]-[[Faroese people|Faroese]] [[Viking]] who is credited with the discovery of [[Iceland]]. Naddod was also one of the first settlers on the [[Faroe Islands]] after [[Grímur Kamban]] became the first to settle there around 825. Naddod was born in [[Sørlandet|Agder]], which comprises the two Norwegian counties of [[Aust-Agder]]  and [[Vest-Agder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The First Settlers |url=http://www.angelfire.com/magic/iceland/first_settlers.htm |website=The Settlement of Iceland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Landnámabók]], a medieval Icelandic manuscript, describes in considerable detail the settlement (Icelandic: ''landnám'') of Iceland by the [[Norsemen|Norse]] in the 9th and 10th century. According to Landnámabók, Iceland was discovered by Naddod, who was sailing from [[Norway]] to the Faroe Islands, but got lost and drifted to the east coast of Iceland. Naddod came upon the shore of a land with a bay and mountains near what is today the Icelandic town of  [[Reyðarfjörður]].  Although he climbed a mountain to look for smoke rising from fireplaces he saw no sign of humans.  Naddod decided to continue his journey to the Faroe Islands, but as he returned to his boat it started to snow and so he named the land ''Snæland'' (''Snowland'').  The island later became known as ''Ísland'' (''Iceland''). (See [[names of Iceland]]).

Naddod is probably the father of [[Ann Naddodsdóttir]] from [[Shetland]]. Naddod has distant relations to [[Erik the Red]] and his son, [[Leif Erikson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Thorvald Asvaldsson {{!}} Mediander {{!}} Connects|url = http://www.mediander.com/connects/85845/thorvald-asvaldsson/|website = Mediander|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People of various ethnicities and national origins are citizens of New Zealand, governed by [[New Zealand nationality law|its nationality law]]. 

Originally composed solely of the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]], the [[Demographics of New Zealand|ethnic makeup of the population]] has been dominated since the 19th century by [[European New Zealanders|New Zealanders of European descent]], mainly of [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[English people|English]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry, with smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as [[Germans|German]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Scandinavia]]n and [[South Slavs|South Slavic]]. Today, the ethnic makeup of the New Zealand population is undergoing a process of change, with new waves of [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]], higher birth rates and increasing [[interracial marriage]] resulting in the New Zealand population of Māori, [[Asian New Zealanders|Asian]], [[Pacific Islander]] and [[multiracial]] descent growing at a higher rate than those of solely European descent, with such groups projected to make up a larger proportion of the population in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/estimates_and_projections/ethnic-pop-projections-issues-and-trends.aspx|title= Ethnic Population Projections: Issues and Trends|author= Gillian Smeith and Kim Dunstan|date= June 2004|work= Statistics New Zealand|publisher= |accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand has an estimated resident population of around {{NZ population data|New Zealand|y|showtitle|showref|(as of |).}} Over one million New Zealanders recorded in the [[2013 New Zealand census]] were born overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of overseas-born tops 1 million, 2013 Census shows|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/qstats-culture-identity-nz-mr.aspx|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|accessdate=30 July 2017|language=en-nz|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most New Zealanders are resident in New Zealand, there is also a significant [[diaspora]], estimated at around 750,000. Of these, around 640,800 lived in [[Australia]] ({{as of|2014|alt=a June 2013 estimate}}),&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt; which was equivalent to {{percentage|650000|{{NZ population data|New Zealand|2014}}|0}} of the domestic population of New Zealand. Other communities of New Zealanders abroad are predominantly concentrated in other [[Anglosphere|English-speaking countries]], specifically the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], with smaller numbers located elsewhere.&lt;ref name="The diaspora"/&gt;

Despite its [[List of ethnic origins of New Zealanders|multiethnic]] composition, the culture held in common by most New Zealanders can also be referred to as [[mainstream]] New Zealand culture, a [[Western culture]] largely derived from the traditions of British and other [[Northern Europe]]an colonists, settlers, and immigrants. It also includes influences of [[Māori culture]]. Large-scale immigration in the 20th and 21st centuries from Asia, such as [[Chinese New Zealanders|Chinese]] and [[Indian New Zealanders|Indians]], introduced a variety of elements.

The table above shows the broad ethnic composition of the New Zealand population at the 1961 census compared to that from the most recent data of the 2013 census. People of [[European ethnic groups|European]] descent constituted the majority of the 4.2 million people living in New Zealand, with 2,969,391 or 74.0% of the population in the [[2013 New Zealand census]].&lt;ref name="2013 Census results: New Zealand"/&gt; Those of full or part-Māori ancestry comprise 14.9% of New Zealanders. The residual "others" ethnic group consists largely of Asians and Pacific Islanders.&lt;ref name="cicred.org"/&gt;

Most European New Zealanders are of [[British people|British]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry, with smaller percentages of other European ancestries such as [[Germans]], [[Poles]] (historically noted as German due to [[Partitions of Poland]]), [[French people|French]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Scandinavia]]n and [[South Slavs]].&lt;ref&gt;Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand: [http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/en New Zealand Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720062539/http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/en |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1961 census, over 90% self-identified as people of European descent.&lt;ref name="cicred.org"/&gt;

The first Europeans known to have reached New Zealand were Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman|Abel Janszoon Tasman]] and his crew in 1642.&lt;ref name="MeinSmith23"&gt;Mein Smith (2005), pg 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Māori killed several of the crew and no more Europeans went to New Zealand until British explorer [[James Cook]]'s voyage of 1768–71.&lt;ref name="MeinSmith23"/&gt; Cook reached New Zealand in 1769 and mapped almost the entire coastline. Following Cook, New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American [[History of whaling|whaling]], [[Seal hunting|sealing]] and trading ships. They traded European food and goods, especially metal tools and weapons, for Māori timber, food, artefacts and water. On occasion, Europeans and Māori traded goods for sex.&lt;ref name=King122&gt;King (2003) pg 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Treatyofwaitangi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was signed between Māori and the British]]
Becoming aware of the lawless nature of European settlement and of increasing French interest in the territory, the British government appointed [[James Busby]] as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832. Busby failed to bring law and order to European settlement, but did oversee the introduction of the first national flag on 20 March 1834, after an unregistered New Zealand ship was seized in Australia. The nebulous [[United Tribes of New Zealand]] later, in October 1835, sent the [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand]] to King [[William IV of the United Kingdom]], asking him for protection. Ongoing unrest and the legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain [[William Hobson]] to New Zealand to claim sovereignty for the British Crown and negotiate a treaty with the Māori.{{Ref label|Note|i|i}} The [[Treaty of Waitangi]] was first signed in the [[Bay of Islands]] on 6 February 1840.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/milestones Political and constitutional timeline], New Zealand History online, Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Updated 6 December 2009. Retrieved 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The drafting was done hastily and confusion and disagreement continue to surround the translation. The Treaty however remains regarded as New Zealand's foundation as a nation and is revered by Māori as a guarantee of their rights.

In response to [[New Zealand Company]] attempts to establish a separate colony in Wellington, and French claims in Akaroa, Hobson, now Lieutenant-Governor, declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840. The two proclamations published in the ''New Zealand Advertiser and Bay Of Islands Gazette'' issue of 19 June 1840 "assert[s] on the grounds of Discovery, the Sovereign Rights of Her Majesty over the Southern Islands of New Zealand, commonly called 'The Middle Island' ([[South Island]]) and 'Stewart's Island' ([[Stewart Island/Rakiura]]); and the Island, commonly called 'The Northern Island', having been ceded Sovereignty to Her Majesty." The second proclamation expanded on how sovereignty over the "Northern Island" had been ceded under the treaty signed that February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZABIG18400619.1.1&amp;e=-------10--1----1-all | title=New Zealand Advertiser and Bay Of Islands Gazette, 19 June 1840 | publisher=Hocken Library | accessdate=22 April 2010 | quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the formalising of sovereignty, the organised and structured flow of migrants from Great Britain and Ireland began, and by 1860 more than 100,000 British and Irish settlers lived throughout New Zealand. The [[Otago Association]] actively recruited settlers from Scotland, creating a definite Scottish influence in that region, while the [[Canterbury Association]] recruited settlers from the south of England, creating a definite English influence over that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/history-of-immigration/4|title=History of Immigration - 1840 - 1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870 the non-Māori population reached over 250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/history-of-immigration/5|title=History of Immigration - 1853 - 1870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other settlers came from Germany, Scandinavia, and other parts of Europe as well as from China and the [[Indian subcontinent]], but British and Irish settlers made up the vast majority, and did so for the next 150 years.&lt;ref name="early"/&gt;

Between 1881 and the 1920s, the [[New Zealand Parliament]] passed legislation that intended to limit Asiatic migration to New Zealand, and prevented Asians from naturalising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/ImmigrationRegulation/2/en|title=1881–1914: restrictions on Chinese and others|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the New Zealand government levied a poll tax on Chinese immigrants up until the 1930s, when Japan went to war with China. New Zealand finally abolished the poll tax in 1944.
An influx of Jewish refugees from central Europe came in the 1930s.
Many of the persons of Polish origin in New Zealand arrived as orphans from Eastern Poland via Siberia and Iran in 1944 during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/1095/polish-orphans  |title= Polish Orphans |publisher= Te Ara |date=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-Second World War European immigration ====
[[File:Edmund Hillary, c. 1953, autograph removed.jpg|thumb|upright|New Zealand explorer and mountaineer [[Edmund Hillary]], a much loved national fugure]]

With the agencies of the [[United Nations]] dealing with humanitarian efforts following the [[World War II|Second World War]], New Zealand accepted about 5,000 refugees and displaced persons from Europe, and more than 1,100 [[Hungarians]] between 1956 and 1959 (see [[Refugees in New Zealand]]). The post-WWII immigration included more persons from [[Greeks in New Zealand|Greece]], [[Italian New Zealander|Italy]], [[Polish New Zealander|Poland]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]].

New Zealand limited immigration to those who would meet a labour shortage in New Zealand. To encourage those to come, the Government introduced free and assisted passages in 1947, a schema expanded by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] in 1950.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} However, when it became clear that not enough skilled migrants would come from the British Isles alone, recruitment began in Northern European countries. New Zealand signed a bilateral agreement for skilled migrants with the Netherlands, and a large number of Dutch immigrants arrived in New Zealand. Others came in the 1950s from Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Austria to meet needs in specialised occupations.
By the 1960s, the policy of excluding people based on nationality yielded a population overwhelmingly European in origin. By the mid-1960s, a desire for cheap unskilled labour led to ethnic diversification.

Over the following centuries the Polynesian settlers developed into a distinct culture now known as [[Māori culture|Māori]]. The population was divided into [[iwi]] (tribes) and [[hapu|hapū]] (subtribes) which would cooperate, compete and sometimes fight with each other. At some point a group of Māori migrated to the [[Chatham Islands]] where they developed their distinct [[Moriori people|Moriori]] culture.&lt;ref name=Clark123&gt;Clark (1994) pg 123–135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/moriori/4 |title= The impact of new arrivals |work= Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |last=Davis |first=Denise |date=11 September 2007 |accessdate= 30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to New Zealand's geographic isolation, 500 years passed before the next phase of settlement, the arrival of Europeans. Only then did the indigenous inhabitants need to distinguish themselves from the new arrivals, using the term "Māori" which means "normal" or "ordinary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hare |first1=McLintock, Alexander |last2=Gully |first2=John Sidney |title= The Word 'Maori' |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/maori-pakeha-pakeha-maori |work= An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |accessdate=5 May 2017 |language=en |date=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, disputes over questionable land purchases led to the Māori Wars, which resulted in large tracts of tribal land being confiscated by the colonial government. Settlements such as [[Parihaka]] in Taranaki have become almost legendary because of injustices done there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parihaka Attack|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/keyword/parihaka|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the loss of much of their land, Māori went into a period of decline, and in the late 19th century it was believed that the Māori population would cease to exist as a separate race and would be assimilated into the European population.

However, the predicted decline did not occur, and numbers recovered. Despite a high degree of intermingling between the Māori and European populations, Māori were able to retain their cultural identity and in the 1960s and 1970s [[:wikt:Maoridom|Māoridom]] underwent a cultural revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Māori - Urbanisation and renaissance|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori/page-5|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=5 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common region this group lived in was [[Auckland Region]] (23.9 percent or 142,770 people). They are the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand, after European New Zealanders. In addition, more than 120,000 Māori live in Australia. 
The [[Māori language]] (known as ''Te Reo Māori'') is still spoken to some extent by about a fifth of all Māori, representing 3% of the total population. Many New Zealanders regularly use Māori words and expressions, such as "''[[kia ora]]''", while speaking English. Māori are active in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.

===Asian===
{{main article|Asian New Zealanders}}
[[File:Lion dancers at the Auckland lantern festival 2010.jpg|thumb|Lion dancers perform at Auckland's [[Lantern Festival]]]]
In the 2013 Census, Asian ancestries total was 11.8% of the population, [[Chinese New Zealander|Chinese]] remained the largest Asian ethnic group in 2013, with 171,411 people while [[Indian New Zealander|Indian]] was the second-largest Asian ethnic group in 2013, with 155,178 with [[Filipino New Zealander|Filipino]] a distant third with 40,350 people.&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"/&gt;

The Asian component actually predates the Pacific component. There had been people of Asian ethnicity living in New Zealand from the early days of European settlement, albeit in very small numbers. During the period of gold rushes later in the nineteenth century the number of Chinese temporary settlers both from China and from Australia and America increased sharply. This was an interlude in many respects, though there was a small population which remained and settled permanently. However, a century later in the 1980s and 1990s the number of people of Asian ethnicities grew rapidly, and they are likely to exceed the Pacific population within the next few years.

===Pacific Islanders===
[[File:Cook Islands dancers at Auckland's Pacifica festival 3a.jpg|thumb|[[Cook Islands]] dancers at Auckland's [[Pasifika Festival]]]]
In the 1950s and 1960s, New Zealand encouraged migrants from the South Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Islands and New Zealand|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/pacific-islands-and-new-zealand|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=5 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country had a large demand for unskilled labour in the manufacturing sector. As long as this demand continued, migrants were encouraged by the government to come from the South Pacific, and many overstayed. However, when the boom times stopped, some blamed the migrants for the economic downturn affecting the country, and many of those people suffered [[Dawn raid#In New Zealand|dawn raids]] from 1974.

===Middle Eastern, Latin American and African===
{{main article|Middle Eastern|Latin American|African New Zealanders}}
This component was 1.2% of the total population in the 2013 census.&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"/&gt; The Latin American ethnic group almost doubled in size between the 2006 and 2013 censuses, increasing from 6,654 people to 13,182. A more recent component comprises refugees and other settlers from Africa and the Middle East, most recently from Somalia. While there had been previous settlers from the Middle East, such as Syrians, people from Equatorial Africa have been very few in the past. 
* Middle Eastern ethnic group – 20,406
* African ethnic group – 13,464

===Others===
In 2013, 67,752 people or 1.7% self-identified with one or more ethnicities ''other than'' European, Māori, Pacific, Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and African. The vast majority of these people, 65,973 people, identified only as ‘New Zealander’.&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/data-tables/tables-about-a-place.aspx?request_value=24388&amp;tabname=Culturaldiversity# 2013 Census tables about a place: New Zealand] Ethnic groups of people in New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race and ethnic relations==
{{See also|Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements}}
[[File:Waitangi Day 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|Prime Minister [[Norman Kirk]] walks hand in hand with a Māori boy, [[Waitangi Day]] 1973]]
Successive government policies on the relationship between Māori and non-Māori people have worsened race relations. After 1840, many issues to do with [[sovereignty]] and land ownership remained unresolved and, for a long time, invisible while Māori lived in rural communities. When Māori and Pākehā began living in closer proximity, the belief that the country had "the best race relations in the world" was tested. The first Race Relations Concilitator was appointed in 1971 to help combat racial discrimination among New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The people of New Zealand|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/society/page-1|website=TeAra.govt.nz|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agitation regarding [[Treaty of Waitangi]] violations intensified in the 1970s. The [[Waitangi Tribunal]] was set up in 1975 to consider alleged breaches, and in 1984 was empowered to look back to 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Waitangi Tribunal|url=https://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/about-waitangi-tribunal/|website=waitangitribunal.govt.nz|publisher=Waitangi Tribunal|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Further|Culture of New Zealand}}

New Zealand culture is essentially a [[Western culture]] influenced by the unique environment and geographic isolation of the islands, and the cultural input of the Māori and the various waves of multiethnic migration which followed the British colonisation of New Zealand. British settlers brought a legal, political, and economic system that has flourished, along with the British system of [[agriculture in New Zealand|agriculture]] that has transformed the landscape. The British brought the [[Protestant work ethic]]—the industrious newcomers astonished Māori people. In return, settlers noted the athletic ability, musicality, and courage of the Māori. However, British paternalism soon brought an extensive [[welfare in New Zealand|welfare system]] that created a large Māori [[underclass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maori and Welfare|url=https://nzinitiative.org.nz/dmsdocument/86|publisher=The New Zealand Initiative|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coloured illustration of Anzac troops after the fighting at Gallipoli during World War I (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of [[Anzac]] troops after the fighting at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] during the First World War]]

The development of a New Zealand identity and national character, separate from the British colonial identity, is most often linked with the period surrounding the First World War, which gave rise to the concept of the [[Anzac spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spirit of ANZAC|url=https://anzacday.org.au/spirit-of-anzac|publisher=ANZAC Day Commemoration Committee|accessdate=28 June 2017|date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cultural links between New Zealand and Great Britain are maintained by a common language, sustained immigration from the UK, and the fact that many young New Zealanders spend time in Britain on "[[overseas experience]]", known as "OE".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Make your overseas experience relevant to New Zealand|url=https://www.newzealandnow.govt.nz/work-in-nz/finding-work/job-interviews/make-your-overseas-experience-relevant|website=newzealandnow.govt.nz|publisher=New Zealand Immigration|accessdate=28 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealanders also identify closely with [[Australians]], as a result of the two nations' shared historical, cultural and geographic characteristics.&lt;ref name="Australians"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia and New Zealand - Common culture|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/australia-and-new-zealand/page-5|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maori dancers.jpg|thumb|left|A Māori war dance, called a [[haka]]]]
The New Zealand government promotes Māori culture by supporting Māori-language schools, by ensuring the language is visible in government departments and literature, by insisting on traditional Māori welcomes ([[pōwhiri]]) at government functions and state school award programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haerewa|first1=Ngarangi|title=Māori Culture: What Is A Pōwhiri?|url=https://theculturetrip.com/pacific/new-zealand/articles/maori-culture-what-is-a-powhiri/|website=Culture Trip|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by having Māori run the welfare services targeted at their people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Mel|last2=Coates|first2=John|last3=Bird|first3=Michael Yellow|title=Indigenous Social Work Around the World: Towards Culturally Relevant Education and Practice|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754648383|page=114|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-uldFd2WMVoC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealanders are distinctive for their twangy dialect of [[English language|English]] and propensity to travel long distances, and are quickly associated with the [[All Blacks]] rugby team and the [[haka (sports)|haka]]. A tradition of resourcefulness came from the pioneering backgrounds of both European and Māori colonists.

===National personifications===
{{see also|National symbols of New Zealand}}
[[File:Palmerston NZ Boer War Memorial closer.jpg|upright|thumb|A statue of ''[[Zealandia (personification)|Zealandia]]'' as a [[Second Boer War]] memorial in Palmerston.]]

''[[Zealandia (personification)|Zealandia]]'' is a [[national personification]] of New Zealand and New Zealanders. In her stereotypical form, Zealandia appears as a woman of European descent who is dressed in flowing robes (or gown).&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/zealandia-mother-of-the-nation/|last=Wolfe|first=Richard|title=Zealandia – mother of the nation?|issue=23|publication-date=July–September 1994|magazine=[[New Zealand Geographic]]|location=Auckland|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glover"&gt;[[Denis Glover|Denis James Matthews Glover]], [http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/zealandia/1 "A National Symbol?"] in ''[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]]'' ([[Alexander Hare McLintock|A. H. McLintock]] ed, 1966). Retrieved on 5 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She is similar in dress and appearance to [[Britannia]] (the female personification of Britain), who is said to be the mother of Zealandia.&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

As a rhetorical evocation of a New Zealand national identity,&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt; Zealandia appeared on [[postage stamp]]s, posters, cartoons, [[war memorial]]s, and New Zealand government publications most commonly during the first half of the 20th century. The personification was a commonly used symbol of the [[New Zealand Centennial Exhibition]], which was held in [[Wellington]] in 1939 and 1940.&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt; Two large Zealandia statues serve as war memorials that honour the casualties of the [[Second Boer War]]: one is in [[Waimate]] and the other is in [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]].&lt;ref name="Wolfe"/&gt; Some smaller statues exist in museums and in private hands.

The female figure who appears on the left side of the [[coat of arms of New Zealand|national coat of arms]] has been identified as Zealandia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/int/nzl/nz-nat.htm National Arms of New Zealand] - Heraldry of the World. Last modified on 21 January 2016. Retrieved on 5 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; (in a "cut down nightie").&lt;ref name="Glover"/&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of New Zealand}}
English ([[New Zealand English]]) is the dominant language spoken by New Zealanders, and a ''de facto'' official language of New Zealand. According to the [[2013 New Zealand census]],&lt;ref name="2013table28"/&gt; 96.1% of New Zealanders spoke English. The country's ''[[de jure]]'' [[official language]]s are [[Māori language|Māori]] (Te Reo) and [[New Zealand Sign Language]] (NZSL). Other languages are also used by ethnic communities.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in New Zealand}}
[[File:John Atcherley Dew in 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Dew (bishop)|John Dew]] is the Roman Catholic [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington|Archbishop of Wellington]] and a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]]]

However, regular [[church attendance]] is probably closer to 15%.&lt;ref name="bibleengagement"&gt;{{cite book | last = Opie | first = Stephen | title = Bible Engagement in New Zealand: Survey of Attitudes and Behaviour | page = 4 | publisher = Bible Society of New Zealand | date = June 2008 | url = http://biblesociety.org.nz/mediafiles/bible-society-research-2008.pdf | id =  | accessdate = 29 May 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100526105617/http://biblesociety.org.nz/mediafiles/bible-society-research-2008.pdf | archivedate = 26 May 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before [[History of New Zealand|European colonisation]] the religion of the indigenous Māori population was [[Māori religion|animistic]], but the subsequent efforts of [[missionaries]] such as [[Samuel Marsden]] resulted in most Māori converting to Christianity.

Religious affiliation has been collected in the [[New Zealand census]] since [[1851 New Zealand census|1851]]. One of the many complications in interpreting religious affiliation data in New Zealand is the large proportion who object to answering the question, roughly 173,000 in 2013. Most reporting of percentages is based on the total number of responses, rather than the total population.

In the early 20th century New Zealand census data indicates that the vast majority of New Zealanders affiliated with Christianity. The total percentages in the 1921 non-Māori census were 45% Anglicans, 19.9% Presbyterians, 13.6% Catholics, 9.5% Methodists and 11.2% Others. Statistics for Māori were only available from 1936, with 35.8% Anglicans, 19.9% Ratana, 13.9% Catholics, 7.2% Ringatu, 7.1% Presbyterians, 6.5% Latter Day Saints, 1.3% Methodists and 8.3% Others recorded at this census.&lt;ref name="NZHA70"&gt;''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' (1997) McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, Plate 70&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikolay Mikhailovich Afanasyev''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Михайлович Афанасьев}}, also known as Nicolai Michaelovich Afanasiev) (November 14, 1916 – March 15, 2009) was a Russian [[firearms]] designer.&lt;ref name="k"&gt;"[http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/812/024.pdf Памяти Николая Михайловича Афанасьева]", ''КАЛАШНИКОВ.

==Biography==
Nicolai Michaelovitch Afanasiev was born in Russia on 14 November 1916 in [[St. Petersburg]]. In 1938 he graduated from a [[Tekhnikum]] of the Mechanization of Agriculture.

In 1939 he was drafted to serve in a tank corps in [[Mongolia]], where he started to work on machine gun design. After the Nazi invasion of the [[Soviet Union]], he volunteered for front-line service. He was allowed to be a fighter from September 1941 until the fall of 1942, when he was recalled to work on armaments, initially on improving fuses for 82- and 120-mm mortars.

After 1948 Afanasiev worked at the [[KBP Instrument Design Bureau]].&lt;ref name="k"/&gt;

He died on 15 March 2009.

[[Image:Bossier Street in Natchitoches, LA IMG 1980.JPG|200px|right|thumb|&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Bossier Street in Natchitoches is named for Pierre Bossier.&lt;/span&gt;]]

'''Pierre Evariste Jean-Baptiste Bossier''' (March 22, 1797 &amp;ndash; April 24, 1844) was a [[Planter (American South)|planter]], soldier and politician born in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]]. He is the namesake of [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier Parish]] (pronounced BO zhure), located east of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] across from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] in northwestern Louisiana. [[Bossier City, Louisiana|Bossier City]] and the Pierre Bossier Mall shopping center in Bossier City are among the other places named for him.

==Early life and education==
Born in Natchitoches, Louisiana, in 1797, while it was still a colony, Pierre Evariste Jean-Baptiste Bossier was the son of planter François Paul Bossier and the former Catherine Pélagie Lambre. An ethnic French Catholic Creole, he was privately educated by a tutor in the classics.

==Career==
Bossier was a planter like his father and cultivated cotton and sugar as commodity crops on his plantation, Live Oaks, on the [[Cane River]], depending on the labor of large gangs of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]. This waterway was formerly a segment of the Red River, in [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana|Natchitoches Parish]]. Like other native-born creoles of the planter elite, Bossier served in the state [[militia (United States)|militia]], gaining the rank of general.

He entered politics as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Bossier was elected as a member of the [[Louisiana State Senate]] in 1832, defeating [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] [[Louis Gustave De Russy]]. Of French descent, De Russy (also known as Lewis DeRussy, in an anglicized form of his name) was born and grew up in New York City, where his father had taken the family after fleeing from the violence on [[Saint-Domingue]] during the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Bossier served from 1833 to 1843.

In the summer of 1839, a political argument between a prominent [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], General F. Gaiennie, and State Senator General P. E. Bossier, a Democrat, escalated to recriminations published in the local newspaper. Gaiennie, also a general in the state militia, had denounced Bossier as a coward. Bossier demanded a [[duel]] and Gaiennie accepted, choosing rifles as the most deadly weapon available. The duel occurred the following autumn on the grounds of Cherokee Plantation, which was owned by Emile Sompayrac in Natchitoches Parish. Gaiennie fired first and missed, Bossier hit Gaiennie in the heart, killing him instantly.&lt;ref name="mayeux"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JdI3cNDAmP0C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=General+F.+Gaiennie+1843+duel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NrPLFb5INE&amp;sig=BFoO2fClWyRZ7chbTgKjj3CarwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimmM-H--vZAhUF2lMKHZ8EBBwQ6AEINzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=General%20F.%20Gaiennie%201843%20duel&amp;f=false Steven M. Mayeux, ''Earthen Walls, Iron Men: Fort DeRussy, Louisiana, and the Defense of Red River''], University of Tennessee Press, 2007, Appendix A, pp. 275-276&lt;/ref&gt; Another eleven men died in the aftermath, as animosities related to the duel continued to play out.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Raphael Nardini, Jr., ''My Historic Natchitoches, Louisiana and Its Environment'', (Natchitoches, LA: Nardini Publishing, 1963), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Bossier was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from the newly established [[Louisiana's 4th congressional district]], serving from March 4, 1843, until his death in office a year later on April 24, 1844 in [[Washington, D.C.]] before his first term had ended. He committed suicide.&lt;ref name="mayeux"/&gt;

Bossier's remains are interred at the Catholic Cemetery in Natchitoches.

==Legacy and honors==
Bossier City, Bossier Parish, and Pierre Bossier Mall in Bossier City, and Bossier Street in Natchitoches, are all named in his honor.

'''Raoul Silva''' (real name '''Tiago Rodriguez''') is a fictional character and the primary antagonist in the 2012 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Skyfall]]''. He is portrayed by [[Academy Award]]-winning actor [[Javier Bardem]]. A former [[MI6]] agent, he turns to [[cyberterrorism]] and begins targeting the agency he used to work for as part of a plan to get revenge against [[M (James Bond)|M]], against whom he holds a homicidal grudge.

Bardem received critical acclaim for his performance, and Silva is regularly ranked among the greatest villains in the James Bond series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ryan|last=Gilbey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/oct/28/profile-javier-bardem|title=Javier Bardem: is he the best ever Bond baddie?|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=27 October 2012|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Crow|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/james-bond/250413/007-ranking-the-24-james-bond-villains-from-best-to-worst/page/0/1|title=007: Ranking the 24 James Bond Villains From Best to Worst|website=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=Dennis Media|location=London, England|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Chris|last=Nashawatty|url=http://ew.com/gallery/james-bond-ranking/24-moonraker-1979|title=Ranking All 24 James Bond Movies|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=November 5, 2015|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backstory==
''Skyfall'' establishes that Silva's real name is Tiago Rodriguez, and that he once was a part of Station H, the MI6 division based in [[Hong Kong]] before [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|China took control]], specialising in [[cyberterrorism]]. When he hacked into the Chinese government's top secret files, M, who was the head of Station H at the time, allowed them to take him prisoner in exchange for the return of six previously captured agents and a peaceful transition of sovereignty. He was tortured for five months, until finally he attempted suicide by swallowing a [[cyanide]] capsule. He survived, but was left disfigured, with a misshapen jaw, rotted teeth and a sunken left eye socket. He wears a dental prosthetic to conceal his disfigurements. At some point he escaped from Chinese custody and reinvented himself as Raoul Silva, a cyberterrorist for hire, and began forming a plan to get revenge against M.

==''Skyfall''==
One of Silva's henchmen, Patrice, steals a hard drive containing the names and locations of MI6 agents operating [[undercover]] within terrorist groups; Silva begins uploading their identities and aliases onto [[YouTube]], resulting in several agents being murdered. Silva then targets MI6 headquarters by sabotaging the building's gas main, causing an explosion that kills several agents. M sends Bond to [[Macau]] to find and kill Silva. Bond seduces Silva's lover, a prostitute named [[Sévérine]], who promises to take Bond to him in return for her freedom; ultimately,  however, Silva intimidates her into betraying Bond. Upon taking Bond captive, Silva forces him at gunpoint to participate in a game of [[William Tell]], in which the target is a [[shot glass]] of [[Scotch whisky|scotch]] balanced on Sevérine's head.  When Bond intentionally misses her, Silva shoots her dead. Bond then kills Silva's men. Moments later, MI6 helicopters arrive to take Silva into custody having been signaled by an emergency distress radio given to Bond by [[Q (James Bond)|Q]].

At MI6's underground headquarters in London, M confronts Silva, who taunts her that his plan is already in motion. Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 systems, allowing Silva to escape from MI6 custody. Bond realises that Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M.

Silva flees into the [[London Underground]], with Bond in pursuit. Silva diverts through London's sewers. When Bond finally catches up to him, Silva detonates an explosive charge that sends a runaway subway train coming straight for Bond, who narrowly escapes. Silva, along with several accomplices, barge into a government hearing where M is giving a deposition, but fails to kill her. Bond barges in and a gunfight follows, in which Silva's plans are disrupted and Bond manages to flee, taking M with him.

Silva follows Bond and M to the former's childhood home in [[Scotland]], where his men open fire. He pursues a mortally wounded M to a chapel at the side of the house, and begs her to kill them both by firing a bullet through her head and into his. At that moment, however, Bond appears and throws a knife into Silva's back, killing him. 

==In other films==
In the following Bond film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] reveals that Silva had worked with and been supported by [[SPECTRE]], a worldwide criminal organization, along with [[Le Chiffre]] and Dominic Greene, the villains of ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', respectively.

==Sexuality==
The scene in which Silva and Bond first meet raised eyebrows among critics and fans alike for its supposed [[homoerotic]] subtext. In the scene Silva strokes Bond's thighs and chest while interrogating the secret agent, who is tied to a chair.

{{quote|Silva: Look what she's done to you.&lt;br&gt;
Bond: Yes, well, she never tied me to a chair.&lt;br&gt;
Silva: Her loss. [begins tracing along Bond's chest with his finger]&lt;br&gt;
Bond: Are you sure this is about M?&lt;br&gt;
Silva: It's about her, and you, and me. We are the last two rats, and we can either eat each other... [lascivious grin] ...or we can eat everyone else. Ah, you're trying to think back to your training. What's the regulation to cover this? Oh well... [strokes Bond's thighs] ... there's a first time for everything.&lt;br&gt;
Bond: What makes you think this is my first time?&lt;br&gt;
Silva: Oh, Mr. Bond!}}

The scene ignited speculation that screenwriter [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], who is [[gay]], intended to imply that Silva and Bond are gay or [[bisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Frank|last=DiGiacomo|url=http://movieline.com/2012/10/15/james-bond-gay-daniel-craig-javier-bardem-skyfall-scene/|title=Is Bond Bi? Daniel Craig And Javier Bardem Weigh In Separately On Their Flirtatious Scene Together|website=[[Movieline]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=October 15, 2012|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logan denied this in an interview with [[The Huffington Post]], saying, "Some people claim it's because I'm, in fact, gay but not true at all. [Director [[Sam Mendes]]] and I were discussing, there were so many scenes in which Bond goes mano-a-mano with the villain, whether it's [[Julius No|Dr. No]] or [[Auric Goldfinger|Goldfinger]] or whatever, and there's been so many ways to a cat-and-mouse and intimidate Bond, and we thought, what would make the audience truly uncomfortable is sexual intimidation; playing the homoerotic card that is sort of always there subtextually with characters like [[Francisco Scaramanga|Scaramanga]] in '[[Francisco Scaramanga|Man With the Golden Gun]]' or [[Julius No|Dr. No]]. So we just decided we would play the card and enjoy it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher|last=Rosen|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/06/skyfall-bisexual-james-bond-gay_n_2082845.html|title='Skyfall' Bisexual Scene: James Bond Screenwriter Reveals Impetus Behind Homoerotic Interrogation|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=November 6, 2012|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Bassett''' (April 2, 1745 – August 15, 1815) was an American lawyer and political figure from the state of [[Delaware]] who, as a veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, is considered one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. A member of the [[Federalist Party]], he served in the [[Delaware General Assembly]], as [[Governor of Delaware]], and as [[List of United States Senators from Delaware|U.S. Senator from Delaware]].  He holds the Senate Rank of 1, as the most senior [[United States Senator]] during the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/chronlist.pdf Senators of the United States 1789–2012] at the website for United States Senate&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Bassett was born at Bohemia Ferry in the [[Province of Maryland]]'s [[Cecil County]].  His mother, Judith Thompson, had married part-time tavern-owner and farmer Arnold Bassett who deserted the family during Richard's childhood. Since Judith Thompson was the great granddaughter and heiress of [[Augustine Herrman]], the original owner of Cecil County's massive estate of Bohemia Manor, her family raised young Richard. Eventually this heritage provided him with inherited wealth, including the Bohemia Manor plantation as well as much other property in Delaware's [[New Castle County]].

[[File:RICHARD BASSETT HOUSE, DOVER, KENT COUNTY, DELAWARE.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Richard Bassett House in [[Dover, Delaware]]]]
Bassett studied law under Judge [[Robert Goldsborough]] of Province of Maryland's [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester County]] and, in 1770, Richard was admitted to the Bar. He moved to Delaware and began a practice in [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]]'s court town of [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], which, in 1777, became the newly independent state's capital city. By concentrating on agricultural pursuits as well as religious and charitable concerns, he quickly established himself amongst the local gentry and "developed a reputation for hospitality and philanthropy."&lt;ref name = soldierState&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/bassett.htm| title = Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution| id =CMH Pub 71-25| chapter = Richard Bassett| year =1987|  location = Washington D.C.| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| first1 =Robert K.| last1 = Wright, Jr.|first2= Morris J.| last2 = MacGregor Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774, at the age of 29, Richard married Ann Ennals and they had three children, Richard Ennals, Ann (known as Nancy) and Mary. After Ann Ennals' death he married Betsy Garnett in 1796. They were active members of the [[Methodist Church]], and gave the church much of their time and attention.

==Professional and political career==
Bassett was a reluctant revolutionary, more closely in tune with the approach of [[George Read (U.S. statesman)|George Read]] than with his neighbors from Kent County, [[Caesar Rodney]] and [[John Haslet]]. Nevertheless, in 1774 he was elected to the local Boston Relief Committee. When the new government of Delaware was organized, Bassett served on the 1776 Delaware Council of Safety, and was a member of the convention responsible for drafting the [[Delaware Constitution]] of 1776, which was adopted September 20, 1776. He was then one of the conservatives elected to [[1st Delaware General Assembly]], and served for four sessions, from 1776/77 through 1779/80. Subsequently, he was a member of the House of Assembly for the 1780/81 and 1781/82 sessions, and returned to the Legislative Council, for three sessions from 1782/83 through 1784/85. He concluded his state legislative career with a final term in the House of Assembly during the 1786/87 session. He thereby represented Kent County in all but one session of the Delaware General Assembly from independence to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution of 1787.

However, Bassett's most notable contributions during the American Revolution were his efforts to mobilize the state's military. Some sources credit him with developing the plans for raising and staffing the [[1st Delaware Regiment]], with his neighbor, John Haslet at its command. Known as the "Delaware Continentals" or "Delaware Blues", they were from the smallest state, but at some 800 men, were the largest battalion in the [[Continental Army]]. In his book ''[[1776 (book)|1776]]'', historian [[David McCullough]] describes them as "turned out in handsome red trimmed blue coats, white waistcoats, buckskin breeches, white woolen stockings, and carrying fine, 'lately imported' English muskets". Raised in early 1776, they went into service in July and August 1776. Bassett also participated in the recruitment of the reserve militia that served in the "[[Flying Camp]]" of 1776, and the Dover Light Infantry, led by another neighbor, [[Thomas Rodney]].

When the [[History of the British Army#American War of Independence|British Army]] marched through northern New Castle County, on the way to the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and the capture of [[Philadelphia]], Bassett "appears to have joined his friend Rodney in the field as a volunteer". Once the Delaware militia returned home after the British retired from the area, Bassett continued as a part-time soldier, assuming command of the Dover Light Horse, Kent County's militia cavalry unit. in 1799 Bassett was elected governor of Delaware and held his position until 1801.

==Later issues and Methodism==
Bassett was one of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention and, without supplying much input, signed the Constitution. Meanwhile, the Delaware Constitution of 1776 was in need of revision, and Bassett once again joined with another of Delaware's Founding Fathers, [[John Dickinson (Delaware)|John Dickinson]] in leading the convention to draft a revision, which became the Delaware Constitution of 1792. Upon his retirement from the United States Senate in 1793, Bassett began a six-year term as the first Chief Justice of the [[Delaware Court of Common Pleas]]. At the time it was a court of general civil jurisdiction and the predecessor of the present [[Delaware Superior Court]]. By this time Bassett was formally a member of the Federalist Party, and as such was elected Governor of Delaware in 1799. It was during his time in office that [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] first came to Delaware to begin his gunpowder business.

However, it was also during his term that [[Thomas Jefferson]] was elected President of the United States, causing great concern for the future of the country among the Federalists. The retiring President [[John Adams]], rushed the [[Judiciary Act of 1801]] through the [[6th United States Congress|Federalist 6th Congress]], creating a number of new judgeships on the United States circuit courts. Being a staunch Federalist and old political ally, Adams, on his last day in office, February 18, 1801, appointed Bassett, as part of the so-called "midnight judge" appointments, to one of the positions, judge of the Third Circuit. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 20, 1801, and received his commission the same day. But the legislation was repealed by the new [[7th United States Congress|Jeffersonian 7th Congress]], and his tenure ended quickly on July 1, 1802. He never again held public office.

In addition to his high profile in government, Bassett was a devout and energetic convert to [[Methodism]]. Having met [[Francis Asbury]] in 1778 at the home of their mutual friend, Judge Thomas White, Bassett soon had a conversion experience, and for the remainder of his life devoted much of his attention and wealth to the promotion of Methodism. He and Asbury remained lifelong friends. This association caused him to become linked in many people's minds to the loyalists, as both White and Asbury were viewed to be opposed to the war. But it also led to a strong abolitionist belief, which led him to free his own slaves and advocate the emancipation of others.

==Death and legacy==
Bassett died at Bohemia Manor and was first buried there. In 1865 his remains were moved to a Bassett and Bayard mausoleum in the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery in Delaware's largest city, [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]].

Bassett was a stout man of medium build. He was very fashionable and influential in society. At the Constitutional Convention of 1787 he was described as "gentlemanly, a religious enthusiast and a man of plain sense" with "modesty enough to hold his tongue". Bassett's daughter, Anne married [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James A. Bayard]], a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator, and they were the ancestors of the branch of the [[Bayard family]] that has played a prominent role in Delaware politics ever since. His niece and adopted daughter, Rachel McCleary, married Governor [[Joshua Clayton]] of yet another family long prominent in Delaware politics.

Bassett Street in [[Wisconsin]]'s capital, [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp Origins of Madison Street Names at the website for Wisconsin Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Almanac==
Elections were held October 1 and members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. State Legislative Councilmen had a three-year term and State Assemblymen had a one-year term. The General Assembly chose the U.S. Senators, who took office March 4 for a six-year term. However, Bassett's term was only four years to establish a rotation.

Beginning in 1792 elections were held the first Tuesday of October. The State President became the Governor and was popularly elected. He takes office the third Tuesday in January and had a three-year term. Judges of the Courts of Common Pleas were also selected by the General Assembly for the life of the person appointed. U.S. Circuit Court Judges were appointed by the President and approved by the U.S. Senate.

'''Sally ("Salwa") Shatila Kader''' is the co-founder and president of the [[United States Federation for Middle East Peace|International Federation for Peace &amp; Sustainable Development]] (formerly USFMEP), a bipartisan, non-profit and non-governmental organization, which has seventeen chapters around the world including its headquarters in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=USFMEP&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Board|url=http://www.usfmep.org/board-of-directors.html|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kader is a peace activist and currently leads IFPSD programs and events at the [[United Nations]] [[Headquarters of the United Nations|Headquarters in New York City]] and around the world. She has been recognized by world leaders and organizations for her contributions towards peace.

== Background ==

Kader, who was born in [[Beirut, Lebanon]], holds a Bachelor’s Degree in History and Archeology from the University of Lebanon and a Master’s Degree in History from Central Missouri State University.  She also pursued extensive coursework in comparative religion, communications and conflict resolution at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Baghdad]] and Lebanese University.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Activism ==

As President of USFMEP, Kader has traveled across the United States and the Middle East developing learning opportunities in relation to the Middle East, raising awareness about its religions, cultures, history and political landscape.  Kader also engages in dialogue with the people of the Middle East, educating them about American culture and tradition, emphasizing the inherently peaceful nature of the American people.  Through her work with the organization, Kader has sought to strengthen relations between the United States and the Arab and Muslim worlds by undermining common misconceptions and enhancing tolerance.&lt;ref name="Bahrain News Agency"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaikh Fawaz Receives Sally Kader|url=http://50.22.202.12-static.reverse.softlayer.com/portal/en/news/444865|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121217173807/http://50.22.202.12-static.reverse.softlayer.com/portal/en/news/444865|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 December 2012|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an academic well-versed in archeological studies, Kader has also supported the preservation of numerous archeological dig sites and their cultural artifacts in countries such as [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]].   
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ban Ki-Moon and Mrs. Kader.jpg|thumb|Kader with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon]] --&gt;
Kader has strived to promote peace and tolerance amongst different groups of people by engaging in [[interfaith dialogue]] discussions, encouraging youth education and facilitating women empowerment.  She has met and worked with various world leaders including former [[United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair|Prime Minister Tony Blair]] and the late [[Benazir Bhutto]]. Kader has also led peace efforts with prominent celebrities including the famous actress Safia Al-Omari.

Kader has further collaborated with other leading UN organizations to submit joint statements to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], recommending certain amendments to existing resolutions.  In 2004, USFMEP drafted and submitted a document advocating the implementation of international legal standards condemning religious intolerance, which was signed by approximately sixty religious leaders and theorists from around the world.

=== Involvement in Peace-Building Areas ===

Kader has been recognized for her distinguished contribution to global peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moussly|first=Rania|title=Is Interfaith Dialogue Working?|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/education/is-interfaith-dialogue-working-1.727780|accessdate=22 August 2012|date=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has sought to increase awareness of pressing global issues such as human trafficking and much of her work has been committed towards building peace in the world. In pursuit of these goals, Kader has hosted numerous events, panel discussions, peace conferences, vigils, prayer services and peace marches including International Peace Conferences at the Arab League Headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, Annual UN International Day of Peace celebrations throughout the world and an International Peace Walk in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt (December 19, 2005) among others. Through this work, Kader has strived to contribute towards peace-building initiatives by promoting mutual respect, camaraderie and religious tolerance and by condemning violence and hatred.

=== Women Empowerment Initiatives ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Palest, refugees, iceland.JPG|thumb|Kader helps support Palestinian Refugees in Iceland]] --&gt;
Kader is a long-time activist for [[women’s rights]] and much of her work has been devoted toward the empowerment of women and the elevation of women’s status in society.  She has taken an active involvement in women empowerment initiatives by encouraging dialogue and educating audiences on various women’s issues. This has included hosting interfaith discussions between different religious women, raising awareness on the trafficking of young girls, promoting women’s role in the media and encouraging women to participate in society, politics and decision-making. Some of her work has included helping refugee Palestinian women and hosting international conferences including one on the Role of Immigrant Women towards International Peace in [[Stockholm, Sweden]].

In addition, Kader has annually organized numerous side-events for the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (“CSW”) on a variety of topics. Some of the CSW side events hosted by Kader have included Women in Islam:  East Meets West (March 4, 2005), The Trafficking of Young Girls in the 21st Century (February 26, 2007), Rights of Muslim Women:  Islam and Tradition (March 8, 2005), The Role of Women in Creating a Counter-Balance to Extremism (February 2007), The Role of Women in the Media Coverage of Peace-Building between the Middle East and the West (February 28, 2007), Empowering Women in Politics and Decision-Making in Muslim Countries (March 6, 2007), Empowerment of Women through Media Exposure for Building Peace (February 25, 2008), Violence against the Working Mother (March 1, 2010) and Muslim, Jewish and Christian Women Who Share the Vision of Understanding (March 12, 2009) among many others.

'''Scott McKenzie''' (born '''Philip Wallach Blondheim III'''; January 10, 1939 &amp;ndash; August 18, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[singing|singer]] and [[songwriter]].  He was best known for his 1967 [[hit single]] and generational anthem, "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Philip Wallach Blondheim III was born in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], on January 10, 1939, as the son of Philip Wallach Blondheim, Jr. by the former Dorothy Winifred Hudson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottmckenzie.info/ |title=Welcome - Scott McKenzie |publisher=Scottmckenzie.info |date= |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family moved to [[Asheville, North Carolina]], when he was six months old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottmckenzie.info/the-early-days.html |title=The Early Days - Scott McKenzie |publisher=Scottmckenzie.info |date=1939-01-10 |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew up in [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]], where he became friends with the son of one of his mother's friends, [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]]. In the mid-1950s, he sang briefly with [[Tim Rose]] in a [[high school]] group called The Singing Strings, and later with Phillips, Mike Boran, and Bill Cleary formed a [[doo wop]] [[band (music)|band]], The Abstracts.

In [[New York City|New York]], The Abstracts became The Smoothies and recorded two [[single (music)|singles]] with [[Decca Records]], [[record producer|produced]] by [[Milt Gabler]]. During his time with The Smoothies, Blondheim decided to change his name for business reasons:

:"[We] were working at one of the last great night clubs, The Elmwood Casino in Windsor, Ontario.  We were part of a variety show&amp;nbsp;... three acts, dancing girls, and the entire cast took part in elaborate, choreographed stage productions&amp;nbsp;... As you might imagine, after-show parties were common.
:
:"At one of these parties I complained that nobody could understand my real name&amp;nbsp;... [and] pointed out that this was a definite liability in a profession that benefited from instant name recognition. Everyone started trying to come up with a new name for me. It was [comedian] [[Jackie Curtis]] who said he thought I looked like a Scottie dog. Phillips came up with Laura's middle name after Jackie's suggestion. I didn't like being called 'Scottie' so everybody agreed my new name could be ''''Scott McKenzie.'"'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottmckenzie.info/a-change-of-name.html |title=A Change of Name - Scott McKenzie |publisher=Scottmckenzie.info |date= |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:
In 1961 Phillips and McKenzie met [[Dick Weissman]] and formed the folk group, The Journeymen, at the height of the folk music craze. They recorded three [[album]]s and seven singles for [[Capitol Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstribune.info/newsnow/x1430693989/Remembering-the-folk-music-boom-of-hte-early-60s-some-famous-some-not-so-famous]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[The Beatles]] became popular in 1964, The Journeymen disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottmckenzie.info/the-sixties.html |title=Early Sixties - Scott McKenzie |publisher=Scottmckenzie.info |date= |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKenzie and Weissman became solo performers, while Phillips formed the group [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]] with [[Denny Doherty]], [[Cass Elliot]], and [[Michelle Phillips]] and moved to [[California]].

McKenzie originally declined an opportunity to join the group, saying in a 1977 interview, "I was trying to see if I could do something by myself. And I didn't think I could take that much pressure."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130124185726/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BII0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=154EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5635,2647154&amp;dq=scott-mckenzie+san+francisco&amp;hl=en] &lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he left New York and signed with [[Lou Adler]]'s Ode Records, one of whose most famous artists [[Carole King]] later became.

[[File:San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) Sheet Music (1967).jpg|thumb|right|San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair) (1967)]]

Phillips [[songwriter|wrote]] and co-produced "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]" for McKenzie. John Phillips played [[guitar]] on the [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and [[session musician]] Gary L Coleman played orchestra bells and chimes. The bass line of the song was supplied by [[session musician]] [[Joe Osborn]]. [[Hal Blaine]] played drums.

It was released on 13 May 1967 in the United States and was an instant hit, reaching number 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 2 in the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]] charts. It was also a [[chart-topper|number 1]] in the UK and several other countries, selling over seven million copies globally.&lt;ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"&gt;{{cite book

McKenzie followed the song with "Like An Old Time Movie," which Phillips also wrote, composed, and produced, but which was a minor hit (number 27 in Canada). His first album, ''The Voice of Scott McKenzie,'' was followed with an album called ''[[Stained Glass Morning]].'' He stopped recording in the early 1970s and lived in [[Joshua Tree, California]], and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]].

In his own right, McKenzie likewise wrote and composed the song "[[What About Me (Anne Murray song)|Hey! What About Me]]" that launched the career of Canadian singer [[Anne Murray]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hey! What About Me|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/hey!-what-about-me-mt0028285377|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Murray's United States breakthrough, with Gene McLellan's "Snowbird," would not follow for several years.)

In 1986, he started singing with a new version of The Mamas and the Papas. With [[Terry Melcher]], [[Mike Love]], and [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], he co-wrote "[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]" (1988), a number 1 single for [[The Beach Boys]].

By 1998, he had retired from the road version of The Mamas and the Papas, and resided in [[Los Angeles]], California, until his death.&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/08/20/francisco-one-hit-wonder-scott-mckenzie-dies-at-73/?intcmp=features | title='San Francisco' one-hit wonder Scott McKenzie dies at 73 | publisher=Fox News | date=August 20, 2012 | accessdate=August 20, 2012 | agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="noise2"/&gt; He appeared at the Los Angeles tribute concert for John Phillips in 2001, amongst other 1960s contemporary acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/29/entertainment/ca-44038 |title=Dear John - latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2002-10-27 |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheldon D. Fields''' Ph.D., RN, AACRN, FAANP, FNAP, FAAN [[Family Nurse Practitioner|FNP-BC]] (born January, 1970), is a [[Registered nurse|Registered Professional Nurse]] and [[Family Nurse Practitioner]] working in the field of behavioral health research specializing in the area of [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention.

== Early life and education ==
Fields was born in Brooklyn, New York, in January 1970, the youngest child of six children raised by a single mother. Fields attended public schools and lived in Brooklyn until the age of 17.  Sheldon attended [[Clara Barton High School]] for Health Professionals with the intention of going to medical school in the future. Instead, he discovered his love of nursing.  
At the age of 17, Sheldon began his college education at the [[State University of New York]] (now known as Binghamton University). Fields graduated in 1991 and started his first job as a nurse at the [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan Cancer Center]] in New York City. It was there that Fields first was exposed to the [[HIV/AIDS]] population. Working at Sloan Cancer Center, Fields also worked closely with [[Nurse practitioner|Nurse Practitioners]] and decided to return to school to receive his advanced degree in nursing. In 1993, Fields returned to [[Binghamton University]] to complete a master's in family nursing with certification as [[Family Nurse Practitioner]]. While studying for his master's degree, Fields researched intimate partner violence. His mentor, Dr. Theresa Grabo, encouraged him to pursue a Ph.D., and Fields went on to attend the [[University of Pennsylvania]], his mentor’s alma mater, graduating with a Ph.D. in Nursing Science in 2000.

== Professional life ==
Fields's specialty is behavioral health, in particular [[HIV prevention|HIV/AIDS prevention]]. He has produced contributions including scholarly articles, book chapters, seminars, webinars, newspaper articles, and television appearances. Many of his contributions focus on the young minority HIV/AIDS population.

Fields has conducted national-level research within the [[HIV Vaccine Trials Network]] (HVTN) and the [[HIV Prevention Trials Network]](HPTN). Along with these endeavors, Fields began his career as an assistant professor at Binghamton University from 2000 to 2001. While in Rochester, New York, in 2009, he was selected for the highly competitive and prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellowship, which allowed him to work in the office of United States Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]] (D-MD). Fields supported Senator Mikulski's work on the aging subcommittee of the Senate HELP committee during the height of the historic healthcare reform legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=2606 HIV Researcher Heads to Washington to Study Health Policy]. Sept 9, 2009. www.urmc.rochester.edu. Retrieved on 2012-11-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Fields was promoted to associate professor in the School of Nursing at the University of Rochester.

In late 2011, Fields became an associate professor at [[Florida International University]]'s Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences and served as the first-ever assistant dean of clinical affairs and health policy, as well as the co-director of the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program. Fields left Florida in January 2015 to be the dean of the Mervyn M. Dymally School of Nursing at [[Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science]] in Los Angeles, California. This appointment made Fields one of the youngest nursing deans in the country. Fields is also one of very few people of color (Afro-Latino) or men to have led a school of nursing. Fields left Drew in 2016, and in January 2017 he began work as dean of [[New York Institute of Technology]]'s School of Health Professions, where he oversees five allied health degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/667115/] "Sheldon Fields to Lead NYIT School of Health Professions," Newswise, 4 January 2017.

[[File:Bernet-Torpedo-frame.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Torpedo.]]
'''''Torpedo''''', or '''''Torpedo 1936''''', is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[comics]] series written by [[Enrique Sánchez Abulí]] and drawn by [[Jordi Bernet]], which depicts the adventures of the [[antagonist]]ic character Luca Torelli, a heartless [[hitman]], and his [[sidekick]] Rascal, in context of the violent [[organized crime]] culture of [[New York City]] during the [[Great Depression]] era.

==Publication history==
The series was originally developed by Abulí and veteran artist [[Alex Toth]], who drew the first two stories in 1981. The collaboration ended when Toth decided he did not share Abulí's darkly humorous view of mankind and frequent use of profanity, and withdrew from the project.&lt;ref name="Toth orbituary"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gravett | first = Paul | title = Alex Toth | publisher =The Guardian  | date =June 23, 2006 | url =http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/obituary/0,,1804106,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then replaced by Jordi Bernet, whose gritty, if [[Aestheticization of violence|stylized]], artistic style was well suited for the dark and violent subject matter.

''Torpedo 1936'' was first published in issue 32 of the Spanish horror comics magazine ''Creepy'' in February, 1982.&lt;ref name="Tebeosfera-30-39"&gt;{{cite web| last =Tebeosfera | title =Creepy, primera época, 30 a 39 | url =http://www.tebeosfera.com/Obra/Tebeo/Toutain/Creepy/30a39.htm|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two issues featured Toth's artwork, and starting issue 34, with the story ''De perro a perro'', Bernet was responsible for the drawings. ''Torpedo'' went on to be featured in several Spanish comics magazines, such as ''Thriller'', ''Comix International'', ''Totem el comix'', ''Co &amp; Co'' and ''Viñetas'', and albums were published, translated into several languages.&lt;ref name="fandecomix"&gt;{{cite web | last = fandecomix.com | title = Torpedo | url = http://www.fandecomix.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=27 | language = es | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928163832/http://www.fandecomix.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42&amp;Itemid=27 | archivedate = 2007-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The public response to the series became substantial, and it was awarded with the 1986 [[Angoulême International Comics Festival|Angoulême]] [[Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Comic Book#1980s|Best Foreign Album Award]].&lt;ref name="Angoulême awards"&gt;{{cite web | last =readyourselfraw.com | title = Angoulême Awards list | url =http://www.readyourselfraw.com/recommended/awards_angouleme/angouleme_old/awards_angouleme_old.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, a dedicated magazine named ''Luca Torelli es Torpedo'' started publication in May, 1991.&lt;ref name="lambiek-bernet"&gt;{{cite web | last =Lambiek Comiclopedia | title = Jordi Bernet| url =http://lambiek.net/artists/b/bernet.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==
Luca Torelli is born in Sicily circa 1903, to a poor, broken home marked by spousal abuse. His parents are presumed to be Vittorio Torelli and Luciana Petrosino, although his older brother's real father was actually their grandfather (who raped his own daughter) and it is implied that Luca's own biological father was the local ''mafioso'' kingpin, who raped Luciana in exchange for mediating peacefully in the feud between the Torellis and the Petrosinos. Luca loses his older brother to a severe beating by their drunken father, orchestrates a vengeance against the latter by using a vindictive neighbour as an unwitting agent, and finally witnesses their mother dying of sorrow upon her son's and husband's consecutive deaths, thereupon being fostered by his uncle Vincenzo. Despite the fact that he engineered his father's death at the hands of their neighbour, the ancestral institution of [[Feud|vendetta]] prevails and Luca kills him with his uncle's aid; this is implied to be his first direct murder. He is then forced to flee for America as a teenager where he works as a shoe shiner, thereby meeting an abusive senior police officer named MacDonald whom he finally shoots, being involved in other law infringements, such as bank robberies, which also happen to end in murders, and soon becoming a [[hit man]] ("torpedo" is 1920s slang for a contract killer). Some time later, he gets a [[Polish American]] sidekick called Rascal.

From here onwards it is difficult to maintain a linear narrative since no dates are given (aside from incidental details such as the [[Volstead Act]], the outburst of the [[Spanish civil war]] and, later in the series, the [[Cuban revolution]]). Apart from Rascal and characters in flashback stories, there are few recurring characters and few dates are given for his present day stories. The only significant recurring character is a woman called Susan who consistently outwits Torelli. She appears in the first story by Bernet (''De perro a perro''), a second one still early on (''La dama de los camelos''), and one of the latest (''El día de la mala baba''). At least thirteen years are said to have passed between her second and third appearance; she is assumed to be a high-profile prostitute in the first two (whose services had been solicited by Torelli himself in the past), and a "reformed", recently widowed housewife and mother, who had presumably "fucked her [old and rich] husband to death", as Torelli puts it, in the third.

'''Trevis Smith''' (born September 8, 1976) is a former [[Canadian football|football]] [[linebacker]] who played seven years with the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]]. Born in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Smith was formerly a [[linebacker]] for the [[University of Alabama]].

On October 28, 2005, he was charged with [[aggravated sexual assault]] in [[Surrey, BC]] for knowingly exposing women to the [[HIV]] virus by having unprotected sex with them and not revealing his condition. Constable Marc Searle of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] named a complainant called simply "A. O." who claimed that Smith had assaulted her between November 26, 2003, and May 18, 2005. After appearing in court in Surrey, he was freed on a C$10,000 bail after pleading "not guilty".  On November 18, Smith was charged with the same offence in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] after another woman came forward alleging that Smith did not tell her that he was HIV positive before they had unprotected sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/sports/football/story.html?id=7d232d78-0300-4940-9065-222d0c49440f&amp;p=1 |title=Sports |publisher=Canada.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109021416/http://www.canada.com/sports/football/story.html?id=7d232d78-0300-4940-9065-222d0c49440f&amp;p=1 |archivedate=2015-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith was found guilty of two counts of aggravated sexual assault—one for each woman—and bail violations on February 8, 2007 and sentenced to 5½ years in jail on February 26, 2007; he unsuccessfully appealed the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leader |first=Regina |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/sports/story.html?id=a16dafb4-37ca-4cf1-bfd9-56b11658ec2b |title=Smith sentenced to six years |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2015-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192052/http://www.canada.com/topics/sports/story.html?id=a16dafb4-37ca-4cf1-bfd9-56b11658ec2b |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was released from prison on February 25, 2009 and was [[deported]] to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/more/01/15/cfl.player.hiv.parole.ap/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414192301/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/more/01/15/cfl.player.hiv.parole.ap/index.html |date=April 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 18, 2012, it was reported that Smith was dismissed from his position as a high school football coach in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], after the [[George Washington Carver High School (Birmingham, Alabama)|George Washington Carver High School]] learned of his conviction for aggravated sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Roughrider Trevis Smith fired from high school coaching job: Report|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/former-roughrider-trevis-smith-fired-from-high-school-coaching-job-report/article4488076/|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=18 August 2012|agency=[[Canadian Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trevor Philips''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', a video game in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] made by [[Rockstar Games]]. He appears as one of the three main protagonists, alongside [[Michael De Santa (Grand Theft Auto V)|Michael De Santa]] and [[Franklin Clinton (Grand Theft Auto V)|Franklin Clinton]]. He is played by actor [[Steven Ogg]], who provided the [[voice acting|voice]] and [[motion capture]] for the character.

Rockstar based Trevor's appearance on Ogg's physical appearance, while his personality was inspired by [[Charles Bronson (prisoner)|Charles Bronson]]. ''Grand Theft Auto V'' co-writer [[Dan Houser]] described Trevor as purely driven by desire and resentment. To make players care for the character, the designers gave the character more emotions. Trevor is shown to truly care about people very close to him, despite his antisocial behavior and psychotic derangement.

Trevor is considered one of the most controversial characters in video game history. The general attention given to Trevor by critics and gamers was mostly very positive, although some reviewers felt that his violent personality and actions negatively affected the game's narrative. His design and personality have drawn comparisons to other influential video game and film characters.  Many reviewers have called Trevor a likeable and believable character, and felt that he is one of the few protagonists in the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series that would willingly execute popular player actions, such as murder and violence.

==Character design==
[[Image:Steven Ogg.png|thumb|upright|[[Steven Ogg]] portrayed Trevor in ''Grand Theft Auto V''. His performance was mostly recorded using [[motion capture]] technology.]]

''Grand Theft Auto V'' co-writer [[Dan Houser]] explained that Trevor "appeared to [Rockstar] pretty much out of nowhere as the embodiment of another side of criminality [...] If Michael was meant to be the idea of some version of criminal control [...] what about the guy who didn't do that?"&lt;ref name="Game Informer Digital Issue 236"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bertz |first=Matt |title=Go Big Or Go Home |publisher=United States: [[GameStop]] |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=236 |date=December 2012 |pages=72–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described Trevor as "the person who's driven purely by desire, resentment, no thought for tomorrow whatsoever, completely [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] rather than [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]-driven." He stated that Trevor "kills without remorse, like a true psychopath, but very sentimental for the right reasons when it suits him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/articles/2012/11/13/grand-theft-auto-v-meet-the-cast |title=Grand Theft Auto 5: Meet The Cast |last1=Simmons |first1=Alex |last2=Miller |first2=Greg |last3=Lynch |first3=Casey |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockstar drew upon game protagonist archetypes during the scripting the characters; Trevor was considered to embody insanity. Houser said the team characterised Michael and Trevor as juxtapositions of each other. He said, "Michael is like the criminal who wants to compartmentalise and be a good guy some of the time and Trevor is the maniac who isn't a hypocrite". He said that having three lead characters would help move the game's plot into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising through the ranks of a criminal underworld.&lt;ref name="Dan Houser Famitsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3643990/gta-5-writer-explains-the-decision-to-develop-for-current-gen-consoles |title=GTA 5 writer explains the decision to develop for current gen consoles |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=14 November 2012 |first=Kevin |last=Gifford |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Grand Theft Auto V'', [[Steven Ogg]] portrayed Trevor. During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed an on-set chemistry between him and Ned Luke (who portrayed Michael), which he felt helped secure them the roles.&lt;ref name="Up At Noon trevor"&gt;{{cite web |title=GTA 5: How Trevor became Trevor, how you can play games with athletes - Up At Noon |url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2013/10/14/gta-5-how-trevor-became-trevor-up-at-noon |last=Miller |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Miller (Internet celebrity) |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogg said, "When [Luke] and I went in the room together we immediately had something".&lt;ref name="Ogg Interview"&gt;{{cite web |title=An Interview With Steven Ogg, The Voice Of "GTA V's" Trevor |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/an-interview-with-steven-ogg-the-voice-of-gta-vs-trevor |last=Bernstein |first=Joseph |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |date=30 September 2013 |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games, it was when they signed contracts that they learned they would be involved in a ''Grand Theft Auto'' title.&lt;ref name="USAT Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2013/10/09/grand-theft-auto-v-actors/2938165/ |title=Interview: Crime pays for 'Grand Theft Auto V' actors |work=[[USA Today]] |date=9 October 2013 |last=Molina |first=Brett |accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogg felt Trevor's characterisation had evolved over time. He said, "Nuances and character traits that began to appear{{mdash}}his walk, his manner of speech, his reactions, definitely informed his development throughout the game".&lt;ref name="Ogg Interview"/&gt;

The actors began working on the game in 2010.&lt;ref name="USAT Interview"/&gt; Their performances were mostly recorded using [[motion capture]] technology.&lt;ref name="Inside GTA V Creative"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/sep/13/grand-theft-auto-5-dan-houser |title=Grand Theft Auto 5 – inside the creative process with Dan Houser |last=Stuart |first=Keith |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=13 September 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they considered their performances were no different from those of film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted so that it did not allow the actors to [[Ad libitum#Drama|ad-lib]]; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors.&lt;ref name="TSA Ogg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/12/17/gta-vs-trevor-talks-to-tsa-an-exclusive-interview-with-steven-ogg/ |title=GTA V's Trevor Talks To TSA: An Exclusive Interview With Steven Ogg |work=The Sixth Axis |date=17 December 2013 |author=Tuffclub |accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
&lt;!-- This is a fictional character who is not entirely meant to be realistic, so no need to "correct" labels to fit reality. --&gt;
Trevor is depicted as a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] in ''Grand Theft Auto V''. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. He appears to be very insecure about having grown up in [[Canada]], and takes offence to people mocking his accent.&lt;ref name="Rampages"/&gt; Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems to care about people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother,&lt;ref name="Mrs. Philips"/&gt; [[List of Grand Theft Auto V characters#Ashley Butler|Ashley Butler]],&lt;ref name="Mr. Philips"/&gt; Patricia Madrazo,&lt;ref name="Monkey Business"/&gt; Maude,&lt;ref name="Bail Bonds"/&gt; [[List of Grand Theft Auto V characters#Michael De Santa|Michael De Santa]] and his children [[List of Grand Theft Auto V characters#Tracey De Santa|Tracey]]&lt;ref name="Fame or Shame"/&gt; and [[List of Grand Theft Auto V characters#Jimmy De Santa|Jimmy]], [[List of Grand Theft Auto V characters#Lamar Davis|Lamar Davis]], Ron, Lester, Wade and [[List of Grand Theft Auto V characters#Franklin Clinton|Franklin Clinton]]. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to [[insanity defense|plead insanity]] if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his silence on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.

When portraying Trevor, Ogg cites [[Tom Hardy]]'s depiction of English criminal [[Charles Salvador|Charles Bronson]] in the 2008 [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]'' as a strong stylistic influence on his portrayal of Trevor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://o.canada.com/technology/gaming/gta-v-unedited-and-uncensored-interview-with-steven-ogg-the-man-behind-trevor-philips |title=GTA V: unedited and uncensored Interview with Steven Ogg, the man behind Trevor Philips |last=Borkowski |first=Andy |date=22 October 2013 |publisher=O Canada |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogg reflected that while Trevor embodies the violent, psychopathic ''Grand Theft Auto'' anti-hero archetype, he wanted players to sympathise with Trevor's story. "To elicit other emotions was tough, and it was the biggest challenge and it's something that meant a lot to me," Ogg said.&lt;ref name="USAT Interview"/&gt;

===''Grand Theft Auto V''===
{{main|Grand Theft Auto V}}

Trevor is Canadian, born just north of the border of the United States. He grew up with a physically abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother.&lt;ref name="Mrs. Philips"/&gt; Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10. This upbringing combined with Trevor's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged, leading to numerous fights at school, including an assault on a teacher. Trevor loved planes, and at some point entered the military as a pilot,&lt;ref name="PS-blog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/28/grand-theft-auto-v-what-we-know/ |title=Grand Theft Auto V: What We Know |last=Shuman |first=Sid |publisher=[[PlayStation Blog]] |date=28 June 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Destructoid" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/grand-theft-auto-v-everything-is-bigger-and-better-252852.phtml |title=Grand Theft Auto V: Everything is bigger and better |last=Aziz |first=Hamza |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=2 May 2013 |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation.&lt;ref name="Friends Reunited"/&gt; Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that landed him in jail for six months (however, due to good behavior, he was out in four).&lt;ref name="The Paleto Score"/&gt; He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor eventually met [[List of Grand Theft Auto V characters#Michael De Santa|Michael Townley]] and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large [[Bank robbery|heists]], and both men became successful in doing so. However, their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her.&lt;ref name="Friends Reunited"/&gt;

During one of their heists with their mutual accomplice Brad Snider, Michael and Brad are shot by police while Trevor escapes, and he believes Michael died and Brad was sent to jail.&lt;ref name="Prologue"/&gt; Trevor eventually settles in Sandy Shores, Blaine County, where he establishes a small criminal enterprise{{efn|Throughout the game's dialog, the organization is inconsistently called "Trevor Philips Industries", "Trevor Philips Enterprise", and "Trevor Philips Corporation".&lt;ref name="Mr. Philips"/&gt;}} that smuggles weapons and manufactures [[methamphetamine]], which he hopes will grow into a large empire. Due to raging [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], Trevor surrounds himself with two loyal friends that he kidnapped and brainwashed from their previous lives&lt;ref name="Hang Ten"/&gt; named "Nervous" Ron Jakowski and Wade Hebert. Trevor also enters an uneasy truce with his competitors in Sandy Shores, including The Lost Motorcycle Club led by [[Johnny Klebitz]],&lt;ref name="Mr. Philips"/&gt; the Varrios Los Aztecas gang,&lt;ref name="Trevor Philips Industries"/&gt; and the O'Neil Brothers.&lt;ref name="Crystal Maze"/&gt;

Nine years after the fateful heist, Trevor finds out that Michael faked his death, and is so spooked and enraged that he breaks the truce and kills most of his competition in one burst of violence, a deadly streak that continues when a potential game-changing deal with the Triads falls through.&lt;ref name="Crystal Maze"/&gt; He drives to Los Santos, taking over the apartment and ruining the life of Wade's cousin Floyd, and reunites with Michael, who now took on the name "De Santa". After Michael introduces Trevor to Franklin Clinton, the two perform heists again, this time including Franklin.&lt;ref name="The Merryweather Heist" /&gt; Trevor is determined to rob anything guarded by Merryweather Security Consulting, a private security firm that he dislikes,&lt;ref name="Scouting the Port"/&gt; but he often fails. After not getting paid for a job, Trevor kidnaps Patricia, the wife of kingpin Martin Madrazo.&lt;ref name="Caida Libre"/&gt; Due to her kind maternal nature and his own abandonment issues, Trevor falls in love with her and only returns her after much demanding from Michael.&lt;ref name="Derailed"/&gt; However, the two stay in contact until the end of the game.&lt;ref name="GTA V"/&gt;

Trevor eventually discovers that Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad is not in jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist.&lt;ref name="Bury the Hatchet"/&gt; When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael.&lt;ref name="The Big Score"/&gt; Near the end of the game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that he hates, which Michael accepts.&lt;ref name="The Third Way" /&gt; If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Grand Theft Auto V |developer=[[Rockstar North]] |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=17 September 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] |version=1.0 |level=Something Sensible}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him.&lt;ref name="Something Sensible"/&gt; If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.&lt;ref name="GTA V"/&gt;

Trevor appears as a main character in ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'', the online multiplayer mode of ''Grand Theft Auto V''. He provides missions to the player character once they reach Rank 13; after the player steals Trevor's [[rolling meth lab]],&lt;ref name="Meth'd Up"/&gt; Trevor demands that they are to complete jobs for him to settle the issue.&lt;ref name="TP Industries"/&gt; The jobs that Trevor demands generally consist of stealing drugs from rival groups, specifically the Lost Motorcycle Club, while killing the dealers.&lt;ref name="Lost My Mind"/&gt; The narrative of ''Grand Theft Auto Online'' is set several months prior to the events of the single-player story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/51487/gta-online-details-game-day-access-info-and-more.html |title=GTA Online Details: Game Day Access Info and More |author=R* Q |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=30 September 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
===Reception===
Trevor's character was met with generally positive feedback following the release of ''Grand Theft Auto V''. ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' singled out Trevor as the stand-out of the three protagonists, which they owed to his volatile personality.&lt;ref name="Edge Review"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edge Staff |title=Play: Economies of scale |publisher=[[Future plc]] |journal=''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' |issue=259 |date=November 2013 |pages=85–88 |url=http://www.edge-online.com/review/grand-theft-auto-v-review/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Edge'', Caroline Petit of ''[[GameSpot]]'' considered Trevor "a truly horrible, terrifying, psychotic human being—and a terrific character."&lt;ref name="Gamespot Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/ |title=Grand Theft Auto V Review: City of Angels and Demons |last=Petit |first=Carolyn |date=16 September 2013 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Eurogamer]]'''s Tom Bramwell, however, felt that Trevor undermined the other characters because he was a "shallow and unconvincing" sensationalised anti-hero, and that "his antics derail[ed] the narrative" and overshadowed the character development of Michael and Franklin.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-09-16-grand-theft-auto-5-review |title=Grand Theft Auto 5 review |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=16 September 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xav de Matos of ''[[Joystiq]]'' found all three characters unlikable to the extent that they had an alienating effect on the story, noting that "though each character has a valid motivation for his journey, it's difficult to want them to succeed." He also felt that the ambivalence between Trevor and Michael was a tired device by the conclusion of the story as it became a "seemingly endless cycle" of conflict between them.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer Review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joystiq Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-5-review/ |title=Grand Theft Auto 5 review: How to take it in America |last=de Matos |first=Xav |date=16 September 2013 |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas Sullivan of ''[[GamesRadar]]'' praised Trevor for being the first character in the series that "makes sense". He stated that, upon their first playthrough of a ''Grand Theft Auto'' game, most players "carjacked some poor schlub, then started doing 90mph on the sidewalk, mowing over civilians", as opposed to playing peacefully. "Trevor's existence isn't a commentary on any group of people–he's just the first logical fit to the way people have been playing ''GTA'' games for the past decade," he said. Sullivan concluded that Trevor is one of the few protagonists in ''Grand Theft Auto'' that would willingly execute popular player actions, such as murder and violence.&lt;ref name="trevor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/trevor-first-gta-character-makes-sense/ |title=Trevor is the first GTA character that makes sense |last=Sullivan |first=Lucas |publisher=[[GamesRadar]] |date=27 September 2014 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor has been compared to many other characters in video games and films. Calvin Khan of [[IGN]] compared Trevor to [[Heath Ledger]]'s [[Joker (The Dark Knight)|Joker]] in the 2008 film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. Khan felt that Trevor is the only character in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' not trying to fake his persona, stating "Trevor absolutely knows that he's a monster but just doesn't care. He enjoys causing misery and harm, lives for it and embraces it and – much like Heath Ledger's Joker – he exists purely for unadulterated anarchy." He also felt that Trevor's only reasoning for hurting people and messing everything up around him is simply because it's just too much fun not to. Khan concluded saying that it's clear that the world through the eyes of Trevor is already royally broken and he sees no harm in messing it up some more, hence the reason for Trevor's actions.&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ap.ign.com/en/grand-theft-auto-v-ps3/65490/news/trevor-philips-gta-5s-most-sentimental-psychopath |title=TREVOR PHILIPS: GTA 5'S MOST SENTIMENTAL PSYCHOPATH |last=Khan |first=Calvin |date=28 October 2013 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
{{Main|Controversies surrounding Grand Theft Auto V#Depiction of torture|l1=Controversies surrounding Grand Theft Auto V}}

The mission "By the Book" from ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was criticised for its depiction of [[torture]]. In the mission, Trevor interrogates a man named Ferdinand Kerimov (called Mr. K) for information about a suspected [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] fugitive who poses a threat to the FIB (the game's version of the [[FBI]]). Trevor uses torture equipment on the restrained man, which players select from a table. Once Mr. K provides the FIB with the information, Trevor is asked to kill him, but instead drives him to the airport, providing him an opportunity to escape. While driving Kerimov, Trevor monologues about the ineffectiveness of torture, pointing out Kerimov's readiness to supply the FIB with the information without being tortured, and expressing that torture is used as a power play "to assert ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Grand Theft Auto V |developer=[[Rockstar North]] |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=17 September 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] |version=1.0 |level=By the Book |quote="'''Trevor''': The media and the government would have us believe that torture is some necessary thing. We need it to get information, to assert ourselves. Did we get any information out of you? / '''Kerimov''': I would have told you everything. / '''Trevor''': Exactly. Torture's for the torturer.

Reviewers echoed that while the mission served as political commentary on [[Torture and the United States|the use of torture by the United States government]], its use of torture was in poor taste. GameSpot's Petit felt that placing the torture scene in context with the monologue created a hypocrisy in the mission's function as a commentary device,&lt;ref name="Gamespot Review"/&gt; and IGN's MacDonald felt it "pushed the boundaries of taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-review |title=Grand Theft Auto V Review |last=MacDonald |first=Keza |date=16 September 2013 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial, Bramwell discussed whether the political commentary was overshadowed by the violent content, comparing the mission to ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''{{'}}s  "[[Controversies surrounding Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2#"No Russian"|No Russian]]" controversy. He considered the sequence lacking enough context to justify its violence and summarised its function as "flawed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-09-16-is-the-most-disturbing-scene-in-gta5-justified |title=Is the most disturbing scene in GTA5 justified? |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=22 September 2013 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Keith Vaz]] expressed concern that underage players could be exposed to the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/grand-theft-auto-5-under-fire-for-graphic-torture-scene |title=Grand Theft Auto 5 under fire for graphic torture scene |last=Hern |first=Alex |date=19 September 2013 |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |location=London |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Best of [[Freedom from Torture]] said the torturer role-play "crossed a line".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/18/grand-theft-auto-5-under-fire-for-graphic-torture-scene |title=Grand Theft Auto 5 under fire for graphic torture scene |last=Hern |first=Alex |date=19 September 2013 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Chick defended the torture sequence, and wrote that unlike the "No Russian" mission or the 2012 film ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', the underlying political commentary on torture in "By the Book" necessitated the violent content.&lt;ref name="Tom Chick GTA V"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/09/21/grand-theft-auto-v-relevant-story-torture-since-zero-dark-thirty/ |title=Is Grand Theft Auto V the most relevant story about torture since Zero Dark Thirty? |authorlink=Tom Chick |last=Chick |first=Tom |date=21 September 2013 |publisher=Quarter to Three |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Tranter''' (1816 &amp;ndash; January 7, 1890) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] gunmaker and gun designer famous for inventing the [[Tranter Revolver]].

==His youth and early career==
Born in [[Oldbury, West Midlands|Oldbury]] in [[Worcestershire]], William Tranter was the eldest son of a [[blacksmith]]. Birmingham was for many years the centre of arms manufacture in [[England]] and in 1830, at the age of 14, Tranter was apprenticed to the gunsmithing firm of Hollis Bros &amp; Company. In 1839 a small legacy allowed him to buy out another Birmingham gunsmith.

Tranter went into partnership with his former employers, John and Isaac Hollis, in 1844. The partnership dissolved five years later, and Tranter is known to have had an extensive manufactory, together with sales offices, at 50 Loveday Street between 1854 and 1860.

==Modifications and alterations on revolvers==
By about the year 1853 Tranter had manufactured over 8000 [[Robert Adams of London|Adams]] [[trigger (firearms)|double-action]] revolvers under licence. Together with James Kerr, Tranter developed modifications to the Adams action and about 1853 he made the first of his double trigger, double-action revolvers. The first model was built on an Adams frame and featured a detachable rammer which fitted onto the frame.  His next model featured a rammer secured by a keyed peg on the frame and a hook on the barrel. In 1855 he also manufactured his own version of the [[Beaumont–Adams revolver]], known as the [[Tranter-Adams-Kerr]]. 

After 1856 he began production of his third model double trigger revolver, with a more streamlined frame and screw-secured rammer. At the same time he developed his fourth model, a single trigger, double-action revolver based on the same frame.

At the time the size of revolvers was typically described by the bore instead of the term  calibre which is used today. The bore size equates to the number of lead balls of a particular diameter that can be cast from one pound (454 g) of lead. Tranter's most common bores were:
{| class="wikitable"
! Bore!!Calibre (in)!! Calibre (mm)
|-
| 120 || 0.320 || 9.13 
|-
| 80|| 0.380 || 9.65
|-
| 54|| 0.442|| 11.2
|-
| 38|| 0.500|| 12.7
|-
| 24|| 0.577|| 14.7
|-
|}

==The use of his guns in the U.S.==
With the onset of the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] States began buying British arms in quantity and Tranter's high-quality weapons were much esteemed.  The New Orleans importers Messrs Hyde &amp; Goodrich and [[A. B. Griswold &amp; Co]] (who later manufactured his own pistols) distributed Tranters. Tranter also produced percussion rifles that used a revolver cylinder instead of a magazine.  These rifles were produced in various configurations including both single and double trigger mechanisms.

Two Tranters were carried by the famous detective [[Allan Pinkerton]], whose detective [[Pinkerton Agency|agency]] protected U.S. officials prior to the creation of the [[U.S. Secret Service]].  He is said to have armed his men with Tranter double trigger revolvers. An engraved and [[nickel]]-plated Tranter model 1879, marked "Made for W.A. Pinkerton by Thos M. Tranter. 16 Weaman St., Birmingham" is thought to have been presented to [[William Pinkerton|William A. Pinkerton]], one of Allan’s sons.

==His increasing success==
Tranter continued to produce percussion revolvers well after the introduction of cartridge revolvers since many shooters were more comfortable with the old system, which was also cheaper. However, in 1863 Tranter secured patents for revolvers using the [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] system, some of the first in Britain. Tranter's rim-fire revolvers ranged from small caliber single- and double-action revolvers to the large solid frame model 1863 revolver in .442 in (11.2&amp;nbsp;mm) caliber.  Tranter began manufacturing [[Centerfire ammunition|center fire]] revolvers in 1868.

In late 1867 Tranter constructed a new, larger facility on Lichfield Road in [[Aston#Aston Cross|Aston Cross]], called "The Tranter Gun and Pistol Factory", although business continued to be conducted at the old location for some time.  At that time Tranter's was the most extensive pistol-making business in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]].  Tranter produced over 20 different pistols of his own design, together with other designers' guns under contract. He had government contracts for the official British [[Snider Rifle]], and in 1878 was granted a government contract for a solid frame .450 centre fire revolver for use by the [[British army]]. He supplied weapons of every kind to the gun trade in general, including overseas markets. 

Between 1849 and 1888 Tranter made 24 [[patent]] applications. Nineteen of those were for cartridge weapons including [[bolt-action]] rifles and [[machine gun]]s, as well as his famous revolvers. "Tranter was certainly in the very forefront of rook rifle development and production."&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, Colin. ''The Classic British Rook &amp; Rabbit Rifle'', 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-86126-880-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Tranter was a substantial property owner and a founding member of the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] Ltd., of which he was a director in its early years. As a prominent member of the Birmingham small arms trade he was called as a witness before a parliamentary committee on small arms in 1854.

==The end of his life, and his legacy==
Tranter retired in 1885 and died on January 7, 1890.  His factory was leased by his friend George Kynoch and was renamed [[The Kynoch Gun Factory]]. In 1888 the name was changed to the [[Aston Arms Factory]], which had ceased by 1900 when the factory was occupied by the Clipper Automatic Tyre Co. The factory was ultimately demolished in 1961. 

William Tranter's own son, William Grosvener Tranter, registered at least two firearms patents but appears to have been only slightly interested in the gun industry. However William's son-in-law, Thomas William Watson, was joined his by brother in 1884 to form the arms company of Watson Brothers.  William's nephews, Walter Tranter and Alfred William Thompson and Thomas Musgrove Tranter formed an arms firm called [[Tranter Bros. Gunmakers]] in Birmingham in 1900. The firm, which also sold [[bicycle]]s in the 1890s, closed in 1957.

==Biography==

Kim was born in 1936 in Moscow to Kim Chersan (1904–1938), a journalist of [[Koreans in Russia|Korean]] descent, and Nina Valentinovna Vsesvyatskaya (1907-1974), a teacher of [[Russian language]] and literature who came from a [[Russians|Russian]] family of doctors.&lt;ref name="booknik" /&gt;&lt;ref name='sakh'&gt;[https://www.sakharov-center.ru/asfcd/auth/?t=author&amp;i=1147 Vsesvyatskaya Nina Valentininovna] biography at the [[Sakharov Center]] website (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='lekh'&gt;[https://lechaim.ru/ARHIV/158/kim.htm Yuliy Kim: Following the Life Pass] interview in the [[:ru:Лехаим (журнал)|Lekhaim]] magazine, June 2005 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather Vasiliy Vsesvyatskiy was a [[protoiereus]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in the [[Zhukovsky District, Kaluga Oblast|Ugodsko-Zavodsky Uezd]] of the [[Kaluga Governorate]] who baptized [[Georgy Zhukov]].&lt;ref name='lekh' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravmir.ru/yulij-kim-kazhdyj-raz-ya-shel-zashhishhat-nashix-detej/ Yuliy Kim: Every time I went to protect our children] interview at [[:ru:Православие и мир|Pravoslavie and World]], 26 February 2014 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parents of Kim were victims of the [[Great Purge]] of 1937 and 1938, in which his father was executed and his mother was sentenced as a "[[Traitor of Motherland Family Member|family member of a traitor of the Motherland]]" to five years in a [[labor camp]] and three years of [[exile]], so that Kim didn't see her until age 9.&lt;ref name='sakh' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://2003.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2003/95n/n95n-s20.shtml Yuliy Kim, a happy son of Gulag], [[Novaya Gazeta]]&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[rehabilitate (Soviet)|rehabilitate]]d during the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] period in 1958, but before that, she was under the  "[[101st kilometer]]" law and could not live in Moscow, so Kim's family settled in [[Maloyaroslavets]], [[Kaluga Oblast]]. In 1951, the family moved to [[Turkmenistan]]. Kim returned to Moscow in 1954 to enter the [[Moscow State Pedagogical Institute]].

In 1959, Kim graduated from the Department of History and Philology of [[Moscow State Pedagogical University]]. During his student years, he began writing poems and setting some of them to music.  Upon graduation, he was sent to teach in the village of [[Il'pyrsky]], [[Kamchatka Oblast|Kamchatka]], near [[Anapka]], where he taught for three years.  He taught history, [[literature]], [[geography]], and other subjects, and also directed a number of [[musical theater|musical]] plays with the schoolchildren.  Since then, the sea has become one of the main themes of his songs.

In 1969, he signed An Appeal to The UN Committee for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yakobson, Anatoly |author2=Yakir, Pyotr |author3=Khodorovich, Tatyana |author4=Podyapolskiy, Gregory |author5=Maltsev, Yuri |title=An Appeal to The UN Committee for Human Rights|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=21 August 1969|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1969/aug/21/an-appeal-to-the-un-committee-for-human-rights/|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to [[Moscow]], Kim worked as a school teacher, and at the same time participated in the [[Soviet dissident]] movement, which cost him his job in 1968.  Subsequently, Kim earned a living by writing songs for plays and movies as well as publishing plays under the [[pseudonym]] Yu. Mikhailov, which he used until 1986.  At the same time, while he was barred from giving concerts, he continued his singing underground.

With the advent of [[glasnost]], Kim was finally able to perform legally.  Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, he has been acclaimed throughout the [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking world and has performed in numerous locations in Russia, Europe, and the United States.  He has received numerous awards, such as the [[Bulat Okudzhava]] Prize of the Russian Federation.

Today, Yuliy Kim's discography includes over 20 titles on CD, audio and video tape, and DVD. His songs have been included in almost all anthologies of author’s song as well as many anthologies of modern Russian poetry.

His first wife was Irina Yakir — granddaughter of [[Red Army]] commander [[Iona Yakir]]. They married in 1966, and in 1998 they immigrated to Israel. After Irina's death in 1999, Kim married Lidia Lugovaya, Irina's close friend since school days.&lt;ref name="booknik"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1tv.ru/prj/pokavsedoma/vypusk/468 While Everyone's at Home] // [[Channel One Russia]], 21 December 2008 (interview at Kim's apartment)&lt;/ref&gt; He currently splits his time between Jerusalem and Moscow.
