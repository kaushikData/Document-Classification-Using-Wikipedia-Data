{{not to be confused|fire base}}
In [[military terminology]], a '''base of fire''' is a supporting force that provides [[overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]] and [[covering fire]] to other advancing units while they are executing [[fire and movement]] tactics. A base of fire can be a [[platoon]] during company fire and movement, by individual [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s (esp. [[tank]]s) or infantry [[Section (military unit)|sections]], in platoon fire and movement, or even by [[fireteam]]s or individual soldiers, in the final stages of an assault.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The term "'''Behind Closed Doors'''" is used in several sports, primarily [[association football]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.si.com/sports-illustrated/photos/2015/04/29/behind-closed-doors | title=Behind Closed Doors | publisher=www.si.com | accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe matches played where spectators are not allowed in the stadium to watch. The reasons for this may include punishment for a team found guilty of a certain act in the past, stadium safety issues or to prevent potentially dangerous clashes between rival supporters. It is predicated by articles 7, 12 and 24 of [[FIFA]]'s disciplinary code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.fifa.com/mm/Document/AFFederation/Administration/50/02/75/DisCoInhalte.pdf FIFA Disciplinary Code 2011 edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup==

Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] in Belgium the previous April, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] were forced to begin their defence of the European Cup at an empty [[Villa Park]] in September 1982, with the match kicking off at 2.30 pm on a Wednesday afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;"Ipswich assignment no Roman holiday" by Peter Ball, ''[[The Times]]'' page 22, 15 September 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007 Italian football==
As a result of a policeman being killed during [[2007 Catania football violence|rioting]] at a [[Serie A]] match between [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] and [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]] on 2 February, the [[Italian Football Federation]] suspended all Italian matches indefinitely. Subsequently, matches resumed but many clubs were ordered to play their games behind closed doors until their stadiums met with updated security regulations.

==2009 Italian football==
[[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were ordered to play a home game behind closed doors after their fans had [[racial abuse|racially abused]] [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] striker [[Mario Balotelli]] during a 1-1 [[Serie A]] draw in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juve punished over racial abuse|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8008928.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 October 2011|date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009–10 UEFA Europa League==
[[FC Dinamo Bucureşti]] had to play two home games in European competitions behind closed doors after their match against [[FC Slovan Liberec]] on 25 August 2009 was abandoned in the 88th minute due to a pitch invasion by Dinamo fans.

==2009 Mexico Clausura==
During the penultimate round of league games all teams had to play with closed doors due to the [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|H1N1]] [[2009 flu pandemic|swine flu outbreak]] in infected cities. Several games taking place in areas which were badly affected by the outbreak were also played behind closed doors the following week. Games behind closed doors have been played regularly as a penalty for bad behavior of fans in Mexico, most recently an [[2015–16 Liga MX season|Apertura 2015]] game in which [[Atlas (football)|Atlas]] hosted [[Querétaro F.C.|Querétaro]] at [[Estadio Jalisco]] because of last season quarterfinal game in which Atlas fans invaded the pitch against their hated rivals [[Guadalajara Chivas|Guadalajara]].

==2010–11 Heineken Cup==
In [[rugby union]], the [[2010–11 Heineken Cup]] [[2010–11 Heineken Cup pool stage#Pool 1|pool stage]] match between [[Edinburgh Rugby|Edinburgh]] and [[Castres Olympique|Castres]] at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] was played behind closed doors on 20 December 2010. The match was originally scheduled for 19 December, but was postponed due to heavy snow in [[Edinburgh]] that covered the pitch and created major access issues for potential spectators. The competition organiser, [[European Rugby Cup]], decided to hold the rescheduled match behind closed doors to remove any possible danger to spectators attempting to travel to the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/my_club/edinburgh/9295226.stm |title=Edinburgh to meet Castres on Monday behind closed doors |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 December 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkish football in 2011–12{{anchor|No men}}&lt;!--[[Mustang (film)]] links here --&gt;==
Starting with the 2011–12 season, the [[Turkish Football Federation]] (TFF) instituted a modified version of this rule. The penalty for a team sanctioned for crowd violence is now a ban on both ticket sales to, and attendance by, males over age 12 (as spectators). Women, and children under age 12 of either sex, are admitted free. The first game under the new rule took place on 20 September 2011, when [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football team)|Fenerbahçe]] hosted [[Manisaspor]] at [[Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium]] in [[Istanbul]]. Over 41,000 women and children attended the match (plus a small number of men who had sneaked into the stadium). The experiment was so successful that the TFF planned to require that teams allocate an unspecified number of free tickets for women and children at all future club matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ap-turkey-nomenallowed |title=Turkey wants more women and children at stadiums |first=Suzan |last=Fraser |agency=Associated Press |work=Yahoo!

==Ajax–AZ, 2011–12 KNVB Cup==
A match between [[Eredivisie]] clubs [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[AZ (football club)|AZ]] in the [[2011–12 KNVB Cup#Fourth round|fourth round]] of the [[2011–12 KNVB Cup]] was replayed behind closed doors at Ajax's home ground, [[Amsterdam Arena]], on 19 January 2012. In the original match, held at the same venue on 21 December 2011, Ajax held a 1–0 lead when a fan [[Pitch invasion|ran onto the pitch]] and launched a karate kick from behind against AZ goalkeeper [[Esteban Alvarado]]. The player responded by kicking the fan several times before security arrived. When Alvarado was [[Misconduct (association football)#Sending-off offences (red card)|sent off]] for retaliating against his attacker, AZ left the pitch, and the match was abandoned. The [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] rescinded the red card, ordered the match replayed in its entirety, Ajax then gave an apology to their [[AZ Alkmaar]] opponents. but were nonetheless fined €10,000 for failing to prevent the fan entering the stadium. He was supposed to be serving a 3-year stadium ban, but was pretending that his ban had expired early. Ajax accepted the penalties, and announced that it had extended the fan's stadium ban 10 times more charges to 30 years and given him a long ban from the club and its seasonal ticketing for a total of 800 to 900 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7395584/ajax-az-alkmaar-cup-match-replayed-full |title=Ajax vs. Alkmaar to start from scratch |author=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=28 December 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barcelona–Las Palmas, 2017–18 La Liga==
Surrounding violence in Catalonia due to the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017|2017 Catalan independence referendum]], the match between [[FC Barcelona]] and [[UD Las Palmas]] in the [[2017–18 La Liga]] was played behind closed doors. Barcelona first requested the [[Liga de Fútbol Profesional|LFP]] to postpone their match which was to be played on the same day as the referendum. This request was declined by the LFP, saying that, if Barcelona refused to play the match, their six points would be deducted. To protect the fans, as well as in protest to LFP's decision, Barcelona played the match behind closed doors, a first at their stadium, [[Camp Nou]]. The match ended 3–0 in favor of Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/catalan-referendum-election-police-fc-barcelona-gerard-pique-las-palmas-a7978236.html|title=Club president reveals why Barcelona played behind closed doors over postponing the game|date=2017-10-02|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/01/barcelona-vs-las-palmas-goes-ahead-behind-closed-doors-amid/|title=Barcelona beat Las Palmas behind closed doors amid Catalan referendum clashes|last=Sport|first=Telegraph|date=2017-10-01|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/barcelonas-vs-las-palmas-played-11270680|title=Why Barcelona vs Las Palmas was played behind closed doors|last=Mackay|first=Hamish|date=2017-10-01|work=mirror|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippines-Qatar, 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian Qualifiers==
As part of the sanctions handed to the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|Philippine men's basketball team]] in the aftermath of their involvement in their [[Philippines–Australia basketball brawl|brawl against Australia]] during their home game on July 2, 2018, the Philippine national team is obliged to play their next home match in the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers behind closed doors with the succeeding two home games being placed under probation. &lt;ref&gt; [http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/07/20/18/fiba-world-cup-ph-hoops-exec-saddened-to-lose-6th-man-in-closed- FIBA World Cup: Philippine hoops exec saddened to lose 6th man in closed door game] [[ABS-CBN News]] Accessed July 21, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt; The game that will be played behind closed doors is their home game against [[Qatar men's national basketball team|Qatar]] on September 17, 2018 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].

==France==
The French league has a tough line on misconduct. Each smoke grenade sent to the pitch results in a fine, which can then result in playing behind closed doors. If the crowd isn't managed, the club may also be punished. Hence, almost every season, a handful of matches are played behind closed doors.

==Brazil==
In Brazil, the practice of games without public access is known as "closed gates" (in Portuguese, "portões fechados"), even referred as such in the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]'s rulebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.cbf.com.br/content/201312/1485364923.pdf|title=RGC - REGULAMENTO GERAL DAS COMPETIÇÕES|publisher=CBF|accessdate=2014-07-23|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once it was applied to a whole tournament: two rounds of the [[Campeonato Catarinense]] second division in 2014 were behind closed doors because the participant clubs did not deliver the security checks for their stadia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fcf.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/RDI-32-2014.pdf|publisher=Federação Catarinense de Futebol|title=Resolução de Diretoria Nº 32/2014|language=Portuguese|date=16 July 2014|accessdate=17 July 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanitary reasons dictated the restriction in 2009, where two games of the [[2009 Campeonato Brasileiro Série D|Série D]] were played behind closed doors due to the [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futebolinterior.com.br/news.php?id_news=93668|title=BOMBA! Jogo da Série D terá portões fechados devido a nova gripe|publisher=Futebol Interior|date=13 August 2009 |language=portuguese|accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
Behind closed doors matches in the major North American sports leagues are exceedingly rare, as local law enforcement, [[security guard|private security]] contractors working for either the team or a league, and national agencies such as the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] take large roles in preventing situations of fan violence before they can occur by restricting access to known troublesome fans either at the gate or even at the stage of selling tickets (such as 'do not sell' lists), along with heavy restrictions on bringing in items and screening with [[metal detector]]s and [[Frisking|pat-down]] searches where bringing in a weapon or explosive device can result in immediate arrest and lifetime ejection from a venue, and other examples such as the "clear bag" policy, which only allows spectators to bring in bags that can be easily seen through. Teams also have incentive to prevent fan violence due to [[Forfeit (sport)|forfeit rules]] which come with penalties to their records and playoff positioning, and league sanctions such as fines and the stripping of [[Draft (sports)|draft picks]] due to neglecting to create a safe environment for players, which in turn can affect teams for years beyond a violent event.

===Major League Baseball===
{{main|2015 White Sox–Orioles crowdless game}}
On 28 April 2015, [[Major League Baseball]] announced a game between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] to be played at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] in Baltimore that evening would instead start at 2:06 p.m. [[Time in the United States|EDT]], with no fans being admitted.  The unprecedented decision came due to security concerns related to [[2015 Baltimore riots|civil unrest]] in the city, along with a 10 p.m. EDT curfew which would have required suspension of the game had it been played at its original time.  The game was to have been the last game of a three-game series, but the first two had already been postponed due to the unrest. The game was televised in the Baltimore and Chicago markets, and was also offered as a "free game of the day" on MLB's [[MLB.tv|streaming service]] nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/12781465/baltimore-orioles-chicago-white-sox-series-finale-played-wednesday-closed-public|title=White Sox-Orioles game will be played Wednesday, closed to public|author=Staff report|date=28 April 2015|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unofficially, some fans were able to watch the game through obstructed gates in left-center field, along with guests at the nearby [[Hilton Baltimore]] which overlooks the playing field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bs-sp-orioles-empty-stadium-0430-20150429-story.html#page=1|title=Even with Camden Yards closed to public, fans found way to support O's|author1=Encina, Eduardo A.  |author2=Kaltenbach, Chris |lastauthoramp=yes |date=29 April 2015|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time a North American major league sports event would be held in an empty sports venue; previously in minor league baseball, a 2008 [[Iowa Cubs]] game was played without public admittance due to flooding in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], while a 2002 [[Charleston RiverDogs]] game in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] held a purposeful [[gimmick]] "Nobody Night" where no one was admitted to the park until the attendance figure was made [[official game|official]] after the fifth inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/121075114/anthony-castrovince-mlb-game-without-crowd-also-without-precedent|title=MLB game without crowd also without precedent|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|date=28 April 2015|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PGA Tour golf===
While large [[Glossary of golf#G|galleries]] consisting of thousands of fans are standard for top-level professional [[golf]] events in the [[United States]], on 30 June 2012, the third round of the 2012 [[Quicken Loans National|AT&amp;T National]] at [[Congressional Country Club]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], [[Maryland]] was played without fans being admitted due to trees being downed and other storm damage caused by a [[derecho]] the night before. Additionally, the start of the third round was delayed to the early afternoon, instead of a morning start that is normal for a round of a golf tournament utilizing a [[stroke play]] format, in order to allow for the continuation of course clean-up efforts. This is the first of two recorded instances of any part of a [[PGA Tour]] event being played without a gallery present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/8115466/pga-tour-play-congressional-resumes-brutal-storm-fans-kept-out|title=Play under way, but fans out|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=30 June 2012|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 [[Farmers Insurance Open]] at [[Torrey Pines Golf Course]] in the [[La Jolla]] community of [[San Diego]], [[California]], after inclement weather disrupted play on Sunday and several trees were ripped apart on the golf course, fans were barred from the premises for the Monday conclusion of the final round of the tournament due to safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Course closed to public tomorrow due to safety issues|url=https://twitter.com/FarmersInsOpen/status/693975221343117313|website=Farmers Insurance Open Twitter page|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The 2018 edition of the same tournament also was finished behind closed doors on Monday.  The sudden death playoff had reached five holes without a winner, and darkness made it impossible to complete the tournament.  The event concluded Monday morning at 8:18 AM behind closed doors.

===Ice hockey===
The [[Charlotte Checkers]] of the [[American Hockey League]] have played in two such "behind closed doors" games, both caused by severe winter storms when the opposing team and game officials had already arrived in the city.  On 22 January 2016, the Checkers played against the Chicago Wolves behind closed doors because of a severe winter storm &lt;REF&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/charlotte-ahl-game-closed-to-the-public-as-winter-storm-arrives-225359802.html] &lt;/REF&gt;, and the same again on 17 January 2018, the Checkers played against the [[Bridgeport Sound Tigers]] behind closed doors as a result of inclement weather (ice and snow).  Both games were played at [[Bojangles' Coliseum]]. &lt;REF&gt;[http://nhl.nbcsports.com/2018/01/18/weather-forces-ahls-charlotte-checkers-to-play-game-in-empty-arena-video/].&lt;/REF&gt;

In 1985, a [[measles]] outbreak on campus led [[Boston University]] to hold home [[Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey|ice hockey]] games without spectators for a week, in order to control the disease's spread. Basketball games were also affected, and other large public events on campus, were also temporarily banned.&lt;ref name="BU measles ice hockey closure"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]]|title=All No-Shows At B.U.

'''Bernard Etxepare''' (pronounced {{IPA-eu|berˈnart eˈtʃepaɾe|}}) was a [[Basque people|Basque]] writer of the 16th century, most famous for a collection of poems titled ''Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ'' ("First Fruits of the Basque Language")&lt;ref name="Linguae_Worldcat"&gt;{{cite web |title=Linguae Vasconum Primitiae : the first fruits of the Basque language, 1545 |url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/linguae-vasconum-primitiae-the-first-fruits-of-the-basque-language-1545/oclc/967842846 |translator-first=Mikel Morris |translator-last=Pagoeta |others=Foreword by Pello Salaburu; Introduction by Beñat Oyharçabal |website=Worldcat |accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he published in 1545, the first book to be published in the [[Basque language]].

==Spellings of the name==
His first name is also spelled ''Bernat'' or ''Beñat'' in Basque, he himself used Bernat. His surname is spelled ''Etxepare'' in modern Basque but the variant ''Detxepare'' is also occasionally encountered, in Basque or ''Dechepare'' in Spanish, both based on the [[French language|French]] spelling ''D'echepare''. He himself used ''Dechepare''.

==Life==
Very little is known about his life. He was born c. 1470–1480&lt;ref name=Egin&gt;Etxepare, B. ''Linguae Vasconum Primitiae'', Egin Biblioteka 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; in the area of [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]] in [[Lower Navarre]]. His birthplace is the ''Etxeparia'' farmhouse in [[Bussunarits-Sarrasquette]],&lt;ref name=Orhipean&gt;Etxegoien, J. ''Orhipean - Gure Herria Ezagutzen'' Pamiela 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and he spent the majority of his life in the valleys of Cize, working as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] in [[Saint-Michel, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Michel]] at the church of Saint-Michel-le-Vieux and [[vicar]] in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.&lt;ref name=Orhipean/&gt;

Etxepare lived through a period of war and upheaval from 1512 onward with the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|Castilian conquest of Upper Navarre]]. In one of his poems, ''Mossen Bernat echaparere cantuya'', he confesses to having spent time in prison in [[Béarn]], although the reasons for his detainment are not very clear. According to some, he was accused of having taken the side of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] in its conflict with Navarre, not least of all due to religious reasons.&lt;ref name=Orhipean/&gt; Others, however, think that the reasons for his incarceration were moral rather than political. Either way, Etxepare maintained that he was innocent.

The date of his death is unknown.

==Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ==
In 1545 he published a book in [[Bordeaux]], the ''Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ'', generally assumed to be the first book ever printed in Basque. It contains a collection of poems, some religious in nature, some love poems, one about his life, some extolling the virtues of the Basque language and others. It has been suggested by [[Arnauld de Oihenart|Oihenart]] in his ''L´art poétique basque'' from 1665 that some of his prestigious contemporary Basque writers such as [[Joan Etxegarai]] and [[Arnaut Logras]] who were famous for their [[Pastoral (Soule)|pastorals]] might have been published too. However, if they were, any evidence has been lost.

It is written in the [[Lower Navarrese]] dialect of Basque, using a French-influenced [[orthography]] and the metre and style of writing suggest that Etxepare was a [[bertsolari]], a type of Basque poet known for producing sung [[extemporised]] poetry.

The book contains:
* Foreword
* ''Doctrina Christiana'' "Christian Doctrine"
* ''Hamar manamenduyak'' "The [[Ten Commandments]]"
* ''Iudicio generala'' "General Judgement"
* ''Amorosen gaztiguya'' "The Disappointment of Lovers"
* ''Emazten favore'' "In Defense of Wives"
* ''Ezconduyen coplac'' "The Couplet of the Married Couple"
* ''Amoros secretuguidena'' "The Secret Lover"
* ''Amorosen partizia'' "The Separation of Lovers"
* ''Amoros gelosia'' "The Jealous Lover"
* ''Potaren galdacia'' "Asking for a Kiss"
* ''Amorez errequericia'' "Requesting Love"
* ''Amorosen disputa'' "The Lovers Dispute"
* ''Ordu gayçarequi horrat zazquiçat''
* ''Amore gogorren despira'' "Contempt for the Harsh Mother"
* ''Mossen Bernat echaparere cantuya'' "The Song of Mosén Bernat Etxepare"
* ''Contrapas''
* ''Sautrela''
* ''Extraict des regestes de Parlement''

The following example is the ''Contrapas'', which is a poem that broadly sets out Etxepare's motivation for producing this book and his hopes for the language. Etxepare explains that he is the first Basque writer to have his work published in print. He calls for the Basque language to "go out" and become more widely known, for the Basques to blaze new trails and make themselves known to the world.

Note that the above rendition into Standard Basque contains several words which would be spelled like that but are rarely used. Instead of ''lengoaje'' "language" the indigenous terms ''mintzaira'' or ''hizkuntza'' would be most widely used today for example.

The only surviving original copy of the book is kept at the [[National Library of France]] in Paris. Irrespective of its literary value, his book has enjoyed enduring fame amongst Basques. Especially the last two pieces of his book, or excerpts thereof, are frequently quoted or used otherwise in the Basque scene. During the 1960s for example the Basque musician [[Xabier Lete]] produced a musical score to accompany the ''Kontrapas''. More recently, a newly developed [[speech recognition]] software tool has been named [[Sautrela]] after the final poem in Etxepare's book and a Basque literature series in [[Euskal Telebista|Basque Television]] is also named ''Sautrela''.

The '''Chapacuran languages''' are a nearly [[Extinct language|extinct]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[language family]] of [[South America]]. There are three living Chapacuran languages, which are spoken in the southeastern [[Amazon Basin]] of [[Brazil]] and [[Bolivia]].

The Chapacuran languages appear to be related to the extinct [[Wamo language]]. Almost all Chapacuran languages are extinct, and the four that are extant are moribund.

==Languages==
Birchall et al. (2013) classify the dozen known Chapacuran languages as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Birchall, Joshua and Dunn, Michael and Greenhill, Simon (2013) ''An internal classification of the Chapacuran language family.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Chapacuran'''
**Kitemoka&amp;ndash;Tapakura
***[[Chapacura language|Chapacura]] †
***[[Quitemo language|Quitemo]] †
**Moreic&amp;ndash;Waric
***Moreic&amp;ndash;Tor
****Nuclear More
*****[[Itene language|Itene]]
*****[[Cumana language|Cumana]]
****[[Torá language|Torá]] †
***Waric
****Urupa&amp;ndash;Yaru:
*****[[Urupa language|Urupa]] †
*****Yaru †
****Wanham&amp;ndash;Wari&amp;ndash;Oro Win
*****[[Wanham language|Wanham]] †
*****Wari&amp;ndash;Oro Win
******[[Oro Win language|Oro Win]]
******[[Wari' language|Wari']]
**?[[Napeca language|Napeca]] (Nape) †
**?[[Rocorona language|Rocorona]] (Ocorono) †

All languages are rather closely related. Rocorona appears closest to Torá and Moré (Itene), but those do not cluster together in the classification above.

Extinct languages for which Loukotka says 'nothing' is known, but which may have been Chapacuran, include Cujuna, Mataua, Urunumaca, and Herisobocono. Similarities with [[Mure language|Mure]] appear to be loans.&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt;

'''Christian Johan Barnard''' (15 July 1939 &amp;ndash; 28 December 2015), known as '''Chris Barnard''', was a South African author and movie [[scriptwriter]].  He was known for writing [[Afrikaans]] novels, novellas, columns, youth novels, [[short stories]], plays, radio dramas, film scripts and television dramas.

==Biography==
Barnard was born in Mataffin in the [[Nelspruit|Nelspruit district]] of South Africa on 15 July 1939, and matriculated at {{Interlanguage link multi|Hoërskool Nelspruit|af}} in 1957. He majored in Afrikaans-[[Dutch language|Nederlands]] and [[History of Art]] at the [[University of Pretoria]].

In the 1960s he and several other authors were notable figures in the Afrikaans literary movement known as ''[[Die Sestigers]]'' ("The Sixty-ers"). These writers sought to use Afrikaans as a language to speak against the [[apartheid]] government, and also to bring into [[Afrikaans literature]] the influence of contemporary English and French trends.

During 1962 Barnard married his first wife, Anette, and together they produced three sons; Johan, Stephan and Tian. After divorcing his first wife in 1978, he married his second wife, [[:af:Katinka Heyns|Katinka Heyns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''combinatorial method''' is a method of [[linguistic analysis]] that is used to study texts which are written in an unknown language, and to study the language itself, where the unknown language has no obvious or proven well-understood close relatives, and where there are few bilingual texts which might otherwise have been used to help understand the language. It consists of three distinct analyses:
* archaeological and antiquarian analysis,
* [[structural linguistics|formal-structural analysis]], and
* [[content analysis|content]] and context analysis.

The method relies principally on information that is available in and about the language being studied, and has most famously been used for study of the [[Etruscan language]]. It has also been used for other languages, for example by [[Yves Duhoux]] (1982) for [[Eteocretan]]. The method was first advocated by [[Wilhelm Deeke]] in his 1875 refutation of [[Wilhelm Corssen]]'s attempt to demonstrate a supposed relationship between Etruscan and the [[Indo-European languages]] by the [[etymological method]], which is based on perceived resemblances between words in the text in the unknown language and words existing in known languages.

The combinatorial method was developed to replace the etymological method because the latter bases itself on [[circular reasoning]], in which the assumed relationship purportedly proves the interpretation of the text and vice versa, thus being inadequate for scientific study or proof. While mainstream specialists in [[Etruscology]] have long since abandoned the etymological method in favour of the slow, rigorous work of the combinatorial method, the etymological method is still popular with [[folk linguistics|amateurs]] wishing to prove a relationship between ancient texts and an existing language.

==Archaeological-antiquarian analysis==
Archaeological-antiquarian analysis consists of using archaeological and antiquarian methods to determine the nature of the text, such as the nature of the object bearing the inscription, and the circumstances and location of its discovery. An example of ignoring this stage would be to describe the [[Pyrgi Tablets]] as part of a temple archive, as some commentators did when the tablets were found in 1964, when quite clearly the tablets had been nailed to a wall as a notice. Part of this stage is also rigorously checking the [[Epigraphy|epigraphic]] or [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] details of the inscription concerned. [[Vladimir I. Georgiev|Vladimir Georgiev]]'s claim that Etruscan is related to [[Hittite language|Hittite]] was largely based on a non-existent word ''esmi'' which had been incorrectly read from an inscription, while [[Mario Alinei]]'s 2003 claim that the word ''iθal'' means "drink" and that Etruscan is thus based on Hungarian is ruled out by the fact that ''iθal'' occurs in one single inscription and does not re-occur in the many hundreds of known inscribed Etruscan [[symposium]] vessels which might be expected to contain the word "drink" if their Latin equivalents are anything to go by.

==Formal-structural analysis==
{{See also|Morphology (linguistics)}}
Formal-structural analysis consists of breaking down words into their component [[morpheme]]s to form a hypothesis of the structure of the language, which must be consistent with that deduced from other interpreted or partly interpreted inscriptions, and with the features that might be expected in known languages. The point of this stage is to reveal the root words and their roles in the text. While establishing the meaning of the word or morpheme is not the key goal at this stage, it can however rule out potential meanings. For example, [[Zacharie Mayani]]'s claim that Etruscan ''θu'' means "two" is ruled out by the fact that ''θu'' is the only Etruscan numeral which is never found with a plural referent, and in addition it does not have a derived multiple of 10 based on it, which points to it meaning not "two" but "one".

==Content and context analysis==
Once both the root form of a word and an idea of its role in the text and elsewhere are established, an analysis of content and context can be carried out to determine the word's part of speech, or whether it is part of a name, and if so, the sex of the person, and if an object or an action, its likely nature or general semantic area. This stage must also ensure that any proposed more definite meaning is consistent with all other instances, but must also allow for the possibility of [[homonym]]s with different meanings and morphemes with more than one purpose.

Meanings and interpretations established by the combinatorial method are not certain, for example, as meanings confirmed by a bilingual text or by a reliable ancient gloss, but are of variable reliability, and as provisional models. The understanding of the Etruscan language has gradually increased over the years, as new knowledge from the Etruscan texts themselves, and from research in other disciplines of Etruscology. Giulio Facchetti's research into [[Etruscan private law]] (2000)&lt;ref name="Facchetti2000"&gt;{{cite journal|language=italian|first=Giulio M.|last=Facchetti|date=2000|trans-title=Fragments of Etruscan Private Law|title=Frammenti di diritto privato etrusco|location=[[Florence]]|publisher=[[Leo S. Olschki Editore|Olschki]]|isbn=88-222-4922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; taken together with the publication of the text of the [[Tabula Cortonensis|Cortona tablet]] in 1999 is an example of where this has happened.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1761">'''Cosmesis''' is the preservation, restoration, or bestowing of bodily beauty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dorland's Medical Dictionary]]''. 25th ed. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Co.; 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In the medical context, it usually refers to the surgical correction of a disfiguring defect, or the cosmetic improvements made by a surgeon following incisions. Its use is generally limited to the additional, usually minor, steps that the surgeon (who is generally operating for noncosmetic [[Indication (medicine)|indication]]s) takes to improve the aesthetic appearance of the scars associated with the operation. Typical actions include removal of damaged tissue, mitigation of tension on the wound, and/or using fine (thin) sutures to close the outer layer of skin.

Cosmetic surgery is the portion of [[plastic surgery]] that concerns itself with the elective improvement of cosmesis.

==Prosthetic limbs==

The practice of cosmesis, the creation of lifelike limbs made from silicone or PVC{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}, has grown in popularity. Such prosthetics, such as artificial hands, can now be made to mimic the appearance of real limbs, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints, and even tattoos. Custom-made cosmeses are generally more expensive, costing thousands of US dollars depending on the level of detail. Standard cosmeses come ready-made in various sizes, though they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts. Another option is the custom-made silicone cover, which can be made to match a person's skin tone, but not details such as freckles or wrinkles. Cosmeses are attached to the body using an adhesive, suction, form-fitting, stretchable skin, or a skin sleeve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2802">In [[semantics|linguistic semantics]], an expression X is said to have '''cumulative reference''' if and only if the following holds:  If X is true of both of ''a'' and ''b'', then it is also true of the combination of ''a'' and ''b''.  Example:  If two separate entities can be said to be "water", then combining them into one entity will yield more "water". If two separate entities can be said to be "a house", their combination cannot be said to be "a house".  Hence, "water" has cumulative reference, while the expression  "a house" does not. The [[english plural|plural]] form "houses", however, ''does'' have cumulative reference.  If two (groups of) entities are both "houses", then their combination will still be "houses".

Cumulativity has proven relevant to the linguistic treatment of the [[mass noun|mass/count]] distinction and for the characterization of grammatical [[telicity]].

Formally, a cumulativity predicate ''CUM'' can be defined as follows, where capital ''X'' is a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] over [[set (mathematics)|sets]], ''U'' is the [[universe of discourse]], ''p'' is a [[mereology|mereological]] part [[mathematical structure|structure]] on ''U'', and &lt;math&gt;\oplus_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mereology|mereological]] sum operation.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
(\forall X\subseteq U_p)(CUM(X)\iff \exists x,y(X(x) \wedge X(y) \wedge x\neq y) \wedge \forall x,y(X(x) \wedge X(y) \Rightarrow X(x \oplus_p y)))
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In later work, Krifka has generalized the notion to ''n''-ary predicates, based on the phenomenon of ''cumulative quantification''.  For example, the two following sentences appear to be equivalent:
: John ate an apple and Mary ate a pear.
: John and Mary ate an apple and a pear.

This shows that the relation "eat" is cumulative. In general, an ''n''-ary predicate ''R'' is ''cumulative'' if and only if the following holds:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
(\forall x_1,\ldots, x_n, y_1,\ldots, y_n)(R(x_1, \ldots,x_n)\wedge R(y_1, \ldots,y_n)) \rightarrow R(x_1\oplus y_1, \ldots,x_n\oplus y_n)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

'''Decreolization''' is a postulated{{cn|date=August 2018}} phenomenon whereby over time a [[creole language]] [[Language convergence|reconverges]] with one of the [[Standard language|standard languages]] from which it originally derived. First proposed by [[Keith Whinnom]] at the 1968 Mona conference, the concept has come under fire in recent years from such linguists as [[Derek Bickerton]] and [[John R. Rickford]] since at its inception it sought to overturn long-held elements of the theory of [[Post-creole speech continuum|creole continua]].

==Overview==
Decreolization is a process of homogenization a [[creole language]] may undergo when in contact with one of its [[Parent language|parent languages]], particularly if the parent language is ascribed a [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] value. To put it another way, in decreolization, the influence of the [[superstratum|superstrate language]] dismantles influences from [[substratum|substrate languages]].

If one views [[pidgin]]ization as a process of [[language reform#Simplification|simplification]], [[relaxed pronunciation|reduction]], and [[Admixture (genetics)|admixture]] from [[substratum|substrate languages]], and creolization as the expansion of the language to combat reduction, then one would view decreolization as an attack on both simplification and admixture.

As languages remain in contact over time, they inevitably influence one another. Typically, the language with higher prestige (most often the [[lingua franca]]) will exert a much greater influence on the lower prestige language (the [[creole language|creole]]). This leads to the reintroduction of complexities, irregularities and redundancies into the creole from the source language. Elements of other sources begin to disappear as there is less and less linguistic territory for them to cover. It is theorized that eventually the creole will resemble the source language to such a degree that it can then be called a [[dialect]] of that language rather than a separate language at all.

Another name for a near-fully decreolized language is a “[[Vestigiality|vestigial]] post-creole.”

==Examples==
===Portuguese creoles===
Decreolization processes occurred in creoles ranging from [[Brazil]] in South America as well in Africa, to [[Macau]] and [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]] in Asia. The Asian and American creoles existed in [[post-creole continuum|continua]] with forms of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and underwent a process of decreolization when the Asian places were still [[Portuguese Empire|overseas provinces of Portugal]], and from the 18th century when the [[Língua Geral|línguas gerais]] were forbidden by [[Marquis of Pombal]] to about one century after the [[Brazilian independence]] along in the Americas. These older processes can best be seen or studied in [[Daman and Diu Portuguese creole|Daman and Diu Portuguese]] and [[Macanese Patois]], which converged with Standard Portuguese.

In Africa, these are contemporary processes in post-independence Africa. In [[Cape Verde]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]] the creoles are dominant over Portuguese, but undergoing decreolization processes, leading to the development of "soft creoles" in both Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau and post-creole continua with noncreolized Portuguese. In [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], the situation is different from [[Upper Guinea]] as noncreolized Portuguese is dominant over the creoles, and children are intentionally raised in Standard Portuguese by their parents, leading to the younger generations in Principe Island not even being able to understand the island's creole or not valuing it.&lt;ref name="santomense"&gt;[http://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/18319/1/ulfl183078_tm.pdf Estudo do Léxico do São-Tomense com Dicionário] Carlos Fontes - Universidade de Coimbra.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duan''', '''Doan''', or '''Halang Doan''', is a language spoken by more than four thousand people on either side of the [[Laos|Laotian]]–[[Vietnam]]ese border.  There are some 2,346 speakers in [[Attopu Province]], Laos, and another couple of thousand in [[Kon Tum Province]], Vietnam. It is too poorly known to classify completely and may be mutually intelligible with [[Takua language|Takua]], [[Kayong language|Kayong]], [[Halang language|Halang]], and [[Rengao language|Rengao]]. Might be a part of the Xơ Ɖăng ethnic group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25963">An '''electrostatic detection device''', '''EDD''' or '''ESDA''', is a specialized piece of equipment commonly used in [[questioned document examination]] to reveal [[:wikt:impression|indentations or impressions]] in paper that may otherwise go unnoticed. It is a non-destructive technique (will not damage the evidence in question), allowing further tests to be carried out. It is a sensitive technique capable of detecting indentations on pages several layers below the top sheet and many years after the indentations were created.

EDD equipment and investigative techniques were central to overturning a number of convictions in the [[United Kingdom]], as it was possible to demonstrate that witness statements had been altered or signed as blank pages in reverse order to the main notes. This was central in a number of cases investigated at the [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] that were appealed. The allegations of tampering with evidence and witness statements led to the unit being disbanded, and over 60 convictions being quashed, many of the appeals relying on EDA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=Tom |title=ESDA and the Analysis of Contested Contemporaneous Notes of Police Interviews |journal=Forensic Linguistics |date=1994 |issue=1 |pages=71-89|publisher=Routledge |url=http://www.unask.com/website/printing/IndeterminacyLecture/ESDA.htm | ref=harv}}
 See [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] for full details of the cases&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
When writing is fashioned on a sheet of paper resting upon other pages, the indentations or impressions produced are transferred to those below. These transferred impressions can be detected using an EDD.

In some situations, a questioned document such as a [[ransom]] note, or an [[extortion]] letter, may exist which can be determined to be the source of indentations detected on another piece of paper (e.g., an offender's notepad).  Alternatively, indentations detected on a business [[contract]] might match information present on another such document.  In some situations this would be an entirely innocent finding; however, if the two businesses are supposed to be operating independent of one another, then the finding could be significant.&lt;ref&gt;The sourcing/matching of indentations must be interpreted in the context of the investigative scenario.  That is, indentations and source writing that 'match' indicate only that pieces of paper were in physical juxtaposition at the time the writing occurred.&lt;/ref&gt;  Decipherable indentations may also provide valuable information even when a second document is not present or cannot be located.  For example, an [[Poison pen letter|anonymous letter]] may bear impressions of writing that relate to some mundane activity of the offender which could ultimately lead an investigator to a particular suspect.

The electro-physical basis whereby an EDD actually works is complex.  The original theory suggested that the paper sandwiched between the grounded platen and the mylar charging film acted as a type of capacitor with the change in capacitance being due to differing compression of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; proposed an alternative theory explaining the detection capability of an EDD as being due to a surface charge effect created by paper-to-paper friction specifically in the area where a writing instrument is pressed down into the top-most sheet of paper.  Seward's model was based upon "charge transport through the Mylar-paper-platen structure"&lt;ref name=Seward1 /&gt; and is appropriately called the 'charge transport model'.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the charge transport model, while not perfect, is sound.  This testing also clarified that areas of indentation are less negatively charged than surrounding areas.  It is this relative difference in potential that causes the toner to be attracted to the areas of indentation, rather than other areas on the mylar surface.

Seward's model also helps to explain two unusual phenomena sometimes observed when using an EDD:
# 'pure' indentations caused by impact printing, for example, may not produce good EDD results
# indirect secondary 'impressions' may appear that are caused by lateral relative motion between two sheets of paper when the source sheet bears significant embossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, indentations can sometimes not develop very well even though they are clearly visible.  This may occur, for example, with very heavy or deep impressions or with impressions in glossy heavy-weight paper such as that used for brochures. In such situations, it is possible to use digital scanning and image-processing to document such writing impressions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Practical use==
Despite the complexity of the underlying theoretical mechanism, the practical use of an EDD is straightforward.  Most devices are similar in their operation.  The following are the key steps in using an EDD to visualize indentations:&lt;ref name=ASTM2291&gt;ASTM Standard E 2291 – 03, 2003, "Standard Guide for Indentation Examinations," ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2003, www.astm.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evaluation of material
:# Assess adequacy of material for examination:  an EDD works best when used on a single sheet of clean, smooth paper (that is, paper without wrinkles, creases or stains).  The presence of any of these factors may preclude effective examination or, at the minimum, mean that the results will be limited.&lt;ref name=ESDA2manual&gt;Foster + Freeman ESDA-2 User Manual 14-06, July 2008 (UK/US)&lt;/ref&gt;  Heavy-weight, coated or treated papers often produce poor results. The purported age of the document is not generally a factor of concern.  Latent indentations have been developed on documents older than fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;

:# Examination using side (oblique) lighting:  as a general rule, all items should be examined using side lighting.  This is important because visual examination may detect deep indentations even though the EDD may fail to develop those indentations properly.
:# Documents that have been subjected to high levels of humidity will not generally retain indentations.  As a result, other forensic examinations involving the wetting of a document, such as [[fingerprint]] development using a [[ninhydrin]] solution, should not be done until after examination for indentations.&lt;ref&gt;

These data strongly suggest that it is the absolute humidity of the atmosphere used that determines the quality of the ESDA results.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To help ensure proper humidification, most manufacturers provide a 'humidification chamber' that can be used to prepare a document for examination. It is important to note that over-humidification is also possible so care must be taken to not actually wet the document.&lt;ref&gt;The Foster + Freeman ESDA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; user manual states "Over-humidification may have the same effect as wetting the document with a liquid.  The ESDA image may be degraded or obliterated."&lt;/ref&gt;  
:# Fitness-for-use (FFU) test; AKA, control sample:  since an EDD may fail to detect indentations when they are actually present (for a variety of reasons), it is important to check on the equipment's performance using a control sample (commonly called a FFU test) known to have indentations.  Recommendations include using a FFU test sample at the beginning and end of a series involving the examination of multiple questioned documents, or placing a small FFU test sample adjacent to each questioned document on the platen.  The FFU test can be prepared by hand using a similar writing instrument and similar paper.  Alternatively, a special device call the 'Gradient®' can be used to produce control indentations that vary in depth in a known manner thereby permitting the examiner to determine not only that the EDD is working but also the degree to which it is sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is not essential to precisely match the questioned document in terms of paper type or pen type since the objective is to show that the device is functioning properly.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} 
* Placement on platen:  the goal is to place the questioned document flat on the platen surface with few wrinkles or distortions (ideally, none).  The document should not extend beyond the platen edges and enough room should be present around the document to allow the charging film&lt;ref&gt;Some manufacturers refer to this as an "imaging film"&lt;/ref&gt; (see below) to seal against the platen surface.
:# Type of document:  as noted above, an EDD works well with a single sheet of paper up to a [[paper size|legal-sized]] sheet.&lt;ref&gt;The platen size varies by device.  As an example, the platen on the Foster + Freeman ESDA is approximately 24cm x 42 cm&lt;/ref&gt; However, if there are concerns about biological or chemical contamination, due to the condition of the questioned document, it is possible to use a second sheet of clean paper, e.g. copier paper, known to be free of indentations as a barrier between the platen and questioned document. Books and other multipage items can also be examined in some instances but these require additional preparation.  Ideally, individual pages should be removed from such items but this is not always possible.  As an alternative, a sheet of conductive material (e.g., aluminum foil) can be used to contact the conductive surface.&lt;ref name=ESDA2manual /&gt;
:# Covering with charging film:  As noted above, the charging film should cover the document completely and contact the platen all the way around the document.  The charging film serves two purposes: it protects the document from subsequent toner application and it takes the electrostatic charge required to 'develop' any latent indentations on the document.  The film should be laid over the document taking care to avoid wrinkles or excessive stretching of the film.  Most EDD devices have a roll of bulk film positioned adjacent to the device for ease in application.  The charging film will adhere to the platen due to suction applied through the surface of the platen.&lt;ref&gt;Many systems use a sintered brass plate for the platen but any porous and conductive surface would, in theory, work for this purpose&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charging of surface:  the top surface of the charging film must be [[electrostatic]]ally charged.  To achieve this most EDDs use a shielded (grounded) hand-held unit containing a high-tension corona wire&lt;ref&gt;A single strand of wire through which a high voltage (-8 kV) electrical charge is passed similar to a corona wire used in some [[electrophotography|electrophotographic]] devices.  Some manufacturers refer to this as a 'corona wand'.&lt;/ref&gt; which is turned on and literally waved over the entire surface of platen for several seconds criss-crossing the platen area.  The objective is to produce an evenly distributed electrostatic charge in the air above the surface of the charging film.  After passing the unit over the platen, the examiner waits for a few minutes until the charge has been passed to the surface of the charging film.
* Application of toner to develop indentations.  The EDD is able to visualize indentations because the surface is differentially charged depending upon whether or not an indentation is present.  The negatively charged toner particles are attracted to areas where there are indentations in the paper surface.&lt;ref name=ESDA2manual /&gt;  Once an electrostatic charge has been applied to the charging film, the latent indentations can be developed.  This is done using a powder toner very much like toner found in any electrophotographic printing device.  There are various methods used for this purpose.
** Cascade method:  Some EDDs have a platen that is hinged on one edge to permit it to be tilted.  A mixture of toner and small carrier beads (made of glass or similar non-conductive material&lt;ref&gt;The carrier material and toner composition is carefully designed based upon their [[triboelectric]] properties to ensure proper deposition.&lt;/ref&gt;) is then poured over the surface of the document from one side to the other.  The beads, and excess toner, are captured on the lower edge of the device to be reused.&lt;ref&gt;Some manufacturers have built in a 'catch tray' for this purpose.&lt;/ref&gt;  This process can be repeated several times in order to develop all areas of the document.
** Aerosol spray method:  Some EDDs provide the ability to spray toner over the surface of the charging film.  In these systems a protective shell or chamber is fitted that covers the entire platen.  At one end there is a nozzle connected to a reservoir of toner.  The examiner then manually activates a pump that sprays toner into the chamber creating a cloud of fine toner that settles down onto the surface of the charging film.  Ideally the cloud is randomly distributed but often this method produces a relatively distinctive pattern of toner on the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
** Brush method:  With some EDDs the toner is applied using a magnetic brush such as would be used for development of latent [[fingerprint]]s.  This is a manual process that is quite tedious and requires meticulous control of the brush.  But the method works well for selective development of subtle indentations.
** Toner pad method: Similar to the brush method described above but uses a special pad with a built-in toner reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Some manufacturers refer to this as a toner application device, or TAD.&lt;/ref&gt;  The toner pad is placed on the surface of the charging film and moved across the surface by hand.
* Assessment of results.  After the development process is complete the examiner must assess the results of the test process.
** FFU test results: since the questioned document may or may not have indentations, the correct method to assess the functionality of the EDD is through inspection of the FFU test sample.
:**If indentations are developed from the FFU test sample, the EDD can be considered as functioning correctly.
:**If no indentations developed from the FFU test sample, the EDD is not working.
:**If the FFU test was positive and no indentations are developed in the area of the questioned document, then the assessment will be that no detectable indentations have been developed.  It is important to note that this does not mean the questioned document was never in contact with other items of interest.  The absence of detectable indentations may be due to one or more limitations causing the indentations to not be detected.
:**Note that the presence of indentations in the document area is prima facie evidence that detectable indentations exist such that the FFU test is redundant.
* Preservation of results.  It is important to record and/or preserve the results of a test, especially if the test is positive (i.e., indentations were developed).  This can be done in at least two ways.
** Adhesive lift:  in this method, a sheet of fixing film is used to preserve the developed indentations.  The fixing film is usually a relatively rigid sheet of self-adhesive, transparent polymer film.  It is applied by removing the backing material and carefully laying the fixing film directly onto the charging film, thus trapping and fixing the toner in place between the films.  Pressure is then carefully applied to the top of the fixing film by hand or with a small roller.  The resulting sandwich is referred to simply as a "lift",&lt;ref name=ASTM2291 /&gt; or EDD lift.  Interpretation of the developed indentations is generally done using the lift after removal from the document because this permits the examiner to see the developed indentations on their own without interference from any visible markings on the document.
** Photography/scanning:  the results may also be captured using a camera, either directly from the charging film or from the lift after removal from the document.  Scanning is also an option but only when using the lift itself.

Aside from visualizing indentations, the method can be used to detect the presence of fresh [[fingerprint]]s, fiber disturbance on the paper surface (e.g. relating to mechanical erasure of information), or the presence of footwear impressions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9158">The '''Family Viewing Hour''' was a policy established by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the [[United States]] in [[1975 in television|1975]]. Under the policy, each [[television network]] in the U.S. had a responsibility to air "[[family friendly|family-friendly]]" programming during the first hour of the [[prime time]] lineup (8 to 9 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]). The hour disappeared in [[1977 in television|1977]] after the policy was overturned in court; however, the concept has continued to be used by some viewers who still believe that the 8:00 p.m. time slot in primetime has an obligation to have family-friendly programming.

== Background ==

In [[1974 in television|1974]], there was widespread public criticism regarding the amount of sex and violence then on [[Television in the United States|American television]].&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brown, James A.|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/familyviewin.htm|title=Family Viewing Time|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are several examples, there was one television scene that caused a particularly strong backlash. The 1974 [[NBC]] television movie ''[[Born Innocent (film)|Born Innocent]]'' featured a lesbian rape scene, and was even briefly shown in daytime promotional spots for the film. The scene drew much outcry upon its first airing and was blamed for the real-life rape of a young girl, which led to a case before the [[California Supreme Court]].  

In January 1975, then-FCC chairman [[Richard E. Wiley]] addressed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and House [[United States Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet|Communications and Commerce Subcommittee]]s, stating that all three networks agreed to adopt a "family viewing hour" in response to the criticism. The [[National Association of Broadcasters]] took the gesture one step further, decreeing that local stations also air family friendly programming in the 7 p.m. time slot, which was given to the [[network affiliates|affiliate]]s to air what they wished.&lt;ref&gt;http://sage.library.emory.edu/data1/Sage/0800/02/PR/PR/7278/080002PRPR7278305001001.GIF&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of [[CBS]] at the time wanted to go through with the measure but would only agree if [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] consented, citing a possible decline in [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] (the network had been #1 in U.S. households since the mid-1950s) if they were the only network to try the new policy. By the end of 1974, each network executive agreed to endorse the Family Viewing Hour, and to implement it by the [[1975–76 United States network television schedule|fall 1975 season]].&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

Indeed, many television series suffered from the Family Viewing Hour mandate. ''[[All in the Family]]'', which was the runaway top-rated show in the U.S. since [[1971 in television|1971]], was moved to 9 p.m. on Mondays after five seasons leading the Saturday night lineup. Producer [[Norman Lear]], citing an infringement on creative freedom and on his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, mounted a lawsuit. With the support of varying guilds, including the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA]], he won the case.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; The show's cast responded by recording a satirical, never-aired rendition of the show's theme song, retitled "These Are the Days".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSCng1f-6ZY |accessdate=February 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417171321/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSCng1f-6ZY |archivedate=April 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, [[1976 in television|1976]], [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|United States district court]] Judge [[Warren J. Ferguson]] declared the Family Viewing Hour null and void, starting with the [[1977–78 United States network television schedule|fall 1977 season]]. Ferguson stated while the idea was good in theory, the FCC had overstepped its bounds in having it instituted; the FCC privately lobbied the three major networks to adopt the policy instead of holding public hearings on the matter, and Ferguson ruled on those grounds that the Family Viewing Hour had no binding merit. The decree made by the National Association of Broadcasters in 1975 was also overturned, giving stations free rein on what to air in the pre-[[prime time]] slots.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

== Use of the concept today ==

After the Family Viewing Hour was declared unconstitutional, the networks continued voluntarily to offer family-friendly programs such as ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Happy Days]]'' in the early primetime hours, so some families still believed in the concept.&lt;ref name="no place"&gt;{{cite paper|last=Johnson |first=Thomas |title=The "Family Hour": No Place For Your Kids |publisher=[[Parents Television Council]] |date=1997-05-08 |url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/archives/famhtm.asp |accessdate=2007-09-05 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201255/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/archives/famhtm.asp |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this point of view, in 1989, Michigan housewife [[Terry Rakolta]] started a highly public letter-writing campaign to persuade advertisers to stop sponsoring the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network sitcom ''[[Married... with Children]]'' after watching the episode "[[Her Cups Runneth Over]]" with her three youngest children. Consequently, two companies completely withdrew sponsorship from the show, while other companies, including [[The Coca-Cola Company]], simply reduced sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lane| first = Frederick S. | title = The Decency Wars: The Campaign to Cleanse American Culture | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2006 | location = [[Amherst, New York]] | pages = 157–159 | url = http://www.fredericklane.com/the-decency-wars-the-campaign-to-cleanse-american-culture/ | isbn = 1-59102-427-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 2000-2001 season, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] stopped showing commercials for R-rated films during the first hour of primetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/13/us/disney-bans-r-rated-movie-ads-before-9-pm-on-abc-network.html|title=Disney Bans R-Rated Movie Ads Before 9 P.M. on ABC Network|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=2000-09-13|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that FCC commissioner [[Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin]] called to bring back the Family Hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/25/arts/few-viewers-object-as-unbleeped-bleep-words-spread-on-network-tv.html?scp=2&amp;sq=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Few Viewers Object as Unbleeped Bleep Words Spread on Network TV|last=Rutenberg|first=Jim|date=2003-01-25|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2424">A '''flip tax''' is a fee paid by a seller or buyer on a housing [[co-op]] transaction, typically in [[New York City]]. It is not a tax and is not deductible as a [[property tax]]. It is a transfer fee, payable upon the sale of an apartment to the co-op.

Flip taxes are considered a method to help raise money for a co-op's overhead expenses without raising the maintenance fees or assessing flat charge to all residences. Charging the fee to those who are leaving the building seems to be the most politically feasible.

==Types==
#  A flat fee
#  A dollar amount based on shares allocated to the subject apartment
#  A percentage based on the sales price
#  A percentage based on the net profit of the sale
#  A fee based on the duration the seller has owned the apartments (shorter time periods of ownership typically bring higher fees)

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnyc.com/code/newsletters/2002autumn/aut02_008fliptaxes.html |title=Understanding Flip Taxes|publisher=Council of Cooperatives and Condominiums in New York City |date=Autumn 2002 |accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The imposition of flip taxes in New York City has been supported in the courts. The [[New York State Legislature]] in July 1986 acted on a proposal from the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums and defined in what way co-ops could legally impose these fees. Specifically, the law allows such an assessment if either of the following applies:
# if it is sanctioned in the co-op's proprietary lease
# if the lease is amended with more than two thirds of shareholders approving.

Flip taxes appear to be legal for condominiums in New York City and [[New Jersey]] but are generally uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/13/realestate/a-condo-flip-tax-lawyers-say-yes.html |title=A Condo 'Flip Tax'?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3395">In mathematics, the '''Hardy–Littlewood zeta-function conjectures''', named after [[Godfrey Harold Hardy]] and [[John Edensor Littlewood]], are two conjectures concerning the distances between zeros and the density of zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]].

== Conjectures ==

In 1914 [[G. H. Hardy|Godfrey Harold Hardy]] proved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hardy| first=G.H.| title= Sur les zeros de la  fonction &lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt;| pages=1012–1014| journal= Compt. Rend. Acad. Sci.| volume=158| year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Riemann zeta function &lt;math&gt;\zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; has infinitely many real zeros.

Let &lt;math&gt;N(T)&lt;/math&gt; be the total number of real zeros, &lt;math&gt;N_0(T)&lt;/math&gt; be the total number of zeros of odd order of the function &lt;math&gt;\zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;, lying on the interval
&lt;math&gt;(0,T]&lt;/math&gt;.

Hardy and Littlewood claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hardy| first=G.H.| last2=Littlewood| first2=J.E.|  title= The zeros  of Riemann's zeta-function on the critical line| pages=283–317| journal= Math. Z.| volume=10| year=1921| doi=10.1007/bf01211614}}&lt;/ref&gt; two conjectures. These conjectures – on the distance between real zeros of &lt;math&gt;\zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; and on the density of zeros of &lt;math&gt;\zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)&lt;/math&gt; on intervals &lt;math&gt;(T,T+H]&lt;/math&gt; for sufficiently  great &lt;math&gt;T &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H = T^{a + \varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and with as less as possible value of &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrarily small number – open two new directions in the investigation of the Riemann zeta function.

'''1. For any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists such &lt;math&gt;T_0 = T_0(\varepsilon) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; that for &lt;math&gt;T \geq T_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H=T^{0.25+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; the interval &lt;math&gt;(T,T+H]&lt;/math&gt; contains a zero of odd order of the function &lt;math&gt;\zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)&lt;/math&gt;.'''

'''2. For any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exist &lt;math&gt;T_0 = T_0(\varepsilon) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = c(\varepsilon) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, such that for &lt;math&gt;T \geq T_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; the inequality &lt;math&gt;N_0(T+H)-N_0(T) \geq cH&lt;/math&gt; is true.'''

== Status ==

In 1942 [[Atle Selberg]] studied the problem '''2''' and proved that for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists such &lt;math&gt;T_0 = T_0(\varepsilon) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = c(\varepsilon) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, such that for &lt;math&gt;T \geq T_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; the inequality  &lt;math&gt;N(T+H)-N(T) \geq cH\log T&lt;/math&gt; is true.

In his turn, [[Atle Selberg|Selberg]] made [[Selberg's zeta function conjecture|his conjecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Selberg| first=A.| title= On the zeros of Riemann's zeta-function| pages=1–59| journal= Shr. Norske Vid. Akad. Oslo| volume=10| year=1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it's possible to decrease the value of the exponent &lt;math&gt;a = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; which was proved 42 years later by [[A.A. Karatsuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=A. A.| last=Karatsuba| title= On the zeros of the function ζ(s) on short intervals of the critical line| pages=569–584| journal= Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Mat.| volume=48 |issue=3| year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became an Associate of the [[Royal School of Mines]]. He was the State Geologist of [[Travancore]] State and the Director of Industries.

He was also a well-known writer in English, [[Malayalam]] and [[Sanskrit]]. He was the second recipient of the [[Kerala Sahitya Academy]] Award (instituted in 1955), which he was conferred in 1956 for his work 'Paananeeya Pradyoditham'. The Academy also has an Endowment Award in his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralasahityaakademi.org/ksa/Awards/Endowments/Award_ICChacko.htm I_C_Chacko Endowment Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; His other works include the [[Sanskrit]] poem 'Kristhusahasranamam' (The Thousand Names of Christ).

'''Ingvar Moe''' (11 December 1936 - 2 September 1993) was a Norwegian poet, novelist and children's writer. He published over 20 books including short stories, novels, poetry and textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturnett.no/kunstner_og_artister/kunstner_og_artister.jsp?id=T12057136 ''Ingvar Moe'' (Kulturnett.no )]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ingvar Moe was born and grew up in the farming district of [[Etne]] in [[Sunnhordland]] in the county of [[Hordaland]]. His parents were baker Sigurd Moe and Brita Talette Amanda Hardeland. He graduated from the teachers' college at [[Stord]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He worked for two decades as a teacher, principally in [[Nøtterøy]] and [[Nodeland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasentunet.no/default.asp?menu=3822 ''Moe, Ingvar'' (Nynorsk kultursentrum)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075433/http://www.aasentunet.no/default.asp?menu=3822 |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his literary début in 1975 with the poetry collection ''Løktastolpefrø'', for which he was awarded the [[Tarjei Vesaas' debutantpris]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In 1976 he published the story collection ''Sommaren te Ingjeberr''. Among his novels are ''Rundt sjøen'' from 1986, ''Forbanninga'' from 1988, and ''Kvinner mellom mørke fjell'' from 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbuforfattere.no/pub/nbu/aktuelt/?aid=243 ''Ei skål for Ingvar Moe!''

He worked in many genres and turn to different audiences. He wrote, in addition to poetry, short stories and novels, textbooks for primary school texts for cabaret and theater. In addition to his writing for adults, he wrote the youth novels and children's books. Moe also released an  autobiographical novel,  ''Rundt sjøen'' (1986). As an author of books for children, he is known for humorous books about the grandmother.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ingvar Moe |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Ingvar_Moe |language=Norwegian | accessdate=20 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ingvar Moe |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Per Olav |last=Kaldestad |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ingvar_Moe/utdypning |language=Norwegian|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''It's not you, it's me''' is a popular phrase used in the context of [[Breakup|breaking up]], and is intended to ease the dumpee's feeling in the knowledge that it wasn't their fault, but rather the fault of the dumper.

==History==
Merriam-Webster says that the phrase originated in newspaper articles which saw it being used in a sporting context in which players were "either apologizing for or boasting about their abilities". But the phrase morphed into a romantic context in the 1988 movie ''[[Casual Sex?]]'' in which it was used in the middle of a seduction scene.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/blog/its-not-you-its-me.htm|title=It's Not You, It's you|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a column written from the perspective of a sexually frustrated wife who uses the term "ran stateside in syndication", and in the same year an Australian comedian named Anthony Ackroyd deemed the line "unavoidably unoriginal".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;

The phrase was popularized by a 1993 episode of ''[[Seinfeld]]'' in which George Costanza gets dumped by a woman who uses the phrase on him, to which he replies that he uses it as well.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt;

''[[Psychology Today]]'' offered an expanded version which reads: "'It's not you, it's me.' 'I hope we can still be friends'", which adds an element of [[friend zone|friendzoning]] to the situation.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/love-in-limbo/201005/its-not-you-its-me-pseudo-compassionate-break-lines|title="It's Not You, It's Me." Pseudo-Compassionate Break-Up Lines|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The phrase's purpose is to ease a break-up and put the onus on the person breaking up: "The person saying these words is taking responsibility for their inability to please you...It hurts them to hurt you."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-scribner/why-its-not-you-its-me-isnt-the-worst-breakup-excuse_b_5313210.html?ir=Australia|title=Why 'It's Not You, It's Me' Isn't the Worst Breakup Excuse|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase may be used as a vague all-encompassing, dismissive alternative "because the truth makes them feel shallow and embarrassed."&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt; An article in ThoughtCatalog used the phrase in terms of the "sad, honest truth [that] I don’t deserve a woman as good as she".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/dallas-richardson/2013/11/sometimes-its-not-you-its-me-is-the-sad-honest-truth/|title=Sometimes "It’s Not You, It’s Me" Is The Sad, Honest Truth - Thought Catalog|work=Thought Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Merriam-Webster described it as a "much-reviled, often-used excuse".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"/&gt; The Huffington Post described it as "overworked and clichéd".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt; PsychologyToday argues that "Opening with "It's not you, it's me" is just going put your partner on the defensive from the start."&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9838">'''Jan Coucke''' (c.&amp;nbsp;1812 – 16 November 1860) and '''Pieter Goethals''' (c.&amp;nbsp;1826 – 16 November 1860) were two [[Flemish people|Flemings]] who were sentenced to death for murder in 1860 at a time [[Belgium]] was legally only [[French language|French]]-speaking, though the majority of the citizens spoke [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and only the official language was acknowledged by the Courts of Justice. They became an example as well as an exponent of how the French-speaking bourgeoisie (from Wallonia but also from Flanders) treated their Flemish fellow-citizens, of whom the language – if not its speakers – was considered inferior by the elite.
Later on, the real perpetrators confessed to the murder, which in 1873 led to a debate in [[Parliament of Belgium|parliament]] that ended in the ''Coremans Act'', one of the first laws to recognize Dutch as an official language in Belgium, allowing the Flemish to use their own language at Flemish courts, though not yet in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
On 23 March 1860, widow Dubois was the victim of an assault and robbery by night in [[Charleroi|Couillet near Charleroi]]. She was discovered in agony only the next day, and died of her injuries a few days later. To the village policeman, she had only been able to utter that her attackers spoke "Flemish". Consequently, the attention was drawn on two Flemings who had been making a living in the region, Jan Coucke, a forty-nine-year-old potato salesman born in [[Zwevegem|Sint-Denijs near Kortrijk]], and Pieter Goethals, a railroad worker originating from [[Aalter|Lotenhulle]] and thirty-four years of age.

Their trial in French at the [[Assize Court]] of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] in [[Mons]] started on 20 August 1860. Although both lived in [[Couillet, Belgium|Couillet]], [[Wallonia]], and spoke French for their work, they were assisted by a Dutch translator, Pierre Van Horenbeek.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lesoir.be/saga-belgica-4-30--coucke-et-goethals-condamnes_t-20080528-00G876.html |title = Coucke et Goethals, condamnés parce qu’ils étaient… coupables |publisher=Le Soir |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate =2011-09-23|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutor Charles-Victor de Bavay obtained their death sentence five days later. They were beheaded on the Grand Market Place of Charleroi a few weeks later.

In 1861, a year after the execution, 14 members of the infamous Black Gang were to appear before the same assize court. The leader of the gang, Leopold Rabet, confessed that French-speaking gang members had killed the widow Dubois. Jean-Baptiste Boucher and Auguste Leclercq confessed to having committed the murder and were sentenced to death. They also confessed that although Coucke and Goethals did not kill the widow, they were their accomplices.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;!--
In the ''Journal des Tribunaux'' of 21 November 1889, [[Jules Destrée]] held a plea for a revision of the trial. This was five years before Destrée became elected as Socialist [[Member of Parliament]] for the electoral ''[[arrondissements of Belgium#Electoral|arrondissement]]'' of Charleroi--&gt;&lt;!--NO link to 'Ar. of Ch': no longer an electoral arrondissement! and not to the city--&gt;&lt;!--, and many more years before he elated the Walloon soul and opposed the [[Flemish Movement|Flemish]] by the [[Walloon Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;

--&gt;

On 18 July 2005 at the Belgian federal parliament, [[Filip De Man]] directed a series of questions at the vice-prime minister and minister of Justice ([[Laurette Onkelinx]]), regarding the case Coucke and Goethals. His introduction stated that since 1861 there had been several attempts to officially restore the honour of Coucke and Goethals.  In 2000, [[Johan Vande Lanotte]], [[:nl:Siegfried Bracke|Siegfried Bracke]] and Geert Goedertier had still written (in ''België voor beginners. Wegwijs in het Belgisch labyrint'', p.&amp;nbsp;27, die Keure, Brugge) that Coucke and Goethals were not the murderers of the widow, but were informed on the murder.  In 1948, a study by the Flemish journalist Herman Bossier had concluded that there had not been a [[miscarriage of justice]], as according to the journalist, the declaration by Rabet included errors and two other members of the Black Gang, after their trial, had talked about the Flemish as accomplices; the interpreter would not have been a ''gendarme'' from Luxembourg, but a sworn translator of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] origin (''Nederlandse afkomst'').  On five occasions Goethals would have confessed and as chief railroad worker he had to know the French language, while Coucke sold vegetables to French-speaking customers and, having had money problems before the murder, thereafter had means of which he could not demonstrate the origin.

The Member of Parliament then asked whether the ''[[wiktionary:dossier|dossier]]'' of the trial case could be looked into by [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s or by civilians, and whether it corroborated the journalist's statements about Rabet, the interpreter, Goethals' confessions, and Coucke's financial situation.  He also wished to know whether the nine death penalties of 17 January 1862 by the same court of which seven had been reduced, were connected to the Black Gang and thus to Boucher, Leclerq, and Rabet.  Would the Minister of Justice in this case be willing to ask the advice of the Attorney General at the [[Appeal Court]] of Mons, and to ask for the revision of the verdict of 1869, or to provide reasons for not asking the latter.

The Minister replied one year later, on 24 July 2006. The confession of guilt by third parties can be considered as a ''new fact'' having taken place after the conviction, offering the possibility to review the case.  The criticism and advises that several authors may have brought forward, do not form a ground for a revision.  According to the Minister, of the mentioned elements, only the statement by Rabet form such a ground in as far it is of a nature that proves the innocence of the convicts and it has been made in circumstances giving credibility to that statement or confession.  The mentioned information however, does not offer the possibility to assess the reality, the circumstances, and the reach of the declarations by Rabet.  The ''dossier'' on the case can be viewed if the Attorney General at the Appeal Court of Mons gives his permission, even in case it is in the National Archives as it is over a hundred years old.

Initially, in the 1970s, there was no concept of having the same writer for the screenplay, story and dialogue, nor were the writers given any credits in the titles. Rajesh Khanna is credited with giving Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in ''Haathi Mere Saathi''.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-19/news-interviews/32731341_1_rajesh-khanna-consecutive-solo-superhits-record-in-indian-film&lt;/ref&gt; Javed Akhtar stated in an interview that "One day, he went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow, Aashirwad. But the film was a remake and the script of the original was far from being satisfactory. He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/features/type/view/id/3718/|title=The Magic of Haathi Mere Saathi - Latest Movie Features - Bollywood Hungama|first=Bollywood|last=Hungama|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first big success was the script for [[Andaz (1971 film)|''Andaz'']], followed by ''Adhikar'' (1971), ''[[Haathi Mere Saathi (1971 film)|Haathi Mere Saathi]]'' and ''[[Seeta Aur Geeta]]'' (1972). They also had hits with ''[[Yaadon Ki Baaraat]]'' (1973), ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''Haath Ki Safai'' (1974), ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), ''Chacha Bhatija'' (1977), ''Don'' (1978), ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978), ''Dostana'' (1980), ''[[Kranti]]'' (1981), ''[[Zamana (1985 film)|Zamana]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mr. India (1987 film)|Mr. India]]'' (1987). They have worked together in 24 films including two Kannada films – ''[[Premada Kanike]]'' and ''[[Raja Nanna Raja]]''. Of the 24 films they wrote, 20 were hits. The scripts they wrote, but which were not successful at box office include ''Aakhri Dao'' (1975), ''Immaan Dharam'' (1977), ''Kaala Patthar'' (1979) and ''Shaan'' (1980). Though they split in 1982, due to ego issues, some of the scripts they wrote were made into hit films later, such as ''Zamana'' and ''Mr. India''. Salim-Javed, many a time described as "the most successful scriptwriters of all-time",&lt;ref&gt;Sholay, through the eyes of Salim Khan, ''[http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-interview-with-salim-khan/20120228.htm]'',Rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt; are also noted to be the first scriptwriters in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]] to achieve star status.&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh Dawar (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC Encyclopaedia of Hindi cinema]'', Encyclopædia Britannica (India) Pvt.

'''Kanhu Charan Mohanty''' (11 August 1906&amp;nbsp;– 6 April 1994) was an Indian [[Odia language]] novelist who has authored fifty-six novels in a career spanning over six decades from 1930 to 1985. He is considered as "one of the most popular and celebrated novelists of [[Odisha|Odisa]]".&lt;ref name="storm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbtindia.gov.in/books_detail__1__aadan-pradan__682__the-storm.nbt|title=The Storm: Kanhu Charan Mohanty; translated by Bijay Kumar Nanda|publisher=National Book Trust|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mohanty was awarded the [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Odia|Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1958 for his novel, ''Kaa'', published in 1956, and was one of the [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|fellows]] of the [[Sahitya Akademi]]. Mohanty died on 6 April 1994 at the age of 87.

== Personal life ==
Kanhu Charan Mohanty was born on 11 August 1906 in Nagabali village of [[Sonepur State|Sonepur]], India, to an [[Odia people|Odia]] family.&lt;ref name="SAF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/library/fellowship_pdf/Shri.%20Kanhu%20Charan%20Mohanty.pdf|title=Sahitya Akademi Fellowship: Late Kanhu Charan Mohanty|format=PDF|accessdate=17 March 2017|publisher=Sahitya Akademi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbl"/&gt; He is an elder brother of [[Gopinath Mohanty]] (1914–91) who was also a [[Jnanpith Award]]-winning (1974) Odia novelist.&lt;ref name="bbl"/&gt;{{rp|299}}&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=George, K.

Later, he completed his graduattion from [[Ravenshaw College]] (now [[Ravenshaw University]]) in 1929. Mohanty joined as a clerk in Government Service and retired as a Senior Administrative Officer in 1964. Mohanty died on 6 April 1994 at the age of 87.&lt;ref name="SAF"/&gt;

== Literary works ==
Mohanty wrote his first novel ''Utshabe Byasane'' during 1923–24. However, the novel was never published and its manuscript could not be traced later.&lt;ref name="SAF"/&gt; His novels first published in 1930, ''Arana'' and ''Patalaka''.&lt;ref name="SAF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/orissaannualreference/ORA-2004/pdf/eminent_literacy_luminaries_of_orissa.pdf|title=Eminent Literary Luminaries of Orissa|format=PDF|pages=30|publisher=Government of Odisha|accessdate=19 March 2017|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}}  His 1932 published novel ''Nishpatti'' is considered as the first Oriya novel to depict the events of a marriage between a child and a widow. He published two novels in 1944, ''Bhala Paibara Sesha Katha'' and ''Tunda Baida''. ''Bhala Paibara Sesha Katha'' portrays the [[untouchability]] in the Indian society and ''Tunda Baida'' depicts the relation between a widow and her younger brother-in-law and rumors spread about them by villagers.&lt;ref name="ON3040"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2008/Sept-Octo-2008/engpdf/73-77.pdf|title=Oriya Novels in the 1930s and 1940s|format=PDF|publisher=Government of Odisha|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=2008|author=Patnaik, Jitendra Narayan}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|74–75}} While ''Haa Anna'' (1935) was set against the backdrop of [[Orissa famine of 1866]], his 1946 published novel ''Shasti'' (Punishment) depicts famine's aftermath and pestilence during the years 1866 and 1870. Both the novels portrayed the romantic love stories with social and economical inequality.&lt;ref name="ON3040"/&gt;{{rp|74–75}}&lt;ref name="Lal1992"/&gt; His [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Odia|Sahitya Akademi Award]]-winning novel  ''Kaa'' (Impersonation, 1956) deals with the subject of [[female infertility]] and [[maternal death]]. In ''Kshana Kshanake Ana '' (The World Changes Every Moment, 1975) Mohanty narrates the story of step-mothers and domestic violence.&lt;ref name="4writers"/&gt;{{rp|67}} He published fifty-six novels in a career spanning over six decades from 1930 to 1985 with ''Jaksha'' (1985) being his last published novel.&lt;ref name="SAF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ON3040"/&gt;{{rp|74–75}}

== Legacy ==
Mohanty is considered as "one of the most popular and celebrated novelists of [[Odisha|Odisa]]".&lt;ref name="storm"/&gt; He is known for depicting social realism and most of his work involved problems associated with plight of woman,&lt;ref name="storm"/&gt; caste and economic exploitation.&lt;ref name="OP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odisha.gov.in/portal/ViewDetails.asp?vchglinkid=GL012&amp;vchplinkid=PL098&amp;vchslinkid=SL069|title=Odisha Profile: Literature [Novel/Prose]|publisher=Government of Odisha|accessdate=19 March 2017|author=Mishra, Ganeswar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted that he, being a [[Dvija|upper caste]] writer, portrayed [[Dalit|lower caste]] characters in his writings.&lt;ref name="AbrahamMisrahi-Barak2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abraham, Joshil K.|author2=Misrahi-Barak, Judith |title=Dalit Literatures in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ph4-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|date=24 July 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-40880-2|pages=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148}} His novels are set around [[Geography of Odisha|coastal Odisa]].

Odia novelist and a pioneer member of Sarala Sahitya Sansad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saralasahityasansad.org/web/AboutUs.aspx|title=Sarala Sahitya Sansad: About US|accessdate=21 March 2017|publisher=Sarala Sahitya Sansad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pravakar Swain, noted that "[Mohanty's] books had a social commitment and sympathy for the insulted and the injured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1070115/asp/jamshedpur/story_7261987.asp|title=Novelist recalled in 100-yr gathering|date=15 January 2007|accessdate=21 March 2017|newspaper=The Telgraph (Calcutta)|location=Cuttack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic depiction of novels ==
Some of Mohanty's novels were later made into films. 1965 [[Cinema of Odisha|Odia film]] ''Abhinetri'' (The Actress) is based on his 1947 published novel by the same name and marked first occurrence of [[Dual role]], played by Jharna Das, in Odia cinema. Another novel ''Kaa'' (1956) was later made into a film ''[[Kaa (film)|Kaa]]'' (1966). The film was awarded the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Odia|Certificate of Merit for the Best Feature Film in Odia]] at [[14th National Film Awards]]. ''Tunda Baida'' (Gossip, 1944) was also made into a film in 1987 by the same name.&lt;ref name="GokulsingDissanayake2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gokulsing, K.

== Awards ==
Mohanty won several awards for his literary work. He won the [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Odia|Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1958 for ''Kaa'', the Jeevan Rang Prize in 1970, and the Neela Saila Award in 1992. On 4 February 1994, the [[Sahitya Akademi]], India's National Academy of Letters, selected him as its [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|fellow]], the highest honour conferred by the Akademi; however, Mohanty died on 6 April 1994 before the honour could formally be conferred upon him.&lt;ref name="SAF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/aboutus/about.jsp|title=Sahitya Akademi: About Us|accessdate=23 March 2017|publisher=Sahitya Akademi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">A '''morphogram''' is the representation of a [[morpheme]] by a [[grapheme]] based solely on its meaning. [[Kanji]] and [[hanja]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} are two writing systems that make use of '''morphograms''', where Chinese characters were borrowed to represent native morphemes because of their meanings. Thus, a single character can represent a variety of morphemes which originally all had the same meaning. An example of this in Japanese would be the grapheme 東 [east], which can be read as ''higashi'' or ''azuma'', in addition to its [[logographic]] representation of the morpheme ''tō''. Additionally, in Japanese, the logographic (Chinese-derived) reading is called the ''on'', and the morphographic reading (native Japanese) is called the ''kun''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23028">Success in second language learning is often related to the concept of ‘motivation’. Motivation is the most used concept for explaining the failure or success of a language learner&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. [[Second language]] (L2) refers to a language an individual learns that is not his/her [[mother tongue]], but is of use in the area of the individual.  It is not the same as a [[foreign language]], which is a language learned that is not generally spoken in the individual’s area. In research on [[motivation]], it is considered to be an internal process that gives behavior energy, direction and persistence in research (in other words, it gives behavior strength, purpose, and sustainability).&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeve|first1=Johnmarshall|title=Understanding motivation and emotion|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Learning a new language takes time and dedication. Once you do, being fluent in a second language offers numerous benefits and opportunities. Learning a second language is exciting and beneficial at all ages. It offers practical, intellectual and many aspirational benefits.
In learning a language, there can be one or more goals – such as mastery of the language or communicative competence – that vary person to person. There are a number of '''language learner motivation''' models that were developed and postulated in fields such as [[linguistics]] and [[sociolinguistics]], with relations to [[second-language acquisition]] in a classroom setting. The different perspectives on L2 motivation can be divided into three distinct phases: the social psychological period, the cognitive-situated period and the process-oriented period.&lt;ref name="Dornyei"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dörnyei|first1=Z.|title=The psychology of the language learner: Individual differences in second language acquisition|date=2005|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The social psychological period==
[[Social psychological]] perspectives on L2 learning motivation emphasize the role of the individuals’ social context and social interactions. The social psychological period in L2 motivation research flourished in the bilingual context of Canada from 1959 through 1990 ([[Zoltán Dörnyei|Dörnyei]], 2005; Ushioda, 2012).&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ushioda"&gt;Ushioda, E. (2012) Motivation: L2 learning as a special case? In S. Mercer, S. Ryan, &amp; M. Williams (Eds.), Psychology for language learning (pp. 58-73). Basingstoke, HA: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Gardner developed the socio-educational model while Clément and colleagues explored the theory of linguistic self-confidence.

===The socio-educational model===

R.C. Gardner formulated the socio-educational model suggesting that learning an L2 cannot be solely explained by people’s [[aptitude]] or their competency to acquire as many languages.&lt;ref name="Gardner1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=R. C.|title=Social psychology and second language learning: The role of attitudes and motivation|date=1985|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted that individual differences were key factors affecting L2 acquisition such that in understanding how the L2 learning process and outcomes work, it is important to consider the cultural contexts, which influence people’s attitude and motivation in learning another culturally distinct language.&lt;ref name=Gardner1959&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=R. C.|last2=Lambert|first2=W. E.|title=Motivational variables in second-language acquisition|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology|date=1959|volume=13|pages=266–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; By simply regarding aptitude as the only factor, researchers dismiss the social, contextual and pragmatic reasons that drive people to learn other languages.&lt;ref name=Gardner1985 /&gt;

The original socio-educational model (1979) proposed that there are two main factors that influence L2 performance: aptitude, and motivation in learning.&lt;ref name=Gardner1985 /&gt; The model, however, placed more emphasis on the motivation factor because Gardner was interested in how people succeeded in acquiring L2 even when it seemed that their competency/aptitude is below average. This meant that motivation played a bigger role in driving those people to learn an L2.&lt;ref name=Gardner1985 /&gt; The model then attempted to explain that these motivational factors took place in the sites where
L2 learning occurs: the formal site (i.e. the educational context), and the informal site (i.e. the cultural context). Gardner argued that these two contexts play distinct roles in boosting the learner’s L2 performance in that the educational context became a place where explicit instruction and correction occurs, whereas the cultural context was an area allowing the learners to become immersed in the other culture without placing any specific rules or instructions.&lt;ref name="Gardner2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=R. C.|title=The socio-educational model of second language acquisition|journal=Canadian Issues|date=2011|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ways, the learners become increasingly knowledgeable and more confident with the social and cultural settings behind the L2, and these motivate them to learn L2 even more. Upon this transition, linguistic and non-linguistic outcomes emerge. In the linguistic component, learners tend to develop L2 proficiency and fluency, whereas in the non-linguistic outcomes, they undergo changes in attitudes towards the culture where the L2 came from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sajid-us-Salam, M. |year=2008|title= Gardner’s Early Socio-Educational Model (Powerpoint Slides)|url=http://www.slideshare.net/cupidlucid/gardners-early-soci-educational-model-presentation?next_slideshow=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of L2 acquisition starts from the social milieu where learners have initial attitudes towards the culture behind the L2; these preset beliefs were acquired from their own cultures.&lt;ref name=Gardner1959 /&gt;
The social milieu, in turn, influences the strategies, which individuals use in acquiring the L2. After knowing the individual differences in L2 acquisition, it is important to consider the context of learning (i.e. educational or cultural) because they improve L2 performance through direct (i.e. explicit instruction) and indirect (i.e. cultural immersion) means.&lt;ref name=Gardner2011 /&gt; Finally, when the learners have already acquired experience and knowledge of the L2, they gain varying positive outcomes such as fluency and appreciation of the other culture.&lt;ref name=Gardner1985 /&gt;

===Revisions of the socio-cultural educational model===

The model has undergone numerous revisions to capture the sub-processes underlying in each of the individual factors. In 1985, Gardner introduced three sub-measures namely the intensity, the desire to learn and the attitude towards learning to explain the motivation factor.&lt;ref name="Dornyei1998"&gt;Dörnyei, Z.  (1998). Motivation in second and foreign language learning. Language Teaching, 31 (3), 117-135.&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner argued that if these three criteria work together, the learner could effectively use motivation as a tool for L2 acquisition.&lt;ref name=Dornyei1998 /&gt; Dornyei and other researchers, however, assert that this is not the case; they contend that one can have a ‘strong’ desire to learn, but have a different attitude towards the learning process itself.&lt;ref name=Dornyei1998 /&gt; Nevertheless, some researches still claim the attitude towards learning has a high predictive capacity because attitude has a strong association with direct behavior (i.e. learning).&lt;ref name=Dornyei1998 /&gt; From 1993 to 2010, the model’s schema was rigorously changed to encompass the variability in the external factors affecting L2 learning; the term “social milieu” became “the external factors”.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, R. C. &amp; Macintyre, P. D. (1993). On the measurement of affective variables in second language learning. Language Learning, 43,157-94.&lt;/ref&gt; More characteristics were added to describe the variables affecting each of the individual factors; these were compiled in the Attitude Motivation Test Battery developed by Gardner.

====Attitude Motivation Test Battery ====

Gardner also created the Attitude Motivation Test Battery (AMTB) to quantitatively measure the four main factors and their sub-units, and to predict L2 performance/outcome of the learning.&lt;ref name=Gardner2011 /&gt; The test generally instructs participants to rate a set of statements on a scale of 1 to 7 (i.e. least likely to most likely), and on a 6-level Likert Scale (i.e. strongly disagree to strongly agree).&lt;ref name="Garnder2004"&gt;Gardner, R. C. (2004). Attitude/motivation test battery: International AMTB research project. Canada: The University of Western Ontario.&lt;/ref&gt; Different statements correspond to a certain variable (or main factor), and scores from those sets are added up to determine how much of that variable is influencing the language learning of the participants.&lt;ref name=Garnder2004 /&gt; Like the model, however, the test has also been revised over the years. In Gardner’s review of the Socio-educational Model, he named the four overarching variables which are measured in the AMTB: (1) integrativeness, (2) attitude toward learning situation, (3) motivation and (4) language anxiety.&lt;ref name=Gardner2011 /&gt; Other variables such as the instrumental orientation and parental encouragement in the AMTB are used in different settings or as needed.

=====''Integrativeness''&lt;ref name=Gardner2011 /&gt;=====

The integrativeness variable (also known as the integrative motive) reflect the cultural context of L2 learning as it attempts to measure how open a learner is to the other culture that primarily uses L2. The AMTB assesses this variable by accounting for the extent to which the learner is generally interested in foreign languages, as well as his/her preset attitudes towards the community where the L2 comes from. It also accounts for the integrative orientation of the individual or the social and cultural reasons why the individual learns the L2.

=====''Attitude toward learning situation''&lt;ref name=Gardner2011 /&gt;=====

Contrary to integrativeness, the attitude towards learning situation accounts for the education context of L2 acquisition and the affective facts that correspond with it. The AMTB measures this variable by asking the individual to evaluate the teacher and the course in the educational context. This determines how much the educational context aids in improving L2 performance.

=====''Motivation''&lt;ref name=Gardner2011 /&gt;=====

Motivation, in the AMTB, is assessed through the combination of  the desire to learn, attitude towards learning, and motivational intensity. While integrativeness and attitude toward the learning situation target each site of learning, motivation accounts for both contexts as well as the affective variables (i.e. individual differences) that influence the two contexts.

=====''Language anxiety''&lt;ref name=Gardner2011 /&gt;=====

In the AMTB, language anxiety is an affective variable, which corresponds to what the individuals feel when ‘performing’ the L2. In the AMTB, it is measured by determining how anxious the learner feels when in the classroom or when using the language in general.

===Linguistic self-confidence===
Clément and his associates investigated the importance of social contextual factors on L2 acquisition.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; Of these social contextual factors, Dörnyei (2005)&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; argues linguistic self-confidence plays the most important role in motivation in learning a second language. Linguistic self-confidence refers to a person’s perceptions of their own competence and ability to accomplish tasks successfully.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;Clement, R. (1980). Ethnicity, contact and communicative competence in a second language. In H. Giles, W. P. Robinson &amp; P. M Smith (Eds.), Language: Social psychological perspectives (pp. 147-154). Oxford: Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt; This linguistic self-confidence is established through the interaction between the language learner and members of the language community, and strengthened based on the quality and quantity of these interactions.&lt;ref name=Clement /&gt; In multi-linguistic communities, self-confidence fosters language learners’ identification with the language community and increases their willingness to pursue learning that language.&lt;ref name=Clement /&gt;

==The cognitive-situated period==

[[Cognitive]] perspectives focus on how the learners’ mental processes influence their motivation. During the late 1980s and 1990s, emphasis in the language learning motivation field shifted towards cognitive models, reflecting the “cognitive revolution” taking place in psychology at the time.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; Cognitive psychologists argued that how one thinks about one’s abilities, possibilities, potentials, limitations, and past performances has major influences on motivation.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; Thus, L2 motivation models shifted away from the broad social psychological perspectives, while more narrow-viewed microperspectives emerged.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; During this time, note-worthy contributions were made by Noels and colleagues through a self-determination theory-based model of language learning motivation, Ushioda through attribution theory, as well as Williams and Burden with their social constructivist model.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt;

===Self-determination theory===

The self-determination theory focuses on the intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of motivation.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; Noels and colleagues explored this theory in the language learning context and developed the Language Learning Orientations Scale which categorizes a person’s motivational orientation as either intrinsic, extrinsic, or amotivated based on a continuum of self-determination.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; In this line of research it was found that in the language learning classroom, teachers that were autonomy supportive and non-controlling promoted intrinsic and self-determined orientations of motivation in students.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt;

===Attribution theory===

Attribution theory contends that the causal reasons we attribute to our past successes or failures plays a critical role in our motivation in future endeavors in that area.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; Consistent with this theory, Ushioda identified two attributional patterns associated with positive motivational outcomes in language learning.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; The first involves attributing one’s successes in learning the language to personal factors, while the second involves attributing one’s failures to temporary forces which may be overcome.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt;

===Social constructivist model===

This cognitive perspective arose from a supposed “constructivist movement” that stemmed mostly from the work of [[Jean Piaget]] and that also encompassed personal construct psychology (developed by [[George Kelly (psychologist)]]).&lt;ref name="WilliamsBurden"&gt;Williams, M., &amp; Burden, R. L. (1997). Psychology for teachers. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This model suggests a constructive nature of the learning process as emphasized by Piaget, this assumes that people are actively involved in constructing personal meaning right from birth.&lt;ref name=WilliamsBurden /&gt; This brings the learner into central focus in learning theory as everyone is  constructing their own sense of the world, which is key to the constructivist perspective.&lt;ref name=WilliamsBurden /&gt;

The learner is in control of his/her learning as a result of his/her cognitive processing and organizing, and the context in which he/she is learning.&lt;ref name=WilliamsBurden /&gt; This means that the individual who is learning is in control of what he/she learns based on the way he/she think, and the immediate environment he/she is in as well as any internal factors (mood, preoccupation, motivation, etc.). Four key elements (the learner(s), the teacher, the task, and the context) are outlined by this model as affecting the teaching-learning process as they interact with and act on each other.&lt;ref name=WilliamsBurden /&gt;

====''Framework of motivation in L2 learning''====

Using the social constructivist model, Marion Williams and Robert L. Burden developed a framework of motivation in language learning as an attempt to summarize motivational factors relevant to L2 learning in the classroom setting. This framework placed an emphasis on contextual influences, and it categorized motivational factors in terms of learner-internal and external factors.&lt;ref&gt;Dörnyei, Z., &amp; Ushioda, E. (2013). Teaching and researching: Motivation. (2nd ed.). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The framework is shown below:

==The process-oriented period==

With the rise of cognitive approaches to L2 learning motivation, researchers began to focus on the dynamic character of motivation. The models of the process-oriented period explore the short-term and long-term changes in the individuals’ motivation as they learn L2.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; This approach views motivation as a dynamic factor which fluctuates within a class period, a year, and a lifetime.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; Models from this period include the process model and the motivational self-system.
 
===Process model===

[[Zoltán Dörnyei|Dörnyei]] and Ottό developed a process model of L2 learning marked by three distinct, chronological stages: the preactional stage, the actional stage, and the postactional stage.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; The preactional stage involves the initial choice to begin learning a second language and creating goals for oneself.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; This stage is associated with setting goals, forming intentions, and launching action.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; During the preactional phase, the major motivational influences are the values associated with L2 learning, attitudes towards the L2-speaking community, learners’ expectations and beliefs, and environmental support.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; The actional stage includes sustaining one’s level of motivation throughout the language-learning process.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; This stage involves generating and carrying out subtasks, appraising one’s achievement, and self-regulation.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; During the actional stage the major motivational influences are the quality of the L2 learning experience, sense of autonomy as an L2 learner, teachers’ and parents’ influence, and usage of self-regulatory strategies. Lastly, the postactional stage involves retrospection and self-reflection on the language learning experience and outcomes.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; This stage entails forming causal attributions, elaborating standards and strategies, and dismissing the intention and further planning.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; During the postactional stage the major motivational influences are the learners’ attributional styles and biases, self-concept beliefs, and received feedback during the L2 learning process.&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt;

===Motivational self system===
After developing the process model, [[Zoltán Dörnyei|Dörnyei]] (2005)&lt;ref name=Dornyei /&gt; designed the motivational self-system of L2 learning. The L2 motivational self-system forms links with conceptualizations of L2 motivation by Noels (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Noels, K. A. (2003). Learning Spanish as a second language: Learners' orientations and perceptions of their teachers' communication style. In Z. Dörnyei (Ed.), Attitudes, orientations, and motivations in language learning (pp. 97-136). Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ushioda (2001).&lt;ref&gt;Ushioda, E. (2001). Language learning at university: Exploring the role of motivational thinking. In Z. Dörnyei &amp; R. Schmidt (Eds.), Motivation and second language acquisition (pp. 91-124). Honolulu, HI: University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This motivational self-system has three components: the ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self, and L2 learning experience.&lt;ref name="Dornyei2009"&gt;Dörnyei, Z. (2009) The psychology of second language acquisition. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal L2 self is a person’s imagined ideal future self as a second language speaker.&lt;ref name=Ushioda /&gt; This ideal L2 self promotes motivation by inspiring the present self to strive to become the ideal self, which promotes integrative and internalized instrumental motivation in language learning.&lt;ref name=Dornyei2009 /&gt; The ought-to L2 self includes the attributions a person believes they should have in order to meet expectations or avoid negative outcomes, which is associated with extrinsic motivational orientations.&lt;ref name=Dornyei2009 /&gt; The L2 learning experience component includes the situational and environmental aspects of the language learning process as well as one’s subjective learning experience.&lt;ref name=Dornyei2009 /&gt;

'''Motivation and Context''' 

Motivation and its constructs are context dependent and therefore, any language learning context has its own unique motivational model. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jodai|first=Hojat|last2=Zafarghandi|first2=Amir Mahda Vi|last3=Tous|first3=Maryam Danaye|date=2013-01-01|title=Motivation, Integrativeness, Organizational Influence, Anxiety, and English Achievement|url=https://doi.org/10.1524/glot.2013.0012|journal=Glottotheory|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1524/glot.2013.0012|issn=2196-6907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Context|date=February 2016}}
In [[computing]], [[software]] or [[data type|data formats]] that are '''native''' to a system are those that the system supports with  minimal [[computational overhead]] and additional components. This word is used in such terms as '''''native [[mode (computer interface)|mode]]''''' and '''''native [[machine code|code]]'''''.

== Applications ==
Something running on a [[computer]] natively means that it is running without any external layer requiring fewer software layers. For example, in [[Microsoft Windows]] the [[Native API]] is an [[application programming interface]] specific for [[Windows NT]] kernel, which can be used to give access to some kernel functions, which cannot be directly accessed through a more universal [[Windows API]].

== Operating systems ==
Used to designate the lowest level of virtualization or the absence of virtualization. For instance the term “Native VM” is used to ensure reference to the lowest level operating system, the one that actually maintains direct control of the hardware when multiple levels of virtualization occur.

== Machine code ==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
Native [[operating system]], '''native''' [[instruction set]], etc., in application to a computer [[central processing unit|processor]] means that the corresponding item was implemented specifically for the given model of the computer or [[microprocessor]], as opposed to [[Emulator|emulation]] or [[compatibility mode]].

== Data ==
{{expand section|date=February 2012}}
Applied to [[data (computing)|data]], native [[data type|data formats]] or [[communication protocol]]s are those supported by a certain [[computer hardware]] or software, with maximal consistency and minimal amount of additional components. 

For example, [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and [[VGA]] video adapters ''natively'' support [[code page 437]]. This does not preclude supporting other [[code page]]s, but it requires either a [[VGA-compatible text mode#Fonts|font uploading]] or using [[All Points Addressable|graphic modes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4517">'''Old Church Slavonic''' was the main language used for administrative (until the 16th century) and liturgical purposes (until the 17th century) by the Romanian principalities, being still occasionally used in the [[History of Christianity in Romania|Orthodox Church]] until the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Panaitescu, Petre P., ''Începuturile şi biruinţa scrisului în limba română'', 1965&lt;/ref&gt;
__NOTOC__
== Characteristics ==

The language, while based on [[Old Church Slavonic]], was influenced by the Slavic languages used by surrounding peoples. The most important influences were from Middle and Modern [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], with some smaller influences from [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (in [[Wallachia]]) and [[Russian language|Russian]] (in [[Moldavia]]). Starting with the 15th century, the language was also influenced by [[Romanian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Costăchel et al., p.504-505&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

After the [[Slavic migrations]], Slavonic became the liturgical language of the Eastern Orthodox Church in present-day Romania, under the influence of the South Slavic feudal states. The exact timing of this change happened is not known, but it was probably in the 10th century.&lt;ref name="georgescu66"&gt;Georgescu, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; While the language was not understood by most Romanians, it was a language known by the bishops, the monks, some of the priests, the clerks, the merchants, the boyars and the Prince.&lt;ref&gt;Costăchel et al., p.505-506; 513&lt;/ref&gt;

Old Church Slavonic was also used as a [[literary language]], for example in [[chronicle]]s, story-books, law codexes (known as ''pravila''), property documents (''hrisov''), decrees of the voivodes or boyars, diplomatic correspondence and sometimes even in private letters.&lt;ref&gt;Costăchel et al., p.505&lt;/ref&gt; It also led to an integration of the written Romanian culture into the Slavic culture of the neighbours.&lt;ref name="georgescu66"/&gt;

The earliest contracts (''zapis'') to be written in Romanian rather than Slavonic date from 1575-1590 and by 1655-1660, all the administrative documents at the Princely Courts of both Wallachia and Moldavia were written in Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Costăchel et al., p.513&lt;/ref&gt;

The replacement of Slavonic religious texts with Romanian versions began with the first translations in [[Maramureş|Máramaros (now Maramureş)]] in the late 15th century, further translations being created in Transylvania after the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Costăchel et al., p.511&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wallachia]], the gospels were translated into the vernacular between 1512-1518 and by the middle of the 16th century, the earliest religious works were printed, while the first complete bible in Romanian being print in Bucharest in 1688.&lt;ref name="georgescu66"/&gt;

Nevertheless, the Orthodox Church opposed the changes and the Metropolitan [[printing presses]] continued to print Church Slavonic books until 1731 in Moldavia and 1745 in Wallachia.&lt;ref name="georgescu67"&gt;Georgescu, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and assessments==
[[Coresi]], the printer of the first Romanian-language book, saw in 1564 no good in the usage of Old Church Slavonic as a liturgical language, as the priests speak to the people in a foreign language, arguing that all the other peoples have the [[Religious text|word of God]] in their language, except for the Romanians.&lt;ref name="georgescu66"/&gt; [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], a Moldavian scholar who published the first novel in Romanian, saw the usage of Old Church Slavonic as a "barbarism", which caused a cultural regression.&lt;ref name="georgescu67"/&gt;

However, there were some cultural accomplishments done in the Old Church Slavonic language, such as a number of chronicles and historiographical works in Moldavia or [[Neagoe Basarab]]'s Teachings to his son Theodosie.&lt;ref name="georgescu68"&gt;Georgescu, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prayer of the Apostle Paul''' is a [[New Testament apocrypha]]l work, the first manuscript from the Jung Codex (Codex I) of the [[Nag Hammadi Library]]. It seems to have been added to the codex after the longer tractates had been copied. Although the text, like the rest of the codices, is written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], the title is written in [[Greek language|Greek]], which was the original language of the text. The manuscript is missing approximately two lines at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Dieter, "The Prayer of the Apostle Paul (Introduction)", from ''The Nag Hammadi Library'', [[James M. Robinson]] (ed.), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

This text is clearly [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] and was not written by the historic [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]]. It shows a distinctive [[Gnostic]] appeal unlike prayers in letters known to have come from Paul. Many scholars have dubbed it as a [[Valentinius|Valentinian]] work due to characteristic phrases such as the "psychic God"—this would indicate that it was composed between 150 and 300 AD; if it is not of Valentinian origin it could date from as early as 75.&lt;ref&gt;Hal Taussig, ed., ''A New New Testament'', {{ISBN|978-0-547-79210-1}}, page 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have found parallels to many other works which may be partial sources, including [[Corpus Hermeticum]], the [[Three Steles of Seth]], the [[Gospel of Philip]], and the authentic Pauline letters.

'''Red chips''' stocks ({{zh|t=紅籌股|s=红筹股|p=hóngchóugǔ|y=hung4 chau4 gu2}}) are the stocks of [[mainland China]] companies [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] outside mainland China and [[listed company|listed]] in [[Hong Kong]]. These [[business]]es are based in mainland China and controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the central, provincial or municipal governments of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] but listed in Hong Kong to allow overseas investment in the companies.

[[Image:RegistrationMark.png|right|thumb|A registration mark showing a slight misalignment of the printing heads, resulting in subtle color hues visible around the edges of the black area (click image to zoom in).]]
In [[CMYK]] printing, '''registration black''' refers to 100% coverage in each of the four process colors: cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and [[black]] (K).&lt;ref name="regmarks"&gt;{{cite book | title=Intelligent Vision Systems for Industry | publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |author1=Batchelor, Bruce |author2=Whelan, Paul | year=2012 | pages=12 | isbn=9781447104315}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, if a different mixture of colors is being used, registration black marks in each of the colorants (inks) used.

It is therefore not correct to simply define registration color as 100% of C,M,Y,K, since it will rather be 100% of whichever colors are used in reproduction.&lt;ref name="regmarks"/&gt;

It is a special purpose color, and as such is not generally used to print black text or [[grayscale]] graphics.

Instead, registration black is used for printing crop marks, or "registration marks".  When proofs for each color are generated on separate pieces of film, use of registration black makes crop marks visible on all channels, providing a useful reference for alignment. A thin line printed in registration black can also be used to check whether the printing plates are lined up.

==PostScript==
The [[PostScript]] printer description languages supports registration black, starting with PostScript language level 2. This is done by referring to a [[spot color]] with the special name '''All'''. This never generates a spot plate. Instead it marks all of the plates that are there.  The All color space can be used with a tint value between 0.0 (no mark) to 1.0 (full intensity). Generally, only 1.0 would be used.

The name "All" might not be used in the user interface of a design program, especially outside English language speaking areas. However, the spot color must have the exact name "All". As a side effect, it is impossible in PostScript to create a normal spot plate with this name.

==PDF==
The [[Portable document format]] (PDF) also includes a spot color called '''All''', with the same restrictions, starting with PDF 1.2. Note that a PDF spot color must also include a "tint transform" which translates spot values into a different [[color space]] for viewing on screen, or printing to printers without spot color support. There is no special rule for the name "All", so PDF creators must include a tint transform that converts to black in some color space, in order to maintain the same appearance as the final printed piece.

'''''Scientific wild-ass guess''''' ('''SWAG''') is an [[American English]] slang term meaning a rough estimate made by an expert in the field, based on experience and intuition. It is similar to the slang word ''[[guesstimate]]'', a [[portmanteau]] of ''guess'' and ''estimate''.&lt;ref name=Lasky/&gt;

==History==
The slang term "SWAG" is generally thought to have originated in the US military, either the [[United States Army|Army]]&lt;ref name=Safire&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pj2MsS3v0DYC&amp;pg=PA95 |pages=95–96 |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |title=No Uncertain Terms: More Writing from the Popular "On Language" Column in The New York Times Magazine |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2004 |isbn=0743258126}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].&lt;ref name=AcronymSWAG&gt;{{cite web |title=Acronym Finder |url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/SWAG.html |accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Melvin J. Lasky]] wrote that it was first used casually by US Army General [[William Westmoreland]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Westmoreland would sometimes reply "SWAG" to reporters' questions about American failure to neutralize the enemy.&lt;ref name=Lasky&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jRyAtavVVsC&amp;pg=PA106 |page=106 |first=Melvin J. |last=Lasky |authorlink=Melvin J. Lasky |title=The Language of Journalism: Profanity, obscenity &amp; the media |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2005 |isbn=0765802201 |volume=2 |series=The Language of Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Westmoreland's use of the term was affirmed in court by Colonel John Frank Stewart in November 1984 during witness testimony for the lawsuit initiated by Westmoreland against CBS for their TV documentary ''[[The Uncounted Enemy|The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception]]''. On the witness stand, Stewart explained that in Vietnam, the military intelligence branch that he commanded would deliver numbers of enemy strength to Westmoreland, the numbers derived from "the SWAG principle".&lt;ref name=Safire1999/&gt; There was laughter in the court when Stewart explained what was meant by the acronym ''SWAG''.&lt;ref name=Safire1999&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-4-25-99-on-language-eye-roller.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |last=Safire |first=William |authorlink=William Safire |title=The Way We Live Now: 4-25-99 - On Language; Eye Roller |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=April 25, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier use of term is mentioned by linguist J. Robert Dumouchel who wrote the 1975 book, ''Dictionary of Development Terminology''. Dumouchel says he first encountered SWAG "in the vernacular of community development" in the US in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Safire/&gt;

Regardless of its origin, the term gained greater prominence in the first half of 1999 in connection with the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]. Reporter [[John F. Harris]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' was the first person to put the term into a newspaper article. Describing the factors that led to President [[Bill Clinton]] relying on the US Air Force in Kosovo instead of employing "200,000 NATO troops",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/april99/clinton040199.htm |title=Clinton Saw No Alternative to Airstrikes |last=Harris |first=John F. |authorlink=John F. Harris |work=Washington Post |date=April 1, 1999 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris wrote that NATO's estimate requiring 200,000 ground troops was regarded by American war planners as politically impossible to achieve; it was quickly removed from consideration. "NATO's analysis, officials said, was not a comprehensive study. Instead, it was an initial review that some officials called a 'SWAG'—military parlance for a 'scientific wild-ass guess.'"&lt;ref name=Safire1999/&gt;

==Use==
SWAG is used to describe an estimate derived from a combination of factors including past experience, general impressions, and [[heuristic]] or approximate calculations rather than an [[exhaustive search]], [[proof (truth)|proof]], or rigorous calculation. The SWAG is an educated guess but is not regarded as the best or most accurate estimate.&lt;ref name=Safire/&gt; The SWAG is not computed or proven rigorously, but the proponent asserts his or her own judgement suffices to rationalize the estimate; and it may, in time, be viable to produce a rigorous [[forecasting|forecast]] of increased precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com |url=http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/WAG-estimate |accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other [[backronym]]s of ''SWAG'' have been published, including "sophisticated wild-ass guess", "Silly Wild-Ass Guess", "Semi-Wild-Ass Guess", "Stupid Wild-Ass Guess", and "Scientific Wildly Aimed Guess".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hTCpx9VUF8C&amp;pg=PA100 |page=100 |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide To Project Management With Microsoft Project 2003 |last=Black |first=Ron |publisher=Penguin |year=2005 |isbn=1592573088}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Scientific" implies that the "guess" can be justified if necessary or cost-effective.&lt;ref name=AcronymSWAG/&gt; A guess of lesser worth may be called the "Wild-Ass Guess" or "WAG", and an even rougher estimate may be called "[[Back-of-the-envelope calculation|Back of the Envelope]]" (BOTE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCYOPuIpJmQC&amp;pg=PA164 |series=For Dummies |title=Cash Flow For Dummies |pages=164–165 |first1=John A. |last1=Tracy |first2=Tage |last2=Tracy |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2011 |isbn=1118018508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary succession''' is one of the two types [[ecological succession]] of a plants life. As opposed to the first, [[primary succession]], secondary succession is a process started by an event (e.g. [[forest fire]], [[harvest]]ing, [[hurricane]], etc.) that reduces an already established [[ecosystem]] (e.g. a forest or a wheat field) to a smaller population of species, and as such secondary succession occurs on preexisting [[soil]] whereas [[primary succession]] usually occurs in a place lacking soil. Many factors can affect secondary succession, such as trophic interaction, initial composition, and competition-colonization trade-offs.&lt;ref name = "Cook"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = W.M. | last2 = Yao | first2 = J. | last3 = Forster | first3 = B.L. | last4 = Holt | first4 = R.D. | last5 = Patricks | first5 = L.B. | year = 2005 | title = Secondary succession in an experimentally fragmented landscape: Community pattern across space and time | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 1267–1279 | doi=10.1890/04-0320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factors that control the increase in abundance of a species during succession may be determined mainly by seed production and dispersal, micro climate; landscape structure (habitat patch size and distance to outside seed sources);&lt;ref name = "Cook"/&gt; bulk density, pH, and soil texture (sand and clay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Kamp | first1 = J. | last2 = Yassir | first2 = I. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Soil carbon changes upon secondary succession in ''Imperata'' grasslands (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) | url = | journal = Geoderma | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.11.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, secondary succession is the ecological succession that occurs after the initial succession has been disrupted and some plants and animals still exist. It is usually faster than primary succession 
# [[Soil]] is already present
# [[Seeds]], [[root]]s and underground [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative organs]] of plants may still survive in the soil.

==Examples==

=== Imperata ===
[[Imperata cylindrica|''Imperata'']] grasslands are caused by human  activities such as logging, forest clearing for shifting cultivation, agriculture and grazing, and also by frequent fires. The latter is a frequent result of human interference.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, K., Hatta, G., Halim, H., Mangalik, A., 1996. Ecology of Kalimantan. The ecology of Indonesia Seri Vol. III&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when not maintained by frequent fires and human disturbances, they regenerate naturally and speedily to secondary young forest. The time of succession in ''Imperata'' grassland  (for example in Samboja Lestari area), ''Imperata cylindrica'' has the highest coverage but it becomes less dominant from the fourth year onwards. While ''Imperata'' decreases, the percentage of shrubs and young trees clearly increases with time. In the burned plots, ''Melastoma malabathricum, Eupatorium inulaefolium, Ficus'' sp., and ''Vitex pinnata''. strongly increase with the age of regeneration, but these species are commonly found in the secondary forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yassir | first1 = I. | last2 = Van der Kamp | first2 = J. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2010 | title = Secondary succession after fire in Imperata grasslands of East Kalimantan, Indonesia | url = | journal = Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | volume = 137 | issue = | pages = 172–182 | doi=10.1016/j.agee.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil properties change during secondary succession in Imperata grassland area. The effects of secondary succession on soil are strongest in the A-horizon (0–10&amp;nbsp;cm), where an increase in carbon stock, N, and C/N ratio, and a decrease in bulk density and pH are observed.  Soil carbon stocks also increase upon secondary succession from ''Imperata'' grassland to secondary forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Kamp | first1 = J. | last2 = Yassir | first2 = I. | last3 = Buurman | first3 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Soil carbon changes upon secondary succession in Imperata grasslands (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) | url = | journal = Geoderma | volume = 149 | issue = | pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2008.11.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oak and hickory forest ===
A classic example of secondary succession occurs in [[oak]] and [[hickory]] forests cleared by wildfire. Wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. Their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form of ash. Thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold. Before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. Their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. After the fire, though, these trees are no longer dominant. Thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. Due to, at least in part, changes in the environment brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees. These organisms are called intermediate species. Eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. This equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cnx.org/contents/GFy_h8cu@10.117:d0xglyLD@4/Community-Ecology|title=45.6 Community Ecology|last=|first=|date=|website=OpenStax CNX|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-fire succession==
{{details|Fire ecology}}

===Soil===
Generation of carbonates from burnt plant material following fire disturbance causes an initial increase in soil pH that can affect the rate of secondary succession, as well as what types of organisms will be able to thrive. Soil composition prior to fire disturbance also influences secondary succession, both in rate and type of dominant species growth. For example, high sand concentration was found to increase the chances of primary ''Pteridium'' over ''Imperata'' growth in ''Imperata'' grassland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yassir|first1=I.|title=Secondary succession after fire in Imperata grasslands of East Kalimantan, Indonesia|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|date=15 April 2010|volume=137|pages=172–182|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The byproducts of combustion have been shown to affect secondary succession by soil microorganisms. For example, certain fungal species such as ''Trichoderma polysporum'' and ''Penicillium janthinellum'' have a significantly decreased success rate in spore germination within fire-affected areas, reducing their ability to recolonize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Widden|first1=P.|title=The effects of a forest fire on soil microfungi|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date=March 1975|volume=7|issue=2|pages=125–138|doi=10.1016/0038-0717(75)90010-3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071775900103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===
Vegetation structure is affected by fire. In some types of ecosystems this creates a process of renewal. Following a fire, early successional species disperse and establish first. This is then followed by late successional species. Species that are fire intolerant are those that are more flammable and are desolated by fire. More tolerant species are able to survive or disperse in the event of fire. The occurrence of fire leads to the establishment of deadwood and [[Snag (ecology)|snags]] in forests. This creates habitat and resources for a variety of species.
Fire can act as a seed dispersing stimulant. Many species require fire events to reproduce, disperse, and establish. For example, the knobcone pine ("Pinus attenuata") has closed cones that open for dispersal when exposed to heat caused by forest fires. This particular conifer grows in clusters because of this limited method of seed dispersal. A tough fire resistant outer bark and lack of low branches help the knobcone pine survive fire with minimal damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burczyk|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Adams|first2=W.

A '''semi-automatic pistol''' is a type of [[pistol]] that is [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], meaning it uses the energy of the fired cartridge to cycle the action of the firearm and advance the next available cartridge into position for firing.  One [[ammunition|cartridge]] is fired each time the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] of a semi-automatic pistol is pulled; the pistol's "disconnector" ensures this behavior.

Additional terms sometimes used as synonyms for a semi-automatic pistol are '''automatic pistol''', '''self-loading pistol''', '''autopistol''', and '''autoloading pistol'''.

A semi-automatic pistol harnesses the energy of one shot to reload the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]] for the next.  After a round is fired, the spent casing is ejected and a new round from the [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] is loaded into the chamber, allowing another shot to be fired as soon as the trigger is pulled again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Edmund G. |authorlink =Jerry Brown |title =Handgun Safety Certificate |publisher =[[California Department of Justice]] |volume = |edition = |date =2009 |location =[[West Sacramento, California]] |page =52 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most pistols use [[recoil operation]] to do this, but some pistols use [[blowback (arms)|blowback]] or [[gas-operated reloading|gas operation]].

Most types of semi-automatic pistols rely on a removable magazine to store ammunition before it is fired, usually inserted inside the grip.

==Operation==
Semi-automatic pistols use one firing chamber that remains fixed in a constant linear position relative to the gun barrel. In contrast, although double-action [[revolver]]s can also be fired semiautomatically, their rounds are not fired from a single chamber, but rather are fired from each of the chambers that are rotated into linear alignment with the barrel's position in turn just prior for each shot fired.

Typically, the first round is manually loaded into the chamber by pulling back and releasing the slide mechanism. After the trigger is pulled and the round is fired, the [[recoil operation]] of the handgun automatically extracts and ejects the shell casing and reloads the chamber.  This mode of operation generally allows for faster reloading and storing a larger number of cartridges than a revolver.

[[File:Firearm simple blowback animation.gif|thumb|Diagram showing a simple blowback action]]

Some modern semi-automatic pistols are [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action|double action only]] (DA or DAO); that is, once a round is chambered, each trigger pull cocks the hammer, striker, or firing pin, and  additionally releases the same to fire a cartridge in one continuous motion. Each pull of the trigger on a DAO semi-automatic pistol requires the same amount of pressure.  The [[Kel-Tec P-32]] is an example of a DAO action.  DAO semi-automatic pistols are most generally recommended only in the smaller, self-defense, concealable pistols, rather than in target or hunting pistols. A notable exception is Glock-brand pistols which optimize preset triggers (similar to DAO), but the striker is partially cocked back as the slide closes. This allows for significantly shorter trigger pulls than DAO.  The trigger spring can be replaced with a lighter one and paired with a low-strength sear connector resulting in lightened trigger pulls to improve a shooter's accuracy (like models G34 and G35).

[[Image:S&amp;W-Chief.jpg|thumb|[[Smith &amp; Wesson]] double-action .45 ACP semi-automatic compact [[pistol]]]]

Standard modern semi-automatic pistols are usually double action (DA), also sometimes known as double-action/single-action (DA/SA).  In this design, the hammer or striker may be either thumb-cocked or activated by pulling the trigger when firing the first shot.  The hammer or striker is recocked automatically during each firing cycle.  In double-action pistols, the first pull of the trigger requires roughly twice as much pressure as subsequent firings, since the first pull of the trigger also cocks the hammer (if not already cocked by hand).  The [[Beretta 92F/FS]], a full-sized, service, semi-automatic pistol is an example of this style of action.  A common mode of carry for DA semi-automatic pistols is with the magazine full, a round chambered, and the gun holstered and uncocked with the external safety unengaged or off.  The Taurus PT145 is an example of a (DA/SA) weapon, as it has no decocker and thus has its striker primed from the moment of chambering and only enters double-action mode if a round fails to fire upon the pin's impact; at other times, it operates as a single-action striker fired firearm.

In contrast, a [[Trigger (firearms)#Single-action|single-action]] (SA) semi-automatic pistol must be cocked by first operating the slide or bolt, or, if a round is already chambered, by cocking the hammer manually.  The famed Colt [[M1911]] is an example of this style of action.  All SA semi-automatic pistols exhibit this feature, and automatically cock the hammer when the slide is first "racked" to chamber a round. A round can also be manually inserted in the chamber with the slide locked back. Then the safety can be applied.

===Cocking modes===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}

The normal mode of carrying an SA semi-automatic pistol is condition 1, popularly known as cocked and locked. Condition 1 (a term popularized by [[Jeff Cooper (colonel)#The Modern Technique|Colonel Jeff Cooper]]) refers to having the magazine full, a round chambered, the hammer fully cocked, and the thumb safety engaged or on, at least for right-handed users. For many single-action, semi-automatic pistols, this procedure works well only for right-handed users, as the thumb safety is located on the left side of pistol and is easily accessible only for those who are holding the pistol in the right hand. Many modern SA semi-automatic pistols have had their safety mechanisms redesigned to provide a thumb safety on both sides of the pistol (ambidextrous), thereby better meeting the needs of left-handed, as well as right-handed users.

Many SA semi-automatic pistols have a hammer position known as "[[half-cock]]ed". Squeezing the trigger will not fire the gun when it is in the half-cocked position, and neither will dropping the gun in this state cause an accidental discharge. During WWII in the Pacific Theater, an unofficial and unapproved carry mode for the SA M1911 by left-handed US soldiers in combat was carrying the gun with the magazine full, a round chambered, the action in half-cocked position, and the thumb safety (accessible only to right-handed users) positioned in the off (or ready-to-fire) mode.

The primary advantage of the half-cocked position versus the uncocked position in that particular scenario was added sound suppression (of the click of the weapon being cocked). A secondary advantage was the avoidance of accidental discharges if the gun were accidentally dropped. The half cock was revised by Colt in the 1970s and subsequently other manufacturers – the hammer will fall from half cock if the trigger is pulled on most newer 1911 type guns.

==Terminology==
The language surrounding automatic, semi-automatic, self-loading, etc., often causes confusion due to differences in technical usage between different countries and differences in popular usage. For example, the term "automatic pistol" technically refers to a [[machine pistol]] which is capable of firing multiple round bursts for a single pull of the trigger, although in popular US usage it is also used as a synonym for a semi-automatic pistol. In the case of pistols, an 'automatic pistol', a 'semi-automatic pistol', or a 'self-loading pistol', all usually imply a handgun that is semi-automatic, self-loading, and magazine-fed with a magazine that is removable, producing one shot fired for each trigger pull. The term pistol may refer to handguns in general, or may be used to differentiate (semi-automatic) pistols from revolvers.

==Technology==
A self-loading pistol reloads the chamber with a new round automatically each time the weapon is fired, without additional action being required by the user. For a semi-automatic pistol, this is typically accomplished by recoil operation. In a machine pistol, in contrast, this can be accomplished by [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]], or, less commonly, by [[gas-operated reloading|gas operation]], harnessing gases produced when the gun is fired. The [[Desert Eagle]] is a rare example of a semi-automatic pistol that siphons off some of the gases instead of relying on short recoil operation.

A revolver, which uses multiple chambers and a single barrel, and a [[derringer]], which uses multiple chambers and multiple barrels, also fire one round per trigger pull, but achieve this in different ways and as such are not classified as being semi-automatic.

A semi-automatic pistol will fire only one shot per trigger pull, in contrast to a "fully automatic" or machine pistol, which continues to fire as long as the trigger is held or until all rounds have been fired. The [[Mauser M712 Schnellfeuer]] (German for "rapid fire"), a modified Mauser C96 pistol, is a notable example of a true machine pistol.

While both types of weapons operate on the same principles, fully automatic weapons must be built more ruggedly to accommodate the heat and stress caused by rapid firing, and it can be difficult (and illegal in most countries) to convert a semi-automatic pistol into a fully automatic mode of fire. A [[selective-fire]] action pistol, though, can be converted back and forth by means of a switch, and often includes a [[Burst mode (firearm)|burst mode]], typically for a three-round burst with each trigger pull. Selective-fire weapons are generally used by specialized law enforcement and security personnel such as [[SWAT]] teams, hostage rescue teams, antiterrorist units, or government [[bodyguard]]s for heads of state. In the United States, selective-fire weapons are not available to civilians unless they live in a state that allows civilian ownership of [[National Firearms Act]] or Title II weapons.

==Actions: blowback versus locked breech==
{{main|Blowback (arms)|Recoil operation}}

Self-loading automatic pistols can be divided into "blowback" and "locked breech" categories according to their principle of operation. The blowback operating principle is suitable for smaller, lower-powered calibers, such as [[.32 ACP]] and [[.380 ACP]], as the resistance of the recoil spring and mass of the slide are sufficient to retard the opening of the breech until the projectile has left the barrel, and breech pressure has dropped to a safe level. For more powerful calibers such as the [[9×19mm Parabellum|9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum]] (9&amp;nbsp;mm) and [[.45 ACP]], some form of locked breech is needed to retard breech opening, as an unlocked blowback pistol in these calibers requires a very heavy slide and stiff spring, making them bulky, heavy, and difficult to operate. A somewhat commercially successful blowback pistol design in the more powerful calibers was produced; the Spanish [[Astra 400]] in [[9 mm Largo]] and the similar Astra 600 in 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum.  U.S. manufacturer [[Hi-Point]] also produces a line of blowback-operated pistols in several calibers, including 9&amp;nbsp;mm and .45 ACP.  Virtually all other service-caliber pistols are locked-breech designs.

== History ==

After [[Hiram Stevens Maxim|Hiram Maxim]] introduced his recoil-powered [[machine gun]] in 1883, several gunsmiths set out to apply the same principles to handguns, including Maxim. Maxim's designs for smaller firearms using his recoil-powered ideas never went into production.

In the 1880s, other designers worked on self-loading designs. The [[Schönberger-Laumann 1892]] was the first semi-automatic pistol.

The first model to gain any commercial success was [[Hugo Borchardt]]'s [[Borchardt C-93|C-93]], which, together with the [[7.65×25mm Borchardt|7.65&amp;nbsp;mm Borchardt]] cartridge, had been designed in 1893 and made its public debut in 1894. Borchardt based the principle of the C-93's mechanism in large part upon Maxim's toggle-lock.{{Dubious|"toggle-lock" principle|reason=Undocumented|date=June 2013}} The C-93 featured a locking mechanism modeled after the human knee, which is called ''Kniegelenk'' in German (knee joint). The C-93 proved mechanically reliable, but was too large and bulky to receive widespread acceptance. Equipped with a screw-on wooden stock, the C-93 served well as a small pistol [[carbine]].

In 1896, [[Paul Mauser]] introduced the first model of his Mauser "Broomhandle" semi-automatic pistol, the [[Mauser C96|C96]]. This was the first mass-produced and commercially successful pistol to have a large-capacity, staggered-column magazine holding 10 or 20 rounds.
Its original cartridge was called [[7.63×25mm Mauser|7.63&amp;nbsp;mm Mauser]], which was more powerful but otherwise identical to the [[7.65×25mm Borchardt|7.65&amp;nbsp;mm Borchardt]].
The Mauser was one of the first self-loading pistols used extensively in battle, notably the [[South African War]] of 1899-1902. These pistols were made in [[7.63×25mm Mauser|7.63&amp;nbsp;mm Mauser]], or 9×25&amp;nbsp;mm Mauser, along with some models eventually being made in 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum and a small number in [[.45 ACP]] for China.

1898 saw the [[Schwarzlose Model 1898]], a semi-automatic pistol invented by Prussian firearm designer [[Andreas Wilhelm Schwarzlose]]. It was chambered for the 7.65×25mm Mauser,[1] but could also shoot the weaker Borchardt ammunition. The Schwarzlose design was most advanced and far ahead of its time, but not widely adopted with less than 1000 pieces being manufactured.[2][3]
Small lots were sold to the Boers and used during the [[Boer War]]. Another lot was sold to members of the Russian Social-Democratic Party who were plotting insurrection, but were confiscated at the Russian border and issued to the Imperial Russian Frontier Guards.[3][4]

In [[Belgium]] in 1896 American gun designer [[John Browning]] developed self-loading semi-automatic pistols. His models were first manufactured in Europe by the Belgian firm of [[Fabrique Nationale]] (FN) and later by [[Colt Firearms|Colt]] in the U.S.
Browning's first successful design was the [[Browning M1900]].
Like [[Georg Luger]]'s work conducted around the same time in Germany, it was desiged alongside a in 7.65&amp;nbsp;mm cartridge, but the [[7.65&amp;nbsp;mm Browning]] (aka .32 Auto) differs substantially from Luger's [[7.65&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum]]. Browning went on to design .25, .38, .380, and .45 [[Automatic Colt Pistol|ACP]] cartridges for his semi-automatic pistol designs.

Browning must be given credit for developing the type of locked-breech action which is commonly used by the vast majority of modern large caliber semi-automatic pistols. 

One of Browning's most enduring designs was the [[Colt M1911]], which was adopted by the U.S. military as its [[service pistol]] and is still{{when|date=September 2018}} in active use with some U.S. [[Special Forces]] and [[Marine Corps]] units.

Browning also co-designed the FN [[Browning Hi-Power]], announced in 1922, during the last years of his life, working on this design until his death in 1926. This was a 9&amp;nbsp;mm Luger semi-automatic pistol capable of holding 13 rounds in the magazine (plus one chambered).
A staggered magazine had already been realized in the [[Savage Model 1907]] with 10-rounds of .32 ACP.&lt;ref&gt;''Small Arms Encyclopedia'', Amber Books Ltd., 2011, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; 
This predates the filing of Browning's patent for the large-capacity 9&amp;nbsp;mm pistol [6-28-1923, issued as U.S. patent #1,618,510, dated 22 Feb. 1927] by some 18 years as the Savage was patented in 1905,&lt;ref name="World, Hogg 1982"&gt;Pistols of the World, Hogg, V. &amp; Weeks, J., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
Whether the staggered magazine featured in the Savage 1905 was a focal point of the patent is unclear. In a review of the Browning patent dated 22 Feb. 1927, it is equally unclear if the   staggered magazine is a primary or a dependent claim of the patent as issued. However, the existence of a staggered magazine in 1905 is indisputable, as many of these Savage pistols were produced and survive to this day. Browning could well have come into contact with this concept during the military trials of 1911, as a version of the Savage design in .45 cal was also under consideration alongside the Browning/Colt design.&lt;ref name="World, Hogg 1982"/&gt;) 

The next notable design was the [[7.65 mm Luger]] by [[Georg Luger]], which although successful in its function, nonetheless failed to have adequate [[stopping power]]{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and failed to win widespread acceptance. In 1902, Luger's subsequent and similar [[Luger pistol|P08]] in [[9×19mm Parabellum|9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum]] overcame the problem of inadequate stopping power and featured a greatly improved Borchardt-type ''Kniegelenk'' ("knee-joint") locking mechanism. Unlike Browning's locked-breech design, the barrel in a ''Kniegelenk'' design does not tip up and down while the gun is fired, thereby theoretically improving shooting accuracy. Luger's P.08 was adopted by the [[Germany|German]] military and served as their standard sidearm in [[World War I]].

During [[World War II]], Germany was the first nation to adopt a [[double-action]] pistol, the [[Walther arms|Walther]] [[Walther P38|P38]], which could be carried loaded (with a cartridge chambered) and ready to fire without the risk of an accidental discharge if dropped. The P38 also used Luger's 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum cartridge.

During World War II, revolvers were still issued by various major powers, but their use was decreasing.&lt;ref name="pistol_impact"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinard|first=Jeff|title=Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-470-7|quote=Soon after World War II the major powers all but abandoned the revolver for standard issue|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finest_weapons"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=Ian|title=Handguns &amp; Rifles: The Finest Weapons from Around the World|year=2003|publisher=The Lyons Press|isbn=978-1-85648-701-6|quote=World War II saw no advance in revolver design or ammunition; indeed, it began the move away from revolvers in major armies |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the British firm [[Webley &amp; Scott]] had developed several adequate self-loading pistols, one of which was adopted by the (normally unarmed) [[British police]] in 1911 and by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines before the First World War, revolvers were generally preferred by most [[Military of the United Kingdom|British military]]. In the Soviet Union, the [[TT pistol]] replaced the [[Nagant M1895]] revolver during the war. In the United States, the M1911A1 was adopted as the standard military sidearm. Both Colt and [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] produced revolvers chambered for the same .45 ACP ammunition used in the M1911A1, because of the great demand for handguns and the need to adopt a common cartridge for use in both semi-automatic pistols and revolvers.

After World War II, most nations eventually adopted 9&amp;nbsp;mm Parabellum caliber pistols employing some variant of Browning's locked-breech design for their standard-issue military pistols. The most popular early choice was the FN Browning Hi-Power mentioned above; another popular model was the locked-breech Walther P38 because of its many safety features. {{As of|2011}}, the U.S. military sidearm is a variant of the [[Beretta 92]]F/FS.

After the Second World War, the almost universal trend has been for semi-automatic pistols to replace revolvers for military use, although the transition has been slower in police and civilian use. {{As of|2011}}, revolvers are mainly used in jurisdictions which permit their use for civilian self-defense, hunting, [[plinking]], and target practice. Semi-automatic pistols are by far the most popular for concealed carry by civilians, primary handguns for police and military use, backup guns for police use, and where the usual five or six shots of a revolver are deemed inadequate.

Erotic '''sensation play''' is a class of activities meant to impart physical sensations upon a partner, as opposed to mental forms of erotic play such as [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] or [[sexual roleplaying]].

Sensation play can be ''sensual'', where the sensations are generally pleasing and light. Many couples that would not consider themselves active in [[BDSM]] are familiar with this kind of play: the use of silk scarves, feathers, ice, massage oils, and other similar implements.

Sensation play in [[BDSM]] can also involve [[Sadism and masochism|sadomasochistic]] play, involving the application of ''carefully controlled'' stimuli to the human body so that it reacts as if it were actually hurt. While this can involve the infliction of actual [[pain]], it is usually done in order to release pleasurable [[endorphin]]s, creating a sensation somewhat like [[runner's high]] or the afterglow of [[orgasm]], sometimes called "flying" or "body stress".
&lt;!-- [[Image:Tickle torture.jpg|thumb|Tickling with an electric toothbrush.]] --&gt;

== Examples ==
In BDSM play, the [[Top (BDSM)|top]] (or [[Dominant (BDSM)|dominant]]) introduces and controls the sensation to the [[bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] (or [[submissive (BDSM)|submissive]]).

* Two partners exploring the sensations of [[kissing]] or other [[intimacy]] while [[blindfold]]ed
* Unusual textures such as [[feathers]], [[silk]], or [[leather]]
* [[Erotic tickling]]
* [[Sensory deprivation]] such as [[Mummification (BDSM)|mummification]]
* Contact with intense temperatures, such as [[ice play|ice]] or [[Wax play|hot wax]]
* [[Biting]] and [[claw]]ing
* [[Whip]]s, [[flogging]], [[suspension bondage|bondage suspension]] and other [[BDSM]] related activities.
* Clamping parts of the body with [[clothespin]]s, [[forceps]], [[nipple clamp]]s or similar devices.
* Other implements that may not be normally be used in a sexual context, such as an [[electric toothbrush]].  These items may be referred to as pervertibles within the BDSM community.

The sensation can come from just about anywhere, provided that the implement and its use fall within the negotiated terms of the interaction or relationship.  Sensation play is limited only by one's own imagination and a lot of variation can occur from one play [[Scene (BDSM)|scene]] to the next.  For example, chains could be left in a freezer for some time and then laid across the body of a bottom or submissive.  Or the chain could just be brought out of a bag and run across the body or perhaps just rattled loudly to invoke a response.

== Safety ==
Note that safety and consent are of paramount importance in the practice of more intense forms of sensation play. People engaging in such activities should adhere to the principles of "[[safe, sane and consensual]]" or of "[[risk-aware consensual kink]]".

{{Life in Singapore}}

'''Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin''', also known as '''Singdarin''' ({{zh|s=新加坡式华语|t=新加坡式華語|w=hsing1 chia1 p'o1 shih4 hua2 yü3|p=Xīnjiāpōshì Huáyǔ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.163.com/06/0711/11/2LOEI16K00061Q2M.html |title=中文·外来语来聚"掺" |publisher=《三联生活周刊》 |date= |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an interlanguage native to [[Singapore]]. In [[Taiwan]], this language variety is known as '''[[Singnese]]''' ({{zh|s=星式中文|t=星式中文|w=hsing1 shih4 chung1 wen2|p=Xīngshì Zhōngwén}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= 顧長永 (Gu Changyong) | title =《新加坡: 蛻變的四十年》 (Singapore: The Changing Forty Years)| publisher =五南圖書出版股份有限公司 |date=2006-07-25 | location =Taiwan | pages =54 | isbn =978-957-11-4398-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] but has a large amount of [[English language|English]] in its vocabulary. For this reason, Singdarin is sometimes known as "Anglo-Chinese". There are also words from [[Malay language|Malay]] and other Chinese dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huayuqiao.org/articles/zhouzhaocheng/zhouzc01.htm |title=重视新加坡本土华语的文化意义 (Attending to the cultural significance of Colloquial Singaporean Mandarin) |publisher=華語橋 (Huayuqiao) |date= |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, well-educated [[Chinese Singaporean]]s are able to [[code-switch]] between Singdarin and [[Standard Mandarin]].

Singdarin grammar is usually identical to Mandarin. In some circumstances, there is code-switching with English.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Singdarin vocabulary consists of a large number of words from English, Hokkien, and Malay, among other languages, often when speakers do not know the Mandarin equivalent of what they wish to express, and instead use English words to convey the meaning.

It is almost identical to the [[Malaysian Mandarin|Colloquial Malaysian Mandarin]] spoken in Malaysia, while native Chinese from China or native Taiwanese from Taiwan generally find it difficult to understand Singdarin due to large number of English or non-Mandarin words used. The Singaporean government currently discourages the use of Singdarin in favour of [[Standard Singaporean Mandarin]] as it believes in the need for Singaporeans to be able to communicate effectively with native Chinese from China or Taiwan.

==Origins==
Like its [[Singlish]] equivalent, Singdarin evolved because many Singaporean Chinese families come from mixed language environments. For instance, children may be raised in households in which one parent speaks English while the other speaks Chinese or coming for other Chinese dialects, such as Hokkien or Cantonese respectively.

Singdarin has also evolved largely because Singapore is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual society. One of the most important policies of the Singaporean government is to ensure social and multi-ethnic harmony. Therefore, instead of letting certain ethnic groups to live in an isolated community like they did in the past, the Singapore government encourages the majority of Singaporeans to live in [[Housing Development Board|HDB]] flats that have now become a melting pot of Chinese, Malays, Indians and other different ethnicity who speak different languages. This is believed to reduce differences between the diverse linguistic and ethnic groups in Singapore.

As the majority of Singaporeans live in HDB flats, which have families coming from various linguistic, racial and ethnic background, there is a tendency for different languages to be mixed in order to facilitate more effective communication between the different races. In short, it leads to the creation of a hybrid culture (known colloquially as a "[[rojak]]" culture).

This and the tendency for the Singaporean Chinese people to use the mixed language that they use at home in daily colloquial conversation has since influenced the Mandarin spoken in schools, resulting in "Singdarin" being formed. It was in this environment that Singdarin developed.

==Usage of English technical terms==

Since English is the main working and educational language of Singapore, many Chinese Singaporeans are more familiar with the English professional terminology (technical terms) used at work, rather than that of Mandarin. This led to many Chinese Singaporeans tending to mix large number of English professional terms into Mandarin at work, instead of using Chinese technical terms. As such, a form of Singdarin spoken at work appears, resulting in some degree of communication barrier at work between the Chinese Singaporeans and the Chinese from China or Taiwan.

Comparison between Singdarin spoken at work in Singapore and Mandarin spoken at work in China is shown below:

==Other terms associated with Singdarin==

{{Original research|date=June 2011}}

There are other terms associated with Singdarin such as "Broken Chinese", "Half-bucket" (半桶水） or "Half-past Six Chinese". These are the terms used by Singaporean Chinese-language professionals to refer to the mediocre (or low) proficiency level of [Standard Mandarin] amongst certain Chinese Singaporeans.  The terms describe that when measured against Standard Mandarin, certain Chinese Singaporeans are only 50-65% proficient in Mandarin{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

Part of the reason for this could be due to the widespread use of Singdarin in Singapore. Singdarin has led to the impression of "broken Chinese" or "bad Chinese", and is generally considered to be an adulterated form of Mandarin Chinese. Speaking Singdarin, for Singaporeans, is a natural linguistic habit derived from speaking a mixed language in daily life. However, the lower proficiency in formal Mandarin Chinese was mainly due to a lack of practice and exposure to more proper Chinese language, a lack of practice in speaking, hearing, reading and writing Chinese{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. This further led to a limited Chinese vocabulary or knowledge on Chinese cultural subjects, thus making it difficult for Singdarin speakers to speak Standard Mandarin fluently. Singdarin speakers will generally find it difficult to communicate (at a higher level) when attempting to interact with native Chinese speakers from China or Taiwan.

'''Suba-Simbiti''' (''Kisuba, Kisimbiti'') is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of [[Tanzania]]. Suba-Simbiti is spoken by six groups in the Tarime region of Tanzania. This include Hacha, Kine, Sweta, Simbiti and Kiroba. The total number of speakers is in the region of 110,000.

== Phonology ==

Simbiti has a seven-vowel system with the vowels /i e ɛ a ɔ o u/ attested. However,  only the five vowels / i ɛ a ɔ u / are found in verb roots.

== Grammar ==

Simbiti has a basic SVO word order and head-initial syntax. The language has 19 noun classes, including two locative classes. 

There are three past tenses: a recent past, distant past and a general past. There is also a three-way distinction in the future: immediate future, a hodiernal future (used for events that will take place later the same day) and a distant future tense for events that will take place after today.  Simbiti uses a range of simple and complex verb forms to encode a wide range of specific tense-aspect combinations. The progressive verb forms (past progressive, present progressive and future progressive) are all formed through the use of compound, auxiliary-based constructions, with the past progressive and the present progressive both exhibiting verb-auxiliary order. 

Simbiti is one of a small set of East African Bantu languages that exhibit verb-auxiliary constituent order in restricted contexts. In Simbiti, the auxiliary appears after the verb in the past progressive and the present progressive tenses.

He studied at the [[Surendranath College]], [[Dum Dum Motijheel College]], [[City College, Kolkata]] - all affiliated with the [[University of Calcutta]]. Thereafter, he obtained his master's degree in [[Bengali literature|Bengali]] from the [[University of Calcutta]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="Spouse and children of Gangopadhyay" /&gt;

Gangopadhyay was the founder editor of ''Krittibas'', a seminal poetry magazine started publishing from 1953, that became a platform for a new generation of poets experimenting with many new forms in poetic themes, rhythms, and words.&lt;ref name="Bengali writer Sunil Gangopadhyay dies of a heart attack at 78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bengal's literary chameleon" /&gt; o

===Other works===
Later, he started writing for various publications of the [[Ananda Bazar Patrika|Ananda Bazar group]], a major publishing house in [[Kolkata]] and has been continuing it for many years.&lt;ref name="Bengali writer Sunil Gangopadhyay dies of a heart attack at 78" /&gt; He became a friend of the beat poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] while he was travelling in India. Ginsberg mentioned Gangopadhyay most notedly in his poem September on Jessore Road. Gangopadhyay in return mentioned Ginsberg in some of his prose work. After serving five years as the Vice President, he was elected the President of the [[Sahitya Akademi]] on 20 February 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/21/stories/2008022159901400.htm|title=Gangopadhyay elected Sahitya Akademi president|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunil, along with Tarun Sanyal, [[Jyotirmoy Datta]] and Satrajit Dutta had volunteered to be defence witnesses in the famous trial of [[Hungry generation]] movement poet [[Malay Roy Choudhury]].&lt;ref name="Indian and Foreign Review"&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian and Foreign Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kNnAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 October 2012|year=1969|publisher=Publications Division of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Sunil Gangopadhyay 4191.JPG|thumb|left|Gangopadhyay in Science City, Kolkata in January 2010]]
Author of well over 200 books,&lt;ref name="Bengali writer Sunil Gangopadhyay dies of a heart attack at 78" /&gt; Sunil was a prolific writer who has excelled in different genres but declares poetry to be his "first love".&lt;ref name="Bengal's literary chameleon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bengal's literary chameleon|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/obituaries/bengals-literary-chameleon-20121031-28kqs.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Nikhilesh'' and ''Neera'' series of poems (some of which have been translated as ''For You, Neera'' and ''Murmur in the Woods'') have been extremely popular.

As in poetry, Sunil was known for his unique style in prose. His second novel was ''Atmaprakash'' and it was also the first writing from a new comer in literature published in the prestigious magazine- ''Desh'' (1965).&lt;ref name="Sunil Gangopadhyay dies BD News" /&gt; It was critically acclaimed but some controversy arose for its aggressive and 'obscene' style. Sunil said that he was afraid of this novel and went away from Calcutta for a few days. Satyajit Ray thought to make a film on it but it wasn't possible for reasons. The central character of 'Atmaprakash' is a young man of core-calcutta'- Sunil, who leads a bohemian life-style. The novel had inspiration from ' On the road' by Jack Kerouac, the beat generation writer. His historical fiction ''[[Sei Somoy]]'' (translated into English by Aruna Chakravorty as ''[[Those Days (novel)|Those Days]]'') received the Indian [[Sahitya Akademi]] award in 1985. ''Sei Somoy'' continues to be a best seller more than two decade after its first publication.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The same is true for ''[[First Light (Sunil Ganguly)|Prothom Alo]]'' (also translated recently by Aruna Chakravorty as ''First Light''), another best selling historical fiction and ''Poorba-Pashchim'', a raw depiction of the [[Partition of India|partition]] and its aftermath seen through the eyes of three generations of Bengalis in West Bengal, Bangladesh and elsewhere.  He is also the winner of the Bankim Puraskar (1982), and the [[Ananda Puraskar]] (twice, in 1972 and 1989).
[[File:Sunil Gangopadhyay giving autographs to his fans in Kolkata Book Fair 2010 by Piyal Kundu.JPG|thumb|Sunil Gangopadhyay giving autographs to his fans in Kolkata Book Fair 2010]]
Sunil wrote in many other genres including travelogues, children's fiction, short stories, features, and essays. Among his pen-names are: Nil Lohit, Sanatan Pathak, and Nil Upadhyay.&lt;ref name="Bengali writer Sunil Gangopadhyay dies of a heart attack at 78" /&gt;

Though he wrote all types of children's fiction, one character created by him that stands out above the rest, was [[Kakababu]], the crippled adventurist, accompanied by his [[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]] nephew Santu, and his friend Jojo. Since 1974, Sunil Gangopadhyay wrote over 35 novels of this popular series, most of which appeared in [[Anandamela]] magazine.

He returned to Kolkata on the day of ''Mahalaya''.&lt;ref name="Amaratwa ke tachhilya korte chaiten tini"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amaratwa ke tachhilya korte chaiten tini|newspaper=Anandabazar Patrika|date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was a communist and never followed any Hindu practices, Gangopadhyay's body was cremated following Hindu custom on 25 October at ''Keoratola crematorium'' with several dignitaries and numerous fans paying their last tributes.However, Ganguly was an atheist and he never had any belief in any Hindu religious activities.&lt;ref name="The discovery of utility in death"&gt;{{cite news|title=The discovery of utility in death|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/discovery-utility-death-204205043.html|accessdate=26 October 2012|newspaper=Yahoo News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018184407/http://in.news.yahoo.com/discovery-utility-death-204205043.html|archivedate=18 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian President [[Pranab Mukherjee]] condoled the death of Gangopadhyay saying–&lt;ref name="Eminent litterateur Sunil Gangopadhyay passes away at his Kolkata residence" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gangopadhyay had enriched Bengali literature through his unique style. He was one of the best intellectuals among his contemporaries. The vacuum created by his death cannot be filled&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee]], the former Chief Minister of West Bengal, who was closely associated with the writer since 1964, said that Bengali literature would remain indebted to him.&lt;ref name="Sunil Gangopadhyay passes away The Hindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunil Gangopadhyay passes away|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/sunil-gangopadhyay-passes-away/article4025129.ece|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1970 Satyajit Ray's film ''[[Pratidwandi]]'' released which was based on Gangopadhyay's novel. In the novel Gangopadhyay depicted how a poor nurse used to entertain men for some ''moolah''. This arose controversy and nurses across the city of Kolkata protested against such depiction.&lt;ref name="The freedom song"&gt;{{cite news|title=The freedom song|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/calcutta-times/The-freedom-song/articleshow/1661050.cms|accessdate=26 October 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Jun 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006 novel ''Ardhek Jibon'', he expressed his carnal desire for [[Hindu]] goddess [[Saraswati]] created some controversies. A retired IPS officer lodged a case against Gangopadhyay in the Calcutta High Court. Against this controversy Gangpadhyay felt– he had no freedom to express what he felt. Another Bengali writer [[Buddhadeb Guha]] found this a cheap gimmick and he told– "I don't support such cheap gimmicks. An author should set an example for the younger generations. If an author thinks it's cool to say that he loves to booze and enjoys going to Sonagachhi, then this only speaks poorly of him."&lt;ref name="The freedom song" /&gt;
* In September 2012 Bangladeshi author [[Taslima Nasreen]] accused Sunil Gangopadhyay of sexually harassing her and other women.

Tashi delek is traditionally used as part of a larger invocation on [[Losar]].&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tibet, Tibet|first=Patrick|last=French|publisher=Random House Digital|year=2009|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frechette"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tibetans in Nepal: The Dynamics of International Assistance Among a Community in Exile|first=Ann|last=Frechette|first2=Walter|last2=Schatzberg|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2002|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Dalai Lama's self-deportation and creation of the [[Tibetan diaspora]], exile authorities promoted the use of "tashi delek" as an all-purpose greeting which could be easily picked up by foreign sponsors.&lt;ref name="French"/&gt; Students of the exile school system are taught that this usage of "tashi delek" has roots in premodern Tibet, and that Chinese Tibetans' exclusive usage of "tashi delek" for New Years' is corrupt.&lt;ref name="Frechette"/&gt; [[Tour operator]]s have promoted the phrase, along with [[khata]] scarves and [[prayer flag]]s, as essentialized and commodifiable aspects of [[Tibetan culture]], a fact that has caused resentment among some religious Tibetans. "Tashi Delek" is the name of a website that provides information on the nation of Bhutan and promotes Tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faiths on Display: Religion, Tourism, and the Chinese State|first=Tim|last=Oakes|first2=Donald|last2=Sutton|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2010|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Tashi delek" is also used in the [[Chinese language]] with the Chinese transcription ''Zhaxi Dele'' ({{Lang|zh|[[:Zh:扎西德勒|扎西德勒]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://xz.xinhuanet.com/gdbb/2009-02/25/content_15796257.htm|periodical=Xinhua News|title=西藏百姓互道"扎西德勒"欢度藏历新年|date=2009-02-25|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a song called ''Zhaxi Dele'' with lyrics by Rongzhong Erjia ([[:Zh:容中尔甲|容中尔甲]]), a Tibetan, and music by Chang Yingzhong ([[:zh:昌英中|昌英中]]), a [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mp3.baidu.com/singerlist/%C8%DD%D6%D0%B6%FB%BC%D7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120721184204/http://mp3.baidu.com/singerlist/%C8%DD%D6%D0%B6%FB%BC%D7.html |archivedate=2012-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also used in  [[Bhutan]], regions of  [[Nepal]], and [[Sikkim]]. There is a company in Bhutan called TashiDelek.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tashidelek.com/ Tashi Delek Net]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Hotel Tashi Delek in [[Gangtok]], Sikkim. The inflight magazine of [[Bhutan]]ese airline [[Druk Air]] is called Tashi Delek.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.drukair.com.bt/COMMON.aspx?Type=Tashi%20Delek.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Govind Vinayak Karandikar''' (23 August 1918&amp;nbsp;– 14 March 2010), better known as '''Vindā Karandikar''', was a well-known [[Marathi language|Marathi]] poet, writer, literary critic, and translator.

He was conferred the 39th [[Jnanpith Award]] in 2006, which is the highest literary award in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/marathi-litterateur-karandikar-conferred-jnanpith/10335/0|title=Marathi litterateur Karandikar conferred Jnanpith|date=11 Aug 2006|work=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also received some other awards for his literary work including the Keshavasut Prize, the Soviet Land Nehru Literary Award, the Kabir Samman, and the [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa2.htm Fellowships] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630180021/http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa2.htm |date=30 June 2007 }} [[Sahitya Akademi]] Official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and works==
Karandikar was born on 23 August 1918, in Dhalavali village in the Devgad taluka present-day [[Sindhudurg district]] of Maharashtra.

Karandikar's poetic works include ''Svedgangā'' (River of Sweat) (1949), ''Mrudgandha'' (1954), ''Dhrupad'' (1959), ''Jātak'' (1968), and ''Virupika'' (1980). Two anthologies of his selected poems, ''Sanhita'' (1975) and ''Adimaya'' (1990) were also published. His poetic works for children include ''Rānichā Bāg'' (1961), ''Sashyāche Kān'' (1963), and ''Pari Ga Pari'' (1965).

Experimentation has been a feature of Karandikar's Marathi poems. He also translated his own poems in English, which were published as "Vinda Poems" (1975).  He also modernized old Marathi literature like [[Dnyaneshwari]] and ''Amrutānubhawa''.

Besides having been a prominent Marathi poet, Karandikar has contributed to Marathi literature as an essayist, a critic, and a translator. He translated [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics of Aristotle]] and [[King Lear]] of [[Shakespeare]] in Marathi.

Karandikar's collections of short essays include ''Sparshaachi Palvi'' (1958) and ''Akashacha Arth'' (1965). ''Parampara ani Navata'' (1967), is a collection of his analytical reviews.&lt;ref name="outlook"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?676674|title=Marathi Poet Govind Vinayak Passes Away|date=14 March 2010|publisher=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|accessdate=15 March 2010|location=Mumbai|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718090511/http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?676674|archive-date=18 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karandikar was the third Marathi writer to win the [[Jnanpith Award]], after [[Vishnu Sakharam Khandekar]] (1974) and Vishnü Vāman Shirwādkar ([[Kusumagraj]]) (1987).

The trio of poets [[Vasant Bapat]], Vinda Karandikar and [[Mangesh Padgaonkar]] provided for many years public recitals of their poetry in different towns in [[Maharashtra]]. Along with Vasant Bapat and Padgaonkar, Karandikar travelled across Maharashtra in the 1960s and 1970s reciting poetry.&lt;ref name=Arun&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navhindtimes.in/iwatch/arun-date-mangesh-padgaonkar-perform-ka |title=Arun Date, Mangesh Padgaonkar to perform at KA |date=24 April 2010 |newspaper=[[Navhind Times]] |accessdate=7 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303165607/http://www.navhindtimes.in/iwatch/arun-date-mangesh-padgaonkar-perform-ka |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a member of a Marathi literary group called "Murgi club", loosely fashioned after the [[Algonquin Round Table]]. In addition to Karandikar, it included Vasant Bapat, Mangesh Padgaonkar, [[Gangadhar Gadgil]], Sadanand Rege and Shri Pu Bhagwat. They met every month for several years to eat together, engaging each other in wordplay and literary jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loksatta|title=माझा विक्षिप्त मित्र|url=http://www.loksatta.com/daily/20060115/lr02.htm|website=लोकसत्ता लोकरंग|publisher=Loksatta Newspaper|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Vinda Karandikar died on 14 March 2010 at the age of 91 in [[Mumbai]] following a brief illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-poet-vinda-karandikar-jnanpith-winner-dies-at-92-1359057 Poet Vinda Karandikar, Jnanpith winner, dies at 92]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/marathi-poet-vinda-karandikar-passes-away/article244888.ece Marathi poet Vinda Karandikar passes away]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Welsh Wikipedia''' (''[[Welsh language|Welsh]]'': '''{{#property:P1448}}''') is the [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] edition of [[Wikipedia]]. This edition was started in July 2003. On 23 June 2007 it reached 10,000 articles, the 66th Wikipedia to do so. On 20 November 2008 it attained 20,000 articles. Less than a year later, on 28 October 2009, it reached 25,000 articles. In July 2013 it reached 50,000 articles and is now the 62nd largest Wikipedia edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias List of Wikipedias] on Meta-Wiki.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only internet resource of its kind in Welsh, has an average of 2.7 million hits every month making it the most popular Welsh language website; it therefore has an important place in Welsh language online culture.

The Welsh Wikipedia has been growing at a considerable rate, for its size, over the last few years, with over 10,000 articles created in less than 18 months in the period June 2007 – November 2008, doubling its total. It has been referred to in the Welsh-language current affairs magazine ''[[Golwg]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jac Codi Baw, "''Wiki-peidio''", ''[[Golwg]]'', October 16, 2008, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Y Faner Newydd'', and is listed by the [[National Library of Wales]] as a Welsh-language e-resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesontheweb.org/cgi-bin/gw/chameleon?sessionid=2008040716052727098&amp;skin=eresources&amp;lng=en&amp;inst=consortium&amp;conf=.%2Fchameleon.conf&amp;search=FREEFORM&amp;function=CARDSCR&amp;sourcescreen=INITREQ&amp;elementcount=1&amp;t1=dc%3A025.52&amp;pos=4&amp;itempos=1&amp;rootsearch=FREEFORM National Library of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2007 interview, [[Jimmy Wales]], co-founder of Wikipedia, used the Welsh Wikipedia as an example of the rationale for having Wikipedias in smaller languages:
{{quote|Certainly within Wikipedia right now we are seeing some fairly successful projects in small European languages. You don't really need a Welsh language Wikipedia, perhaps. The number of people who speak Welsh who don't also speak English is very small and getting smaller every year. So why do we have a Welsh Wikipedia? Well, people wanted it, so they're making it. And language preservation is the main motive. It is their mother tongue and they want to keep it alive, keep its literature alive. Certainly some of the larger small languages like Basque and Catalan have very successful projects. I definitely see that preserving parts of your language and culture through collaborative projects makes a lot of sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekillustrated.com/article.htm?articleid=1334&amp;all=yes|title=巷に溢れ出す風俗たち|publisher=geekillustrated.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A direct link to the Welsh Wikipedia has been added to the Getting Started page of the Welsh-language version of the [[Mozilla Firefox]] web browser where it appears as the first of four recommended websites, above the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cy.www.mozilla.com/cy/firefox/central/#feature-learn ''Cychwyn Arni''], Mozilla Firefox (Welsh).&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 "Wici Cymru" was formed;&lt;ref&gt;[[:cy:Wicipedia:Wici Cymru|Wici Cymru]]&lt;/ref&gt; this is a society whose aim is to develop Wikipedia in Wales. By October, BAFTA-winning actor [[Rhys Ifans]] had become its Patron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/University-honours-ex-Swans-star-Guillermo-Bauza/story-27448906-detail/story.html "University honours for ex-Swans star Guillermo Bauza and actor Rhys Ifans", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 20 July 2015].
