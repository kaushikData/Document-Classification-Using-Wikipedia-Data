The '''2021 World Aquatics Championships''' — 19th [[FINA World Aquatics Championships]] will be held in [[Fukuoka]], Japan in 2021. It will be the second time Fukuoka hosts this meet, 20 years after the [[2001 World Aquatics Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2016/01/31/doha-fukuoka-aquatics-world-championships-2021-2023/ |title=Fukuoka, Doha chosen as World Aquatics Championships hosts |first1=Nick |last1=Zaccardi |date=31 January 2016 |publisher=[[NBC Sports]] |access-date=1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The year before the championships, the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] will also be held in Japan, hosted by Tokyo.

==Host selection==
The competitions originally were to be held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], in the summer of 2021.&lt;ref name="Award"/&gt;  This was announced on July 19, 2013, on the biennial General Congress of [[FINA]] in [[Barcelona]], the host-city of the [[2013 World Aquatics Championships]]. Also [[Gwangju]], [[South Korea]], was awarded the [[2019 World Aquatics Championships|2019 Championships]] in the same vote.

However, in March 2015, it was announced that Budapest will host the [[2017 World Aquatics Championships|2017 Championships]], after [[Guadalajara]] gave up the organization of the championships for financial reasons. A new bidding procedure was opened for the 2021 event.&lt;ref name=Fina2015-03-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=InsideTheGames2015-03-11/&gt;

On 9 June 2015, the FINA reported it had received expressions of interest for the 2021 and 2023 FINA World Championships from Argentina, Australia (with Melbourne or Sydney), China (with Wuhan or Nanjing), Germany (two potential cities), Japan, Turkey and Qatar. On 30 June 2015, an information meeting was organised for the nations and cities which had shown interest in bidding before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fina.org/H2O/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5219 |title=PR 48 - FINA encouraged by strong interest for its 2021 and 2023 World Championships |access-date=30 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924050412/http://www.fina.org/H2O/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5219 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting was attended by representatives of cities from six countries:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/news/6-cities-vying-for-fina-world-championship-hosting-duties/ 6 Cities Vying for FINA World Championship Hosting Duties]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fina.org/H2O/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5255:pr-59-fina-world-championships-2021-a-2023-potential-bidders-meet-in-lausanne&amp;catid=416:2015&amp;Itemid=246 |title=PR 59 - FINA World Championships 2021 &amp; 2023: potential bidders meet in Lausanne |access-date=12 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713214008/http://www.fina.org/H2O/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5255:pr-59-fina-world-championships-2021-a-2023-potential-bidders-meet-in-lausanne&amp;catid=416:2015&amp;Itemid=246 |archive-date=13 July 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3280">'''Abu Salih Mansur''' (died 915) was a [[Samanid]] prince, who served as governor during the reign of his uncle [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad]], his cousin [[Ahmad Samani]], and [[Nasr II]].

== Biography ==
Abu Salih governed several provinces during the reign of Isma'il ibn Ahmad and Ahmad Samani. The first time he is mentioned as a governor is in 902 when he was appointed as governor of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] by Isma'il ibn Ahmad who had conquered territory as far as [[Qazvin]] in Iran. During his governorship of Ray, he became friend with [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]],&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt; a famous [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar. In 910, or 911, he was appointed as governor of [[Sistan]] by Ahmad Samani. However, Abu Salih's oppressive taxation policies sparked a revolt in Sistan within in 912, led by the [[Kharijites|Khariji]] [[Muhammad ibn Hurmuz]], who was a supporter of the [[Saffarid]] [[Amr ibn Ya'qub]]. Abu Salih was then taken prisoner until the rebellion was crushed by a Samanid army under Husain ibn 'Ali Marvarrudhi in 913.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abu-saleh-mansur-b ''ABŪ ṢĀLEḤ MANṢŪR'', C. E. Bosworth, '''Encyclopaedia Iranica''']&lt;/ref&gt; 'Amr was sent to [[Samarkand]], while the other rebel leaders were killed. [[Simjur al-Dawati]] then replaced Mansur as governor of Sistan.

In 914, Mansur was appointed governor of Khorasan, but anarchy unleashed by the death of Ahmad ibn Ismail and the ascent to the throne of the 8 year old child [[Nasr II]]. Mansur's father, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], revolted at [[Samarkand]], while Mansur proclaimed himself as [[Emir]] of [[Nishapur]], and several other cities.
He died a natural death in Nishapur probably in 915, before an army sent against him led by Hammuya ibn Ali reached the city.&lt;ref&gt;''The Samanids'', R.N. Frye, '''The Cambridge History of Iran''', 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ad fraud''' (also referred to as ''Invalid Traffic)'' is concerned with theory and practice of fraudulently representing online advertisement impressions, clicks, conversion or data events in order to generate revenue. While ad fraud is more generally associated with banner ads, video ads and in-app ads, [[click fraud]] has been associated with [[Search engine marketing|search marketing]], mobile advertising and conversion fraud with [[affiliate marketing]]. AppsFlyer estimates financial exposure to app install fraud in Q1 of 2018 was as much as $800 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eladnatanson/2018/06/11/mobile-ad-fraud-in-2018-tackling-the-newest-threats/#5c47db9850f5|title=Mobile Ad Fraud in 2018 - Tackling the Newest Threats|last=Natanson|first=Elad|date=11 June 2018|website=Forbes|archive-url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eladnatanson/2018/06/11/mobile-ad-fraud-in-2018-tackling-the-newest-threats/#5c47db9850f5|archive-date=11 June 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Ad fraud is the categorical term inclusive of all forms of online advertising fraud. In 2004 Google's CFO George Reyes said that fraud is the biggest threat to internet economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/12/02/technology/google_fraud/|title=Google CFO sounds an alarm - Dec.  2, 2004|last=writer|first=By Krysten Crawford, CNN/Money staff|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first research paper covering the topic in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.id.uzh.ch/home/mazzo/reports/www8conf/2149/pdf/pd1.pdf|title=On the security of pay-per-click and other Web advertising schemes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or earlier. In 2016 [[World Federation of Advertisers]] published its first guidance on Ad fraud&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wfanet.org/app/uploads/2017/04/WFA_Compendium_Of_Ad_Fraud_Knowledge.pdf|title=Compendium of ad fraud knowledge for media investors|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to advise its members on how to counter the problem allegedly eating close to US$20 billion of its members ad budgets in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/ad-fraud-eating-digital-advertising-revenue/301017/|title=Report: For Every $3 Spent on Digital Ads, Fraud Takes $1|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other Cybercrime ==
In a 2017 [https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/ad-fraud-to-cost-advertisers-$19-billion-in-2018 report] Juniper Research estimates ad fraud to be worth US$19billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/content-commerce/future-digital-advertising/ai-ad-fraud-ad-blocking-2017-2022|title=Juniper Research - Future Digital Advertising: AI, Ad Fraud &amp; Ad Blocking 2017-2022|last=Barker|first=Sam|date=25 September 2017|website=Juniper Research|archive-url=https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/content-commerce/future-digital-advertising/ai-ad-fraud-ad-blocking-2017-2022|archive-date=25 September 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to $51 million per day. This figure, representing advertising on online and mobile devices, will continue to rise, reaching $44 billion by 2022. Ad fraud is the #1 cybercrime in terms of revenue, ahead of Tax-refund fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/ForensicAndValuation/Resources/ElectronicDataAnalysis/DownloadableDocuments/Top-5-CyberCrimes.pdf|title=THE TOP 5 CYBERCRIMES|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HP Enterprise in its ''Business of Hacking'' report highlighted ad fraud as the easiest and the most lucrative form of [[Cybercrime]].

== Sourced Traffic ==
In a recent publication by [[Association of National Advertisers]] sourced traffic was reported as a notable form of ad fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/rr-2016-sourced-traffic|title=Sourced Traffic: Buyer Beware  {{!}} Industry Insights {{!}} All MKC Content {{!}} ANA|website=www.ana.net|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice where companies partaking in the formal online advertising market buy fraudulent traffic to resell it as legitimate. Sourced traffic has been mistakenly referred to as [[arbitrage]], because buying Sourced traffic does not have any potential for return where as in financial markets [[arbitrage]] refers to "risk-free" trading of legitimate assets. While there is no evidence to support the claim, and such evidence would be impossible to conclusively gather, it may be that Sourced Traffic represents lion's share of the Ad fraud market due to the ease and popularity of acquiring and reselling it. The only evidence-based study to Sourced Traffic found in 2016 that around 50% of the acquired traffic was originating from [[data center]] IP addresses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-06-08|title=Mystery Shopping Inside the Ad-Verification Bubble|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ShailinDhar/mystery-shopping-inside-the-adverification-bubble}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that selected Ad Fraud verification vendors [[Integral Ad Science]] and Moat largely failed to detect it as ad fraud.

An '''approved screening device''' is a term used by the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] to describe a portable measuring instrument that a police officer can use to gather evidence related to [[blood alcohol content]] and the detection of the [[drunk driver|drunk driving]] offence of driving "over 80."  If the police officer believes that a motorist has consumed alcohol prior to driving, the officer can make a demand for a breath sample to be tested by the approved screening device at the roadside.

The results of the screening device test are not admissible in court as proof of blood alcohol level.  However, if the driver fails the screening device test, the officer can make a demand for a further test using an "[[approved instrument]]" at a police detachment which can be used to gather evidence that is admissible in a criminal prosecution.

Where the driver displays significant signs of impairment such as bad driving behaviour or physical signs of intoxication, the officer does not need to use the screening device, but rather can immediately demand for breath sample for testing by the approved instrument.

==Criminal offence of driving "over 80" ==

Canada's criminal law creates two offences of drunk driving:  driving while impaired by alcohol or a drug, and driving with a [[blood alcohol content]] greater than "eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood," colloquially referred to as "over 80" or ".08" (i.e. "point-zero-eight").&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-253.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 253(1).]&lt;/ref&gt;

To gather evidence for the .08 offence, the ''Criminal Code'' provides for roadside screening, using an "approved screening device", and further testing if needed at a police detachment, using an "approved instrument", such as a [[breathalyzer]].

==Definition of "approved screening device"==
    
An approved screening device is a portable instrument used in the field by a police officer, which is checked for accuracy at regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Wilkie, J. G. Wigmore, J. W. Patrick, ''The Performance of the Approved Screening Device, the Alcotest 7410 GLC, in the Field: Low Incidence of False Positive Results in the Identification of Drinking Drivers'' Can. Soc. Forens. Sci. J. Vol. 36. No 3 (2003) pp. 165-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

An approved screening device is defined in the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;approved screening device" means a device of a kind that is designed to ascertain the presence of alcohol in the blood of a person and that is approved for the purposes of this section by order of the Attorney General of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-254.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 254(1), "approved screening device".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Approved Screening Devices Order''&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SI-85-200/page-1.html ''Approved Screening Devices Order'', SI/85-200, as amended by  SI/88-136, s 1;  SOR/93-263, s 2;  SOR/94-193, s 1;  SOR/94-423, s 1;  SOR/96-81, s 1;  SOR/97-116, s 1;  SOR/2009-239, s 1;  SOR/2011-313, s 1;  SOR/2012-61, s 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; establishes certain devices as approved screening devices for use in Canada. These devices are commonly known as ''roadside testers'' or simply as an ''ASD''.

==Demand for a breath sample for screening purposes==
Under provincial laws regulating public highways, the police have a general power to stop drivers to check sobriety.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the law in Ontario:  [https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-h8/latest/ ''Highway Traffic Act'', RSO 1990, c H.8, s 48].  The other provinces and territories have similar provisions.&lt;/ref&gt;  If a police officer stops a motorist and reasonably suspects that a motorist has alcohol in his or her body, the police officer can make a demand for a breath sample for testing in an approved screening device.&lt;ref name="CC254(2)(b)"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-254.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 254(2)(b).]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the police officer makes the demand for a breath sample for screening purposes, the motorist is to provide the sample "forthwith", i.e. immediately.&lt;ref name ="CC254(2)(b)"/&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has held that if the police officer fails to administer the test "forthwith", the screening test may be invalid.&lt;ref name = "grant"&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/800/index.do ''R v Grant'', [1991&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 139.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Court has also held that if there is reason to believe that the motorist has recently consumed alcohol, the alcoholic residue in the mouth could throw off the test results.  In that case, the police are to wait 15 to 20 minutes to allow the alcohol to disperse from the motorist's mouth, ensuring an accurate test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1219/index.do ''R v Bernshaw'', [1995&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 SCR 254.]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the motorist registers a "fail" on the approved screening device test, the police then have grounds to believe that the motorist has committed the offence of driving over .08.  The police officer then may make a demand for a breath sample to be tested on an [[approved instrument]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-254.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 254(3)(a)(i).]&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[breathalyzer]].  The police then take the motorist to the police detachment for the test on the approved instrument.  The results of that test are admissible in court to prove that the accused drove with a blood alcohol content of more than .08.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-258.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 258(1)(c).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refusal to blow==
{{main|Impaired driving in Canada#Sentencing}}
It is a criminal offence to refuse a demand for a breath sample for testing in an approved screening device, provided the demand that has been lawfully made. The ''Criminal Code'' provides as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''254''' (5) Every one commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under this section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-254.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 254(5).]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The penalties for refusing to provide a breath sample for testing in an approved screening device are the same as if the accused had been convicted of the offence of driving over .08.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-255.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 255(1).]&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach reduces the incentive on the motorist to refuse to provide a breath sample for screening purposes.

Possible defences to this offence include challenges to the lawfulness of the demand. Sometimes a demand is unlawful because it is not made forthwith or sometimes the device in question is not used forthwith.&lt;ref name = "grant"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2275/index.do R v Woods, [2005&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2 SCR 205.]&lt;/ref&gt; The demand should be made by the same officer who formed the reasonable suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Pavel'' (1989),  53 CCC (3d) 296 (Ont CA).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional considerations==

===No immediate right to counsel===
[[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 10 of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'']] provides than anyone person who is detained has the right "to retain and instruct counsel without delay".  However, when police officers make roadside screening demands, they generally do not allow the motorist to consult counsel.  The Supreme Court has held that the wording of the ''Criminal Code'' authorising roadside screenings, which says the demand is to be made "forthwith" is a reasonable limit on the right to access counsel immediately.  This finding was based on two points:  (1) the results of the screening test are not admissible as evidence of driving under .08;  (2) if the motorist fails the roadside test and are taken to the police detachment for testing with an approved instrument, the motorist will have the right to consult counsel before being tested with the approved instrument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/317/index.do ''R v Thomsen'', [1988&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1 SCR 640.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disclosure of maintenance records===
The Crown is under a constitutional duty to disclose evidence in its possession which relates to a criminal charge, as part of the accused's right to make full answer and defence, guaranteed by [[Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s 7 of the Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/808/index.do ''R v Stinchcombe'', [1991&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 326.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This duty of disclosure requires the Crown to provide copies of maintenance and calibration records for the screening device&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Campbell'', [2005] OJ No 3037 (Ont SC)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licence suspensions under provincial law==
In addition to the ''Criminal Code'' provisions, provincial laws regulating highway traffic usually provide that a motorist who fails the screening device can result in a temporary suspension of the driver's licence, even if no subsequent criminal charges are laid.  The Supreme Court has held that provincial suspensions of this nature are within provincial constitutional jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/15550/index.do ''Goodwin v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles)'', 2015 SCC 46.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
BiennaleOnline was founded by David Dehaeck and Nathalie Haveman in 2012. The exhibition was set to be launched on September 2012, however it was moved to April 2013.&lt;ref name="Art Daily"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=54541#.URkWJKJeGQk | title=New mobile platform for smart investments in emerging Contemporary art | publisher=''Art Daily'' | accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition is organized by ARTPLUS, a mobile exhibition platform for art lovers and collectors of contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Art in America 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2013-01-29/online-biennial/ | title=Does the Art World Need an Online Biennial? | publisher=''[[Art in America]]'' | date=January 29, 2013 | accessdate=February 11, 2013 | author=Brian Boucher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deredactie 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.francais/magazine/130125_JanHoetBiennaleOnline/ | title=Jan Hoet dirige la première biennale d’art en ligne | publisher=''Deredactie'' | date=January 15, 2013 | accessdate=February 11, 2013 | language= French}} {{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first BiennaleOnline is directed by [[Jan Hoet]]. Hoet previously served as the artistic director of [[Documenta IX]] and the museum [[MARTa Herford]], [[Germany]], and was a founder of [[SMAK]] in Ghent, Belgium. 25 artists, which are carefully chosen by Hoet, will be represented in the center section of the exhibition called "''Reflection &amp; Imagination''".&lt;ref name="Art in America 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Excelsior 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/2013/02/06/882901/ | title=Encuentro de creación en la web, crean una bienal en línea | publisher=''[[Excélsior]]'' | date=February 6, 2013 | accessdate=February 11, 2013 | author=Sonia Ávila | language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Hoet died in a hospital in Ghent on February 27, 2014.

BiennaleOnline is the first of its kind, curated, exclusively online biennial exhibition of contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Deredactie 1"/&gt; 29 Leading international curators select the 183 most promising artists at a critical moment, when they are poised to become established artists.&lt;ref name="Deredactie 1"/&gt; BiennaleOnline aimes to offer an exhibition which breaks away from the conventional notion of Art as an elite pastime, confined to faraway galleries and those with the leisure and funds to enjoy it.

BiennaleOnline started with a "Pay What You want" payment wall. The founders very soon noticed that it was blocking visitors from entering the exhibition. In the best interest of the artists it was decided in May 2012 to remove the payment wall to ensure maximum exposure of their works. Soon after the removal of the payment wall the number of visitors surged to 400.000 within 1 year after opening.

==The second BiennaleOnline==
The second BiennaleOnline will launch in 2017
.
The BiennaleOnline attracted more than 400.000 visitors since its launch in April 2012. The success the BiennaleOnline led to the decision to present the exhibition on its native platform separate from ART+.  In 2014 ART+ modified its business model to focus solely on facilitating secure ownership and trade of media art online.

[[File:Stachledraht DDos Attack.svg|thumb|[[Stacheldraht]] botnet diagram showing a DDoS attack. (Note this is also an example of a type of client-server model of a botnet.)]]
A '''botnet''' is a number of [[Internet]]-connected devices, each of which is running one or more [[Internet bot|bots]]. Botnets can be used to perform [[distributed denial-of-service attack]] (DDoS attack), steal data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thingbots: The Future of Botnets in the Internet of Things|url=https://securityintelligence.com/thingbots-the-future-of-botnets-in-the-internet-of-things/|website=Security Intelligence|accessdate=28 July 2017|date=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control (C&amp;C) software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.techopedia.com/definition/384/botnet |title= botnet |first= |last= |accessdate= 9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "botnet" is a combination of the words "[[robot]]" and "[[Computer network|network]]". The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation.

==Overview==
A botnet is a logical collection of internet-connected devices such as computers, [[smartphone]]s or [[Internet of things|IoT]] devices whose security has been breached and control ceded to a third party. Each such compromised device, known as a "bot", is created when a device is penetrated by software from a ''malware'' (malicious software)  distribution. The controller of a botnet is able to direct the activities of these compromised computers through communication channels formed by standards-based [[network protocol]]s such as [[IRC]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/malicious/bots-botnet-overview-1299 |title=Bots &amp;; Botnet: An Overview |last=Ramneek |first=Puri |date=2003-08-08 |format=PDF |publisher=[[SANS Institute]] |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botnets are increasingly [[Cyber-arms industry#Online|rented out]] by [[Cybercrime|cyber criminals]] as commodities for a variety of purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Danchev| first1=Dancho| title=Novice cyberciminals offer commercial access to five mini botnets| url=http://www.webroot.com/blog/2013/10/11/novice-cyberciminals-offer-commercial-access-5-mini-botnets/| accessdate=28 June 2015| date=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Botnet architecture has evolved over time in an effort to evade detection and disruption. Traditionally, bot programs are constructed as clients which communicate via existing servers. This allows the '''bot herder''' (the person controlling the botnet) to perform all control from a remote location, which obfuscates their traffic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many recent botnets now rely on existing peer-to-peer networks to communicate. These P2P bot programs perform the same actions as the client-server model, but they do not require a central server to communicate.

===Client-server model===
[[Image:Server-based-network.svg|thumb|rt|250px|A network based on the client-server model, where individual clients request services and resources from centralized servers]]
The first botnets on the internet used a client-server model to accomplish their tasks. Typically, these botnets operate through Internet Relay Chat networks, domains, or websites. Infected clients access a predetermined location and await incoming commands from the server. The bot herder sends commands to the server, which relays them to the clients. Clients execute the commands and report their results back to the bot herder.

In the case of IRC botnets, infected clients connect to an infected IRC server and join a channel pre-designated for C&amp;C by the bot herder. The bot herder sends commands to the channel via the IRC server. Each client retrieves the commands and executes them. Clients send messages back to the IRC channel with the results of their actions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781597491358500044| title=Botnets| last=Schiller| first=Craig A.| last2=Binkley| first2=Jim| last3=Harley| first3=David| last4=Evron| first4=Gadi| last5=Bradley| first5=Tony| last6=Willems| first6=Carsten| last7=Cross| first7=Michael| date=2007-01-01 |publisher=Syngress| isbn=9781597491358| location=Burlington| pages=29–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer-to-peer===
[[Image:P2P-network.svg|thumb|250px|A peer-to-peer (P2P) network in which interconnected nodes ("peers") share resources among each other without the use of a centralized administrative system]]

In response to efforts to detect and decapitate IRC botnets, bot herders have begun deploying malware on peer-to-peer networks. These bots may use digital signatures so that only someone with access to the private key can control the botnet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Heron| first=Simon| date=2007-04-01| title=Botnet command and control techniques| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353485807700454| journal=Network Security| volume=2007| issue=4| pages=13–16| doi=10.1016/S1353-4858(07)70045-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; See e.g. [[Gameover ZeuS]] and [[ZeroAccess botnet]].

Newer botnets fully operate over P2P networks. Rather than communicate with a centralized server, P2P bots perform as both a command distribution server and a client which receives commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-9P1EkTkigC&amp;pg=PA335|title=Handbook of Information and Communication Security|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9783642041174|editors=Stamp, Mark &amp; Stavroulakis, Peter|chapter=Peer-to-peer botnets|display-authors=etal|authors=Wang, Ping}}&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids having any single point of failure, which is an issue for centralized botnets.

In order to find other infected machines, the bot discreetly probes random IP addresses until it contacts another infected machine. The contacted bot replies with information such as its software version and list of known bots. If one of the bots' version is lower than the other, they will initiate a file transfer to update.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This way, each bot grows its list of infected machines and updates itself by periodically communicating to all known bots.

==Core components of a botnet==
A botnet's originator (known as a "[[bot herder]]" or "bot master") controls the botnet remotely. This is known as the command-and-control (C&amp;C). The program for the operation which must communicate via a [[covert channel]] to the client on the victim's machine (zombie computer).

=== Control protocols ===
IRC is a historically favored means of C&amp;C because of its [[List of Internet Relay Chat commands|communication protocol]]. A bot herder creates an IRC channel for infected clients to join. Messages sent to the channel are broadcast to all channel members. The bot herder may set the channel's topic to command the botnet. E.g. the message &lt;code&gt;:herder!herder@example.com TOPIC #channel DDoS www.victim.com&lt;/code&gt; from the bot herder alerts all infected clients belonging to #channel to begin a DDoS attack on the website www.victim.com. An example response &lt;code&gt;:bot1!bot1@compromised.net PRIVMSG #channel I am DDoSing www.victim.com&lt;/code&gt; by a bot client alerts the bot herder that it has begun the attack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some botnets implement custom versions of well-known protocols. The implementation differences can be used for detection of botnets. For example, [[Mega-D]] features a slightly modified [[SMTP]] implementation for testing spam capability. Bringing down the [[Mega-D]]'s [[SMTP]] server disables the entire pool of bots that rely upon the same [[SMTP]] server.&lt;ref&gt;C.Y. Cho, D. Babic, R. Shin, and D. Song. [http://www.domagoj-babic.com/index.php/Pubs/CCS10botnets Inference and Analysis of Formal Models of Botnet Command and Control Protocols], 2010 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zombie computer===
In computer science, a [[Zombie (computer science)|zombie computer]] is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse and can be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction. Botnets of zombie computers are often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-of-service attacks. Most owners of zombie computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to be unaware, these computers are metaphorically compared to zombies. A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a zombie horde attack. Many computer users are unaware that their computer is infected with bots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Teresa Dixon Murray |title=Banks can't prevent cyber attacks like those hitting PNC, Key, U.S. Bank this week|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2012/09/banks_cant_prevent_cyber_attac.html|publisher=Cleveland.com |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of stealing computing resources as a result of a system being joined to a "botnet" is sometimes referred to as "scrumping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arntz|first1=Pieter|title=The Facts about Botnets|url=https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2015/02/the-facts-about-botnets/|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Command and control==
Botnet Command and control (C&amp;C) protocols have been implemented in a number of ways, from traditional IRC approaches to more sophisticated versions.

=== Telnet ===
Telnet botnets use a simple C&amp;C botnet Protocol in which bots connect to the main command server to host the botnet. Bots are added to the botnet by using a scanning script, the scanning script is run on an external server and scans IP ranges for telnet and SSH server default logins. Once a login is found it is added to an infection list and infected with a malicious infection line via SSH on from the scanner server. When the SSH command is run it infects the server and commands the server to ping to the control server and becomes its slave from the malicious code infecting it. Once servers are infected to the server the bot controller can launch DDoS attacks of high volume using the C&amp;C panel on the host server. These types of botnets were used to take down large websites like Xbox and PlayStation network by a known hacking group called Lizard Squad.

=== IRC ===
IRC networks use simple, low bandwidth communication methods, making them widely used to host botnets. They tend to be relatively simple in construction and have been used with moderate success for coordinating DDoS attacks and spam campaigns while being able to continually switch channels to avoid being taken down. However, in some cases, merely blocking of certain keywords has proven effective in stopping IRC-based botnets. The RFC 1459 ([[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]) standard is popular with botnets. The first known popular botnet controller script, "MaXiTE Bot" was using IRC XDCC protocol for private control commands.

One problem with using IRC is that each bot client must know the IRC server, port, and channel to be of any use to the botnet. Anti-malware organizations can detect and shut down these servers and channels, effectively halting the botnet attack. If this happens, clients are still infected, but they typically lie dormant since they have no way of receiving instructions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To mitigate this problem, a botnet can consist of several servers or channels. If one of the servers or channels becomes disabled, the botnet simply switches to another. It is still possible to detect and disrupt additional botnet servers or channels by sniffing IRC traffic. A botnet adversary can even potentially gain knowledge of the control scheme and imitate the bot herder by issuing commands correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781597491358500056 |title=Botnets |last=Schiller |first=Craig A. |last2= Binkley |first2=Jim |last3=Harley |first3= David | last4=Evron |first4=Gadi |last5= Bradley |first5=Tony |last6=Willems |first6= Carsten |last7= Cross |first7= Michael |date= 2007-01-01 |publisher= Syngress |isbn= 978-159749135-8 |location= Burlington |pages= 77–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===P2P===
Since most botnets using IRC networks and domains can be taken down with time, hackers have moved to P2P botnets with C&amp;C as a way to make it harder to be taken down.

Some have also used encryption as a way to secure or lock down the botnet from others, most of the time when they use encryption it is [[public-key cryptography]] and has presented challenges in both implementing it and breaking it.

=== Domains ===
Many large botnets tend to use domains rather than IRC in their construction (see [[Rustock botnet]] and [[Srizbi botnet]]). They are usually hosted with [[bulletproof hosting]] services. This is one of the earliest types of C&amp;C. A [[zombie (computer science)|zombie]] computer accesses a specially-designed webpage or domain(s) which serves the list of controlling commands. The advantages of using web pages or domains as C&amp;C is that a large botnet can be effectively controlled and maintained with very simple code that can be readily updated.

Disadvantages of using this method are that it uses a considerable amount of bandwidth at large scale, and domains can be quickly seized by government agencies without much trouble or effort. If the domains controlling the botnets are not seized, they are also easy targets to compromise with [[denial-of-service attack]]s.

[[Fast flux|Fast-flux DNS]] can be used as a way to make it difficult to track down the control servers, which may change from day to day. Control servers may also hop from DNS domain to DNS domain, with [[domain generation algorithm]]s being used to create new DNS names for controller servers.

Some botnets use free [[Domain Name System|DNS]] hosting services such as DynDns.org, No-IP.com, and Afraid.org to point a [[subdomain]] towards an IRC server that harbors the bots. While these free DNS services do not themselves host attacks, they provide reference points (often hard-coded into the botnet executable). Removing such services can cripple an entire botnet.

==Construction==
=== Traditional ===
This example illustrates how a botnet is created and used for malicious gain.

# A hacker purchases or builds a Trojan and/or exploit kit and uses it to start infecting users' computers, whose payload is a malicious application—the ''bot''.
# The ''bot'' instructs the infected PC to connect to a particular command-and-control (C&amp;C) server. (This allows the botmaster to keep logs of how many bots are active and online.)
# The botmaster may then use the bots to gather keystrokes or use form grabbing to steal online credentials and may rent out the botnet as DDoS and/or spam as a service or sell the credentials online for a profit.
# Depending on the quality and capability of the bots, the value is increased or decreased.

Newer bots can automatically scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords. Generally, the more vulnerabilities a bot can scan and propagate through, the more valuable it becomes to a botnet controller community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/botnet.html Attack of the Bots] at ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Computers can be co-opted into a botnet when they execute malicious software. This can be accomplished by luring users into making a [[drive-by download]], exploiting [[browser exploit|web browser vulnerabilities]], or by tricking the user into running a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] program, which may come from an email attachment. This malware will typically install modules that allow the computer to be commanded and controlled by the botnet's operator. After the software is downloaded, it will call home (send a reconnection [[Network packet|packet]]) to the host computer. When the re-connection is made, depending on how it is written, a Trojan may then delete itself or may remain present to update and maintain the modules.

=== Others ===
In some cases, a botnet may be temporarily created by volunteer [[Hacktivism|hacktivist]]s, such as with implementations of the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] as used by [[4chan]] members during [[Project Chanology]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton |first=Quinn |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/anonymous-101-part-deux/3/ |title=Anonymous 101 Part Deux: Morals Triumph Over Lulz |publisher=Wired.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[Great Cannon|Great Cannon of China]] allows the modification of legitimate web browsing traffic at [[internet backbone]]s into China to create a large ephemeral botnet to attack large targets such as [[GitHub]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="WSP-China-Deploys-New-Weapon-Online-Censorship-Great-Cannon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/04/10/china-escalates-censorship-efforts-with-debut-of-offensive-cyber-weapon-researchers-say/ | title=China deploys new weapon for online censorship in form of 'Great Cannon' | publisher=The Washington Post | date=April 10, 2015 | accessdate=April 10, 2015 | author=Peterson, Andrea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common features==
* Most botnets currently feature [[distributed denial-of-service attack]]s in which multiple systems submit as many requests as possible to a single Internet computer or service, overloading it and preventing it from servicing legitimate requests. An example is an attack on a victim's server. The victim's server is bombarded with requests by the bots, attempting to connect to the server, therefore, overloading it.
* [[Spyware]] is software which sends information to its creators about a user's activities&amp;nbsp;– typically passwords, credit card numbers and other information that can be sold on the black market. Compromised machines that are located within a corporate network can be worth more to the bot herder, as they can often gain access to confidential corporate information. Several targeted attacks on large corporations aimed to steal sensitive information, such as the Aurora botnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damballa.com/research/aurora/ |title=Operation Aurora&amp;nbsp;— The Command Structure |publisher=Damballa.com |date= |accessdate=30 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611140112/http://www.damballa.com/research/aurora/ |archivedate=11 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[E-mail spam]] are e-mail messages disguised as messages from people, but are either advertising, annoying, or malicious.
* [[Click fraud]] occurs when the user's computer visits websites without the user's awareness to create false web traffic for personal or commercial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Jim|title=This Is What It Looks Like When A Click-Fraud Botnet Secretly Controls Your Web Browser|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-a-click-fraud-botnet-secretly-controls-your-web-browser-2013-11|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bitcoin]] mining was used in some of the more recent botnets have which include bitcoin mining as a feature in order to generate profits for the operator of the botnet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nichols|first1=Shaun|title=Got a botnet? Thinking of using it to mine Bitcoin? Don't bother|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/06/24/bad_news_malware_infections_are_mining_bitcoin_good_news_theyre_not_making_any_money/|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bitcoinmining.com/ |title=Bitcoin Mining |publisher=BitcoinMining.com |date= |accessdate=30 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.bitcoinmining.com |archivedate=30 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Self-spreading functionality, to seek for pre-configured command-and-control(CNC) pushed instruction contains targeted devices or network, to aim for more infection, is also spotted in several botnets. Some of the botnets are utilizing this function to automate their infections.

==Market==
The botnet controller community features a constant and continuous struggle over who has the most bots, the highest overall bandwidth, and the most "high-quality" infected machines, like university, corporate, and even government machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trojan horse, and Virus FAQ|url=http://www.dslreports.com/faq/trojans/1.0_Trojan_horses|publisher=DSLReports|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While botnets are often named after the malware that created them, multiple botnets typically use the same malware but are operated by different entities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.damballa.com/downloads/d_pubs/WP%20Many-to-Many%20Botnet%20Relationships%20%282009-05-21%29.pdf Many-to-Many Botnet Relationships], ''Damballa'', 8 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
The geographic dispersal of botnets means that each recruit must be individually identified/corralled/repaired and limits the benefits of [[firewall (networking)|filtering]].

Computer security experts have succeeded in destroying or subverting malware command and control networks, by, among other means, seizing servers or getting them cut off from the Internet, denying access to domains that were due to be used by malware to contact its C&amp;C infrastructure, and, in some cases, breaking into the C&amp;C network itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detecting and Dismantling Botnet Command and Control Infrastructure using Behavioral Profilers and Bot Informants|url=http://wwweb.eecs.umich.edu/fjgroup/botnets/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~chris/research/doc/acsac12_disclosure.pdf|title=DISCLOSURE: Detecting Botnet Command and Control Servers Through Large-Scale NetFlow Analysis|publisher=ACM|work=Annual Computer Security Applications Conference|date=Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|citeseerx = 10.1.1.110.8092|title=BotSniffer: Detecting Botnet Command and Control Channels in Network Traffic|date=2008|conference=Proceedings of the 15th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, C&amp;C operators have resorted to using techniques such as overlaying their C&amp;C networks on other existing benign infrastructure such as [[IRC]] or [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]], using [[peer-to-peer networking]] systems that are not dependent on any fixed servers, and using [[public key encryption]] to defeat attempts to break into or spoof the network.

[[Norton AntiBot]] was aimed at consumers, but most target enterprises and/or ISPs. Host-based techniques use heuristics to identify bot behavior that has bypassed conventional [[anti-virus software]]. Network-based approaches tend to use the techniques described above; shutting down C&amp;C servers, null-routing DNS entries, or completely shutting down IRC servers. [[BotHunter]] is software, developed with support from the [[U.S. Army Research Office]], that detects botnet activity within a network by analyzing network traffic and comparing it to patterns characteristic of malicious processes.

Researchers at [[Sandia National Laboratories]] are analyzing botnets' behavior by simultaneously running one million Linux kernels—a similar scale to a botnet—as [[virtual machines]] on a 4,480-node high-performance [[computer cluster]] to emulate a very large network, allowing them to watch how botnets work and experiment with ways to stop them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Researchers-Boot-Million-Linux-Kernels-to-Help-Botnet-Research-550216/?kc=EWKNLLIN08182009STR2 |title=Researchers Boot Million Linux Kernels to Help Botnet Research |publisher=IT Security &amp; Network Security News |date=2009-08-12 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One thing that's becoming more apparent is the fact that detecting automated bot attacks is becoming more difficult each day as newer and more sophisticated generations of bots are getting launched by attackers. For example, an automated attack can deploy a large bot army and apply brute-force methods with highly accurate username and password lists to hack into accounts. The idea is to overwhelm sites with tens of thousands of requests from different IPs all over the world, but with each bot only submitting a single request every 10 minutes or so, which can result in more than 5 million attempts per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/brute-force-botnet-attacks-now-elude-volumetric-detection/a/d-id/1327742 |title=Brute-Force Botnet Attacks Now Elude Volumetric Detection |publisher=DARKReading from [[Information Week]] |date=2016-12-19 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, many tools try to leverage volumetric detection, but automated bot attacks now have ways of circumventing triggers of volumetric detection.
 
One of the techniques for detecting these bot attacks is what's known as "signature-based systems" in which the software will attempt to detect patterns in the request packet. But attacks are constantly evolving, so this may not be a viable option when patterns can't be discerned from thousands of requests. There's also the behavioral approach to thwarting bots, which ultimately is trying distinguish bots from humans. By identifying non-human behavior and recognizing known bot behavior, this process can be applied at the user, browser, and network levels.

The most capable method of using software to combat against a virus has been to utilize [[Honeypot (computing)|Honeypot]] software in order to convince the malware that a system is vulnerable. The malicious files are then analyzed using forensic software.

On July  15, 2014, the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, held a hearing on the threats posed by botnets and the public and private efforts to disrupt and dismantle them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=United States.

==Historical list of botnets==
The first botnet was first acknowledged and exposed by [[Earthlink]] during a lawsuit with notorious spammer Khan C. Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Credeur|first=Mary|title=Atlanta Business Chronicle, Staff Writer|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2002/07/22/story4.html?page=all|publisher=bizjournals.com|accessdate=22 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001 for the purpose of bulk spam accounting for nearly 25% of all spam at the time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Around 2006, to thwart detection, some botnets were scaling back in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2006/04/r4017.pdf |format=PDF|title=Hackers Strengthen Malicious Botnets by Shrinking Them|journal=Computer; News Briefs |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |date=April 2006 |accessdate=12 November 2013 |doi=10.1109/MC.2006.136|quote=The size of bot networks peaked in mid-2004, with many using more than 100,000 infected machines, according to Mark Sunner, chief technology officer at MessageLabs.The average botnet size is now about 20,000 computers, he said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara took control of a botnet that was six times smaller than expected. In some countries, it is common that users change their IP address a few times in one day. Estimating the size of the botnet by the number of IP addresses is often used by researchers, possibly leading to inaccurate assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Espiner |first=Tom |url=http://www.zdnet.com/botnet-size-may-be-exaggerated-says-enisa-3040092062/ |title=Botnet size may be exaggerated, says Enisa &amp;#124; Security Threats &amp;#124; ZDNet UK |publisher=Zdnet.com |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show will premiere on February 13, 2019, with 32 shows currently planned through August 17, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.etonline.com/britney-spears-gets-brand-new-las-vegas-residency-will-make-500k-a-show-111865|title=Britney Spears Gets Brand-New Las Vegas Residency, Will Make $500K a Show|last=Bueno|first=Antoinette|date=October 18, 2018|work=ET Online|access-date=October 18, 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and announcement==
After completing 248 shows at [[Zappos Theater]] at [[Planet Hollywood Las Vegas|Planet Hollywood]] between December 2013 and December 2017, Spears announced her second residency at the Toshiba Plaza at [[T-Mobile Arena]] on October 18, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment-columns/kats/britney-spears-next-las-vegas-strip-appearance-is-thursday/|title=Britney Spears’ next Las Vegas Strip appearance is Thursday|last=Katsilometes|first=John|date=October 16, 2018|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=October 18, 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, multiple publications began reporting that the show would have an "urban vibe" and would be different from her [[Britney: Piece of Me|previous residency]]. The stage will take advantage of [[bleeding edge technology]], with Spears to perform a mix of her hit songs with a hip hop influence throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/britney-spears-plans-hip-hop-show-for-las-vegas-residency-urban-moves-reported-news.62657.html%3f_amp|title=Britney:Domination|date=20 October 2018|access-date=20 October 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CON-CAN Movie Festival''' (CON-CAN) is an audience-interactive online international short movie festival which aims to discover hidden creative talent from all over the world, enabling image creators and a global audience to share the underlying messages and sheer creativity expressed in profound short movie productions. Founded in 2005, the short movie festival enables users to watch short movies for free on its site. The festival's award ceremony is held annually in Tokyo, Japan.

The [[2008 CON-CAN Movie Festival]] is currently underway and will have its award ceremony in Mid-November 2008.

== History ==

The idea for the CON-CAN Movie Festival was founded by Masahiro Yoshino, CEO of Media Research, Inc., a Japanese company that specializes in [[IT consulting]], translation, publishing and [[media arts]].&lt;ref name="japantimeshistory"&gt;{{cite news|first=Mizuho|last=Aoki|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20071130a4.html|title=A film fest on the Net|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=2007-11-30|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media Research, Inc. launched CON-CAN Movie Festival online in 2005. The name CON-CAN was first thought of in Japanese (魂観). CON(魂) represents the soul and CAN(観) represents viewers watching with true appreciation.

The 1st CON-CAN Movie Festival was held in 2005 as an international online short movie festival with two types of awards; one, an Audience Award that is presented by viewers, and the other a Grand Prix award (the best short movie) and two Tamashii awards (special jury awards) decided by the CON-CAN International Jury. A total of 151 short movies from 25 different countries were submitted. Since then, CON-CAN has expanded to receive over 550 submissions from over 50 different countries in 2008.

==Selection process==

Once the submission deadline passes, the process of selecting the movies for the movie festival begins. The programming department at CON-CAN is responsible for a preliminary screening of the movies. The best 80 movies out of all the submitted movies are selected to be part of the movie festival and their directors are notified via email.

The movie festival then branches off into two parts. One part consists of the 80 movies being passed through a first round evaluation and judged by a domestic (Japanese) jury. These preliminary jury members select the best 20 movies to be considered for the final evaluation process. In the final evaluation round, international jury members selected by the CON-CAN staff select the top three nominations to be awarded the Grand Prix award (the best short movie) and the two Tamashii awards (special jury awards).&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Jeffs|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20080614a1.html|title=CON-CAN launches movie competition|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=2008-06-13|accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the Grand Prix award and the two Tamashii award winners are invited to Tokyo with travel and accommodations paid for in order to attend the award ceremony. The award ceremony hosts famous people from the movie industry and notable news networks.

Another part consists of the 80 movies being categorized into four groups. Each group is independently displayed on CON-CAN's website. During this time, registered voters are able to watch free movies and animations, rate the movies and comment on them. The movie with the highest rating in each category is awarded an Audience Award.

{{Criminal law}}
In [[criminal law]], a '''conspiracy''' is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crime.about.com/od/Crime_101/f/What-Is-A-Conspiracy.htm|title=The Crime of Conspiracy is a Complicated Matter|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one [[overt act]] be undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an [[criminal offense|offense]]. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare [[attempt]]s which require proximity to the full offense). For the purposes of [[concurrence]], the ''[[actus reus]]'' is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur joint liability and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, [[repentance]] by one or more parties does not affect liability (unless, in some cases, it occurs ''before'' the parties have committed overt acts) but may reduce their [[sentence (law)|sentence]].

==England and Wales==

===Common law offence===
At [[common law]], the crime of conspiracy was capable of infinite growth, able to accommodate any new situation and to criminalize it if the level of threat to [[society]] was sufficiently great. The [[court]]s were therefore acting in the role of the [[legislature]] to create new offences and, following the [[Law Commission]] Report No. 76 on Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1976/76.pdf Report on Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform] [1976] EWLC 76 (1 January 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]] produced a statutory offence and abolished all the common law varieties of conspiracy, except two: that of conspiracy to defraud, and that of conspiracy to corrupt public morals or to outrage public decency.

====Conspiracy to defraud====
{{further|conspiracy to defraud}}

Section 5(2) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]] preserved the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Act 1977  [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/5 Section 5(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conspiracy to defraud was defined in ''Scott v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis'' per Viscount Dilhorne:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1974/4.html Scott v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis (1974) UKHL 4]; [1975] AC 819, 839&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"to defraud" ordinarily means … to deprive a person dishonestly of something which is his or of something to which he is or would or might but for the perpetration of the fraud be entitled.}}

{{quote|....an agreement by two or more [persons] by dishonesty to deprive a person of something which is his or to which he is or would be or might be entitled [or] an agreement by two or more by dishonesty to injure some proprietary right of his suffices to constitute the offence....}}

====Conspiracy to corrupt public morals or to outrage public decency====
Section 5(3) Criminal Law Act 1977&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Act 1977  [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/5 Section 5(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;  preserved the common law offence of conspiracy to corrupt public morals or of conspiracy to outrage public decency.

Conspiracy to corrupt public morals is an offence under the common law of England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1961/1.html Shaw v Director of Public Prosecutions] [1962] AC 220, [1961] 2 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 897, [1961] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 446, 125 JP 437, 105 [[Solicitors Journal|Sol Jo]] 421, 45 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 113, [[House of Lords|HL]]; [http://www.inquisition21.com/pca_1978/reference/1973AC435.html ''Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions''] [1973] AC 435, [1972] 3 WLR 143, [1972] 2 All ER 898, 136 JP 728, 116 Sol Jo 545, 56 Cr App R 633, HL&lt;/ref&gt;

Conspiracy to outrage public decency is an offence under the common law of England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquisition21.com/pca_1978/reference/1973AC435.html ''Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions'']; [1973] AC 435, [1972] 3 WLR 143, [1972] 2 All ER 898, 136 JP 728, 116 Sol Jo 545, 56 Cr App R 633, HL (Lords Diplock and Reid dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5(1) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]] does not affect the common law offence of conspiracy if, and in so far as, it can be committed by entering into an agreement to engage in conduct which tends to corrupt public morals, or which outrages public decency, but which does not amount to or involve the commission of an offence if carried out by a single person otherwise than in pursuance of an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Law Act 1977]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/5 section 5(3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

One authority maintains that conspiracy to "corrupt public morals" has no definitive case law, that it is unknown whether or not it is a substantive offence, and that it is unlikely that conspirators will be prosecuted for this offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herring |first=Jonathan |year=2008 |title=Criminal Law: Text, Cases and Materials |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |ISBN=978-0-19-923432-5 |page=812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div id="public_decency"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;These two offences cover situations where, for example, a publisher encourages immoral behavior through explicit content in a magazine or periodical, as in the 1970 case of ''Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v Director of Public Prosecutions'', which ultimately was decided in 1973 by the House of Lords.

In the 1991 case of ''R v Rowley'',&lt;ref&gt;''R v Rowley'', [1991] 4 All ER 649&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant left notes in public places over a period of three weeks offering money and presents to boys with the [[intention (criminal law)|intention]] of luring them for immoral purposes, but there was nothing lewd, obscene or disgusting in the notes, nor were they printed by a newsmagazine at the behest of Rowley, which would have invoked the element of conspiracy.  The judge ruled that the [[jury]] was entitled to look at the purpose behind the notes in deciding whether they were lewd or disgusting. On appeal against [[conviction (law)|conviction]], it was held that an act outraging public decency required a deliberate act which was in itself lewd, obscene or disgusting, so Rowley’s motive in leaving the notes was irrelevant and, since there was nothing in the notes themselves capable of outraging public decency, the conviction was quashed.

===Statutory offence===
{{unreferencedsect|date=January 2017}}
This offence was created as a result of the Law Commission's recommendations in their Report, Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform, 1976, Law Com No 76. This was part of the Commission's programme of codification of the criminal law. The eventual aim was to abolish all the remaining common law offences and replace them, where appropriate, with offences precisely defined by statute. The common law offences were seen as unacceptably vague and open to development by the courts in ways which might offend the principle of certainty. There was an additional problem that it could be a criminal conspiracy at common law to engage in conduct which was not in itself a criminal offence: see Law Com No 76, para 1.7. This was a major mischief at which the 1977 Act was aimed,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} although it retained the convenient concept of a common law [[conspiracy to defraud]]: see Law Com No 76, paras 1.9 and 1.16. Henceforward, according to the Law Commission, it would only be an offence to agree to engage in a course of conduct which was itself a criminal offence.

Section 1(1) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]] provides:
{{quote|if a person agrees with any other person or persons that a course of conduct shall be pursued which, if the agreement is carried out in accordance with their intentions, either -
(a) will necessarily amount to or involve the commission of any offence or offences by one or more of the parties to the agreement, or
(b) would do so but for the existence of facts which render the commission of the offence or any of the offences impossible, [added by S.5 Criminal Attempts Act 1981]
he is guilty of conspiracy to commit the offence or offences in question.}}

Section 1A (inserted by the [[Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998]], s5) bans conspiracies part of which occurred in England and Wales to commit an act or the happening of some other event outside the United Kingdom which constitutes an offence under the law in force in that country or territory. Many conditions apply including that prosecutions need consent from the Attorney General.

====Exceptions====
*Under section 2(1) the intended victim of the offence can not be guilty of conspiracy.
*Under section 2(2) there can be no conspiracy where the only other person(s) to the agreement are:{{ordered list| list_style_type=lower-alpha
| a [[spouse]] or [[civil partner]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T997337556&amp;format=GNBFULL&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T997337558&amp;cisb=22_T997337557&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=274768&amp;docNo=4]&lt;/ref&gt;
| a person under the [[age of criminal responsibility]]; or
| an intended victim of that offence.}}

====''Mens rea''====
There must be an agreement between two or more persons.  The ''mens rea'' of conspiracy is a separate issue from the ''mens rea'' required of the substantive crime.

Lord Bridge in ''R v Anderson'' - quoted in ''R v Hussain'' said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2005/87.html Hussain R. v (2005) EWCA Crim 87 (07 June 2005) at paragraph 125]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|an essential ingredient in the crime of conspiring to commit a specific offence or offences under section 1(1) of the Act of 1977 is that the accused should agree that a course of conduct be pursued which he knows must involve the commission by one or more of the parties to the agreement of that offence or those offences.}}

Lord Bridge in ''R v Anderson'' also said:

{{quote|But, beyond the mere fact of agreement, the necessary ''mens rea'' of the crime is, in my opinion, established if, and only if, it is shown that the accused, when he entered into the agreement, intended to play some part in the agreed course of conduct in furtherance of the criminal purpose which the agreed course of action was intended to achieve. Nothing less will suffice; nothing more is required.}}

It is not therefore necessary for any action to be taken in furtherance of the criminal purpose in order for a conspiracy offence to have been committed.  This distinguishes a conspiracy from an attempt (which necessarily does involve a person doing an act) see [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]].

====Things said or done by one conspirator====
Lord Steyn in ''R v Hayter'' said:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/6.html R v Hayter] [2005] UKHL 6 (3 February 2005) at paragraph 25&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|The rule about confessions is subject to exceptions. Keane, The Modern Law of Evidence 5th ed., (2000) p 385–386, explains:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit|In two exceptional situations, a confession may be admitted not only as evidence against its maker but also as evidence against a co-accused implicated thereby. The first is where the co-accused by his words or conduct accepts the truth of the statement so as to make all or part of it a confession statement of his own. The second exception, which is perhaps best understood in terms of implied agency, applies in the case of conspiracy: statements (or acts) of one conspirator which the jury is satisfied were said (or done) in the execution or furtherance of the common design are admissible in evidence against another conspirator, even though he was not present at the time, to prove the nature and scope of the conspiracy, provided that there is some independent evidence to show the existence of the conspiracy and that the other conspirator was a party to it.}}}}

===History===
According to [[Edward Coke]], conspiracy was originally a statutory remedy against false accusation and prosecution by "a consultation and agreement between two or more to appeal or indict an innocent man falsely and maliciously of felony, whom they cause to be indicted and appealed; and afterward the party is lawfully acquitted".&lt;ref name=CECJ&gt;Conspiracy, 1 Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 241-2 (2d ed. 2002); James Burke, Sandord Kadish,Dan M. Kahan&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Poulterer's Case]]'', 77 Eng. Rep. 813 (K.B. 1611), the court reasoned that the thrust of the crime was the confederating of two or more, and dropped the requirement that an actual indictment of an innocent take place, whereby precedent was set that conspiracy only need involve an [[attempt]]ed crime, and that the agreement was the act, which enabled subsequent holdings against an agreement to commit any crime, not just that originally proscribed.&lt;ref name=CECJ/&gt;

====Conspiracy to trespass====

Here, nine students, who were nationals of [[Sierra Leone]], appealed their convictions for conspiracy to trespass, and unlawful assembly.  These persons, together with others who did not appeal, conspired to occupy the London premises of the High Commissioner for Sierra Leone in order to publicize grievances against the government of that country. Upon their arrival at the Commission, they threatened the caretaker with an imitation firearm and locked him in a reception room with ten other members of the staff.  The students then held a press conference on the telephone, but the caretaker was able to contact the police, who arrived, released the prisoners, and arrested the accused. In this case the Court felt that the public interest was clearly involved because of the statutory duty of the British Government to protect diplomatic premises. Lauton J. delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal from conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/userfiles/other/2803069-mackinnon.pdf lawjournal.mcgill.ca: "Conspiracy and Sedition as Canadian Political Crimes"], v23 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  See ''Kamara v Director of Public Prosecutions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Kamara v Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1974] AC 104, [1973] 3 WLR 198, [1973] 2 All ER 1242, 117 Sol Jo 581, 57 Cr App R 880, [[House of Lords|HL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conspiracy to corrupt public morals and conspiracy to outrage public decency====
{{see also|Wolfenden report}}
These offences were at one time tied up with prostitution and homosexual behaviour. After the Second World War, due to the fame of several convicts, the [[Wolfenden report]] was commissioned by government, and was published in 1957. Thereupon came the publication of several books, both pro and contra the report. Of these books we can isolate two representatives: [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin#Wolfenden report|Lord Devlin]] wrote in favour of societal norms, or morals, while [[H. L. A. Hart]] wrote that the state could ill-regulate private conduct. In May 1965, Devlin is reported to have conceded defeat.&lt;ref name="Wolfenden"&gt;
{{citation |title=Law on Homosexuals |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=mclib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS218982571&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |newspaper=The Times |date=11 May 1965 |issue=56318 |page=13 |accessdate=20 July 2012}} {{subscription required}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Street Offences Act 1959]] prohibited England's prostitutes from soliciting in the streets.  One Shaw published a booklet containing prostitutes' names and addresses; each woman listed had paid Shaw for her advertisement.  A 1962 majority in the House of Lords not only found the appellant guilty of a statutory offence (living on the earnings of prostitution), but also of the "common law misdemeanour of conspiracy to corrupt public morals".&lt;ref name=shaw&gt;''Shaw v. D.P.P.'' [1962] A.C. 220 (H.L.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ''Knuller (Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v. D.P.P.'' which was decided 1973 in the [[House of Lords]],&lt;ref&gt;[1972] 2 All E.R. 898 (H.L.) and [1973] [http://www.inquisition21.com/pca_1978/reference/1973AC435.html 435 A.C.]&lt;/ref&gt; the appellants were directors of a company which published a fortnightly magazine. On an inside page under a column headed "Males" advertisements were inserted inviting readers to meet the advertisers for the purpose of homosexual practices. The appellants were convicted on counts of 
#conspiracy to corrupt public morals, and
#conspiracy to outrage public decency.
The appeal on count 1 was dismissed, while the appeal on count 2 was allowed because in the present case there had been a misdirection in relation to the meaning of "decency" and the offence of "outrage".  The list of cases consulted in the ''ratio decidendi'' is lengthy, and the case of ''Shaw v. D.P.P.''&lt;ref name=shaw/&gt; is a topic of furious discussion.

====Conspiracy to effect a public mischief====
In ''Withers v Director of Public Prosecutions'',&lt;ref&gt;''Withers v DPP'' [1974] 3 WLR 751, HL&lt;/ref&gt; which reached the  House of Lords in 1974, it was unanimously held that '''conspiracy to effect a public mischief''' was not a separate and distinct class of criminal conspiracy. This overruled earlier decisions to the contrary effect.  The Law Commission published a consultation paper on this subject in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Codification of the Criminal Law: Conspiracies to effect a public mischief and to commit a civil wrong. Working Paper No 63. 1975. para. 4 to 30&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conspiracy to murder====
The offence of [[conspiracy to murder]] was created in statutory law by section 4 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]].

==Northern Ireland==

===Common law offence===
See [[conspiracy to defraud#Northern Ireland]].

===Statutory offence===
See [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1983/1120/part/IV Part IV] of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (S.I. 1983/1120 (N.I. 13)).

==United States==
Conspiracy has been defined in the United States as an agreement of two or more people to commit a crime, or to accomplish a legal end through illegal actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/conspiracy/ Conspiracy Law &amp; Legal Definition], USLegal, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectlaw.com/def/c103.htm "Conspiracy" Defined &amp; Explained], The 'Lectric Law Library&lt;/ref&gt; A conspiracy does not need to have been planned in secret to meet the definition of the crime.

Conspiracy law usually does not require proof of specific intent by the defendants to injure any specific person to establish an illegal agreement. Instead, usually the law requires only that the conspirators have agreed to engage in a certain illegal act.

Under most U.S. laws, for a person to be convicted of conspiracy, not only must he or she agree to commit a crime, but at least one of the conspirators must commit an overt act (the ''[[actus reus]]'') in furtherance of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.georgiacriminaldefense.com/georgia-conspiracy-lawyer/|title=Georgia Conspiracy Lawyer {{!}} Conspiracy Defense {{!}} Overt Act|newspaper=Kohn &amp; Yager|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''[[United States v. Shabani]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that this "overt act" element is not required under the federal drug conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C. section 846.

The conspirators can be guilty even if they do not know the identity of the other members of the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Monroe'', 73 F.3d 129 (7th Cir. 1995), ''aff'd.'', 124 F.3d 206 (7th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California criminal law]] is somewhat representative of other jurisdictions. A punishable conspiracy exists when at least two people form an agreement to commit a crime, and at least one of them does some act in furtherance to committing the crime. Each person is punishable in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided for the punishment of the crime itself. [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/182-185.html]

One example of this is [[The Han Twins Murder Conspiracy]] case, where one twin sister attempted to hire two youths to have her twin sister killed.

One important feature of a conspiracy charge is that it relieves prosecutors of the need to prove the particular ''roles'' of conspirators. If two persons plot to kill another (and this can be proven), and the victim is indeed killed as a result of the actions of either conspirator, it is not necessary to prove with specificity which of the conspirators actually pulled the trigger. (Otherwise, both conspirators could conceivably handle the gun, leaving two sets of fingerprints and then demand acquittals for both, based on the fact that the prosecutor would be unable to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, which of the two conspirators was the triggerman). A conspiracy conviction requires proof that (a) the conspirators did indeed conspire to commit the crime, and (b) the crime was committed by ''an'' individual involved in the conspiracy.  Proof of ''which'' individual it was is usually not necessary.

It is also an option for prosecutors, when bringing conspiracy charges, to decline to indict all members of the conspiracy (though the existence of all members may be mentioned in an [[indictment]]). Such ''unindicted co-conspirators'' are commonly found when the identities or whereabouts of members of a conspiracy are unknown, or when the prosecution is concerned only with a particular individual among the conspirators. This is common when the target of the indictment is an elected official or an [[organized crime]] leader, and the co-conspirators are persons of little or no public importance. More famously, President [[Richard Nixon]] was named as an unindicted co-conspirator by the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] special prosecutor, in an event leading up to his eventual resignation.

===Conspiracy against the United States===
{{main|Conspiracy against the United States}}

'''Conspiracy against the United States''', or '''conspiracy to defraud the United States''',&lt;ref name="USAM"&gt;§ 923, [https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-923-18-usc-371-conspiracy-defraud-us 18 U.S.C. § 371—Conspiracy to Defraud the United States], [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s ''[[United States Attorneys' Manual]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[federal offense]] in the [[United States of America]] under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|371}}. The crime is that of two or more persons who conspire to commit an offense against the United States, or to [[Fraud|defraud]] the United States.

===Conspiracy against rights===
{{see also|Conspiracy against rights}}
The United States has a federal statute dealing with conspiracies to deprive a citizen of rights secured by the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.fbi.gov/statutes/title_18/section241.htm Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 - Conspiracy Against Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224144931/http://miami.fbi.gov/statutes/title_18/section241.htm |date=24 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
{{see also|Anti-Conspiracy Bill}}
The [[United Nations special rapporteur]] Joseph Cannataci wrote a letter to the Japanese Prime-Minister, [[Shinzō Abe]], expressing concerns about [[Anti-Conspiracy Bill]].
[[Hajime Yoshikawa]] is opposed to the Anti-Conspiracy Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.japan-press.co.jp/modules/news/index.php?id=10595 |title=4,200 citizens rally to scrap anti-conspiracy bill |accessdate=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposition party recently accused the prime minister of influencing a government decision to fund and approve a veterinary school at a university owned by Mr Abe's friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40283730 |title=Japan passes controversial anti-terror conspiracy law |accessdate=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edward Snowden]] said "This is the beginning of a new wave of mass surveillance in Japan, not well explained focuses on terrorism and everything else that's not related to terrorism -- things like taking plants from the forestry reserve, And the only real understandable answer (to the government's desire to pass the bill)...is that this is a bill that authorizes the use of surveillance in new ways because now everyone can be a criminal. "
And Snowden said it should include strong guarantees of human rights and privacy and ensure that those guarantees are "not enforced through the words of politicians but through the actions of courts."
"This means in advance of surveillance, in all cases the government should seek an individualized warrant, and individualized authorization that this surveillance is lawful and appropriate in relationship to the threat that's presented by the police," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date = 2 June 2017| title = Whistleblower Snowden warns of looming mass surveillance in Japan| url          = https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2017/06/5db36d30fb00-exclusive-whistleblower-snowden-warns-of-looming-mass-surveillance-in-japan.html| work = Kyodo News| access-date  = 20 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
{{see also|criminal responsibility in French law}}
Conspiracy law was used at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] for members of the Nazi leadership charged with participating in a "conspiracy or common plan" to commit international crimes. This was controversial because conspiracy was not a part of the European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] tradition. Nonetheless, the crime of conspiracy continued in international criminal justice, and was incorporated into the international criminal laws against genocide.

Of the [[UN Security Council|Big Five]], only the [[French Republic]] exclusively subscribed to the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]; the [[USSR]] subscribed to the [[socialist law]], the [[United States of America|U.S.]] and the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] followed the [[common law]]; and the [[Republic of China]] did not have a [[cause of action]] at this particular proceeding. (In addition, both the [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] and the [[customary law]]) were upheld. The jurisdiction of the [[International Military Tribunal]] was unique and extraordinary at its time, being a court convened under the [[law of nations]] and the [[laws and customs of war]]. It was the first of its sort in human history, and found several defendants [[Acquittal|not guilty]].

'''DashCon''' was a [[fan convention]] catering primarily to users of the [[blogging]] service [[Tumblr]], with a particular emphasis on [[fandom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Fandom Falls Apart: DashCon Edition|url=http://observationdeck.io9.com/when-fandom-falls-apart-dashcon-edition-1604303148|publisher=io9|date=13 July 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bachman|first1=Lynne|title=DashCon convention doomed from the start|url=http://baltimorepostexaminer.com/dashcon-convention-doomed-start/2014/07/24|publisher=Baltimore Post-Examiner|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keilman|first1=John|title=Bloggers mock stumbles at Tumblr convention|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-bloggers-mock-stumbles-at-tumblr-convention-20140717-story.html|publisher=Chicago Tribune|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006123001/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-bloggers-mock-stumbles-at-tumblr-convention-20140717-story.html|archivedate=6 October 2014|date=17 July 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held over the weekend of July 11, 2014, in [[Schaumburg, Illinois]], the inaugural convention quickly became infamous for allegations of mismanagement among organizers, an alleged abrupt demand by the hotel for an upfront payment of cash for use of its facilities, and "celebrity" guests being forced to drop out of the convention after they were informed by the hotel that they would be responsible for paying for their rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearl|first1=Mike|title=YOU KNOW THAT TUMBLR CONVENTION THAT WENT TO SHIT?

Organizers for DashCon initially stated that they were going to hold a second DashCon in 2015 despite the issues faced by the inaugural edition, but officially announced via a Tumblr post in September 2014 that DashCon LLP was going to be dissolved and all its assets liquidated, meaning that they were not going to hold a second convention. The post also denied claims that a similarly themed convention, Emoti-Con, was a re-branded DashCon.

== Concept ==
DashCon was originally announced in mid-2013 under the name '''Tumbl-Con USA'''; a convention catered to users of the blogging platform [[Tumblr]], and was touted as the "largest gathering of Tumblr users to date".&lt;ref name=dailyherald-implodes/&gt; The convention was to focus on works that have developed significant [[fandom|followings]] among Tumblr users, such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and the podcast ''[[Welcome to Night Vale]]''. The convention raised money through ticket pre-orders, along with a [[crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Indiegogo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Constant|first1=Paul|title=The World's First Tumblr Convention Was a Disaster|url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/07/14/the-worlds-first-tumblr-convention-was-a-disaster|publisher=The Stranger|date=14 July 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the start of the convention, the name of the event was changed to DashCon (alluding to the site's dashboard feed) to indicate that it was not officially associated with Tumblr.&lt;ref name="dailydot-dashcon"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/dash-con-controversy-tumblr/ | title=Over the course of a weekend, DashCon 2014 descended into chaos | work=[[The Daily Dot]] | date=July 13, 2014 | accessdate=July 15, 2014 | author=Baker-Whitelaw, Gavia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-disastercon"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5901679/disastercon-how-a-tumblr-fan-conventions-big-dream | title=DisasterCon: how a fan convention's big dream became a nightmare | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=[[The Verge]] | date=July 15, 2014 | accessdate=July 15, 2014 | author=Robertson, Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention==
[[File:Renaissance Schaumburg Hotel.jpg|right|thumb|Overhead view of the [[Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center Hotel]], where the convention was held]]

The convention was organized by DashCon LLP, a [[Hudson, Ohio]]-based [[limited liability partnership]] owned by Megan Eli and Roxanne Schwieterman.&lt;ref name=dailyherald-implodes/&gt; DashCon was held from July 11 to 13, 2014, at the [[Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center Hotel]]. Among the guests originally scheduled to attend were actor [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]], webcomic artist [[Noelle Stevenson]], and the cast of ''[[Welcome to Night Vale]]''.&lt;ref name=dailydot-dashcon/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-disastercon/&gt;

On the evening of July 11&amp;nbsp;– the first night of DashCon&amp;nbsp;– early reports began to surface from attendees that events occurring at the convention were poorly planned and attended, a vendor had left due to poor sales, and minors had been admitted into 18+ rated panels. The convention itself also began to experience unexpected financial difficulties: the staff of the Renaissance purportedly informed a DashCon staff member that they would need to pay $20,000 upfront for the use of the facilities, or shut the convention down. DashCon organizers had verbally negotiated to pay the venue gradually throughout the convention using ticket sales, rather than issuing an upfront payment despite their contract suggesting otherwise.&lt;ref name=dailydot-dashcon/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-disastercon/&gt;

At 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CT]], as a result of this unexpected development, organizers began to publicly solicit donations among a crowd of around 1,000 attendees (itself much lower than the original estimate of 3,000 to 7,000 attendees),&lt;ref name=dailyherald-implodes/&gt; and online via [[PayPal]], to cover costs, with a goal of collecting at least $17,000 by 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to prevent the convention from being shut down. Organizers speculated that the abrupt change in plans was because the hotel's management "[did not] like the people at the con".&lt;ref name=dailydot-dashcon/&gt; Attendees were seen performing a three-fingered salute from ''[[The Hunger Games (film series)|The Hunger Games]]'' and chanting lines from ''[[High School Musical]]''.&lt;ref name=dailydot-dashcon/&gt; While organizers managed to raise the necessary funds, the incident raised suspicion among attendees over the possibility of the crowdfunding drive being a [[scam]] (which included disputes over the authenticity of an image of the bill, printed on hotel stationery, which was released by a staff member), or being further proof of the alleged mismanagement.&lt;ref name=dailydot-dashcon/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-disastercon/&gt;&lt;ref name="escapist-dashcon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/136108-Tumblr-Convention-Disaster-Unfolds-at-Illinois-DashCon | title=Tumblr Convention 'Disaster' Unfolds at Illinois' DashCon | publisher=[[Defy Media]] | date=July 13, 2014 | work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] | accessdate=July 15, 2014 | author=Chipman, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several guests&amp;nbsp;– including Noelle Stevenson (who had to moderate her own panel because the scheduled moderator was absent), the [[Baker Street Babes]] (who produced an all-female [[Sherlock Holmes]] podcast),&lt;ref name=dailyherald-implodes/&gt; and the ''Welcome to Night Vale'' cast&amp;nbsp;– were also informed by the hotel that they would be responsible for paying for their own rooms, despite previously being told that the rooms would be paid for by the convention itself.&lt;ref name=dailyherald-implodes/&gt; Stevenson would ultimately join the ''WTNV'' cast for the night in accommodations obtained via [[Airbnb]]. The appearance by the ''Welcome to Night Vale'' cast was ultimately canceled; organizers reimbursed those who had purchased tickets for the panel with tickets to a [[raffle]] of various autographed collectibles, admission to a concert with the [[Chicago]]-based ''[[Doctor Who]]''-inspired rock band [[Time Crash (band)|Time Crash]],&lt;ref name="cst-timecrash"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/21347022-421/doctor-who-inspires-local-trock-band.html | title=''Doctor Who'' inspires local trock band | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=July 26, 2013 | accessdate=July 15, 2014 | author=Husain, Nausheen | publisher=[[Wrapports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an "extra hour with the [[ball pit]]".&lt;ref name="dailyherald-implodes"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140716/news/140718973/ | title=Social media convention implodes in Schaumburg | publisher=Paddock Publications | work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]] | date=July 16, 2014 | accessdate=July 17, 2014 | author=Peterson, Eric | location=Arlington Heights, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dailydot-dashcon/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-disastercon/&gt;&lt;ref name="dashcon-clarifications"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dashcon.tumblr.com/post/91582246126/clarifications-and-back-up-plans | title=Clarifications and backup plans | publisher=[[Tumblr]] | date=July 12, 2014 | work=DashCon | accessdate=July 15, 2014 | author="DashCon Staff"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and aftermath ==
The ball pit&amp;nbsp;– roughly the size of a [[kiddie pool]], in an otherwise empty concession hall&amp;nbsp;– and the notion of an "extra hour" in it, quickly became a [[Internet meme|meme]] among attendees and other Tumblr users, inspiring parodies.&lt;ref name=dailyherald-implodes/&gt; Users envisioned other large quantities of items that could have been purchased with the $17,000,&lt;ref name=dailyherald-implodes/&gt; and a video game developer created ''Dashcon Simulator 2014'', a comedic simulation of the convention's ball pit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Person|first1=Chris|title=Magnificent Failure Of A Convention Now Has Its Own Simulator|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/07/magnificent-failure-of-a-convention-now-has-its-own-simulator/|publisher=Kotaku|date=16 July 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convention guest Mark Oshiro explained that the ball pit was "not a point of interest, it wasn't something a single soul talked about, and it was just a quirky thing that existed", and that "in order to support the idea that DashCon was a full, 100 percent disaster, every single detail was used to paint the con and the people at it as horrific failures of humanity".&lt;ref name=dailydot-dashcon/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-disastercon/&gt;

In the aftermath of the convention, a staff member of the hotel stated that the facility did enjoy their presence, while DashCon's staff promised to provide a more thorough explanation of what had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desat|first1=Marla|title=Tumblr Convention "Disaster" DashCon Gives Official Statement|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/136219-Tumblr-Convention-Disaster-DashCon-Gives-Official-Statement|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=17 July 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baker Street Babes reported that the hotel payment issue was, according to organizers, a mistake. Stevenson, whose hotel payment had not yet been resolved, defended criticism of DashCon by other users, arguing that they were unfamiliar with what typically occurs at a convention in the first place.&lt;ref name=dailyherald-implodes/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailydot-dashcon/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-disastercon/&gt;

==Emoti-Con==
In September 2014, ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' published an article where they reported on concerns that DashCon had renamed/rebranded itself Emoti-Con.&lt;ref name=DD&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Aja|title=The folks behind the infamous DashCon are back with a 'new' venture|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/dashcon-emoti-con-internet-convention/|work=The Daily Dot|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer noted that the two conventions were nearly identical in their themes, that Emoti-Con was to be held in the same venue that the second DashCon was to be hosted at, the Emoti-Con website contained much of the same text as the DashCon website, and that it was being organized by one of the co-creators of DashCon.&lt;ref name=DD /&gt; DashCon later denied that the two cons were the same via a post on their official Tumblr account, where they stated that while Emoti-Con was being organized by two of the three owners of DashCon, the two events are otherwise unrelated to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DASHCON UPDATE!|url=http://dashcon.tumblr.com/post/96462928454/dashcon-update|publisher=DashCon Tumblr|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that Emoti-Con would be "functioning under a very different infrastructure than DashCon did, with a more experienced and well-rounded staff".&lt;ref name=DD /&gt; Emoti-Con was later canceled, with their official Tumblr account citing "personal, financial, and safety" issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due to a great many factors, Emoti-Con Indy is being canceled.|url=http://emoti-con.tumblr.com/post/104815919298/due-to-a-great-many-factors-emoti-con-indy-is|publisher=Emoti-Con Tumblr|date=9 December 2014|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5614">[[Image:Naturalblonde.jpg|thumb|alt=a woman with blond hair|200px|right|Blond hair is controlled by an [[allele]] recessive to most alleles responsible for darker hair,{{cn|date=September 2018}} but it is not a disappearing gene]]
The '''disappearing blonde gene''' was a [[hoax]] about how a scientific study had estimated that natural blonds would become extinct, repeated as fact in reputable media such as the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' between 2002 and 2006. Claims that blond hair would disappear have been made since 1865.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/blondes.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Blond Extinction |accessdate=2008-01-24 |format= |work=}} Cites ''Chamber's journal of popular literature, science and arts By William Chambers, Robert Chambers, 1865 (p. 408)'', as well as newspaper mentions from 1890, 1906, and 1961. 1906 reference relates to a newspaper report on a lecture by Major C. E. Woodruff called ''The Disappearance of Blond Types from the American Population'', mentioned in MacCurdy GG, Anthropology At The New York Meeting, Science, 26 April 1907: 653-665
&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reports erroneously claimed that the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) had published a report claiming that people with [[blond hair]] "will become extinct by 2202". Neither the WHO nor any reputable expert had issued such a report, and so those who commented on the alleged report were asked by the WHO to retract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article206027.ece A corrected version of "Cavegirls were first blondes to have fun"] by ''[[Sunday Times]]'', February 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In 2002 BBC News reported that unnamed German experts had concluded that the natural distribution of blond hair would cease within the span of 200 years owing to the genes associated with blond hair being [[recessive genes|recessive]]. The article reported the scientists had said that there is a reportedly low number of people carrying the recessive blond allele, especially in nations of mixed [[Biological inheritance|heritage]] (for example, the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, New Zealand and Australia). The dominant alleles ([[brown hair]], [[black hair]], [[eye color|brown eyes]]) "overthrow" the [[recessive genes]] or metaphorically, endanger them. Subsequently the study was attributed to the [[World Health Organization]]. In the BBC article Prof. Jonathan Rees of the University of Edinburgh cast doubt on the story—he was quoted as saying "The frequency of blondes may drop but they won't disappear."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2284783.stm "Blondes 'to die out in 200 years'"], from the BBC, September 27, 2002.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the World Health Organization had no knowledge of this study.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/10/02/1033538673583.html "Hair-raising story about blonds cut short"], from ''[[The Age]]'', October 3, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/statement05/en/ WHO clarification]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the hoax was mentioned by'' [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' when reporting on the publication of a hypothesis of the origins of blonde hair&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/corrected-cavegirls-were-first-blondes-to-have-fun-vwvzx5fj3bv Cavegirls were first blondes to have fun.] The online version was corrected later.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[La Repubblica]]'': "According to the WHO study, the last natural blond is likely to be born in Finland during 2202." It once again traveled quickly across the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bitsofnews.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3407 "Natural blondes are likely to be extinct within 200 years"] from ''Bit of News''&lt;/ref&gt;  The hoax has also been featured on the "Threat-Down" segment of the satirical television show ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on March 6, 2006, where [[Stephen Colbert]] suggested a selective breeding program to save blonds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.com/video-clips/tua61a/the-colbert-report-threatdown---non-blondes Threat Down] Colbert Report. 6 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific position ==
The [[extinction]] hoax is based on a misinterpretation of [[recessive genes|recessiveness in genetics]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In reality, gene frequency is stable unless there is [[Selection (biology)|selection]] for or against them,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayo|first=Oliver|date=2008|title=A Century of Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/century-of-hardyweinberg-equilibrium/7290655079251A83AF3D89D176DA3AFF|journal=Twin Research and Human Genetics|language=en|publication-date=|volume=11|issue=3|pages=249–256|doi=10.1375/twin.11.3.249|issn=1839-2628|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which does not appear to be the case for blonde hair.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In large populations, even extremely rare genes will persist at stable levels over long periods of time. It also does not matter whether a gene is dominant or recessive. Genes disappear if the population is very small ([[Genetic drift|drift]]) or if they confer a disadvantage ([[Natural selection|selection]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Disaster medicine''' is the area of medical specialization serving the dual areas of providing [[health care]] to [[disaster]] survivors and providing medically related [[disaster preparation]], [[disaster planning]], [[disaster response]] and [[disaster recovery]] leadership throughout the [[disaster life cycle]]. Disaster medicine specialists provide insight, guidance and expertise on the principles and practice of medicine both in the disaster impact area and healthcare evacuation receiving facilities to [[emergency management]] professionals, hospitals, healthcare facilities, communities and governments. The disaster medicine specialist is the liaison between and partner to the [[medical contingency planner]], the emergency management professional, the [[incident command system]], government and policy makers.

Disaster medicine is unique among the medical specialties in that unlike all other areas of specialization, the disaster medicine specialist does not practice the full scope of the specialty everyday but only in emergencies. Indeed, the disaster medicine specialist hopes to never practice the full scope of skills required for board certification. However, like specialists in [[public health]], [[environmental medicine]] and [[occupational medicine]], disaster medicine specialists engage in the development and modification of public and private policy, legislation, disaster planning and disaster recovery. Within the United States of America, the specialty of disaster medicine fulfils the requirements set for by [[Homeland Security Presidential Directive]]s (HSPD), the [[National Response Plan]] (NRP), the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS), the [[National Resource Typing System]] (NRTS) and the [[NIMS Implementation Plan for Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities]].

== Definitions ==
[[Disaster healthcare]] – The provision of healthcare services by healthcare professionals to disaster survivors and disaster responders both in a disaster impact area and healthcare evacuation receiving facilities throughout the disaster life cycle.&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nspd/index.html National Security Presidential Directives [NSPD&amp;#93; George W. Bush Administration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disaster behavioral health]] – Disaster behavioral health deals with the capability of disaster responders to perform optimally, and for disaster survivors to maintain or rapidly restore function, when faced with the threat or actual impact of disasters and extreme events.&lt;ref name="Shultz 2006"&gt;Shultz et al. 2006. Surge, Sort, Support: Disaster Behavioral Health for Healthcare Professionals. Orlando: Disaster Life Support Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disaster law]] – Disaster law deals with the legal ramifications of disaster planning, preparedness, response and recovery, including but not limited to financial recovery, public and private liability, property abatement and condemnation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ramirez, M. National Strategies for Medical Contingency Planning seminar, September, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disaster life cycle]] – The time line for disaster events beginning with the period between disasters (interphase), progressing through the disaster event and the disaster response and culminating in the disaster recovery. Interphase begins as the end of the last disaster recovery and ends at the onset of the next disaster event. The disaster event begins when the event occurs and ends when the immediate event subsides. The disaster response begins when the event occurs and ends when acute disaster response services are no longer needed. Disaster recovery also begins with the disaster response and continues until the affected area is returned to the pre-event condition.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Disaster planning]] – The act of devising a methodology for dealing with a disaster event, especially one with the potential to occur suddenly and cause great injury and/or loss of life, damage and hardship. Disaster planning occurs during the disaster interphase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Marghella, P. National Strategies for Medical Contingency Planning seminar, September, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disaster preparation]] – The act of practicing and implementing the plan for dealing with a disaster event before an event occurs, especially one with the potential to occur suddenly and cause great injury and/or loss of life, damage and hardship. Disaster preparation occurs during the disaster interphase.&lt;ref&gt;Marghella, P. National Strategies for Medical Contingency Planning Seminar, september, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disaster recovery]] – The restoration or return to the former or better state or condition proceeding a disaster event (i.e., status quo ante, the state of affairs that existed previously). Disaster recovery is the fourth phase of the disaster life cycle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Disaster response]] – The ability to answer the intense challenges posed by a disaster event. Disaster response is the third phase of the disaster life cycle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Marghella, P. National Strategies for Medical Contingency Planning Seminar, September, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The term “disaster medicine” first appeared in the medical lexicon in the post-World War II era. Although coined by former and current military physicians who had served in World War II, the term grow out of a concern for the need to care for military casualties, or nuclear holocaust victims{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}, but out of the need to provide care to the survivors of natural disasters and the not-yet-distant memory of the 1917-1918 Influenza Pandemic.

The term “disaster medicine” continued to appear sporadically in both the medical and popular press{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} until the 1980s, when the first concerted efforts to organize a medical response corps for disasters grew into the [[National Disaster Medical System]]. Simultaneous with this was the formation of a disaster and [[emergency medicine]] discussion and study group under the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) in the United States as well as groups in Great Britain, Israel and other countries. By the time [[Hurricane Andrew]] struck Florida in 1992, the concept of disaster medicine was entrenched in public and governmental consciousness. Although training and fellowships in disaster medicine or related topics began graduating specialists in the Europe and the United States as early as the 1980s, it was not until 2003 that the medical community embraced the need for the new specialty{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

Throughout this period, incomplete and faltering medical responses to disaster events made it increasingly apparent{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} in the United States of America that federal, state and local emergency management organizations were in need of a mechanism to identify qualified physicians in the face of a global upturn in the rate of disasters{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.  Many physicians who volunteer at disasters have a bare minimum of knowledge in disaster medicine and often pose a hazard to themselves and the response effort because they have little or no field response training. It was against this backdrop that the [[American Academy of Disaster Medicine]] (AADM) and the [[American Board of Disaster Medicine]] (ABODM) were formed in the United States of America for the purpose of scholarly exchange and education in Disaster Medicine as well as the development of an examination demonstrating excellence towards [[board certification]] in this new specialty.

==Ethics in Disaster Medicine==

The Disaster Medicine practitioner must be well-versed in the ethical dilemmas that commonly arise in disaster settings. One of the most common dilemmas occurs when the aggregate medical need exceeds the ability to provide a normal standard of care for all patients. 

''Triage''

In the event of a future pandemic, the number of patients that require additional respiratory support will outnumber the number of available ventilators&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Eyal, N. (2016) Chapter 11: Ethical Issues in Disaster Medicine. In Ciottone’s Disaster Medicine, Second Edition. Pages 27-34. Philadelphia: Elsevier Mosby. &lt;/ref&gt;. Although a hypothetical example, similar natural disasters have occurred in the past. Historically, the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 and the more recent SARS epidemic in 2003 led to resource scarcity and necessitated triage. One paper estimated that in the United States, the need for ventilators would be double the number available in the setting of an influenza pandemic similar to the scale of 1918&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett J, Borio L. The current status of planning for pandemic influenza and implications for the health care planning in the United States. Clin Infec Dis. 2008;46(6):919–925.&lt;/ref&gt;. In other countries with fewer resources, shortages are postulated to be even more severe.  

How, then, is a clinician to decide whom to offer this treatment? Examples of common approaches that guide triage include “saving the most lives”, calling for care to be provided to “the sickest first” or alternatively a “first come, first served” approach may attempt to sidestep the difficult decision of triage&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Emergency services often use their own triaging systems to be able to work through some of these challenging situations; however, these guidelines often assume no resource scarcity, and therefore, different triaging systems must be developed for resource-limited, disaster response settings. Useful ethical approaches to guide the development of such triaging protocols are often based on the principles of the theories of [[Utilitarian bioethics|utilitarianism]], [[egalitarianism]] and proceduralism&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

''Utilitarian Approach'' 

	The [[Utilitarian bioethics|Utilitarian]] theory works on the premise that the responder shall 'maximise collective welfare'; or in other words, 'do the greatest good for the greatest numbers of people&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'. The utilitarian will necessarily need a measure by which to assess the outcome of the intervention. This could be thought of through various ways, for instance: the number of lives saved, or the number of years of life saved through the intervention. Thus, the utilitarian would prioritize saving the youngest of the patients over the elderly or those who are more likely to die despite an intervention, in order to 'maximise the collective years of life saved'. Commonly used metrics to quantify utility of health interventions include [[DALYs]] (Disability Adjusted Life Years) and [[QALYs]] (Quality Adjusted Life Years) which take into account the potential number of years of life lost due to disability and the quality of the life that has been saved, respectively, in order to quantify the utility of the intervention.

''Egalitarian Approach'' 

Principles of [[egalitarianism]] suggest the distribution of scarce resources amongst all those in need irrespective of likely outcome&lt;ref&gt;Hanfling D, Altevogt BM, Viswanathan K, et al. Crisis Standards of Care: A Systems Framework for Catastrophic Disaster Response. Washington, DC: Institute of Medicine; 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. The egalitarian will place some emphasis on equality, and the way that this is achieved might differ. The guiding factor is need rather than the ultimate benefit or utility of the intervention. Approaches based on egalitarian principles are complex guides in disaster settings. In the words of Eyal (2016) “Depending on the exact variant of egalitarianism, the resulting limited priority may go to patients whose contemporaneous prognosis is dire (because their medical prospects are now poor), to patients who have lived with serious disabilities for years (because their lifetime health is worse), to young patients (because dying now would make them short-lived), to socioeconomically disadvantaged patients (because their welfare prospects and resources are lower), or to those who queued up first (because first-come first-served may be thought to express equal concern.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Procedural Approach''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 	
		
	The inherent difficulties in triage may lead practitioners to attempt to minimize active selection or prioritization of patients in face of scarcity of resources, and instead rely upon guidelines which do not take into account medical need or possibility of positive outcomes. In this approach, known as proceduralism, selection or prioritization may be based on patient’s inclusion in a particular group (for example, by citizenship, or membership within an organization such as health insurance group). This approach prioritizes simplification of the triage and transparency, although there are significant ethical drawbacks, especially when procedures favor those who are part of socioeconomically advantaged groups (such as those with health insurance). Procedural systems of triage emphasize certain patterns of decision making based on preferred procedures. This can take place in the form of a fair lottery for instance; or establishing transparent criteria for entry into hospitals - based on non discriminatory conditions. This is not outcome driven; it is a process driven activity aimed at providing consistent frameworks upon which to base decisions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

These are by no means the only systems upon which decisions are made, but provide a basic framework to evaluate the ethical reasoning behind what are often difficult choices during disaster response and management.

Elsewhere in the world, similar centers are created at universities in London, Paris, Brussels and Bordeaux.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G. Disaster Medicine: A History. American Journal of Clinical Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;

1992 – Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 hurricane, strikes south Florida, destroying the city of [[Homestead, Florida]] and initiating the largest disaster healthcare response to date{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

1993 – On February 26, 1993, at 12:17 pm, a terrorist attack on the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (the first such attack on United States soil since World War II) increases interest in specialized education and training on disaster response for civilian physicians{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

1998 – The [[American College of Contingency Planners]] (ACCP) is formed by the [[American Academy of Medical Administrators]] (AAMA) to provide certification and scholarly study in the area of medical contingency planning and healthcare disaster planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aameda.org/p/cm/ld/fid=10 |title=American College of Contingency Planners (ACCP) |publisher=American Academy of Medical Administrators |accessdate=3 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707142548/http://aameda.org/p/cm/ld/fid%3D10 |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2001 – The [[September 11, 2001 attack]]s on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon cause the largest loss of life resulting from an attack on American targets on United States soil since Pearl Harbor. As a result, the need for disaster medicine is galvanized{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}.

2001 – On October 29, 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] issues [[Homeland Security Presidential Directive]] 1 (HSPD-1), establishing the organization and operation of the [[Homeland Security Council]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

2002 – On March 11, 2002, President Bush issues HSPD-3, establishing the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

2003 – The American Medical Association, in conjunction with the [[Medical College of Georgia]] and the [[University of Texas]], debuts the [[National Disaster Life Support]] (NDLS) training program, providing the first national certification in disaster medicine skills and education. NDLS training would later be referred to as "the [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] of the 21st century."

2003 – In February 2003, the [[American Association of Physician Specialists]] (AAPS) appoints an expert panel to explore the question of whether disaster medicine qualifies as a medical specialty.

2003 – On February 28, 2003, President Bush issues HSPD-5 outlining the system for management of domestic incidents (man-made and natural disasters). HSPD-5 mandates the creation and adoption of the [[National Response Plan]] (NRP).&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

2003 – On September 30, 2003, the National Response Plan is published and adopted by all Federal agencies.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;
  
2003 – On December 17, 2003, President Bush issues HSPD-8, outlining the new framework for national preparedness and creating the National Incident Management System (NIMS).&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

2004 – In February, 2004 the AAPS reports to the [[American Board of Physician Specialties]] (ABPS) that the expert panel, supported by the available literature and recent HSPDs, has determined that there is a sufficient body of unique knowledge in disaster medicine to designate the field as a discrete specialty. ABPS empanels a board of certification to determine if [[board certification]] is appropriate in this new specialty.
  
2004 – On April 28, 2004, President Bush issues HSPD-10, also known as the plan for [[Biodefense for the 21st Century]] which calls for healthcare to implement surveillance and response capabilities to combat the threat of terrorism.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

2004 – Hurricanes Charlie, Francis, Ivan and Jeanne batter the state of Florida, resulting in the largest disaster medical response since Hurricane Andrew.

2005 – [[Hurricane Katrina]] batters the Gulf Coast of the United States, destroying multiple coastal cities. For the first time in NDMS history, the entire NDMS system is deployed for a single disaster medical response. Among the many lessons learned in field operations following Hurricane Katrina are the need for cellular autonomy under a central incident command structure and the creation of [[continuous integrated triage]] for the management of massive patient surge. The lessons learned in the Hurricane Katrina response would be applied less than a month later following Hurricane Rita and again following Hurricane Wilma and the Indonesian tsunami.

2005 – In late October 2005, the [[American Board of Disaster Medicine]] (ABODM) and the [[American Academy of Disaster Medicine]] (AADM) are formed for scholarly study, discussion, and exchange in the field of disaster medicine, as well as to oversee board certification in disaster medicine.

2006 – In June 2006, the Institute of Medicine publishes three reports on the state of emergency [[Health care in the United States]]. Among the condemnations of emergency care is the lack of substantial improvement in disaster preparedness, or "cross-silo" coordination.

2006 – On September 17, 2006, the [[NIMS Integration Center]] publishes the [[NIMS Implementation Plan for Hospitals and Healthcare]], establishing a September 30, 2007 deadline for all hospitals and healthcare facilities to be "NIMS-compliant."

2007 – On January 31, 2007, President Bush issues HSPD-18, calling for the development and deployment of medical countermeasures against weapons of mass destruction.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

2007 – On September 30, 2007, the NIMS Implementation Plan for Hospitals and Healthcare Facilities compliance deadline passes with fewer than nine percent of all United States hospitals fully compliant and fewer than half of hospitals and healthcare facilities having made substantial progress towards compliance.

2007 – On October 18, 2007, President Bush issues HSPD-21, outlining an augmented plan for public health and disaster medical preparedness. HSPD-21 specifically calls for the creation of the discipline of "disaster healthcare" using the accepted definition of "disaster medicine." HSPD-21 also calls on the Secretary of [[Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to use "economic incentives" including the [[Center for Medicare Services]] (CMS) to induce private medical organizations, hospitals and healthcare facilities to implement disaster healthcare programs and medical disaster preparedness programs.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

==  Board certification ==

Physicians who hold board certification in disaster medicine have demonstrated by written and simulator-based examination that through training and field experience, they have mastered the spectrum of knowledge and skills which defines the specialty of disaster medicine. As with all medical specialties, this body of knowledge and skills is contained in the [[core competencies]] document created and maintained by the American Board of Disaster Medicine and the American Academy of Disaster Medicine. As with all core competencies documents, the specific knowledge and skills required for certification are subject to constant refinement and evolution. This statement cannot be more true than for a specialty like disaster medicine where the nature of the threats faced, the responses undertaken, and the lessons learned become more complex with each event.

The '''Edinburgh Festival Theatre''' (originally '''Empire Palace Theatre''' and later shortened to '''Empire Theatre''') is a performing arts venue located on Nicolson Street in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] used primarily for performances of [[opera]] and [[ballet]], large-scale musical events, and touring groups.  After its most recent renovation in 1994, it seats 1,915. It is one of the major venues of the annual summer [[Edinburgh International Festival]] and is the Edinburgh venue for the [[Scottish Opera]] and the [[Scottish Ballet]].
==Theatre background and history==
The present theatre’s location is Edinburgh’s longest continuous theatre site, for there has been a theatre in that location since 1830.  From being Dunedin Hall, the Royal Amphitheatre, Alhambra Music Hall, the Queen’s Theatre, [[Pablo Fanque]]'s Amphitheatre, and Newsome’s Circus, the site became the '''Empire Palace Theatre''', the first of the famous [[Moss Empires]]’ chain, opening on 7 November 1892.  Designed by the great British theatre architect, [[Frank Matcham]], (who built the [[London Coliseum]], among others) its décor was lavish, with elephants with Nubian riders, nymphs and cherubs in abundance on the plasterwork, and it seated 3000 people on four levels.
===1911 fire===
For the following twenty years all the top artists of the day played at the Empire Palace until, on 9 May 1911, there was a disastrous fire on stage. While all 3000 theatre goers escaped safely in about 2.5 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fire.org.uk/history-of-fire-safety.html|title=History of Fire Safety|website=fire.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were eleven backstage deaths and the death of a lion). Film of the aftermath of the fire is held by the National Library of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movingimage.nls.uk/film/1607 Theatre Fire in Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre reopened three months after the fire. 

===Popular performers===
Nevertheless, given the long term competition from the growth of film as a popular medium, the theatre had to be re-equipped to present bigger and more spectacular shows.  Reusing some of Matcham’s original design concepts, the theatre reopened on 1 October 1928 with the first production, the musical ''[[Show Boat]]''. Between 1928 and 1963 the Empire was a variety, musical and opera house, often including ice shows.  

Big names like [[Harry Lauder]], [[Charles Laughton]], [[Fats Waller]], [[Joe Loss]], and [[Laurel and Hardy]] appeared, while English comedians [[Max Wall]], [[Morecambe and Wise]] and [[Harry Worth]] established themselves at the Empire.

In addition to the music hall and popular entertainers who appeared at the Empire, the theatre became a principal venue of the Edinburgh International Festival between 1947 and 1963.  It was particularly associated with international ballet and, during the first Festival in 1947,  [[Margot Fonteyn]] danced in ''The Sleeping Beauty'', while in subsequent years, performances by the [[Old Vic]] theatre company, the [[Royal Ballet]] and the [[Royal Opera, London|Royal Opera]] were presented.

However, for nearly thirty years after 1963 the theatre became a bingo hall, only temporarily serving as a Festival venue.  In the early 1970s the venue shortened its name to simply the '''Empire Theatre''' and hosted live music events. Bands did not appear until after 11pm - once the bingo players had gone. [[Free (band)|Free]] (September 14, 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghgigarchive.com/page9.htm |title=Empire/Festival Theatre |publisher=The Edinburgh Gig Archive |date= |accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Wishbone Ash]] (December 9, 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wishboneash.co.uk/arctourdates1972 |title=Classic Wishbone Ash History |publisher=Wishboneash.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Focus (band)|Focus]] (May 11, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alquin |url=http://www.focustheband.com/gighistory.htm |title=Focus The Band Of Thijs Van Leer |publisher=Focustheband.com |date= |accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the acts appearing. Finally, after its third major remodeling, the Empire Theatre reopened in June 1994 with a glass-fronted structure for the new entrance (created by Law &amp; Dunbar-Nasmith Architects), as the now-renamed ''Edinburgh Festival Theatre''. In 1997, the theatre manager and artistic director [[Stephen Barry]] was appointed to shape the rejuvenated venue's future.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Paul [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/09/guardianobituaries1 Stephen Barry (obituary)] ''The Guardian'' London, 9 November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; With the restoration of the Empire Theatre’s former 1928 glory, plus a dramatic mix of art nouveau, beaux arts and neo-classicism, and including adequate acoustics, the new theatre serves the artistic needs of the community.

In the twenty-first century, the theatre has played host to a wide number of touring productions of [[West End theatre|West End]] shows, including [[Les Misérables (musical)|''Les Misérables'']]&lt;ref name="LesMis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/100358-les-miserables-announces-new-uk-tour-dates-and-casting-news-get-tickets/|title=Les Misérables announces new UK tour dates and casting news, get tickets|author=Angus, Craig|date=20 April 2018|publisher=The List UK|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[War Horse (play)|''War Horse'']].&lt;ref name="WH"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2018/04/review-war-horse-festival-theatre/|title=Review – War Horse, Festival Theatre|author=Kennedy, John|publisher=The Edinburgh Reporter|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
The theatre is said to be haunted by a tall, dark stranger rumoured to be the famous illusionist [[Sigmund Neuberger]], a.k.a. The Great Lafayette, who was one of those who burned to death in the fire at the Empire in 1911.

'''Environmental terrorism''' consists of one or more unlawful actions that harm or destroy [[Natural environment|environmental resources]] or deprive others of their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alpas |first=Hami |title=Environmental Security and Ecoterrorism |year=2011 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9789400712379 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; More colloquially, the phrase is also used to label actions seen as the unnecessary or unjustified destruction of the environment for personal or corporate gain.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

== Definition ==
There are academic and semantic difficulties in defining "terrorism" and specifically "environmental terrorism", but discussions of environmental [[terrorism]] are growing with a focus on identifying possible risks to [[natural resources]] or environmental features. Some,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

argue that attacks on natural resources can now cause more deaths, property damage, political chaos, and other adverse effects than in previous years.

Chalecki distinguishes between environmental terrorism and [[eco-terrorism]]. She notes that environmental terrorism can be defined "as the unlawful use of force against in situ environmental resources so as to deprive populations of their benefit(s) and/or destroy other property". In contrast, eco-terrorism is the destruction of property in the interest of saving the environment from human encroachment and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Chronicle, July 1, 2001, page A10&lt;/ref&gt; More concisely, environmental terrorism involves targeting natural resources. Eco-terrorism involves targeting the built environment such as roads, buildings and trucks, in defense of natural resources. Other analysts may fail to distinguish between these different threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Environmental terrorism - definition | work =  | date =  | url = http://law.jrank.org/pages/11976/Terrorism-Environmental-terrorism.html | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Byzantine-Ottoman Wars}}

The '''Fall of Philadelphia''' marked the fall of [[Alaşehir|Philadelphia]], the last independent Christian Greek settlement in western Asia Minor to the Muslim Turks of the [[Ottoman Sultanate]]. Ironically, the besieging army included a contingent from the [[Byzantine Empire]], which was a [[vassal]] of the Ottomans.

Prior to its fall, the city had evaded the fate of her neighbours by paying tribute to the numerous fanatical ghazis, whose bands robbed and pillaged any who did not pay protection money (''[[Jizya]]''), although the city was not officially under Islamic law. In theory, the city was under the Byzantine Empire, but cut off by a sea of hostile land ensured that in reality the city remained independent.

In 1378 [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] promised to hand over the city of Philadelphia to the Turks in return for the Ottoman Sultan's aid in a disastrous Byzantine civil war. However, Manuel seems to have retracted his promise, since it was not until 1390 that Bayezid summoned the two leaders of the civil war, John VII and Manuel II and ordered them to accompany the besieging force. The city was taken by the Turks that year.

'''''Farragut North''''' is a 2008 play written by [[Beau Willimon]], loosely based on former Governor [[Howard Dean]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic primary]] election campaign for U.S. President. The original script won the 2005 Dayton Playhouse FutureFest (a festival of new plays), where it was first produced, to rave reviews by critics and a warm response from audiences. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}  The script has been published by [[Dramatists Play Service]].

The play is billed as "a classic tale of hubris set against a contemporary landscape – about the lust for power and the costs one will endure to achieve it". It is titled after [[Farragut North (Washington Metro)|Farragut North]], a [[Washington Metro]] station in the [[District of Columbia]], on the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]]. Farragut North serves downtown Washington, D.C. and is located just north of [[Farragut Square]], near [[Connecticut Avenue]]. Willimon, who worked for Sen. [[Charles E. Schumer]] (D-NY) and former [[Governor of Vermont]] and 2004 Democratic presidential [[primary election]] candidate Howard Dean, titled the play for the Metrorail station located nearest to D.C.'s geographic center for think tanks, lobbyists, and other advocacy groups.

It was slated to open on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008, in the lead-up to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The production premiered at the Linda Gross Theater of the Atlantic Theater Company in New York City. The production was directed by [[Doug Hughes]] and starred [[John Gallagher, Jr.]], [[Chris Noth]], [[Olivia Thirlby]], Kate Blumberg and [[Isiah Whitlock, Jr.]] The production ran from October 22, 2008 to November 29, 2008 with official opening on November 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brantley|first=Ben|title=Those Who Traffic in Spin Can Get Caught in the Cycle|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/theater/reviews/13farr.html|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 24, 2009, the production transferred to Los Angeles' [[Geffen Playhouse]] with Noth, Thirlby and Whitlock Jr. reprising their roles.  [[Chris Pine]] joined the cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=24 June 2009 Press Release|title=West Coast Premiere Of Beau Willimon’s New Play  Farragut North Opens At The Geffen Playhouse|url=http://geffenplayhouse.com/_px/_release/media105.pdf|publisher=Geffen Playhouse|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently it received a production at the [[Contemporary American Theater Festival]] at Shepherd University in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Contemporary American Theater Festival |title=History &amp; Archives |url=http://www.catf.org/about-catf/history-a-archives |accessdate=27 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112103615/http://catf.org/about-catf/history-a-archives |archivedate=12 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==London, United Kingdom Production==
The play received its London premiere at the [[Southwark Playhouse]], opening on September 11, 2013. Produced by Peter Huntley, in association with Daniel Krupnik and Southwark Playhouse, and directed by [[Guy Unsworth]], the production stars [[Max Irons]] in the role of Stephen and [[Rachel Tucker]] as Ida, and featured [[Shaun Williamson]], Aysha Kala, Josh O’Connor, Alain Terzoli and [[Andrew Whipp]]. 

The production featured design by David Woodhead, lighting by Richard Howell, music by Jude Obermüller and sound design by Peter Malkin.

==Film adaptation==
The play has since been turned into an Oscar-nominated screenplay. The film, ''[[The Ides of March (2011 film)|The Ides of March]]'', starred and directed by [[George Clooney]] and also starred [[Ryan Gosling]], was released by [[Sony Pictures]] in October 2011.&lt;ref name="IMDB09032011"&gt;{{cite web

'''Fictitious''' or '''fake entries''' are deliberately incorrect entries in [[reference work]]s such as [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[encyclopedia]]s, maps, and directories. There are more specific terms for particular kinds of fictitious entry, such as Mountweazel, [[trap street]], paper street, paper town, [[phantom settlement]], and [[:wikt:nihilartikel|nihilartikel]].&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-nih1.htm |title=Nihilartikel |publisher=World Wide Words |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictitious entries are included either as a humorous hoax or as a '''copyright trap''' to reveal subsequent [[plagiarism]] or [[copyright infringement]]. 

==Terminology==
The [[neologism]] ''Mountweazel'' was coined by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' based on a fictitious biographical entry in the 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name=mountweazel&gt;Henry Alford, [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829ta_talk_alford "Not a Word"], ''The New Yorker'' August 29, 2005 (accessed August 29, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''nihilartikel'', combining the Latin ''nihil'' ("nothing") and German ''Artikel'' ("article"), is sometimes used.&lt;ref name="worldwidewords1"/&gt;

== Copyright traps ==
By including a trivial piece of false information in a larger work, it is easier to demonstrate subsequent [[plagiarism]] if the fictitious entry is copied along with other material. An admission of this motive appears in the preface to [[Chambers Harrap|Chambers']] 1964 [[mathematical tables]]: "those [errors] that are known to exist form an uncomfortable trap for any would-be plagiarist".&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Comrie, ''Chambers's Shorter Six-Figure Mathematical Tables'', Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1964, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[trap street]]s may be included in a [[map]], or invented phone numbers in a [[telephone directory]].

Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright (see [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred Worth lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] or ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'', 796 F.Supp. 729, [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York|E.D.N.Y.]], 1992.)&lt;ref&gt;Fred Greguras, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050301065154/http://oikoumene.com/databprotect.html U.S. Legal Protection for Databases], Presentation at the Technology Licensing Forum September 25, 1996. Archived March 1, 2005 on the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Official sources ===
Most listings of the members of the [[German parliament]] feature the fictitious politician [[Jakob Maria Mierscheid]], allegedly a member of the parliament since 1979. Among other activities he is reported to have contributed to a major symposium on the equally fictitious [[stone louse]] in Frankfurt.

=== Reference works ===
Fictitious entries in reference publications often occur in an attempt to catch plagiarism, such as: 

* In August 2005, ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary|The New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' gained media coverage&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; when it was leaked that the second edition contained at least one fictional entry. This later was determined to be the word ''[[esquivalience]]'', defined as "the wilful avoidance of one's official responsibilities," which had been added to the edition published in 2001. It was intended as a copyright trap, as the text of the book was distributed electronically and thus very easy to copy.
* [[Joel Whitburn]]'s pop chart research books say that [[Ralph Marterie]]'s version of "The Song of Love" peaked at No. 84 for the week ending December 26, 1955. However, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' did not put out an issue that week, and Marterie never recorded this song. A similar situation occurs in his compilation of ''Billboard''{{'}}s rock charts, where Whitburn includes the fictitious song "Drag You Down" by the equally non-existent group "The Cysterz".

=== Maps ===
Fictitious entries on maps may be called [[phantom settlement]]s, [[trap streets]],&lt;ref&gt;SA Mathieson, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/may/11/copyright.epublic "A sidestep in the right direction"], ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; paper towns, cartographer's follies, or other names. They are intended to help unmask copyright infringements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/the-fake-places-that-only-exist-to-catch-copycat-cartog-1695414770 Gizmodo: "Fake places that exist to catch copycats"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1978, the fictional [[Ohio]] towns of [[Beatosu and Goblu]] were inserted into that year's official state of [[Michigan]] map as nods to the [[University of Michigan]] and its traditional rival, [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="Monmonier"&gt;{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-226-53421-9 |pages= 50–51 |edition=2nd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictional town of [[Agloe, New York]], was invented by map makers, but eventually became identified as a real place by its county administration because a building, the Agloe General Store, was erected at its fictional location. The "town" is featured in the novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' by [[John Green (author)|John Green]] and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]].
* Mount Richard, a fictitious peak on the [[continental divide]] in the United States, appeared on county maps in the early 1970s. It was believed to be the work of a draftsman, Richard Ciacci. The fiction was undiscovered for two years.&lt;ref name="Monmonier" /&gt;
* In the United Kingdom in 2001, the [[Ordnance Survey]] (OS) obtained a  £20m out-of-court settlement from [[The Automobile Association|Automobile Association]] (the AA) after content from OS maps was reproduced on AA maps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130521130707/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2001/march/centrica.html "Centrica and Ordnance Survey settle AA copyright case"], March 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ordnance Survey denied that it included "deliberate mistakes" in its maps as copyright traps, claiming the "fingerprints" which identified a copy were stylistic features such as the width of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Clark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark |title=Copying maps costs AA £20m |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 6, 2001 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictitious English town of [[Argleton]] was investigated by [[Steve Punt]] in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme ''Punt P.I''. The programme concluded that the town's entry may well have originated as a copyright trap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00trzfl ''Punt PI''], BBC Radio 4, September 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trivia books, etc. ===

*''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'' placed deliberately false information about the first name of TV detective [[Columbo]] for copy-trap purposes and then sued [[Trivial Pursuit]] (which based some of their questions and answers on the work), without success.

=== Other copyright infringement ===
Other examples of copyright infringement that do not fall under the above categories include: 

* In the summer of 2008, the state-owned Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute ({{lang-sk|Slovenský hydrometeorologický ústav, short: SHMÚ}}) became suspicious that a competing commercial service, the website meteo.sk, was stealing their data. On August 7, 2008, SHMÚ deliberately altered the temperature for [[Chopok]] from 9.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 1&amp;nbsp;°C. In a short time, the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;°C appeared for Chopok at meteo.sk as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.sk/c/4018705/shmu-podozrieva-meteo-ze-opisuje.html SHMÚ suspicious that meteo.sk is stealing their data] News portal SME.sk (in Slovak)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]] in the Netherlands once deliberately included a false story about a fire in their radio newscast to see if [[Radio Veronica]] takes its news from the ANP. Several hours later, Radio Veronica also aired the story.
* [[Google]], alleging its search results for a misspelling of [[tarsorrhaphy]] started appearing in [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] results partway through the summer of 2010, created fabricated search results where a hundred query terms like "[[hiybbprqag]]", "delhipublicschool40 chdjob" and "juegosdeben1ogrande" each returned a link to a single unrelated webpage. Nine of the hundred fraudulent results planted by Google were later observed as the first result for the bogus term on Bing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogue|first1=Glenn|title=On Google's Bing Sting|url=https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/on-googles-bing-sting/?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/google-accuses-microsoft-of-stealing-its-search-results-20110202-1acsl.html |title=Bing Copying Google?

== Scrutiny Checks ==
{{see also |List of scholarly publishing stings}}
Some publications such as those published by [[Harvard]] [[biologist]] [[John Bohannon]] are used to detect lack of [[replication crisis|academic scrutiny]], [[peer review | editorial oversight]], [[fraud]] and/or [[p hacking]] on the part of authors or their publishers.  Trap publications may be used by publishers to immediately reject articles citing them, or by academics to detect journals of ill repute (those that would publish them or works citing them).

== Humorous hoaxes ==

=== Reference publications ===
Fictitious entries often occur in reference publications as a prank, or [[practical joke]], in an attempt to be humorous, such as: 

* The [[German language|German-language]] ''[[Der neue Pauly]]. Enzyklopaedie der Antike'', edited by H. Cancik and H. Schneider, vol. 1 (Stuttgart, 1996, {{ISBN|3-476-01470-3}}) includes a fictitious entry now well known amongst classicists: a deadpan description of an entirely fictional [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sport, ''[[apopudobalia]]'', which resembles modern [[football (soccer)|association football]].
* ''[[Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography]]'' (1887–1889) contains about two hundred fictitious entries.
* ''[[Zzxjoanw]]'' was the last entry in Rupert Hughes’ ''Music Lovers’ Encyclopedia'' of 1903, and it continued as an entry in subsequent editions down to the 1950s. It was described as a [[Māori language|Māori]] word for a drum. Later, it was proved to be a [[hoax]] (having seemed suspect because Māori does not use the letters J, X or Z).
* The 1975 ''[[New Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' contains a fictitious entry on ''Lillian Virginia Mountweazel'' (1942–1973).&lt;ref name="mountweazel" /&gt; Her biography claims she was a fountain designer and [[photographer]], best known for ''Flags Up!'', a collection of photographs of rural American [[Letter box|mailboxes]]. Supposedly she was born in [[Bangs, Ohio]], and died in an explosion while on assignment for ''Combustibles'' magazine. Mountweazel was the subject of an exhibit in Dublin, Ireland, in March 2009 examining her fictitious life and works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/0320/1224243084358.html "The Life and Times of Lillian Virginia Mountweazel"], Aidan Dunne, ''[[The Irish Times]]'', March 20, 2009. Retrieved March 27 2009 {{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first printing in 1980 of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' contains two fictitious entries: on Guglielmo Baldini, a non-existent Italian composer, and Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, who purportedly composed a small amount of music for [[flute]]. Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb in [[Copenhagen]]. The two entries were removed from later editions, as well as from later printings of the 1980 edition.
* The [[German language|German-language]] medical encyclopedia ''Pschyrembel Klinisches Wörterbuch'' features an entry on the ''Steinlaus'' ([[stone louse]]), a rock-eating animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225741.800-the-word-copyright-trap.html The word: Copyright trap] ''New Scientist'' October 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific name ''Petrophaga lorioti'' implies its origin: a creation of the German humorist [[Vicco von Bülow|Loriot]]. The ''Pschyrembel'' entry was removed in 1996 but, after reader protests, was restored the next year, with an extended section on the role of the stone louse in the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].

=== Practical jokes ===
Fictitious entries occasionally feature in other publications in an attempt to be humorous, such as:

*[[Rhinogradentia]] are a fictitious [[mammal]]ian [[Order (biology)|order]], extensively documented in a series of articles and books by the equally fictitious [[Germany|German]] naturalist [[Harald Stümpke]]. Allegedly, both the animals and the scientist were the creations of [[Gerolf Steiner]], a [[zoology]] professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].
*[[Taro Tsujimoto]] is a fictional character often included in [[Buffalo Sabres]] reference works. Tsujimoto, an alleged Japanese forward, was the creation of Sabres general manager [[Punch Imlach|George "Punch" Imlach]] designed to fool the [[National Hockey League]] during the [[1974 NHL Amateur Draft]]; Imlach drafted Tsujimoto and only months later—well after the pick was made official—admitted that the league had been fooled by the fictitious player.
*[[Franz Bibfeldt]] is a fictitious theologian created by Robert Howard Clausen for a footnote in a student paper. Bibfeldt was later popularized by Clausen's classmate [[Martin Marty]] as an ongoing in-joke among theologians, including a book and a parody lecture series at the University of Chicago Divinity School.
* At least two [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|sports teams]] at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] have long included [[George P. Burdell]], a fictitious student originally created as a practical joke by a Tech student in 1927, in their lists of [[Varsity letter|lettermen]] in team media guides:
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Football]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1928, 1929, and 1930 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/info-guide-16.pdf |title=All-Time Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Football 2016 Media Guide |page=136 |publisher=Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Men's basketball]]: Lists Burdell as a letterman in the 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', {{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/gtmbb_info_guide_1617.pdf |title=Tech Letterwinners |work=Georgia Tech Basketball 2016–2017 Information Guide |page=82 |publisher=[[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] |accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puzzles/games ===
Many publications have included false items and then challenged readers to identify it, including:
*[[Australia]]n [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] [[Tim Flannery]]'s book ''[[Astonishing Animals]]'' includes one imaginary animal and leaves it up to the reader to distinguish which one it is.
*The product catalogue for Swedish consumer electronics and hobby articles retailer [[Teknikmagasinet]] contains a fictitious product. Finding that product is a contest, ''Blufftävlingen'', in which the best suggestion for another fictitious product from someone who spotted the product gets included in the next issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |title=Teknikmagasinet – meningen med livet |publisher=Teknik magasinet |language=sv |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |trans-title=Meaning of life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403100827/http://www.teknikmagasinet.se/nydb/db.pl?template_file=link_bluffen.html |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Muse (children's magazine)|Muse]]'', a US magazine for children 10–14, regularly includes a two-page spread containing science and technology news. One of the news stories is false and readers are encouraged to guess which one.
*''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' (a magazine devoted to games and puzzles) used to include a fake advertisement in each issue as one of the magazine's regular games.
*The book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]'' describes many bizarre and obscure films. The authors of the work state that one film described by the book is a complete hoax, and they challenge readers to spot the made-up film; the imaginary film was ''Dog of Norway'', which supposedly starred "Muki the Wonder Dog", named after the authors' own dog

== Fictitious entries in fiction ==
Fictitious entries are sometimes plot points in fiction, including:

* A [[Fred Saberhagen]] [[science fiction]] short story, "The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron", in which an encyclopedia article for a star system is a fictitious entry included in the encyclopedia to detect plagiarism, which causes a [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|Berserker]] ship to end up in an empty star system where it runs out of fuel and ceases to be a threat to humanity.
* [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s short story "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" tells of an encyclopedia entry on what turns out to be the imaginary country of Uqbar. This leads the narrator to the equally fantastic region of Tlön, the setting for much of the country's literature.
* The fictitious entry [[Agloe, New York]], is a key plot point in [[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Paper Towns]]'' and its [[Paper Towns (film)|film adaptation]]. ''Paper Towns'' also references the fictitious entry "Lillian Mountweazel" in the name of the Spiegelman family's dog, Myrna Mountweazel.
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Face the Raven]]", a hidden community lives in a London alley. [[Clara Oswald]] helps the Doctor start the search for that community by searching for any trap streets within the London city limits.

== Legal action ==
Fictitious entries may be used to demonstrate copying, but to prove legal infringement, the material must also be shown to be eligible for copyright. However, due to the [[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|''Feist v. Rural'']], [[Trivial Pursuit#Fred%20Worth%20lawsuit|Fred Worth lawsuit]] where the Supreme Court ruled that "information alone without a minimum of original creativity cannot be protected by copyright", there are very few cases where copyright has been proven. Many of these cases that go to court are dismissed and the affected party is rewarded no compensation.

* Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of [[Trivial Pursuit]]. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even his own fictitious entries that he had added to the books to catch anyone who wanted to violate his copyright. However, the case was thrown out by the district court judge as the Trivial Pursuit inventors argued that facts are not protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598,4685968|title=The Courier - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/796/729/1559434/|title=Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co., 796 F. Supp. 729 (E.D.N.Y. 1992)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a New York Corporation that published and sold a New York City taxi driver's guide entitled ''Official New York Taxi Driver's Guide,'' attempted to sue Hagstrom Map Corporation who published and sold ''New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Drivers Guide,'' that Hagstrom allegedly violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] for permanent injunction of their guide, damages, and attorney fees. However, this case was dismissed by the United States Federal Court because it found that fictitious entries (in this case, a "[[trap street]]") are not themselves protected by copyright.
* In ''Alexandria Drafting Co. v. Andrew H. Amsterdam dba Franklin Maps'', Alexandria Drafting Corporation filed suit against Franklin Maps alleging that Franklin Maps had violated the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] by copying their map books. However, this case was dismissed although the judge cited that there was a single instance of original copyright, but this was not sufficient evidence to support copyright infringement. Additionally the judge cited ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'' as previous case law to support that "fictitious names may not be copyrighted" and "the existence, or non-existence, of a road is a non-copyrightable fact."
* In one particular case, in 2001 [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. However, in this copyright infringement case there was no instance of a purposeful copyright trap. Instead, the prosecution sued for specific stylistic choices, such as the width and style of the roads. 

== Simple Errors ==
Often times there will be errors in maps, dictionaries, and other publications, that are not deliberate and thus are not fictitious entries. For example, within dictionaries there are such mistakes known as [[ghost words]], "words which have no real existence […] being mere coinages due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors."&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Skeat, The Transactions of the Philological Society 1885-7 (Oxford: Blackwell, 1885-7) Vol. II, p.351.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Geneva Motor Show''' ({{lang-fr|Salon international de l'automobile}}) is an annual [[auto show]] held in March in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] city of [[Geneva]]. The show is hosted at the [[Palexpo]], a [[convention center|convention centre]] located next to the [[Geneva Cointrin International Airport]]. The Salon is organised by the [[Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles]], and is considered an important major international auto show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevamotorshow2010.com |title=Geneva Motor Show 2010 |publisher=Geneva Motor Show 2010 |date= |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128120050/http://www.genevamotorshow2010.com/ |archivedate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First held in 1905, the Salon has hosted almost all major [[internal combustion engine]]d models in the history of the [[automobile]], along with benzene- and steam-powered cars from the beginning of the century. Exotic [[supercar]]s often steal the spotlight during their debuts at the show. Prototypes, new equipment, technical breakthroughs, international [[partnership]]s, as well as political and social debates, have been announced at the exhibition. The show is regarded as a level playing field for the world's [[automotive industry|automakers]], aided by the fact Switzerland lacks an auto industry of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank Jordans|title=Small is beautiful at the Geneva International Motor Show|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://www.latimes.com/classified/automotive/highway1/la-hy-genevaoverview-story,0,7479684.story|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek economic crisis}}

The '''June 2012 Greek legislative election''' was held in [[Greece]] on Sunday, 17 June,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18082552|title=Greece to hold new election on 17 June|date=16 May 2012|accessdate=16 May 2012|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; to elect all 300 members to the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in accordance with the [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]], after all [[Greek government formation, May 2012|attempts to form a new government]] failed following the [[Greek legislative election, May 2012|May election]]. If all attempts to form a new government fails, the constitution directs the [[President of Greece|president]] to dissolve a newly elected parliament, and then to call for new parliamentary elections within 30 days of the dissolution. The president announced at 16 May the date for the new election, and signed the formal decree to dissolve the parliament and call for the election at 19 May.

The election result featured [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] as the largest party, with 30% of the votes and 129 seats (including the 50 extra seats for coming first). The second party was the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) with 27% of the votes and 71 seats. The third party was the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) with 12% of the votes and 33 seats. The other parties that won seats were: [[Independent Greeks]] (ANEL) with 20 seats, [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] (XA) with 18 seats, [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DIMAR) with 17 seats, and [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) with 12 seats.

None of the parties achieved the 151 seats needed for an overall majority. As outlined by the constitution, the largest party ND led the first negotiations to try and form a new government. ND invited all elected parties, except the [[ultranationalist]] party [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] (XA), to participate in a unity government that would respect the [[Greek debt crisis#Second rescue package (July 2011 - February 2012)|existing bailout agreement]] Greece signed and ratified in February 2012, but as the highest priority should attempt to renegotiate the [[Greek debt crisis#Fifth austerity package – February 2012|austerity terms of the agreement]], asking the main creditors ([[European Union|EU]], [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]) to accept milder terms and increase their amount of bailout funding to Greece. On 20 June, a new unity government comprising ND, PASOK and DIMAR was formed for a planned 4-year term, with [[Antonis Samaras]] appointed to be the new [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]]. The new cabinet was dominated by lawmakers from ND but also included a significant number of technocrats, among them two ministers (Justice, Administrative Reform) nominated by DIMAR. The other coalition participant, PASOK, opted not to participate with leading party cadres in the government.

==Background==
By section 37 of the constitution, the [[President of Greece|President of the Republic]] will consecutively give the leaders of the three largest parties in parliament an exploratory mandate to set up a government within three days, until one leader succeeds. If none does, "the President of the Republic shall summon all party leaders, and if the impossibility to form a Cabinet enjoying the confidence of the Parliament is confirmed, he shall attempt to form a Cabinet composed of all parties in Parliament for the purpose of holding parliamentary elections. If this fails, he shall entrust the President of the Supreme Administrative Court or of the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court or of the Court of Auditors to form a Cabinet as widely accepted as possible to carry out elections and dissolve Parliament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl50.html#A41|title=Constitution of Greece|publisher=Hellenic Resources Network|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May election===
{{main|Greek legislative election, May 2012}}
At the 6 May election, no party won an absolute majority of seats. President [[Karolos Papoulias]], in accordance with the constitution, offered successive exploratory mandates to the leaders of the three largest parties: [[Antonis Samaras]] of [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND), [[Alexis Tsipras]] of the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA), and [[Evangelos Venizelos]] of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK). Each in turn failed to form a government and returned their mandates to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120512-700890.html |title=Greek President Takes Over Negotiations to Form Coalition Government |work=The Wall Street Journal|date=12 May 2012|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 May, the president followed the terms of section 37 of the constitution and met with all party leaders to find a way of forming a majority government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18048946 |title=Greece crisis: Party chiefs in last-ditch talks |publisher=BBC News |date=13 May 2012|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After concluding on the eve of 14 May that it was impossible to form a new ordinary political government, in a last-ditch effort the president asked all the elected political leaders on 15 May if they could support the establishment of a "technocratic" government for a limited term, to guide Greece safely through its economic crisis. After this attempt also failed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/world/europe/in-greece-leaders-fail-to-find-consensus-forcing-country-into-new-elections.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first1=Liz | last1=Alderman | first2=Rachel | last2=Donadio | title=Greek President Expected to Name Caretaker Government | date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he asked on 16 May, in full compliance with the constitution, for a [[Caretaker Cabinet of Panagiotis Pikrammenos|caretaker cabinet]] under [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] president [[Panagiotis Pikrammenos]] to be appointed, and to dissolve parliament and hold new elections on 17 June.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Galpin |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18082552 |title=Greece to hold new election on 17 June |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal decree to dissolve the newly elected parliament and call for new elections was jointly signed by President Karolos Papoulias and caretaker Prime Minister Panagiotis Pikrammenos at 19 May, to fully comply with the 30-day constitutional rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defencenet.gr/defence/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=42270&amp;Itemid=131 |script-title=el:Διαλύθηκε και τυπικά η Βουλή – Προκήρυξη εκλογών |language=Greek |publisher=DefenceNet |date=19 May 2012 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German Finance Minister [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] said the election would be a referendum on Greece's continuation as a member of the [[eurozone]]. "If Greece—and this is the will of the great majority—wants to stay in the euro, then they have to accept the conditions," he said. "Otherwise it isn’t possible. No responsible candidate can hide that from the electorate."&lt;ref name="bberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-15/greek-vote-escalates-crisis-as-schaeuble-raises-euro-exit.html|publisher=Bloomberg|title=Greek vote escalates crisis as Schaeuble raises Euro-exit|date=15 May 2012|accessdate=16 May 2012|first1=Jeff|last1=Black|first2=James G.|last2=Neuger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels were also drawn to the proposed [[Greek proposed economy referendum, 2011|Greek economy referendum]], with suggestion that the two 2012 elections were a ''de facto'' referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/06/201263112548566574.html |title=Democracy versus the eurozone – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incumbent parliament==
{{main|List of members of the Hellenic Parliament, May 2012}}

Seven parties were elected at the May 2012 election, but this parliament was short-lived because a coalition government could not be [[Greek government formation, May 2012|formed]]; fresh elections were called.

The other 50 seats will be awarded to the party that wins a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes, with coalitions in that regard not being counted as an overall party but having their votes counted separately for each party in the coalition, according to the [[Elections in Greece#Electoral law|election law]]. Parliamentary majority is achieved by a party or coalition of parties that command at least one half plus one (151 out of 300) of total seats. Blank and invalid votes, as well as votes cast for parties that fall short of the 3% threshold, are disregarded for seat allocation purposes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Opinion polls==
[[File:Election results and opinion polls in Greece (May-June 2012).png|thumb|center|700px|Opinion polls expressed as an average for each week between the elections at 6 May and 17 June 2012 (based only upon adjusted data)]]

Most of the early polls conducted during the 10 days after the election at 6 May—where the political leaders unsuccessfully attempted to form a new government—showed SYRIZA taking the lead in popular support ahead of ND.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Lowen, Mark |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18030786 |title=Greek Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos hits stalemate |publisher=BBC News |date=6 April 2012 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Becatoros, Elena |agency=Associated Press |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/greek-government-talks-final-stretch-16325292#.T6zlxXgRrBw |title=Greek govt talks fail, country closer to new vote |publisher=ABC News |date=11 May 2012 |author2=Black, Jeff |author3=Neuger, James G. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514014734/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/greek-government-talks-final-stretch-16325292 |archivedate=14 May 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to accusations from the political leaders at ND, PASOK and DIMAR, that SYRIZA deliberately had derailed all attempts to form a new government, with the sole purpose of pursuing their own interest of possibly growing in size after a new election.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} After the new June election was officially called at 16 May,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; there was an apparent change in political momentum, with most of the subsequent opinion polls now indicating that ND had taken the lead in popular support ahead of SYRIZA. 
According to Greek law, the polling companies were not allowed to publish additional opinion polls after the last working day two weeks ahead of the election, meaning that the last opinion polls were published at 1 June.&lt;ref name="last Kapa poll conducted at 29–31 May"/&gt; Among all of the last published opinion polls, 9 out of 12 polling companies measured a lead of popular support for ND, while only the two polling companies, VPRC and Public Issue &lt;small&gt;(who both adjust their vote results by performing a weighted prediction of the likely votes of undecided voters based on [[Time Series Analysis]]&lt;ref name="VPRC opinion poll methodology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vprc.gr/uplds/File/teleytaia%20nea/Epikaira/Survey_Identity_May2012.pdf|title=Η ΤΑΥΤΟΤΗΤΑ ΤΗΣ ΕΡΕΥΝΑΣ (The Identity of Research)|language=Greek|publisher=VPRC|date=30 May 2012|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Public Issue opinion poll methodology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicissue.gr/publicissue/varometro-methodology/|title=The Methodology of Political Barometer: The methodology of Public Issue for the assessment of constituency influence of parties|language=Greek|publisher=Public Issue|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;/small&gt; believed the current lead of popular support belonged to SYRIZA, and the last polling company Pulse RC predicted it would end up with a draw.

*&lt;small&gt;'''Note on varying poll methodology:''' The polls shown above with figures in yellow lines used the "raw data method", recording raw responses for each party as a percentage of total responses, and including percentages for those who are undecided or said they will abstain to vote (either physically or by voting blank). All the other polls used an "adjusted method" where an estimate of vote share is projected, by disregarding those who opted to abstain and in some manner adjusting for the likely votes of those who were undecided. The adjusted method emulates the same vote percentage calculation as in the official election. The raw data method, will by definition always result in some relative lower percentage points for all parties (due to the party votes now being divided by the higher figure "total of all responses", instead of divided by the lower figure "total of all valid votes"). Therefore, the percentage numbers listed by each of these two methods are not directly comparable to each other. For some polls, the data from both methods are presented.&lt;/small&gt;

===Secret polling===
According to Greek law, opinion polls are not allowed to be published after the last working day two weeks ahead of the official election day, and as a result the last date to publish a poll was 1 June 2012.&lt;ref name="last Kapa poll conducted at 29–31 May"/&gt; However, the polling companies are still allowed to conduct opinion polls during the last two weeks of the election campaign for research purpose, as long as the results remain unpublished and secret. Greek banking stocks were up 20% on Thursday 15 June 2012, on reports that a secret poll had indicated that a pro-bailout government was likely to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2012/06/15/central-banks-reach-for-their-guns-ahead-of-greek-vote/|title=Central banks reach for their guns ahead of Greek vote|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
Even before the election had been called, [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DIMAR) leader Kouvelis stated that DIMAR would likely not want to participate in a [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) led government even after repeated elections, as SYRIZA had declined to participate in a unity government with [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND), [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK), and DIMAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_14/05/2012_442025|publisher=Ekathimerini|title=Democratic Left rejects cooperation with SYRIZA even after possible elections|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the election, it was expected that larger parties would try to form alliances with smaller parties; specifically, ND was in negotiations with [[Democratic Alliance (Greece)|Democratic Alliance]] (DISY), while DISY was also negotiating with [[Drasi|Action]] (DRASI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_14/05/2012_442116 |title=Centrist leader seeks to marshal pro-European forces |publisher=ekathimerini.com |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SYRIZA was trying to form an alliance with [[Social Agreement]] (KOISY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/world/europe/caretaker-greek-cabinet-is-sworn-in.html|title=Temporary Cabinet Named in Greece as Agency Lowers Nation’s Debt Rating|first=Niki|last=Kitsantonis|date=17 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_27011_16/05/2012_442477 |title=Parties switch attention to new elections |publisher=ekathimerini.com |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also rumours of SYRIZA negotiating with the [[Ecologist Greens]] (OP) and [[Front of the Greek Anticapitalist Left|Anticapitalist Left Cooperation for the Overthrow -Front of anticapitalist, revolutionary, communist and radical Left Ecology]] (ANTARSYA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18056677 |title=Greece: Trying to understand Syriza |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 May 2012 |date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other left parties however all ended to decide they would not merge or form a new coalition with SYRIZA. Another important change however happened for SYRIZA on 22 May, where the steering committee decided to transform the "Coalition of the Radical Left", from its 10 coalition parties into a single independent party with the new name "Syriza Unionist Social Front".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathremote_1_22/05/2012_443394|title=Ενιαίο πολιτικό κόμμα ο ΣΥΡΙΖΑ [Single political party SYRIZA]|language=Greek|publisher=kathimerini.gr|date=22 May 2012|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driving force behind the transformation from coalition to a united party, was the current Greek election law, stipulating that any coalitions participating in a parliamentary election should have their votes split up for each party in the coalition, before determining who became the largest party in the election and thus qualified to win the 50 extra bonus seats in the parliament. So the transformation by itself, greatly increased the chance of SYRIZA also to win bonus seats in the election.

ND and DISY announced a complete merger of the two parties into an overall united party on 21 May,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120521-711429.html |title=Greek Conservatives Join Forces With Liberal Party|work=Wall Street Journal|date=21 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2012-05/22/content_15353055.htm |title=Greek conservative parties join forces for elections |work=China Daily |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/elections/greece-bakoyannis-gives-lifeline-new-democracy-news-512867 |title=Greece´s Bakoyannis gives lifeline to New Democracy |publisher=EurActiv |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following three parties announced on the same day an agreement to run the election as a new joint coalition: [[Recreate Greece]] – [[Drasi|Action]] – [[Liberal Alliance (Greece)|Liberal Alliance]] (DX-DRASI-FS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_21/05/2012_443034 |title=Parties forge alliances ahead of June vote |publisher=ekathimerini.com |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social Agreement]] announced at 19 May their main goal was to establish a new "left government", and in order to achieve such a goal, they would abstain to participate in the election, and instead use all their energy to arrange meetings with all other progressive left parties, with the purpose of creating a convergence program for the parties to make formation of a new "left government" possible after the elections in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koinonikisymfonia.gr/%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%87%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%BF/%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%BF/794/1%CE%B7%CF%82-%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AE%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%87%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%83-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%83 |title=1st National Meeting executives SOCIAL AGREEMENT |language=Greek|publisher=Social Agreement (koinonikisymfonia.gr)|date=19 May 2012 |accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May the [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DIMAR) however repeated their previous stance, that it would only work with SYRIZA to form a "left government", on the condition that there were guarantees of staying within the eurozone, and this would according to DIMAR require SYRIZA to drop their idea of a unilateral cancellation of the "memorandum" (a nickname for: "The bailout deal that the previous Greek government agreed to implement with EU, [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Petrakis |first=Maria |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-28/greek-democratic-left-demands-euro-pledge-to-back-syriza.html |title=Greek Democratic Left Demands Euro Pledge to Back Syriza |publisher=Bloomberg |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As none of the other left parties (OP, ANTARSYA and KKE), neither wanted to accept signing the proposed agreement of a unilateral rejection of the "memorandum" in favour of SYRIZAs new "National Recovery Plan", the attempt by Social Agreement to form a multilateral agreement between "all progressive left parties" ahead of the election failed. Instead only a small bilateral agreement between SYRIZA and Social Agreement was signed, outlining what the cornerstones of the new policy should be, if the election ended with a parliamentary majority for SYRIZA to form a one party government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koinonikisymfonia.gr/%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B5%CF%87%CF%8C%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%BF/%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%BF/795/%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%AD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%83-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BC%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%83-%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%82-%CF%84-%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%83%CE%AD%CE%BB%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-1%CE%B7-%CF%80%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%AE%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B7 |title=Speech by President SOCIAL AGREEMENT Lucas T.

On 7 June, an arrest warrant was issued for [[Ilias Kasidiaris]] from [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] (XA), after he during a political debate broadcast by ANT-1 TV, as reported by the newspaper Kathimerini: "threw water at SYRIZA’s [[Rena Dourou]] and then repeatedly slapped Communist Party hopeful [[Liana Kanelli]]", before the televised signal was interrupted.&lt;ref name="Arrest warrant for Kasidiaris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_07/06/2012_445749|title=Arrest warrant for Golden Dawn spokesman after attack during TV talk show|publisher=Ekathimerini|date=7 June 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608223230/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_07/06/2012_445749|archivedate=8 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Video clip of Kasidiaris punching"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VheRFTMZV14|title=ANT1 – ΕΠΙΘΕΣΗ ΞΥΛΟΔΑΡΜΟΣ ΚΑΣΙΔΙΑΡΗ ΣΤΗΝ Λ.ΚΑΝΝΕΛΗ |language=Greek|work=Youtube|date=7 June 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The youtube source is supplementing the Kathimerini source, and should be kept for readers as an option to check out the televised pictures, to make up their own opinion about how serious the reported incident was--&gt;

The [[caretaker government]] and all parties, except for the leader of Golden Dawn, jointly condemned the TV show attack by Kasidiaris with the following statements:&lt;ref name="Government and all parties condemn Golden Dawn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_07/06/2012_445768 |title=Government, parties condemn Golden Dawn spokesman's TV show attack |publisher=Ekathimerini|date=7 June 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesman{{who|date=June 2012}} from the caretaker government [[Dimitris Tsiodras]] said: "This attack is an attack against every democratic citizen. The least that any democratic citizen could expect is for Mr Kasidiaris’s party, Golden Dawn, to condemn these actions unreservedly." ND, PASOK, SYRIZA and [[Independent Greeks|ANEL]] also jointly agreed, not to take part in any television or radio panel discussions with Golden Dawn candidates.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} An opinion poll published at 1 June by GPO, had indicated that 60% of the votes received by Golden Dawn in the May election, came from Greeks who wanted to express their opposition to the political establishment, while less than 30% of those voting for the party actually supported its extreme views on immigration. A spokesperson from PASOK said: "This young man proved today that he represents a neo-Nazi group, which apart from being far-right is also cowardly and thuggish" and called for those who previously voted for the party to "think again" before casting their June vote. ANEL leader [[Panos Kammenos]] launched the same message by saying "the neo-Nazis have been unmasked on TV. People who voted for the Nazi thugs should react when casting their vote next time."{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Popular Orthodox Rally|LAOS]]' [[Georgios Karatzaferis]], said Golden Dawn was damaging the country's patriotic front: "It took us 10 years to gain respect and dignity for the patriotic movement. We won't let the party of [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] and the parliamentary gang of Mr Kasidiaris to ridicule what we have built all these years. It is time for them to leave political life. Fascism will not pass in Greece."{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

During the campaign, the 8 largest parties presented some political ultimatums about a possible government formation after the election:

Few hours after the public announcement of the failed attempt by the Greek president to form a new government on 15 May, some Greek officials claimed that German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] had suggested to the Greek president during a telephone call, that he should consider to launch a "euro referendum" along with the new "legislative election".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The Greek media and the heads of ND, PASOK, SYRIZA, KKE, and the interim prime minister, all went out strongly to criticise that Merkel purportedly had made such advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protothema.gr/ekloges/article/?aid=198471 |title=Πρώτο ΘΕΜΑ online : ΚΚΕ: Ωμός εκβιασμός Μέρκελ σε βάρος του ελληνικού λαού – Εκλογές 2012 |language=Greek |publisher=Protothema.gr |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hv4ZTSmw9hd_hokw1cz3Fo2OfIpA?docId=CNG.73302069c1cfc1b61f105e55b53bd1ba.581 |title=AFP: Greece bridles at Merkel referendum suggestion |publisher=Google |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/1336697288272/Griechenland-Verwirrung-um-Merkel-Vorschlag-fuer-Euro-Referendum |title=Verwirrung um Merkel-Vorschlag für Euro-Referendum – Griechenland in der Krise|language=German|publisher=Derstandard.at |date=19 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day later it became clear the entire debate had been based on a translated misunderstanding, as Merkel officially denied ever to have made such a proposition to the Greek president. Merkel insisted that she said the election was "in principle...an indirect referendum on euro membership", as the outcome of the election potentially could lead to a development with Greece leaving the euro, if the election was won by parties supporting a Greek rejection of all commitments signed in the Memorandum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/world/20120518/173543263.html |title=German Govt. Spokeswoman Denies Merkel Referendum Statement |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], representing a neutral nation outside the euro, a few days later completely agreed with Merkel's analysis, that the Greek legislative election in principle was "an indirect referendum on euro membership".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18139454 |title=Nick Clegg warns that Eurozone collapse will fuel 'extremism' |publisher=BBC |date=21 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An EU summit ended on 24 May with repeated calls for Greece to stick to the terms of the EU/IMF memorandum, if they wanted to receive more funds to tackle its debt problem and current economic crisis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Lowen |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18121414 |title=Merkel 'suggests Greek referendum on euro membership' |publisher=BBC |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/05/201252401643302215.html |title=EU summit ends with warning for Greece |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the discussions, SYRIZA's leader Tsipras visited some of the main European cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomhartmann.com/forum/2012/05/greece-democracy-could-put-end-banksters%E2%80%99-austerity-experiment |title=In Greece, democracy could put an end to the banksters’ austerity experiment |publisher=Thom Hartmann |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to clarify his stance of wishing to unilaterally cancel the Memorandum and at the same time having Greece stay within the eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/17/tsipiras-to-amanpour-we-dont-want-greece-outside-the-euro/ |title=Tsipras to Amanpour: "We don't want Greece outside the euro..." |publisher=Cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com |accessdate=26 May 2012 |date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the French Finance Minister [[Pierre Moscovici]] on 5 June repeated the European message that a continued euro membership was conditional on the next Greek government continuing to respect the signed commitments in the Memorandum, as the EU would only be willing to accept a re-negotiation of some subterms, Tsipras claimed this was political bluffing and a new message compared to what the French government previously had told him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_kathremote_1_04/06/2012_445261|title=Tsipras: H Greece does not turn in the Memorandum|language=Greek|publisher=Kathimerini|date=4 June 2012|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eurozone]] finance ministers were quick to issue a statement that read the result "should allow for the formation of a government that will carry the support of the electorate to bring Greece back on a path of sustainable growth...The Eurogroup reiterates its commitment to assist Greece in its adjustment effort in order to address the many challenges the economy is facing." It also said the "troika" of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund would re-visit Athens to continue discussions on the bailout agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/131027.pdf Eurogroup statement on 2012 Greek elections]&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit]], British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] warned of delayed government formation and said that "the outcome of the Greek election looks clear in terms of a commitment to stay in the eurozone and to accept the terms of the memorandum. But I think those parties that want that to happen can't afford to delay and position themselves. If you are a Greek political party and want to stay in the eurozone and accept the consequences that follow you have got to get on with it and help form a government. A delay could be very dangerous."&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; European Union President [[Herman Van Rompuy]] issued a statement that read: "We will continue to stand by Greece."&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt; He added that "we are confident that the new government will take ownership of the adjustment program to which the Greek authorities had committed earlier this year." [[European Commission]] President [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] reiterated a willingness to visit Greece when a new government is formed to keep the country on track to continue receiving the bailout money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Luke |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/18/us-g20-europe-vanrompuy-idUSBRE85H1AQ20120618 |title=EU confident Greece will adhere to bailout: Van Rompuy |publisher=Reuters |date= 18 June 2012|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Democracy's Antonis Samaras said that "there’s no time to lose or leeway for small party games. The country must be governed." PASOK's Evangelos Venizelos said that "there's not even a day to lose" in the need to form a new government.&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stearns |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-17/greece-races-as-cash-dwindles-with-europe-seeking-return-to-cuts.html |title=Greece Races as Cash Dwindles With Europe Seeking Return to Cuts |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=18 June 2012 |date=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaras also said the election was a mandate to stay within the eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Psaropoulos |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/06/2012618102935771328.html |title=Greece results bring relief but no remedy - Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Golden Dawn's [[Nikolaos Michaloliakos]] said that he "would like to thank the hundreds of thousands of Greeks who did not change their vote, despite the effort of wretched propaganda by the paid stooges on TV. We will continue the fight for a Greece that belongs to Greeks." In [[Thessaloniki]], Golden Dawn's supporters celebrated the result and set off flares and fireworks.&lt;ref name="hpost"/&gt;

The following day, [[financial market]]s initially rose on the news of ND's plurality, but later came down as the possible implications became known.&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite news|author=G20 summit |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/g20-summit/9338840/G20-summit-Greece-must-get-on-with-it-or-face-dangerous-consequences-warns-David-Cameron.html |title=G20 summit: Greece must 'get on with it' or face dangerous consequences, warns David Cameron |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 June 2012|accessdate=18 June 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June, European and American financial markets rose on speculation of the imminence of a new government that would have at least a modicum of support for the bailout programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nazareth |first=Rita |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-19/u-s-stock-index-futures-fluctuate-citigroup-falls.html |title=U.S. Stocks Advance to One-Month High as Fed Meets |publisher=Bloomberg |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' read Golden Dawn's popularity as a "symptom of the alienation and hardship that their society is experiencing."&lt;ref name="hpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/17/golden-dawn-election-results_n_1604097.html |title=Golden Dawn, Greek Far Right Party, Returns To Parliament |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=18 June 2012 |date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was echoed by ''[[Fox News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/06/17/greece-far-right-party-returns-to-parliament/ |title=Greece: far-right party returns to parliament |publisher=Fox News |date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[BBC]]'' cited Greece's [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] and forecasts to ask if an exit from the eurozone was only delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18489360 |title=BBC News - Greece: Euro exit delayed? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' said the May election was a vote out of anger over the austerity measures, but that this was a vote out of fear after the in terms of a more defined future. It cited Samaras' question of staying within the eurozone or returning to the [[drachma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/europe/why-greeks-voted-way-they-did |title=Why Greeks voted the way they did &amp;#124; Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also asked if a "Grexit" (Greek exit) from the eurozone was inevitable and cited this as Europe's "Lehman moment" in reference to the [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]]. It further cited the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]'s assertion that there was a 90 percent chance of a Greek exit from the eurozone within 12–18 months, while [[Citigroup]] estimated a 50-75 percent chance of an exit. [[UBS]] suggested a [[write off]] of 60 billion euros of Greece's debts, as opposed to a between 225 billion to 800 billion euros if Greece were to leave the eurozone. Greece was already expected to be unable to pay pensions and civil servant salaries by mid-July should there be no more external funds coming into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/europe/why-grexit-inevitable |title=Why 'Grexit' is inevitable &amp;#124; Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' suggested that the election determined whether Greece would exit the eurozone and decide the fate of the entire postwar European project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stathis N.

==Government formation==
{{main|Cabinet of Antonis Samaras}}

New Democracy announced it was working towards building a "pro-euro" coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/06/201261716157457770.html |title=Pro-euro parties clinch Greek polls – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Samaras was tasked with forming a new government within the stipulated three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris Morris |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18490930 |title=BBC News - Antonis Samaras begins urgent Greece coalition talks |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SYRIZA announced that it would not join a coalition government which would include a party that insists on going ahead with the austerity measures demanded by the "troika." However, PASOK's Evangelos Venizelos met with Samaras and then announced that "the most crucial thing for us right now is to achieve the greatest possible range of consensus, and this must happen by [19 June] at the latest;" he then went on to criticise Tsipras' refusal to join the government in saying that "you can't have some people choosing the easy position of being in opposition and lying in wait for the government to fail - or rather trying to create the conditions for the government, that is the country, to fail."&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/06/2012618173626287447.html |title=Greek leader seeks 'salvation' government - Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June, ND suggested it was on the verge of forming a coalition government with PASOK and DIMAR, though the latter's Fotis Kouvelis said that he would only offer conditional support. The same morning Samaras met with Kouvelis to gauge support for a three-party coalition. ''[[Ta Nea]]'' exclaimed in an [[op-ed]] that "political leaders should be aware of the fact that this government is Greece's last chance to remain in the eurozone. The Greek people are ready to reward the parties that manage to ease austerity and punish those that raise voices of dissent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reuters 19 June 2012, 01.05PM IST |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/greece-elections-conservative-new-democracy-poised-to-clinch-coalition-deal-with-pasok/articleshow/14265425.cms |title=Greece elections: Conservative New Democracy poised to clinch coalition deal with PASOK - Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ND then claimed to have a preliminary agreement with PASOK in order to form a [[national unity government|government of national salvation]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"/&gt;

On 20 June, ND announced a coalition government with PASOK and DIMAR after resuming talks for a common policy programme. Greek media speculated on who would be in the cabinet, including suggestions that the Finance Ministry portfolio would be given to [[Vassilis Rapanos]], the president of [[National Bank of Greece]]. PASOK and DIMAR were said to limit their participitation in a new government so as not to be responsible for its actions. They also opposed the inclusion of cabinet members who were previously in the government that approved the bailout programme. Kouvelis said that DIMAR's conditions for joining the coalition government would include an extension of the timetable to meet the target to cut Greece's budget deficit, as well as cutting the [[minimum wage]] and revoking the austerity measures that had "decimated society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/world/europe/greece-poised-to-form-new-coalition.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Rachel | last1=Donadio | first2=Liz | last2=Alderman | title=Antonis Samaras Is Sworn In as Greek Prime Minister | date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healtheon''' was a [[dot-com company]] founded by [[James H. Clark]] and Pavan Nigam. The company's mission was to "use the power of computing and the [[Internet]] to revolutionize the [[healthcare industry]], stripping away its inefficiencies and inequities and streamlining it for the new millennium".&lt;ref name=heck&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/02/21/273905/index.htm | title=What the Heck is Healtheon? | first=Julie | last=Creswell | work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | date=February 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the company was acquired by [[WebMD]].

==History==
In mid-1995, [[James H. Clark]], the founder of [[Netscape]], came up with the idea to modernize technology in the health care industry. He founded Healthscape in early 1996 with funding from [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]]. To avoid confusion with Netscape, the company changed its name to Healtheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Another-Startup-by-Jim-Clark-New-online-venture-2977549.php | title=Another Startup by Jim Clark / New online venture focuses on health care | first=Jon | last=Swartz | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=June 18, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's first big idea was to develop a system for linking insurers and [[human resources]] departments. However, the idea failed since insurers dismissed it as too expensive and human resource departments were not interested.&lt;ref name=heck/&gt;

In 1997, [[Mike Long (American businessman)|Mike Long]] became [[chief executive officer]] of the company. Five months later, the company formed a [[research and development]] partnership with Brown &amp; Toland, a network of 1,600 physicians in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=heck/&gt;

in February 1998, the company announced the acquisition of ActaMed, a medical-records clearinghouse for doctors and insurers, for $150 million, which gave the company a source of revenue.&lt;ref name=heck/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/26/business/fi-23067 | title=Healtheon to Buy ActaMed for $150 Million | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/1998/02/23/daily11.html | title=Healtheon to buy ActaMed Corp. | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=February 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1998, the company filed for an [[initial public offering]], but the offering was cancelled in October 1998, after stock prices dropped due to the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB908916747713453000 | title=Healtheon Cancels Planned Offering, Will Raise $40 Million From Backers | first=George | last=Anders | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=October 21, 1998}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1999, the company completed its IPO and became a [[public company]] and the stock price rose 400% on its first day of trading.

On April 21, 1999, the company announced the acquisition of MedE America for $478 million in stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://investor.shareholder.com/wbmd/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=249527&amp;CompanyID=HLTH | title=Healtheon to Acquire MEDE AMERICA | date=April 21, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB924717840641032784 | title=Healtheon Agrees to Buy Mede America In Stock Deal Valued at $478.5 Million | first=Don | last=Clark | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=April 22, 1999}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 1999, the company announced a merger with [[WebMD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://investor.shareholder.com/wbmd/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=249524&amp;CompanyID=HLTH | title=Healtheon and WebMD Announce Merger to Form first End-to-End Internet Healthcare and E-Commerce Company | date=May 20, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HotBot''' was a [[metasearch engine]] for information on the [[world wide web]]. It is now a privately owned front end using [[Bing (search engine)|Bing search]] for its search results.

==History==
Hotbot was launched in May 1996 by [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]]. It became a popular tool with search results served by the [[Inktomi (company)|Inktomi]] database and directory results provided originally by [[LookSmart]] and then [[DMOZ]] since mid-1999. Hotbot also used search data from Direct Hit for a period, which was a tool that used click-through data to manipulate results. It was launched using a "new links" strategy of marketing, claiming to update its search database more often than its competitors. It also offered free webpage hosting, but only for a short time, and it was taken down without any notice to its users. It was one of the first search engines to offer the ability to search within search results.

[[Lycos]] acquired HotBot as part of its acquisition of Wired in 1998 and thereafter HotBot languished with limited development and falling market share. At the end of 2002 HotBot was relaunched as a multiple option search tool, giving users the option to search either the [[Fast Search &amp; Transfer|FAST]], [[Google]], [[Inktomi (company)|Inktomi]] or [[Teoma]] databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websearchworkshop.co.uk/hotbot_history.php  HotBot: A brief history of the HotBot search engine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 2011, the HotBot website was merely a [[Front and back ends|front end]] for three third-party search engines ([[Yahoo.com]], [[MSN Search|MSN]], and lyGo.com). In July 2011, HotBot was relaunched with a new robot-like mascot, a new logo, and a modern site design. In the beta, HotBot became a portal, returning not just web search results, but also searches from various Lycos websites, such as News, Shopping and [[Weather Zombie]]. The portal interface lasted for roughly six months, and these features were instead reincorporated into the 2012 Lycos website redesign, returning HotBot to a simplified search interface.

In October 2016, Lycos sold the Hotbot.com domain name for $155,000 to an unnamed buyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://domainnamewire.com/2016/10/04/lycos-sells-hotbot-com-155000/ | title=Lycos sells HotBot.com for $155,000 | first=ANDREW | last=ALLEMANN | publisher=Domain Name Wire | date=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toolbar launch in 2004==
In early 2004, Lycos launched a beta release of a free toolbar search product, Lycos HotBot DeskTop, which the company said was "the first product to integrate traditional desktop search with Web search within the browser." The HotBot DeskTop could search the Internet using Inktomi, e-mail folders for [[Microsoft Outlook]] or [[Outlook Express]], and user documents stored on a hard drive. It also incorporated a blocker for pop-up ads and an RSS News Reader syndication. Indexes created to track e-mail and user files remained stored locally to protect user privacy. Text-based ads were displayed when viewing results for several types of Internet searches. Lycos licensed [[DtSearch Corp.|dtSearch]] technology to power the local search options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbreader.asp?ArticleID=16488  Lycos HotBot Offers Free DeskTop Toolbar - March, 2004 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12072">[[File:North Korea — Pyongyang Opera.jpg|thumb|An opera performance in [[Pyongyang]]]]

'''Korean revolutionary opera''' is a tradition of [[revolutionary opera]] in [[North Korea]] based on that of [[China]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. It is characterized by a highly melodramatic style and reoccurring themes of [[Korean nationalism]] and glorification of [[socialism]], the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]], and the working people, as well as a focus on [[socialist realism|socialist realist]] themes. Composers of North Korean revolutionary opera are employed by the [[North Korean government]] and the fundamental principles of North Korean revolutionary opera were dictated by [[Kim Jong-Il]] in his speech (later transcribed to book) ''On the Art of Opera''.

==History==

North Korean revolutionary opera was preceded by the spread of [[juche]] propaganda songs that praised [[Kim Il-Sung]] and the nation, which itself replaced [[p'ansori]] – traditional Korean theatrical song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Yongmin|title=Musical Performance of Korean Identities in North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the United States|issue=University of Southern California, (thesis)|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean revolutionary opera was highly influenced by the original form of revolutionary opera developed as part of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, including such works as ''Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy'' and ''The Legend of the Red Lantern''. North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West writes that "Three of the alleged North Korean innovations in its national socialist realist musical theater are dynamic three-dimensional stage settings, stanzaic songs based on peasant-folk music, and pangchang (an off-stage singing chorus), which in anti–Brechtian fashion constructs emotional links between character and spectator and controls the audience's interpretation of events. These appear in Maoist revolutionary opera".&lt;ref&gt;David-West, A. (2006). "Nationalist Allegory in North Korea: The Revolutionary Opera ''Sea of Blood''". ''North Korean Review'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, North Korean revolutionary opera differed in several ways, most notably in its use of traditional Korean instruments alongside Western orchestral ones, and its permitting the display of romantic love and supernatural or magical elements, both of which were banned in Cultural Revolution-era China.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Melvin, "North Korean Opera Draws Acclaim in China", ''New York Times'' (online), retrieved 2015-11-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The first revolutionary opera in North Korea, ''[[Sea of Blood]]'', was premiered at the [[Pyongyang Grand Theatre]] in July 1971, with Kim Il-Sung credited as the author and Kim Jong-Il credited as producer.&lt;ref&gt;David-West, 76&lt;/ref&gt; The opera is seen as the primary example of North Korean revolutionary opera, with many North Korean texts referring to revolutionary opera as "Sea of Blood-style" opera. Sea of Blood was adapted from a 1969 film of the same name. Kim Il-Sung claimed to have written it with his comrades in a [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) guerilla unit while fighting against the Japanese in occupied [[Manchuria]], and performed it on a makeshift stage in a recently liberated village as a form of anti-colonial [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name="David-West, 78"&gt;David-West, 78&lt;/ref&gt; However, the veracity of this claim is disputed due to the difficulty of finding accurate information about Kim Il-Sung's early life and guerilla career.

Sea of Blood was followed by the rest of the "Five Great Revolutionary Operas": ''[[The Flower Girl]]'', ''Tell O' the Forest!'', ''A True Daughter of the Party'', and ''The Song of Mount Kumgang''.The five plays have been performed consistently at the Pyongyang Grand Theatre since their respective debuts, with Sea of Blood and The Flower Girl both having been performed over 1,000 times each.

Revolutionary opera flourished in North Korea as Kim Jong-Il began to take charge of many aspects of the country, particularly its arts and propaganda programs. In September 1974, Kim Jong-Il gave a "Talk to Creative Workers in the Field of Art and Literature" entitled "On the Art of Opera", in which he described the most important principles of North Korean opera according to the regime. According to Kim, because opera combines music, dance, poetry, and theatre, it "constitutes a criterion for evaluating the level of a country".&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;{{cite book|last1=Il|first1=Kim-Jong|title=On the Art of Opera|date=2001|publisher=University Press of the Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good revolutionary opera must reflect the time it was produced in, and be guided "strictly by revolutionary principles".&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 4&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary opera must also be emotionally affecting to the audience and be composed of beautifully poetic words and music.

New operas modeled after the five great revolutionary operas are continuing to be produced in North Korea. The operas have been performed outside of North Korea, with ''Sea of Blood'' and ''The Flower Girl'' gaining widespread popularity in China. ''Sea of Blood'' was performed on a two-month tour of China in May to July 2010, with many of the performances selling out.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin, retrieved 11-15-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==

The writers, actors, and directors of North Korean revolutionary opera, under the guiding hands of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, were instructed to produce an opera that was distinctly North Korean and distinctly different than previous forms of opera. According to Kim Jong-Il, "The operatic style of feudalism or capitalism cannot serve the creation of operas for the working class who are now building socialism and communism, nor can the imitation of foreign things help in producing operas that cater to the aesthetic tastes and feelings of our people".&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korean revolutionary opera, being a form of [[socialist realism]], deals near-exclusively in political subject matter, extolling the virtues of the working [[proletariat]], the glory of the communist struggle, and the greatness of the Kim dynasty. Most are set in the formative period of the DPRK – either the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] or the Korean War. The songs of North Korean revolutionary opera, unlike those of Western opera, are stanzaic in form, with main melodies often being repeated. This is in keeping with the aims of North Korean opera to be "a true art for the people",&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 42&lt;/ref&gt; as Kim Jong-Il states in On the Art of Opera. In order for opera to be able to reach the maximum number of people, throughout all of North Korea and beyond, the songs must be memorable and easily repeated, "composed in such a way that anybody can understand and sing", according to Kim.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Also central to North Korean revolutionary opera is the ''pangchang'', or off-stage song, describing the situation of the characters and their innermost thoughts and feelings. For example, in ''Sea of Blood'', the pangchang "The Mother Learns to Read and Write" is sung from offstage as the actor playing the mother is onstage performing the actions described. The song comments on the action and sings the praises of the mother as an ideal communist and North Korean heroine. Kim Jong-Il describes the pangchang as "a powerful means of portrayal not present in the operas of the past",&lt;ref&gt;Kim, 10&lt;/ref&gt; but the originality of the pangchang is disputed, as scholars such as Alzo David-West have found similar innovations in Maoist revolutionary opera, as well as an obvious precedent in the chorus in classical Greek tragedy.&lt;ref name="David-West, 78"/&gt;

North Korean revolutionary opera makes heavy use of [[dance]] as well as singing, with performances often incorporating elaborate dances in the most important scenes to show both the action onstage and the characters' feelings. These dances are typically based on a long tradition of [[Korean folk dance]], one of the few examples of a folk tradition that has remained relatively intact since the formation of the DPRK.

[[Theatrical scenery|Sets]] and backdrops must be realistic and three-dimensional, and are typically lavish and elaborate, eschewing abstraction for reproduction of real life elements. However, sets must not only be a realistic approximation of the location, but also "describe the personality of the character living and working in that society", according to ''On the Art of Opera''.&lt;ref&gt;Kim,79&lt;/ref&gt; The same principles are applied to [[makeup]], [[Theatrical property|props]], and [[costume|costuming]].

North Korean revolutionary opera is typically performed with a mix of Western classical instruments and [[traditional Korean instruments]], a style christened the "combined orchestra" (''paehap kwanhydnak'').&lt;ref&gt;Yu,101&lt;/ref&gt; In this, it is important that Korean instruments take precedence over Western ones, in order to ensure a distinctly Korean opera and to stay aligned with the values of the juche ideology.

==The Five Great Revolutionary Operas==

=== ''Sea of Blood''===
{{Main|Sea of Blood}}
The most famous North Korean revolutionary opera, ''[[Sea of Blood]]'' dramatizes the struggle of a Korean mother and her family in Japanese-occupied Manchuria in the 1930s, where Kim Il-Sung was a guerilla fighter. The family is subject to many horrors under the Japanese regime, before they finally join the Communist revolution and destroy their oppressors. The title refers to the actions of the Japanese army which the hero describes as having "turned the country into the sea of blood".&lt;ref name="North Korea's Revolutionary Operas"&gt;{{cite web|title=North Korea's Revolutionary Operas|url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2009/04/22/north-koreas-revolutionary-operas/|website=North Korean Economy Watch|accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Flower Girl''===
{{Main|The Flower Girl}}
''[[The Flower Girl]]'' is also set during the Japanese occupation in the 1930s, though in Korea itself, not Manchuria. It tells the story of a poor flower-seller and her struggle against a greedy landlord, who is eventually overthrown by the people. It was also made into film.

===''Tell O' The Forest''===
''{{ill|Tell O' The Forest!|ko|밀림아 이야기하라}}'' is the story of Choe Byong Hung, a revolutionary who pretends to serve the Japanese during the occupation, but suffers the anger of the people of his village, who find his deception too convincing. His daughter commits suicide due to the shame of being "daughter of the puppet village head", after which Choe lures the Japanese forces into a trap in which he too perishes. 

Tell O' The Forest was criticized by Kim Jong-Il in ''On the Art of Opera'' for having the hero die before witnessing the moment of victory, as well as sticking to the "outmoded pattern" of using exclusively song, not a mixture of song and speech.&lt;ref&gt;Kim,35&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A True Daughter of the Party''===
''{{ill|A True Daughter of the Party|ko|당의 참된 딸}}'' is set during the Korean War, and follows Nurse Kang Yong Ok, a nurse and woman soldier against the American forces under the banner of the [[Korean People's Army]]. The main theme, "Dear General, Where Are You", is a paean to General Kim Il-Sung. (Kim Jong-Il himself composed the piece.)

===''The Song of Mount Kumgang''===
Again set during and after the Japanese occupation, ''{{ill|The Song of Mount Kumgang|ko|금강산의 노래}}'' tells the story of a family separated during the occupation who reunite twenty years later and live a joyful life under the new communist system. According to the DPRK description, "The opera represents the transformation of the mountain area, once worthless under the Japanese oppression, into the people's paradise through the portrayal of the local girls' joyful life and the hero Hwang's personal experience".&lt;ref name="North Korea's Revolutionary Operas"/&gt;

The '''''Leyenda de Azul''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "the Blue Legend") is a [[lucha libre]] [[tournament]] held seven times by the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) between 2000 and 2008 and again in 2011 and 2012. The tournament honors [[Blue Demon]], or ''Demonio Azul'' as he's sometimes referred to. The tournament is not nearly as prestigious as CMLL's annual ''[[Leyenda de Plata]]'' tournament. The winner is given a plaque with a Blue Demon mask on it and a championship belt featuring Blue Demon as well. All tournaments have taken place in [[Arena México]] in [[Mexico City]] and all were held on Fridays during CMLL's [[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]] show. In 2009 [[Blue Demon Jr.]] threatened to take legal action against CMLL on behalf of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] over CMLL's use of three NWA branded championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.record.com.mx/tmf/demon-desconoce-fajines-del-cmll-03032010.html | title= Demon desconoce fajines CMLL de Texano y Averno | author=Cáliz, David | date= March 3, 2010 | publisher= Record.com.mx | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CMLL did not publicly respond to the threat they dropped the tournament from their schedule for two years. In July 2011, CMLL, still not on good terms with Blue Demon Jr., announced the return of the tournament. The tournament would instead be endorsed by Blue Demon's biological son and Blue Demon Jr.'s adopted brother, El Hijo de Blue Demon.

The first ''Leyenda de Azul'' tournament took place on October 27, 2000, just 21 days after the 2000 version of the ''Leyenda de Plata'' tournament. 16 men competed in a ''[[Torneo cibernetico]]'' match for the trophy. Only the second half of the match was shown on television, which means that the order of the first eight eliminations is only known to the people in attendance at [[Arena México]] that night. The first eight are listed alphabetically. During the match [[Máscara Año 2000]] allowed himself to get pinned by [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] while he himself had Shocker pinned to ensure that Shocker was eliminated from the tournament.

CMLL did not hold a ''Leyenda de Azul'' in 2001 or 2002 but did promote the tournament in 2003. Like the first ''Leyenda de Azul'', the second version also centered around a 16-man ''Torneo cibernetico'' match. The match came down to [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]] and [[Tarzan Boy (wrestler)|Tarzan Boy]], at the time both mid-card wrestlers hoping to move into the main event picture. Tarzan Boy pinned Shocker to win the 2003 ''Leyenda de Azul'' trophy.&lt;ref name=Azul2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=LeyendaAzul2003&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2003 | work = Super Luchas | id = issue 40 | date = January 5, 2003 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third ''Leyenda de Azul'' tournament took place on October 8, 2004 and like the two previous ''Leyenda de Azul'' tournaments featured a 16-man ''torneo cibernetico''. The final two wrestlers in the match were [[Canek (wrestler)|Canek]] and [[Universo 2000]]. Universo 2000 pinned Canek to win the tournament, gaining a small measure of revenge on the man that beat him for his mask only three weeks prior at  the [[CMLL 71st Anniversary Show]].&lt;ref name=Azul2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=LeyendaAzul2004&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004 | work = Super Luchas | id = issue 91 | date = January 24, 2005 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth ''Leyenda de Azul'' took place on July 15, 2005. Unlike previous years' tournaments CMLL did not use the ''torneo cibernetico'' format but instead opted for a 16-man, one night tournament to take place on the July 15, 2005 [[CMLL Super Viernes]] show. The winner of the tournament would also be considered the first CMLL World G1 Heavyweight Champion and win a place in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s (NJPW) upcoming [[G1 Climax]] tour in August, 2005. While it was never confirmed officially it is believed that NJPW actually decided who they wanted to tour with them and thus who won the tournament. The final match saw [[Lizmark Jr.]] pin [[Último Guerrero]] to earn both the ''Leyenda de Azul'' trophy and the CMLL World G1 Heavyweight Champion. The G1 championship was never referred to again after July 15, 2005, not even when Lizmark Jr. competed in NJPW.&lt;ref name=Azul2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=LeyendaAzul2005&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = 2005 Lo Mejor de la Lucha Mexicana | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 140 | date =  January 3, 2006 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMLL used the same tournament format as the previous year as they had the winner of the first and the last match of the first round face off in the finals.

{{History of China}}
[[File:Beijing students protesting the Treaty of Versailles (May 4, 1919).jpg|thumb|300px|Students in Beijing rallied during the May Fourth Movement.]]
The '''May  Fourth Movement''' ({{zh|t=五四运动|p=Wǔsì Yùndòng}}) was an [[anti-imperialist]], cultural, and political movement growing out of student participants  in Beijing on 4 May 1919, protesting against the Chinese government's weak response to the [[Treaty of Versailles]], especially allowing Japan to [[Shandong Problem|receive territories in Shandong]] which had been surrendered by [[German Empire|Germany]] after the [[Siege of Tsingtao]]. These demonstrations sparked national protests and marked the upsurge of [[Chinese nationalism]], a shift towards political mobilization and away from cultural activities, and a move towards a populist base rather than intellectual elites. Many political and social leaders of the next decades emerged at this time.

The term "May  Fourth Movement" in a broader sense often refers to the period during 1915&amp;ndash;1921 more often called the [[New Culture Movement]].

==Background==

"The atmosphere and political mood that emerged around 1919," in the words of Mitter (2004), "are at the centre of a set of ideas that has shaped China's momentous twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Mitter, R. ''A Bitter Revolution: China's Struggle with the Modern World'' (2004), p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, the [[Qing Dynasty]] disintegrated. This marked the end of thousands of years of powerful imperial rule, and theoretically ushered a new era in which political power rested with the people. However, the reality was that China was a fragmented nation dominated by [[warlord era|warlords]], who were more concerned with their own political powers and private armies than national interests.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge International AS Level International History 1871-1945 Coursebook'', Phil Wadsworth, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chinese [[Beiyang government]] was occupied with suppressing internal affairs and did little to counter the influence exerted by foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;Rana Mitter. ''A Bitter Revolution: China's Struggle with the Modern World.'' (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press,  2004), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[March 1st Movement]] that happened in Korea (1919), the Russian revolution (1917), defeats by foreign powers and the presence of [[spheres of influence]] inflamed a sense of nationalism among the emerging middle class and cultural leaders{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Leaders of the [[New Culture Movement]] believed that traditional Confucian values were responsible for the political weakness of the nation{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Chinese nationalists called for a rejection of traditional values and the selective adoption of Western ideals of "Mr. Science" ({{zh|t=賽先生|s=赛先生|p=sài xiānsheng|labels=no|first=t}}) and "Mr. Democrat" ({{zh|c=德先生|p=dé xiānsheng|labels=no}}) in order to strengthen the new nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence. ''The Gate of Heavenly Peace: The Chinese and Their Revolution, 1895-1980.'' (New York: Viking Press,  1981), pp. 117-123 ff..&lt;/ref&gt; These iconoclastic and anti-traditional views and programs have shaped China's politics and culture down to the present.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Chinese". John King Fairbank, Denis Crispin Twitchett, p.451&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shandong Problem==
{{Main|Shandong Problem}}

China had entered World War I on the side of the Allied [[Triple Entente]] in 1917 with the condition that all [[German Empire|German]] spheres of influence, such as [[Shandong]], would be returned to China. Although in that year 140,000 Chinese labourers (as a part of the [[British army]], the [[Chinese Labour Corps]]) were sent to France,&lt;ref&gt;Guoqi Xu. ''Strangers on the Western Front: Chinese Workers in the Great War.'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press,  2011. {{ISBN|9780674049994}}), pp. 1-9, and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Versailles Treaty]] of April 1919 awarded German rights in [[Shandong Province]] to Japan.
The representatives of the Chinese government put forth the following requests:
# abolition of all privileges of foreign powers in China, such as [[extraterritoriality]]
# cancelling of the "[[Twenty-One Demands]]" with the Japanese
# return to China of the territory and rights of [[Shandong]], which Japan had taken from Germany during World War I.

The Western Allies dominated the meeting at Versailles, and paid little heed to Chinese demands. Britain and France were primarily interested in punishing Germany. Although the United States promoted [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]] and the ideals of [[self-determination]], they were unable to advance these ideals in the face of stubborn resistance by [[David Lloyd George]], [[Georges Clemenceau]] and the U.S. Congress. American advocacy of [[self-determination]] at the [[League of Nations]] was attractive to Chinese intellectuals, but their failure to follow through was seen as a betrayal. Chinese diplomatic failure at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] touched off the May Fourth Movement, and became known as the "[[Shandong Problem]]".

==Days of protest==
On the morning of 4 May 1919, student representatives from thirteen different local universities met in Beijing and drafted five resolutions:

# to oppose the granting of Shandong to the Japanese under former German concessions.
# to draw awareness of China's precarious position to the masses in China.
# to recommend a large-scale gathering in Beijing.
# to promote the creation of a Beijing student union.
# to hold a demonstration that afternoon in protest to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.

[[File:May Fourth Movement students.jpg|thumb|left|Students of [[Beijing Normal University]] who arrested by government at the May Fourth Movement.]]
On the afternoon of May 4 over 3,000 students of [[Peking University]] and other schools marched from many points to gather in front of [[Tiananmen]]. They shouted such slogans as "Struggle for the sovereignty externally, get rid of the national traitors at home", "Do away with the '[[Twenty-One Demands]]'", and "Don't sign the [[Versailles Treaty]]". They voiced their anger at the Allied betrayal of China, denounced the government's spineless inability to protect Chinese interests, and called for a [[boycott of Japanese products]]. Demonstrators insisted on the resignation of three Chinese officials they accused of being collaborators with the Japanese. After burning the residence of one of these officials and beating his servants, student protesters were arrested, jailed, and severely beaten.&lt;ref name="Wasserstrom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wasserstrom|first=Jeffrey N.|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/articles/wpj05-2/wasserstrom.html|title=Chinese Students and Anti-Japanese Protests, Past and Present|publisher=World Policy Journal|accessdate=Nov 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, students in Beijing as a whole went on strike and in the larger cities across China, students, patriotic merchants, and workers joined protests. The demonstrators skillfully appealed to the newspapers and sent representatives to carry the word across the country. From early June, workers and businessmen in Shanghai also went on strike as the center of the movement shifted from Beijing to Shanghai. Chancellors from thirteen universities arranged for the release of student prisoners, and  Cai Yuanpei, the principal of Peking University resigned in protest. Newspapers, magazines, citizen societies, and chambers of commerce offered support for the students. Merchants threatened to withhold tax payments if China's government remained obstinate.&lt;ref name=zhidong&gt;{{cite web|last=Hao|first=Zhidong|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=1&amp;hid=13&amp;sid=475134c9-6106-40e3-8d95-789ecaa0f463%40SRCSM2&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9704243835|title=May&amp;nbsp;4th and June&amp;nbsp;4th Compared: A Sociological Study of Chinese Social Movements|publisher=Journal of Contemporary China|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Shanghai, a general strike of merchants and workers nearly devastated the entire Chinese economy.&lt;ref name="Wasserstrom"/&gt; Under intense public pressure, the Beijing government released the arrested students and dismissed [[Cao Rulin]], [[Zhang Zongxiang]] and [[Lu Zongyu]]. Chinese representatives in Paris refused to sign the peace treaty: the May  Fourth Movement won an initial victory which was primarily symbolic, since Japan for the moment retained control of the Shandong Peninsula and the islands in the Pacific. Even the partial success of the movement exhibited the ability of China's social classes across the country to successfully collaborate given proper motivation and leadership.&lt;ref name="Wasserstrom"/&gt;

==Birth of Chinese communism==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2011}}
For many years, the orthodox view in the People's Republic of China was that after the demonstrations in 1919 and their suppression, the discussion became more and more political. People like [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]] shifted more to the left and were among the leading founders of the 1921 [[Communist Party of China]], whilst other intellectuals, such as the [[anarchist]] writer and agitator, [[Ba Jin]] also took part in the movement. Originally voluntarist or nihilist figures like [[Li Shicen]] and [[Zhu Qianzhi]] made similar turns to the Left as the 1920s saw China become increasingly turbulent.

[[Mao Zedong]] claimed that the May Fourth Movement was a stage leading toward revolution:

{{quote|The May Fourth Movement twenty years ago marked a new stage in China's bourgeois-democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism. The cultural reform movement which grew out of the May Fourth Movement was only one of the manifestations of this revolution. With the growth and development of new social forces in that period, a powerful camp made its appearance in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, a camp consisting of the working class, the student masses and the new national bourgeoisie. Around the time of the May Fourth Movement, hundreds of thousands of students courageously took their place in the van. In these respects the May Fourth Movement went a step beyond the Revolution of 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/mswv2_13.htm The May Fourth Movement (May 1939)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The May  Fourth Movement served as an intellectual turning point in China; it was a seminal event that radicalized Chinese intellectual thought. Western-style liberal democracy had previously had a degree of traction amongst Chinese intellectuals, but after the [[Versailles Treaty]] (which was viewed as a betrayal of China's interests), lost much of its attractiveness. [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], despite being rooted in [[moralism]], were also seen as Western-centric and hypocritical.

Many in the Chinese intellectual community believed that the United States had done little to convince the imperialist powers (especially Britain, France, and Japan) to adhere to the Fourteen Points, and observed that the United States itself had declined to join the [[League of Nations]]; as a result they turned away from the Western liberal democratic model. Marxism began to take hold in Chinese intellectual thought, particularly among those already on the Left. It was during this time that communism was studied seriously by some Chinese intellectuals such as [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]].

==Historical significance==
[[File:Beijing_(November_2016)_-_086.jpg|thumb|right|A monument of the May Fourth Movement in [[Dongcheng District, Beijing|Dongcheng District]], Beijing.]]
Scholars rank the New Culture and May  Fourth Movements as significant turning points, along with the abolition of the civil service system in 1905 and the overthrow of the monarchy in 1911. Participants at the time, such as [[Hu Shi]], referred to this era as the Chinese [[Renaissance]] because there was an intense focus on science and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Hu Shih, ''The Chinese Renaissance: The Haskell Lectures, 1933.'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,  1934).&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenge to traditional Chinese values, however, was also met with strong opposition, especially from the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]]. From their perspective, the movement destroyed the positive elements of Chinese tradition and placed a heavy emphasis on direct political actions and radical attitudes, characteristics associated with the emerging Chinese Communist Party. On the other hand, the Communist Party, whose two founders, Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, were leaders of the movement, viewed it more favorably, although remaining suspicious of the early phase which emphasized the role of enlightened intellectuals, not revolution.&lt;ref name="Schoppa "&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoppa|first=R.Keith|title=Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=177–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its broader sense, the May  Fourth Movement led to the establishment of radical intellectuals who went on to mobilize peasants and workers into the Communist party and gain the organizational strength that would solidify the success of the [[Communist Revolution]].&lt;ref name=zhidong/&gt;

==Criticism and resistance==

Although the Movement was highly influential, many of the intellectuals at the time opposed the anti-traditional message and many political figures ignored it.

[[Chiang Kai-shek]], as a nationalist and Confucianist was against the iconoclasm of the May Fourth Movement. As an anti-imperialist, he was skeptical of western ideas and literature. He and [[Dr. Sun Yat-sen]] criticized these May Fourth intellectuals for corrupting morals of youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc4UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=chiang+may+iconoclastic+nationalist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The May fourth movement in Shanghai: the making of a social movement in modern China|author=Joseph T. Chen|year=1971|publisher=Brill Archive|location=|page=13|isbn=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] party came to power under Chiang's rule, it carried out the opposite agenda. The [[New Life Movement]] promoted Confucianism and the Kuomintang purged China's education system of western ideas, introducing Confucianism into the curriculum. Textbooks, exams, degrees and educational instructors were all controlled by the state, as were all universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Caknr1VAqMC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+communist+saw&amp;q=riding+it+of+western+texts+and+models#v=onepage&amp;q=it%20of%20western%20texts%20and%20models%20confucian&amp;f=false|title=China's communist revolutions: fifty years of the People's Republic of China|author=Werner Draguhn, David S. G. Goodman|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|location=|page=39|isbn=0-7007-1630-0|accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservative philosophers and intellectuals opposed any change, but many more accepted or welcomed the challenge from the West but wanted to base new systems on Chinese values, not imported ones.

==Neotraditionalism vs. Western thought==
Although the May Fourth Movement did find partial success in removing [[Culture of China|Chinese]] traditional culture,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} there were still proponents who steadfastly argued that China's traditions and values should be the fundamental foundation of the nation. From these opponents of [[western world|Western civilization]] derived three neotraditional schools of thought: national essence, national character, and modern relevance of [[Confucianism]]. Each school of thought denounced the western values of individualism, materialism and utilitarianism as inadequate avenues for the development of China. Each school held to specific objectives. The "national essence" school sought to discover aspects of traditional culture that could potentially serve the national development of China. Such traditional aspects consisted of various philosophical and religious practices that emerged parallel with Confucianism. Most particularly, China imported [[Buddhism]], a religion from their neighboring countries, India and Nepal. Under the "national character" school, advocates promoted the traditional family system, the primary target of the May  Fourth Movement.  In this school, reformers viewed Westerners as shells without morals. Finally, the modern relevance of Confucianism was centered on the notion that Confucian values were better than Western ones. In response to western culture's primary concentration on rational analysis, China's neotraditionalists argued that this  was misguided, especially in the practical, changing milieu of the world. Most importantly, these three neo-traditionalist thoughts gave no consideration to the individual, which was the main theme of the May  Fourth Movement.&lt;ref name="Schoppa " /&gt;

[[File:Pony Ride (6832505962).jpg|thumb|A small child being hand-led on a pony, with two adults, one handling the pony, and the other watching the child]]
A '''pony ride''' is an opportunity for children to ride real [[pony|ponies]] for a short time, usually seen at [[fair]]s, [[guest ranch]]es, [[zoo]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiazoo.org/Explore/Attractions/Pony-Rides.htm|title=Pony Rides|website=Philadelphia Zoo|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; summer camps, private [[Children's party|children's parties]] and similar places.  Children on pony rides do not handle the pony themselves, but they need to be old enough to sit up straight and hold their head up without support.  Pony rides may be given on individually hand-led ponies, or in a group of ponies, usually four to six, placed on a "pony wheel," a small type of [[hot walker]] that leads all ponies in a walk on a small circle so that fewer handlers are needed.  Safety is a paramount concern and insurance companies consider pony rides to be a high-risk activity. There are concerns about the [[animal welfare|welfare]] of some ponies used for pony rides.

==Types of ponies==
Ponies for younger children generally are under {{hands|14}},&lt;ref name=AEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanequestrian.com/Safety-Group-Guidelines-AEA.htm|title=Safety Group Guidelines|website=American Equestrian Alliance |accessdate=August 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and often much smaller.  A rule of thumb is that the legs of the child should reach at least halfway down the sides of the pony.&lt;ref name=Liestman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safeagritourism.org/wp-content/uploads/starting_handled_pony.pdf|last=Liestman|first=Linda|title=Starting a Hand-Led Pony Ride Business|website=safeagritourism.org|accessdate=August 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shetland pony]] is a [[horse breed|breed]] often used for pony rides.&lt;ref name=Frontier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontiersman.com/valley_life/pony-wheel-ranch-closes/article_4b25f178-fd70-5758-9a78-c27fd4d0b9d4.html|title=Pony Wheel Ranch Closes|publisher=Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman|date=June 12, 2007|accessdate=August 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Best practices advise that ponies be at least {{frac|4|1|2}} years old.  [[Stallions]] are not appropriate for pony rides, and when [[mare]]s are used, they should not work while they are in [[estrus|heat]].&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt;

==Children ages and sizes==
Recommendations vary with the size of the pony, but children who participate in pony rides need to be able to sit up and hold their head up without support, thus children under the age of one are too small to safely ride ponies.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  Best practices are that children be at least three years old,&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt; but some reputable programs accept children age two and up.&lt;ref name=Disney&gt;{{cite web|url=https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/recreation/campsites-at-fort-wilderness-resort/pony-rides/|title=Pony Rides|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum size of riders usually correlates to the size of the pony, but standards range from under {{convert|80|lb}}&lt;ref name=Disney/&gt; to about {{convert|100|lb}}.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  Weight, not age, usually limits the biggest riders, but some programs require participants to be no older than 12.&lt;ref name=KHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyhorsepark.com/equine-theme-park/attractions/horseback-trail-pony-rides|website=Kentucky Horse Park|title=Horseback Trail &amp; Pony Rides|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Pony rides are considered a high risk equine activity.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  Pony ride operators are generally advised to carry liability insurance and to hire staff who are experienced with horses. [[Equestrian helmet]]s are mandated by law for children in some places,&lt;ref name=agritourism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agritourismideas.com/#!Agritourism-Pony-Ride-Safety-Strategy/c1sbz/57502d440cf2d6ecdf988fc1|title=Pony Ride Safety Strategy|website=Agritourism Ideas|accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their use for all children is considered a [[best practices|best practice]].&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt;   Staff should have first aid certification and be covered by [[workers' compensation]] insurance.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;

The safest method for in-hand pony rides is to have two people with each child, one on either side of the pony, similar to the methods used for [[therapeutic horseback riding]].&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  Trained staff should handle the pony, help the child get on and off the pony, and be sure equipment is properly adjusted.  Most parents should not be asked to handle the pony,&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt;  because parents usually lack horse experience and knowledge.  That said, where a second person is used as a "spotter" to help balance the child, a parent can fill that role, so long as they are healthy enough to keep up with the pony and able to remain calm around the animal.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;

A pony wheel eliminates the need for a separate person to lead each pony, but a parent or other spotter can still walk beside the animal to help steady the child. Other methods of controlling the pony with a child on board, such as  [[ponying]] from another horse or riding double are generally considered unsafe.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;

Modern standards state that children are never to be belted or strapped onto ponies.&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt; It was once common for children to be belted to the saddle by velcro or leather straps on pony wheel rides, though this was never considered a safe practice for in-hand pony rides. Safety studies conducted in 1999 led to recommendations that children not be belted onto ponies in any setting.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;   [[Stirrup]]s, when used, need to be adjusted to fit each child.&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt;

===Enclosures===
Pony rides need to be conducted in an enclosed area to help contain a pony that might escape and to give the pony a visual boundary. Low or flimsy fencing is not a best practice.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  Welded pipe panels are considered safe for portable fencing, such as at fairs.&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt; Settings with permanent pony rides that put up wooden fences need rails or planks to be placed on the inside of the fenceposts so that children do not hit their legs and feet on the posts.&lt;ref name=agritourism/&gt;

==Training and equipment==
Ponies used for pony rides need to be quiet, well-trained, and desensitized to children, noise, and crowds.&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  At fairs in particular, ponies are exposed to loud noises and traffic.&lt;ref name=Frontier/&gt;

Ponies are usually given [[western saddle]]s for children's rides because they are less likely to slip and children can hang onto the saddle horn. Straps or loops should not be added to the saddle because children's hands can be caught in them.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  Saddles need to be properly fitted to the pony for its welfare and comfort.&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt;  [[Stirrup]]s, when used, should be wider than for regular riding to help prevent children's feet from getting caught, particularly because many children who take pony rides are wearing [[sneakers]] instead of boots.  [[Tapadero]]s over the stirrups can help prevent a foot from going all the say through the stirrup and getting trapped, but only if properly designed so a child's foot doesn't get wedged between the tapadero and the front of the stirrup.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;

To protect the pony's mouth, and because ponies are led rather than having the child control the pony directly, a [[halter]] or [[caveson]] is used, rather than a [[bit (horse)|bit]] and [[bridle]].&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  [[Side reins]] are not advised for pony rides.&lt;ref name=AEA/&gt; On hand-led rides, leading with a [[choke chain#Aversive collars|dog obedience chain]] added around the nose as a [[lead shank]] for safety and extra control is recommended.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;

Pony wheel rides are also sometimes called "carousel" rides.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  Pony wheels are often custom-manufactured.&lt;ref name=Frontier/&gt;  The largest pony wheels can accommodate up to 11 or 12 ponies,&lt;ref name="Van Ort"/&gt; but most accommodate four to six.

Hand-led rides can be held in an area about {{convert|40|x|80|ft}}, which is large enough to move around, but confines the pony in case of problems.  For hand-led rides, a [[mounting block]] or ramp can be used to help children get on and off the pony.&lt;ref name=agritourism/&gt;

==Pony welfare and law==
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] mandates that carnivals that exhibit animals, roadside zoos and many similar programs be licensed or registered to operate under the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] of 1966, 7 U.S.C. § 2131 et seq., which protects animals not raised for food or fiber.&lt;ref name="APHIS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Licensing and Registration Under the Animal Welfare Act|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/aw/awlicreg.pdf|website=United States Department of Agriculture  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act requires that animals have "adequate housing, sanitation, nutrition, water and veterinary care, and ... [protection] from extreme weather and temperatures."&lt;ref name="USDA APHIS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Welfare Act|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/sa_awa/ct_awa_program_information|website=USDA APHIS|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There also has to be an adequate number of handlers.   While horse and pony rides can sometimes be exempt,&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Welfare Inspection Guide|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/Animal%20Care%20Inspection%20Guide.pdf|website=U.S. Department of Agriculture|accessdate=August 21, 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; because equines are "farm animals" under 9 CFR §1.1, and exhibitors at fairs and [[horse show]]s do not fall within the regulartory definitions,&lt;ref name="9CFR1.1"&gt;{{cite web|title=§1.1   Definitions.|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=1573e570962c47c4cf2b719ba7466cbf&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;mc=true&amp;r=PART&amp;n=pt9.1.1|website=eCFR — Code of Federal Regulations|accessdate=21 August 2016|date=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  if they are part of a petting zoo or carnival, they fall under the statute.&lt;ref name="APHIS"/&gt;

Care for working ponies includes using fly spray in the summer and providing regular access to water.&lt;ref name=agritourism/&gt; There should be good footing for the ponies, such as sand or shavings brought in to put on top of pavement, but a clay lot or grassy area can also be used.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;  Children need basic instructions to not scream or poke at the animals.&lt;ref name="Van Ort"/&gt;  Providing instruction for children to sit up straight and how to hold their legs is a best practice.&lt;ref name=Liestman/&gt;

Some [[animal rights]] advocates oppose pony rides, suggesting that a [[merry-go-round]] is an acceptable substitute.&lt;ref name="Van Ort"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Ort|first1=Cynthia|title=Animal Attraction|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-06-26/features/9406260078_1_petting-zoo-cattle-animals|website=Chicago Tribune|date=June 26, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official position of the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] is "The ASPCA is opposed to the cruelty that is inherent in ... attractions such as elephant rides, camel rides, and llama and pony rides that either stand alone or are attached to [petting zoos]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roadside Zoos|url=http://www.aspca.org/about-us/aspca-policy-and-position-statements/roadside-zoos|website=ASPCA|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerns of animal rights and animal welfare advocates generally concern ponies being subjected to harassment from the public, not getting enough water, and lack of rest.

[[Image:Rallycross SCCA.jpg|right|thumb|A Subaru pictured during a RallyCross competition]]

'''RallyCross''', also known as '''RallyX''', is a type of car competition in the United States and Canada, sanctioned by [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA). It is a timed event that involves solo driving on grass or dirt and can be considered "[[autocross]] on the dirt." As with autocross, the emphasis is on driver skill and handling rather than absolute speed, with frequent corners generally keeping speeds below 60&amp;nbsp;mph (100&amp;nbsp;km/h).  In many ways RallyCross is to [[rally racing]] as autocross is to [[road racing]].

== Influences ==
The American form of RallyCross has many influences.  The name itself implies falsely a close connection with the European [[Rallycross]] format, since 2010 in the United States driven under the tag [[RallyCar U.S. Rallycross]], where up to six cars race side by side on a prepared mixed-terrain circuit.  RallyCross also has close ties to competition stage rally.  It is often looked to as an inexpensive primer for stage competition.  RallyCross is a much safer (due to the lower speeds and closer proximity to aid) and less expensive environment to develop or perfect driving skills that [[World Rally Championship]] or [[Paris-Dakar Rally]] drivers use.

==Events==
===Planning===
SCCA RallyCross events are planned months in advance.  A SCCA RallyCross must be run on a large open piece of ground free of hazardous debris such as large rocks and trees.  Courses are laid out with pylons (cones) and typically are 30–90 seconds in time. Speeds don't see higher than highway speeds and going higher than 2nd gear is a rarity. 
Throughout the day of competition the surface quality is likely to change drastically as gravel or dirt is worn away and ruts are created and deepened or even as snow and ice melt. It is because of these requirements that finding a location for an event is sometimes the most difficult part of event planning.  When a site is chosen and the appropriate paperwork (including sanctioning and insurance) is filled out 
the next step is site preparation.  The site must be further prepared by removing debris and planning the course for race day.

===Working===
On the day of the event the cones that will outline the course are laid out and any last minute adjustments are made.  There are many jobs to be done during the competition itself.  The organizers are responsible for assigning jobs to the appropriate people and seeing that they get done.  Before any of the cars are allowed on course they must go through a technical-safety inspection which is handled by a tech inspector (also known as a [[Auto race workers#Off-track workers|scrutineer]]).  This person must be familiar with how to check the safety of a vehicle (tech inspections do not check for car compliance).  A group of people must also work in timing and scoring, keeping all the day's times straight. The last and most visible job is that of the [[Auto race workers#Duties of Corner workers|corner worker]].  This position is almost always filled by the racers that are not racing during a given heat (round of competition).  Corner workers are in charge of replacing knocked over cones and reporting the penalty to timing and scoring and in some cases may be required to tell a driver to stop in the case of an emergency.

===Scoring===
Often the layout of the course will change throughout the day as the course must move away from dangerous ruts and other obstacles that are formed by the cars during competition.  Each run made on the course could be drastically different than the last for a given driver.  Instead of taking
the best time out of a number of runs, the times for each run are summed together.  Added to this time is an additional 2 seconds for every cone the car hit and 10 seconds for any gate that was missed.  The winner is determined by the lowest combined time.  RallyCross events have one car on course with no wheel to wheel or pass other cars.  This process is similar to the timing for stage rally with individual runs over the same course instead of varying special stages.

==Classes==
SCCA RallyCross events are open to all closed-top production based automobiles that are capable of passing a simple technical inspection.  The vehicles are classed by drive train, modifications allowed, and in some cases power.  The SCCA’s guidelines for vehicle classification are as follows:

===Stock===
This category is for cars that are nearly stock with very few upgrade allowances.  A [[cat-back]] exhaust and the replacement of consumable items, such as tires and brake pads with street legal replacements, are allowed.  The category is further broken down into:
{| class="wikitable"
| SR
| Stock Rear Wheel Drive
|-
| SF
| Stock Front Wheel Drive
|-
| SA
| Stock All Wheel Drive
|}

===Prepared===
Prepared is the category above Rally Stock.  All Rally Stock modifications are allowed with the addition of more modification allowances to the suspension as well as the intake and exhaust.  Any type and size of wheels and tires are allowed in this category.  Prepared is broken down further into:
{| class="wikitable"
| PR
| Prepared Rear Wheel Drive
|-
| PF
| Prepared Front Wheel Drive
|-
| PA
| Prepared All Wheel Drive
|}

===Modified===
This category covers all vehicles not in the other two.  In 2012 the former Modified 2WD class was split into Modified RWD and Modified FWD, though some regions still use the old M2 classing. Modifications are fairly unrestricted, allowing for any suspension (including any changes in suspension geometry) and the use of any internal combustion engine.  Any [[race car log book|log booked]] race car falls under this category.  With these allowances this open class is the most competitive class in RallyCross.  The category is divided into:
{| class="wikitable"
| MR
| Modified Rear Wheel Drive
|-
| MF
|  Modified Front Wheel Drive
|-
| MA
| Modified All Wheel Drive
|}

==SCCA future plans==
{{update|section|date=July 2014}}
2014 Saw its 10th year of National level competition and its 8th National Championship in Greenwood, NE. 2015 will see the 9th National Championship being held at the site of the National Balloon Classic in Indianola, IA. 
2007 marked the formation of The RallyCross National Challenge Series and RallyCross National Championship.  This is the most structure that has been brought to SCCA RallyCross since its birth.  The inaugural championship is scheduled for October at Motorsports Park Hastings in Nebraska.  The national championship brings with it divisional championships as well as a points format.  It seems that the SCCA has intentions of keeping and expanding RallyCross for future seasons.

The 2010 SCCA RallyCross National Championship was  held August 20–22 in Fountain, CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scca.com/event.aspx?hub=2&amp;event=16211 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212035735/http://www.scca.com/event.aspx?hub=2&amp;event=16211 |archivedate=2010-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Seven Years' War''' was a [[global conflict]] fought between 1756 and 1763. It involved every European [[great power]] of the time and spanned five continents, affecting Europe, the Americas, West Africa, [[India]], and the Philippines. The conflict split Europe into two coalitions, led by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] (including [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]], and other small German states) on one side and the [[Kingdom of France]] (including the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian-led Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]] (until 1762), [[Bourbon Spain]], and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]]) on the other. Meanwhile, in India, some regional polities within the increasingly fragmented [[Mughal Empire]], with the support of the French, tried to crush a British attempt to conquer [[Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad|Bengal]]. The war's extent has led some historians to describe it as "World War Zero", similar in scale to other [[world war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/07/economist-explains|title=Why the first world war wasn’t really|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun with what became the [[French and Indian War]] in 1754, the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria's desire to recover [[Silesia]] from the Prussians. Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain's and Prussia's ever-growing might, France and Austria put aside their [[French–Habsburg relations|ancient rivalry]] to form a grand coalition of their own, bringing most of the other European powers to their side. Faced with this sudden turn of events, Britain aligned itself with Prussia, in a series of political manoeuvres known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]]. However, French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed, and Britain's rise as among the world's [[superpower|predominant powers]] destroyed France's supremacy in Europe, thus altering the [[European balance of power]].

== Summary ==
Conflict between Great Britain and France broke out in 1754–1756 when the British attacked disputed French positions in North America, starting with a British ambush of a small French force at the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] on 28 May 1754, and extended across the colonial boundaries and the seizure of hundreds of French merchant ships at sea. Meanwhile, rising power Prussia was struggling with [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] for dominance within and outside the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in central Europe. In 1756, the major powers "[[Diplomatic Revolution|switched partners]]".

Realising that war was imminent, Prussia pre-emptively struck [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and quickly [[Siege of Pirna|overran]] it. The result caused uproar across Europe. Because of Austria's [[Treaty of Versailles (1756)|alliance with France]] to recapture [[Silesia]], which had been lost in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Prussia formed an [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|alliance with Britain]]. Reluctantly, by following the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial diet]], which [[Reichskrieg|declared war on Prussia]] on 17 January 1757, most of the states of the empire joined Austria's cause. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]] (especially the [[Electorate of Hanover]]). [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], seeking to re-gain Pomerania (most of which had been lost to Prussia in previous wars) joined the coalition, seeing its chance when all the major powers of Europe opposed Prussia. [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], bound by the [[Pacte de Famille]], intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an utterly unsuccessful [[Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)|invasion of Portugal]] in 1762. The [[Russian Empire]] was originally aligned with Austria, fearing Prussia's ambition on the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] in 1762.
 
Many middle and small powers in Europe, as in the previous wars, tried to steer clear away from the escalating conflict, even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents. [[Denmark–Norway]], for instance, was close to being dragged into the war on France's side when [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] became Russian emperor and switched sides; Dano-Norwegian and Russian armies were close to ending up in battle, but the Russian emperor was deposed before war formally broke out. The [[Dutch Republic]], a long-time British ally, kept its neutrality intact, fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe, and even [[Battle of Chinsurah|tried to prevent]] Britain's domination in India. [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Savoy]], although sided with the Franco-Spanish alliance, declined to join the coalition under fear of British naval power. The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship, being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] in 1759 to complete her addition to the [[Winter Palace]]. Like Sweden, Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia.
 
The war ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] between France, Spain and Great Britain and the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]] between Saxony, Austria and Prussia, in 1763.
 
The war was successful for Great Britain, which gained the bulk of [[New France]] in North America, [[Spanish Florida]], some individual [[Caribbean]] islands in the [[West Indies]], the colony of [[Senegal]] on the West African coast, and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American tribes]] were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as [[Pontiac's War]], which was a small scale war between the indigenous tribe known as the [[Odawas]] and the English, where the Odawas claimed seven of the ten forts created or taken by the English to show them that they need to distribute land equally amongst their allies, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status. In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but with a combination of good luck and successful strategy, King [[Frederick the Great]] managed to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''. Prussia emerged as a new European great power. Although Austria failed to retrieve the territory of Silesia from Prussia (its original goal), its military prowess was also noted by the other powers. The involvement of Portugal, Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle. Spain lost Florida but gained [[French Louisiana]] and regained control of its colonies, e.g., [[History of Cuba|Cuba]] and [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|the Philippines]], which had been captured by the British during the war. France and Spain avenged their defeat during the [[American Revolutionary War]], with hopes of destroying Britain's dominance once and for all.

The Seven Years' War was perhaps the first true world war, having taken place almost 160 years before [[World War I]] and influenced many major events later around the globe. The war restructured not only the European political order, but also affected events all around the world, paving the way for the beginning of [[Pax Britannica|later British world supremacy]] in the 19th century, the rise of Prussia in Germany (eventually replacing Austria as the leading German State), the beginning of [[American Revolution|tensions in British North America]], as well as a clear sign of [[French Revolution|France's eventual turmoil]]. It was characterised in Europe by sieges and the arson of towns as well as open battles with heavy losses.

== Nomenclature ==
In the historiography of some countries, the war is named after combatants in its respective theatres. In the present-day United States — at the time, the southern English-speaking British colonies in North America — the conflict is known as the '''[[French and Indian War]]''' (1754–1763). In English-speaking Canada — the balance of Britain's former North American colonies — it is called the '''Seven Years' War''' (1756–1763). In French-speaking Canada, it is known as ''La guerre de la Conquête'' (the '''War of the Conquest'''). Swedish historiography uses the name ''Pommerska kriget'' ('''[[Pomeranian War]]'''), as the Sweden–Prussian involvement in 1757–1762 was limited to [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]] in northern central Germany.&lt;ref name=fuessel7&gt;Füssel (2010), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''[[Third Silesian War]]''' involved Prussia and Austria (1756–1763). On the Indian subcontinent, the conflict is called the [[Carnatic Wars|'''Third Carnatic War''']] (1757–1763).

The war has been described as the first "[[world war]]",&lt;ref name="Bowen 1998 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=HV|year=1998|title=War and British Society 1688–1815|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|isbn=0-521-57645-8|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this label was also given to various earlier conflicts like the [[Eighty Years' War]], the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], and to later conflicts like the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The term "[[Second Hundred Years' War]]" has been used in order to describe the almost continuous level of worldwide conflict between France and Great Britain during the entire 18th century, reminiscent of the [[Hundred Years' War]] of the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tombs, Robert and Isabelle.

In the [[War of the Austrian Succession]],&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; which lasted from 1740 to 1748, King [[Frederick&amp;nbsp;II of Prussia]], known as Frederick the Great, seized the prosperous province of [[Silesia]] from Austria. Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] had signed the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748 in order to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances.

The War of the Austrian Succession had seen the belligerents aligned on a time-honoured basis. France's traditional enemies, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], had coalesced just as they had done against Louis XIV. [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the leading anti-Austrian state in Germany, had been supported by France. Neither group, however, found much reason to be satisfied with its partnership: British subsidies to Austria produced nothing of much help to the British, while the British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria. Prussia, having secured Silesia, came to terms with Austria in disregard of French interests. Even so, France concluded a defensive alliance with Prussia in 1747, and the maintenance of the [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|Anglo-Austrian alignment]] after 1748 was deemed essential by the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]], British secretary of state in the ministry of his brother [[Henry Pelham]]. The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the "[[diplomatic revolution]]" or the "reversal of alliances."

In 1756 Austria was making military preparations for war with Prussia and pursuing an alliance with Russia for this purpose. On 2 June 1746, Austria and Russia concluded a defensive alliance that covered their own territory and [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] against attack by Prussia or the Ottoman Empire. They also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of Silesia and the countship of Glatz (now [[Kłodzko]], Poland) to Austria in the event of hostilities with Prussia. Their real desire, however, was to destroy Frederick's power altogether, reducing his sway to his electorate of Brandenburg and giving [[East Prussia]] to Poland, an exchange that would be accompanied by the cession of the Polish [[Duchy of Courland]] to Russia. [[Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin]], grand chancellor of Russia under [[Empress Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]], was hostile to both France and Prussia, but he could not persuade Austrian statesman [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] to commit to offensive designs against Prussia so long as Prussia was able to rely on French support.

[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748]]

The Hanoverian king [[George II of Great Britain]] was passionately devoted to his family's continental holdings, but his commitments in Germany were counterbalanced by the demands of the British colonies overseas. If war against France for colonial expansion was to be resumed, then Hanover had to be secured against Franco-Prussian attack. France was very much interested in colonial expansion and was willing to exploit the vulnerability of Hanover in war against Great Britain, but it had no desire to divert forces to central Europe for Prussia's interest.

French policy was, moreover, complicated by the existence of the ''[[Secret du Roi]]''—a system of private diplomacy conducted by King Louis XV. Unbeknownst to his foreign minister, Louis had established a network of agents throughout Europe with the goal of pursuing personal political objectives that were often at odds with France's publicly stated policies. Louis's goals for ''le Secret du roi'' included the Polish crown for his kinsman [[Louis François de Bourbon, prince de Conti]], and the maintenance of Poland, Sweden, and Turkey as French client states in opposition to Russian and Austrian interests.

Frederick saw [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Royal Prussia|Polish west Prussia]] as potential fields for expansion but could not expect French support if he started an aggressive war for them. If he joined the French against the British in the hope of annexing Hanover, he might fall victim to an Austro-Russian attack. The hereditary elector of Saxony, [[Augustus III]], was also elective King of Poland as Augustus III, but the two territories were physically separated by Brandenburg and Silesia. Neither state could pose as a great power. Saxony was merely a buffer between Prussia and [[Austrian Bohemia]], whereas Poland, despite its union with the ancient lands of Lithuania, was prey to pro-French and pro-Russian factions. A Prussian scheme for compensating Frederick Augustus with Bohemia in exchange for Saxony obviously presupposed further spoliation of Austria.

In the attempt to satisfy Austria at the time, Britain gave their electoral vote in Hanover for the candidacy of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], as the Holy Roman Emperor, much to the dismay of Frederick and Prussia. Not only that, Britain would soon join the Austro-Russian alliance, but complications arose. Britain's basic framework for the alliance itself was to protect Hanover's interests against France. At the same time, Kaunitz kept approaching the French in the hope of establishing just such an alliance with Austria. Not only that, France had no intention to ally with Russia, who,  years earlier, had meddled in France's affairs during Austria's succession war.  France also saw the dismemberment of Prussia as threatening to the stability of Central Europe.

Years later, Kaunitz kept trying to establish France's alliance with Austria. He tried as hard as he could to avoid Austrian entanglement in Hanover's political affairs, and was even willing to trade [[Austrian Netherlands]] for France's aid in recapturing Silesia. Frustrated by this decision and by the [[Dutch Republic]]'s insistence on neutrality, Britain soon turned to Russia. On 30 September 1755, Britain pledged financial aid to Russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the Livonian-Lithuanian border, so they could defend Britain's interests in Hanover immediately. Besthuzev, assuming the preparation was directed against Prussia, was more than happy to obey the request of the British. Unbeknownst to the other powers, King George II also made overtures to the Prussian king, Frederick, who, fearing the Austro-Russian intentions, was also desirous of a rapprochement with Britain. On 16 January 1756, the [[Convention of Westminster]] was signed, whereby Britain and Prussia promised to aid one another; the parties hoped to achieve lasting peace and stability in Europe.

The carefully coded word in the agreement proved no less catalytic for the other European powers. The results were absolute chaos. Empress Elizabeth of Russia was outraged at the duplicity of Britain's position. Not only that, but France was enraged, and terrified, by the sudden betrayal of its only ally. Austria, particularly Kaunitz, used this situation to their utmost advantage. Now-isolated France was forced to accede to the Austro-Russian alliance or face ruin. Thereafter, on 1 May 1756, the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] was signed, in which both nations pledged 24,000 troops to defend each other in the case of an attack. This diplomatic revolution proved to be an important cause of the war; although both treaties were self-defensive in nature, the actions of both coalitions made the war virtually inevitable.

===In North America===
{{Main|French and Indian War}}
[[File:Nouvelle-France map-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the British and French settlements in North America in 1750, before the [[French and Indian War]] (1754 to 1763), that was part of the Seven Years' War]]

The boundary between British and French possessions in North America was largely undefined in the 1750s. France had long claimed the entire [[Mississippi River]] basin. This was disputed by Britain. In the early 1750s the French began constructing a chain of forts in the [[Ohio River Valley]] to assert their claim and shield the Native American population from increasing British influence.

The British settlers along the coast were upset that French troops would now be close to the western borders of their colonies. They felt the French would encourage their tribal allies among the North American natives to attack them. Also, the British settlers wanted access to the fertile land of the Ohio River Valley for the new settlers that were flooding into the British colonies seeking farm land.&lt;ref name="Anderson, p. 17"&gt;Anderson, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important French fort planned was intended to occupy a position at "the Forks" where the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River]]s meet to form the [[Ohio River]] (present day [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania). Peaceful British attempts to halt this fort construction were unsuccessful, and the French proceeded to build the fort they named [[Fort Duquesne]]. British colonial militia from Virginia were then sent to drive them out. Led by [[George Washington]], they ambushed a small French force at [[Battle of Jumonville Glen|Jumonville Glen]] on 28 May 1754 killing ten, including commander [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville|Jumonville]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The French retaliated by attacking Washington's army at [[Battle of Fort Necessity|Fort Necessity]] on 3 July 1754 and forced Washington to surrender.&lt;ref name="AndersonCrucible51_9"&gt;Anderson (2000), pp. 51–65.&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first engagements of what would become the worldwide Seven Years' War.

News of this arrived in Europe, where Britain and France unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a solution. The two nations eventually dispatched regular troops to North America to enforce their claims. The first British action was the assault on [[Acadia]] on 16 June 1755 in the [[Battle of Fort Beauséjour]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 112–115.&lt;/ref&gt; which was immediately followed by their [[expulsion of the Acadians]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In July British Major General [[Edward Braddock]] led about 2,000 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition to retake Fort Duquesne, but [[Braddock Expedition|the expedition]] ended in disastrous defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; In further action, Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] fired on the French ship ''[[French ship Alcide (1742)|Alcide]]'' [[action of 8 June 1755|on 8 June 1755]], capturing it and two troop ships. In September 1755, British colonial and French troops met in the inconclusive [[Battle of Lake George]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British also harassed French shipping beginning in August 1755, seizing hundreds of ships and capturing thousands of merchant seamen while the two nations were nominally at peace. Incensed, France prepared to attack Hanover, whose [[prince-elector]] was also the King of Great Britain and [[Menorca]]. Britain concluded a treaty whereby Prussia agreed to protect Hanover. In response France concluded an alliance with its long-time enemy Austria, an event known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].

For much of the eighteenth century, France approached its wars in the same way. It would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal help (sending them limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating that fights for the colonies would most likely be lost anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pritchard|first=James|title=In Search of Empire: The French in the Americas, 1670–1730|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82742-6|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kK9wa98I4eEC }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was to a degree forced upon France: geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to overseas colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dull|first=Jonathan R.|title=The French Navy and the Seven Years' War|year=2007|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln NE|isbn=0-8032-1731-5|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcsnvXeOdW4C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any French ruler.&lt;ref name=borneman&gt;{{cite book|last=Borneman|first=Walter R.|title=The French and Indian War: Deciding the Fate of North America|year=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-076184-4|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O7TZqbj_6BYC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given these military necessities, the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the continent, hoping for victories closer to home.&lt;ref name=borneman/&gt; The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then, in treaty negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas possessions (as had happened in, ''e.g.'', the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)]]). This approach did not serve France well in the war, as the colonies were indeed lost, and although much of the European war went well, by its end France had few counterbalancing European successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Stephen J.|title=Aspects of European History, 1494–1789|year=1984|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-416-37490-5|page=285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9REWs8RAcYC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Pitt the Elder]], who entered the cabinet in 1756, had a grand vision for the war that made it entirely different from previous wars with France. As prime minister, Pitt committed Britain to a grand strategy of seizing the entire French Empire, especially its possessions in North America and India. Britain's main weapon was the Royal Navy, which could control the seas and bring as many invasion troops as were needed. He also planned to use colonial forces from the thirteen American colonies, working under the command of British [[Regular army|regulars]], to invade New France. In order to tie the French army down he subsidized his European allies. Pitt was head of the government from 1756 to 1761, and even after that the British continued his strategy. It proved completely successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence James|title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DMS3r_BxOYC&amp;pg=PA71|year=1997|page=71ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pitt had a clear appreciation of the enormous value of imperial possessions, and realized the vulnerability of the French Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William R.

Baskett|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly two years after fighting had broken out in the [[Ohio Country]].

Frederick&amp;nbsp;II of Prussia had received reports of the clashes in North America and had [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|formed an alliance with Great Britain]]. On 29 August 1756, he led Prussian troops across the border of Saxony, one of the small German states in league with Austria. He intended this as a bold pre-emption of an anticipated Austro-French invasion of Silesia. He had three goals in his new war on Austria. First, he would seize Saxony and eliminate it as a threat to Prussia, then use the Saxon army and treasury to aid the Prussian war effort. His second goal was to advance into Bohemia, where he might set up winter quarters at Austria's expense. Thirdly, he wanted to invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at Olmütz, and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war.&lt;ref name="Asprey, p. 427."&gt;Asprey, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Lobositz.png|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Battle of Lobositz]]. Austria: blue; Prussia: red.]]

Accordingly, leaving Field Marshal Count [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt von Schwerin]] in Silesia with 25,000 soldiers to guard against incursions from Moravia and Hungary, and leaving Field Marshal [[Hans von Lehwaldt]] in East Prussia to guard against Russian invasion from the east, Frederick set off with his army for Saxony. The Prussian army marched in three columns. On the right was a column of about 15,000 men under the command of [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]. On the left was a column of 18,000 men under the command of the [[Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Bevern|Duke of Brunswick-Bevern]]. In the centre was Frederick II, himself with Field Marshal [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]] commanding a corps of 30,000 troops.&lt;ref name="Asprey, p. 427." /&gt; Ferdinand of Brunswick was to close in on the town of [[Chemnitz]]. The Duke of Brunswick-Bevern was to traverse [[Lusatia]] to close in on [[Bautzen]]. Meanwhile, Frederick and Keith would make for [[Dresden]].

The Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered. Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Lobositz]] on 1 October 1756, Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General [[Maximilian Ulysses Browne|Browne]].&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 430–438.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prussians then occupied Saxony; after the [[Siege of Pirna]], the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Dull, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia. Far from being easy, Frederick's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia's smaller army. This led him to remark that he did not fight the same Austrians as he had during the previous war.&lt;ref name="Frederick II, Jean-Paul Bled"&gt;''Frederick II'', Jean-Paul Bled&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain had been surprised by the sudden Prussian offensive but now began shipping supplies and £670,000 (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|0.67|1756|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) to its new ally.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Hanoverian Army of Observation|combined force of allied German states]] was organised by the British to protect [[Hanover]] from French invasion, under the command of the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;See footnote on Asprey, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; The British attempted to persuade the [[Dutch Republic]] to join the alliance, but the request was rejected, as the Dutch wished to remain fully neutral.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the huge disparity in numbers, the year had been successful for the Prussian-led forces on the continent, in contrast to the British campaigns in North America.

The Prussian army then [[Siege of Prague (1757)|laid siege to the city]].&lt;ref&gt;Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'' (The Free Press: New York, 1966) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In response,  Austrian commander [[Count Leopold Joseph von Daun|Leopold von Daun]] collected a force of 30,000 men to come to the relief of Prague.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the battle at Prague, Frederick took 5,000 troops from the siege at Prague and sent them to reinforce the 19,000-man army under the Duke of Brunswick-Bevern at Kolin in Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Daun arrived too late to participate in the battle of Prague, but picked up 16,000 men who had escaped from the battle. With this army he slowly moved to relieve Prague. The Prussian army was too weak to simultaneously besiege Prague and keep von Daun away, and Frederick was forced to attack prepared positions. The resulting [[Battle of Kolin]] was a sharp defeat for Frederick, his first. His losses further forced him to lift the siege and withdraw from Bohemia altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that summer, the Russians under Field Marshal [[Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin]] besieged [[Klaipėda|Memel]] with 75,000 troops. Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia. However, after five days of artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm it.&lt;ref name="Asprey, p. 460"&gt;Asprey, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade [[East Prussia]] and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested [[Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf]] on 30 August 1757. In the words of the American historian Daniel Marston, Gross-Jägersdorf left the Prussians with "a newfound respect for the fighting capabilities of the Russians that was reinforced in the later battles of Zorndorf and Kunersdorf".&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 pages 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Russians were not yet able to take Königsberg after using up their supplies of cannonballs at Memel and Gross-Jägersdorf and retreated soon afterwards.

[[File:Schlacht bei Roßbach.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Rossbach]]]]

Logistics was a recurring problem for the Russians throughout the war.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 22"&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians lacked a quartermaster's department capable of keeping armies operating in Central Europe properly supplied over the primitive mud roads of eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 22"/&gt; The tendency of Russian armies to break off operations after fighting a major battle, even when they were not defeated, was less about their casualties and more about their supply lines; after expending much of their munitions in a battle, Russian generals did not wish to risk another battle knowing resupply would be a long time coming.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 22"/&gt; This long-standing weakness was evident in the [[Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–39)|Russian-Ottoman War]] of 1735–1739, where Russian battle victories led to only modest war gains due to problems supplying their armies.&lt;ref name="Stone, David page 70"&gt;Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 70&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian quartermasters department had not improved, so the same problems reoccurred in Prussia.&lt;ref name="Stone, David page 70"/&gt; Still, the Imperial Russian Army was a new threat to Prussia. Not only was Frederick forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia, he was now forced to withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; His defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunistic nations into the war. Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000 men.&lt;ref name="Asprey, p. 460"/&gt; Sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania and felt the Swedish army would not need to engage with the Prussians because the Prussians were occupied on so many other fronts.

[[File:Batte of Leuthen.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Leuthen]] by [[Carl Röchling]]]]
[[File:Frederick the Great and his staff at the Battle of Leuthen by Hugo Ungewitter.jpg|thumb|Frederick and staff at Leuthen]]

Things were looking grim for Prussia now, with the Austrians mobilising to attack Prussian-controlled soil and a combined French and ''[[Reichsarmee]]'' (German states) army under [[Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise|Prince Soubise]] approaching from the west. The ''Reichsarmee'' was a collection of armies from the smaller German states  that banded together to heed the appeal of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz I]] against Frederick.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 41"&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November and December 1757, the whole situation in Germany was reversed. First, Frederick devastated Soubise's forces at the [[Battle of Rossbach]] on 5 November 1757&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 469–472.&lt;/ref&gt; and then routed a vastly superior Austrian force at the [[Battle of Leuthen]] on 5 December 1757.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 476–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Rossbach was the only battle between the French and the Prussians during the entire war.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 41"/&gt; At Rossbach, the Prussians lost about 548 men killed while the Franco-German force under Soubise lost about 10,000 killed.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 42"&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick always called Leuthen his greatest victory, an assessment shared by many at the time as the Austrian Army was considered to be a highly professional force.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 42"/&gt; With these victories, Frederick once again established himself as Europe's premier general and his men as Europe's most accomplished soldiers.  However, Frederick missed an opportunity to completely destroy the Austrian army at Leuthen; although depleted, it escaped back into Bohemia.  He hoped the two smashing victories would bring Maria Theresa to the peace table, but she was determined not to negotiate until she had re-taken Silesia.  Maria Theresa also improved the Austrians' command after Leuthen by replacing her incompetent brother-in-law, [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]], with von Daun, who was now a field marshal.

This problem was compounded when the main Hanoverian army under Cumberland was defeated at the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] and forced to surrender entirely at the [[Convention of Klosterzeven]] following a [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|French Invasion of Hanover]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 211–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention removed Hanover from the war, leaving the western approach to Prussian territory extremely vulnerable. Frederick sent urgent requests to Britain for more substantial assistance, as he was now without any outside military support for his forces in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 176–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating that no further Russian advance was likely until 1758, Frederick moved the bulk of his eastern forces to Pomerania under the command of Marshal Lehwaldt, where they were to repel the Swedish invasion. In short order, the Prussian army drove the Swedes back, occupied most of [[Swedish Pomerania]], and blockaded its capital [[Stralsund]].&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George&amp;nbsp;II of Great Britain]], on the advice of his British ministers after the battle of Rossbach, revoked the Convention of Klosterzeven, and Hanover reentered the war.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 215–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the winter the new commander of the Hanoverian forces, [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick]], regrouped his army and launched a series of offensives that drove the French back across the [[River Rhine]].  Ferdinand's forces kept Prussia's western flank secure for the rest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;
The British had suffered further defeats in North America, particularly at [[Fort William Henry]]. At home, however, stability had been established. Since 1756, successive governments led by [[Thomas Pelham-Holles|Newcastle]] and Pitt had fallen. In August 1757, the two men agreed to a political partnership and formed a [[coalition government]] that gave new, firmer direction to the war effort. The new strategy emphasised both Newcastle's commitment to British involvement on the continent, particularly in defence of Germany, and Pitt's determination to use naval power to seize [[French colonies]] around the globe. This "dual strategy" would dominate British policy for the next five years.

Between 10 and 17 October 1757, a Hungarian general, Count [[András Hadik]], serving in the Austrian army, executed what may be the most famous [[hussar]] action in history. When the Prussian king, Frederick, was marching south with his powerful armies, the Hungarian general unexpectedly swung his force of 5,000, mostly hussars, around the Prussians and occupied part of their capital, Berlin, for one night.&lt;ref name="Asprey, p. 467."&gt;Asprey, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 200,000 thalers.&lt;ref name="Asprey, p. 467."/&gt;  When Frederick heard about this humiliating occupation, he immediately sent a larger force to free the city. Hadik, however, left the city with his hussars and safely reached the Austrian lines. Subsequently, Hadik was promoted to the rank of marshal in the Austrian Army.

===1758===
In early 1758, Frederick launched an invasion of [[Moravia]] and laid siege to [[Olmütz]] (now [[Olomouc]], Czech Republic).&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; Following an Austrian victory at the [[Battle of Domstadtl]] that wiped out a supply convoy destined for Olmütz, Frederick broke off the siege and withdrew from Moravia. It marked the end of his final attempt to launch a major invasion of Austrian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, pp. 148–55.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1758, the Russians invaded [[East Prussia]], where the province, almost denuded of troops, put up little opposition.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 41"/&gt; East Prussia had been occupied by Russian forces over the winter and would remain under their control until 1762, although it was far less strategically valuable to Prussia than Brandenburg or Silesia.  In any case, Frederick did not see the Russians as an immediate threat and instead entertained hopes of first fighting a decisive battle against Austria that would knock them out of the war.

[[File:Battle of Krefeld - Map of the area printed in The Gentleman's Magazine.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Krefeld – a map of the area in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'']]

In April 1758, the British concluded the [[Anglo-Prussian Convention]] with Frederick in which they committed to pay him [[Golden Cavalry of St George|an annual subsidy]] of £670,000. Britain also dispatched 9,000 troops to reinforce Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, the first British troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of Pitt. Ferdinand had succeeded in driving the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of [[Emden]] in March 1758 before crossing the Rhine with his own forces,  which caused alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the [[Battle of Krefeld]] and the brief occupation of [[Düsseldorf]], he was compelled by the successful manoeuvering of larger French forces to withdraw across the Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, pp. 179–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this point Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder in Brandenburg-[[Neumark]], at the [[Battle of Zorndorf]] (now Sarbinowo, Poland), a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick on 25 August 1758, fought a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count [[William Fermor]].&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 494–499.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides suffered heavy casualties – the Prussians 12,800, the Russians 18,000 – but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo pp. 162–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian Daniel Marston described Zorndorf as a "draw" as both sides were too exhausted and had taken such losses that neither wished to fight another battle with the other.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In the undecided [[Battle of Tornow]] on 25 September, a Swedish army repulsed six assaults by a Prussian army but did not push on Berlin following the [[Battle of Fehrbellin (1758)|Battle of Fehrbellin]].&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 500.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Pegna Überfall bei Hochkirch.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Hochkirch]]]]

The war was continuing indecisively when on 14 October Marshal Daun's Austrians surprised the main Prussian army at the [[Battle of Hochkirch]] in Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 501–506.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick lost much of his artillery but retreated in good order, helped by dense woods. The Austrians had ultimately made little progress in the campaign in Saxony despite Hochkirch and had failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. After a thwarted attempt to take Dresden, Daun's troops were forced to withdraw to Austrian territory for the winter, so that Saxony remained under Prussian occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, pp. 195–202.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Russians failed in an attempt to take [[Kolberg]] in Pomerania (now [[Kołobrzeg]], Poland) from the Prussians.&lt;ref&gt;''The seven years war in Europe'', Szabo&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, 1758 had been disappointing, and in the wake of this a new chief minister, the [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Duc de Choiseul]], was appointed. Choiseul planned to end the war in 1759 by making strong attacks on Britain and Hanover.

===1759–60===
[[File:HGM Findenigg Gefecht bei Maxen.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Maxen]]]]
[[File:Kunersdorff.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Kunersdorf]]]]

Prussia suffered several defeats in 1759. At the [[Battle of Kay]], or Paltzig, the Russian Count [[Pyotr Semyonovich Saltykov|Saltykov]] with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General [[Carl Heinrich von Wedel]]. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at [[Battle of Minden|Minden]], Austrian general [[Leopold Josef Graf Daun|Daun]] forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the [[Battle of Maxen]]. Frederick himself lost half his army in the [[Battle of Kunersdorf]] (now [[Kunowice]] Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at [[Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf|Gross-Jägersdorf]] (now Motornoye, Russia), and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.  However, disagreements with the Austrians over logistics and supplies resulted in the Russians withdrawing east yet again after Kunersdorf, ultimately enabling Frederick to re-group his shattered forces.

[[File:Bataille des Cardinaux en 1759 peinte par Richard Paton.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Quiberon Bay]]]]
[[File:Menzel - Battle of Liegnitz.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Liegnitz (1760)]]]]

The French [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|planned to invade the British Isles]] during 1759 by accumulating troops near the mouth of the Loire and concentrating their Brest and Toulon fleets. However, two sea defeats prevented this. In August, the Mediterranean fleet under [[Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran]] was scattered by a larger British fleet under [[Edward Boscawen]] at the [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Battle of Lagos]]. In the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] on 20 November, the British admiral [[Edward Hawke]] with 23 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] caught the French Brest fleet with 21 ships of the line under [[Marshal de Conflans]] and sank, captured, or forced many of them aground, putting an end to the French plans.

The year 1760 brought yet more Prussian disasters. The general [[Heinrich August, Baron de la Motte Fouqué|Fouqué]] was defeated by the Austrians in the [[Battle of Landshut (1760)|Battle of Landshut]]. The French captured [[Marburg]], and the Swedes part of [[Pomerania]]. The Hanoverians were victorious over the French at the [[Battle of Warburg]], their continued success preventing France from sending troops to aid the Austrians against Prussia in the east.

Despite this, the Austrians, under the command of [[Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon|General Laudon]], captured [[Kłodzko|Glatz]] (now [[Kłodzko]], Poland) in Silesia. In the [[Battle of Liegnitz (1760)|Battle of Liegnitz]] Frederick scored a strong victory despite being outnumbered three to one. The Russians under [[Pyotr Saltykov|General Saltykov]] and Austrians under [[Franz Moritz Graf von Lacy|General Lacy]] briefly occupied his capital, Berlin, in October, but could not hold it for long. Still, the loss of Berlin to the Russians and Austrians was a great blow to Frederick's prestige as many pointed out that the Prussians had no hope of occupying temporarily or otherwise St. Petersburg or Vienna. In November 1760 Frederick was once more victorious, defeating the able Daun in the [[Battle of Torgau]], but he suffered very heavy casualties, and the Austrians retreated in good order.

Meanwhile, after the battle of Kunersdorf, the Russian army was mostly inactive due mostly to their tenuous supply lines.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian logistics were so poor that in October 1759, an agreement was signed under which the Austrians undertook to supply the Russians as the quartermaster's department of the Russian Army was badly strained by the demands of Russian armies operating so far from home.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 22"/&gt; As it was, the requirement that the Austrian quartermaster's department supply both the Austrian and Russian armies proved beyond its capacity, and in practice, the Russians received little in the way of supplies from the Austrians.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 22"/&gt; At [[Liegnitz]] (now [[Legnica]], Poland), the Russians arrived too late to participate in the battle. They made two attempts to storm the fortress of Kolberg, but neither succeeded. The tenacious resistance of Kolberg allowed Frederick to focus on the Austrians instead of having to split his forces.

Prussia began the 1761 campaign with just 100,000 available troops, many of them new recruits, and its situation seemed desperate.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Austrian and Russian forces were also heavily depleted and could not launch a major offensive.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}

In February 1761 [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick]] surprised French troops at [[Battle of Langensalza (1761)|Langensalza]] and then advanced to [[Siege of Cassel (1761)|besiege Cassel]] in March. He was forced to lift the siege and retreat after French forces regrouped and captured several thousand of his men at the [[Battle of Grünberg]]. At the [[Battle of Villinghausen]], forces under Ferdinand defeated a 92,000-man French army.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}

On the eastern front, progress was very slow. The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland, and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them. One of them, led by general Platen in September resulted in the loss of 2,000 Russians, mostly captured, and the destruction of 5,000 wagons.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War, 1756–1763'',  Herbert Redman&lt;/ref&gt; Deprived of men, the Prussians had to resort to this new sort of warfare, raiding, to delay the advance of their enemies.  Frederick's army, though depleted, was left unmolested at its headquarters in Brunzelwitz, as both the Austrians and the Russians were hesitant to attack it. Nonetheless, at the end of 1761, Prussia suffered two critical setbacks. The Russians under [[Zakhar Chernyshev]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|stormed Kolberg in Pomerania]], while the Austrians captured [[Schweidnitz]]. The loss of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt; A major problem for the Russians throughout the war had always been their weak logistics, which prevented their generals from following up their victories, and now with the fall of Kolberg, the Russians could at long last supply their armies in Central Europe via the sea.&lt;ref name="Stone, David page 75"&gt;Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the Russians could now supply their armies over the sea, which was considerably faster and safer (Prussian cavalry could not intercept Russian ships in the Baltic) than over the land threatened to swing the balance of power decisively against Prussia, as Frederick could not spare any troops to protect his capital.&lt;ref name="Stone, David page 75"/&gt; In Britain, it was speculated that a total Prussian collapse was now imminent.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}

[[File:Fall of Kolberg in 1761.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siege of Kolberg (1761)]]]]

Britain now threatened to withdraw its subsidies if Frederick did not consider offering concessions to secure peace. As the Prussian armies had dwindled to just 60,000 men and with Berlin itself about to come under siege, the survival of both Prussia and her King was severely threatened. Then on 5 January 1762 the Russian [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] died. Her Prussophile successor, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], at once ended the Russian occupation of East Prussia and Pomerania (see: the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)]]) and mediated Frederick's truce with Sweden.  He also placed a corps of his own troops under Frederick's command. Frederick was then able to muster a larger army, of 120,000 men, and concentrate it against Austria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He drove them from much of Silesia, while his brother Henry won a victory in Saxony in the [[Battle of Freiberg]] (29 October 1762). At the same time, his Brunswick allies captured the key town of [[Göttingen]] and compounded this by [[Siege of Cassel|taking Cassel]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}

In 1762 two new countries entered the war. Britain declared war against [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] on 4 January 1762; Spain reacted by issuing its own declaration of war against Britain on 18 January.&lt;ref name=Fish2003p2&gt;{{Harvnb|Fish|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal followed by joining the war on Britain's side. Spain, aided by the French, [[Invasion of Portugal (1762)|launched an invasion]] of Portugal and succeeded in [[Siege of Almeida (1762)|capturing Almeida]]. The arrival of British reinforcements stalled a further Spanish advance, and in the [[Battle of Valencia de Alcántara]] British-Portuguese forces overran a major Spanish supply base. The invaders were stopped on the heights in front of [[Abrantes Municipality|Abrantes]] (called ''the pass to Lisbon'') where the Anglo-Portuguese were entrenched.

He therefore made peace with Frederick and evacuated Prussia's Rhineland territories, ending France's involvement in the war in Germany.{{sfn|Mitford, Nancy|2013|p=242, 243}}

[[File:Hubertusburg Allegorie.jpg|thumb|[[Treaty of Hubertusburg]]]]

By 1763, the war in central Europe was essentially a stalemate between Prussia and Austria. Prussia had retaken nearly all of Silesia from the Austrians after Frederick's narrow victory over Daun at the Battle of Burkersdorf.  After his brother Henry's 1762 victory at the Battle of Freiberg, Frederick held most of Saxony but not its capital, Dresden. His financial situation was not dire, but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened. His manpower had dramatically decreased, and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that an offensive against Dresden seemed impossible.&lt;ref name="Frederick II, Jean-Paul Bled"/&gt; British subsidies had been stopped by the new prime minister, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], and the Russian emperor had been overthrown by his wife, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]], who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war. Austria, however, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army, which greatly affected its offensive power.&lt;ref name="Frederick II, Jean-Paul Bled"/&gt; Indeed, after having effectively sustained a long war, its administration was in disarray.&lt;ref&gt;''The emergence of the Eastern powers'', Hamish Scott&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, it still held Dresden, the southeastern parts of Saxony, and the county of Glatz in southern Silesia, but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support, and Maria Theresa had largely given up her hopes of re-conquering Silesia; her Chancellor, husband and eldest son were all urging her to make peace, while Daun was hesitant to attack Frederick. In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], in which Glatz was returned to Prussia in exchange for the Prussian evacuation of Saxony. This ended the war in central Europe.

The stalemate had really been reached by 1759&amp;ndash;1760, and Prussia and Austria were nearly out of money. The materials of both sides had been largely consumed. Frederick was no longer receiving subsidies from Britain; the Golden Cavalry of St. George had produced nearly 13 million dollars (equivalent). He had melted and coined most of the church silver, had ransacked the palaces of his kingdom and coined that silver, and reduced his purchasing power by mixing it with copper. His banks' capital was exhausted, and he had pawned nearly everything of value from his own estate. While Frederick still had a significant amount of money left from the prior British subsidies, he hoped to use it to restore his kingdom's prosperity in peacetime; in any case, Prussia's population was so depleted that he could not sustain another long campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander J.

She had pawned her jewels in 1758; in 1760, she approved a public subscription for support and urged her public to bring their silver to the mint. French subsidies were no longer provided.&lt;ref name=Mahantheresa&gt;Mahan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UzJ8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41&amp;dq=Army+of+Maria+Theresa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNsYbO-ZLTAhXDhFQKHYduDzwQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Daun&amp;f=false here].&lt;/ref&gt; Although she had many young men still to draft, she could not conscript them and did not dare to resort to impressment, as Frederick had done.&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UzJ8CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41&amp;dq=Army+of+Maria+Theresa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNsYbO-ZLTAhXDhFQKHYduDzwQ6AEILDAB#v=snippet&amp;q=army&amp;f=false here].&lt;/ref&gt; She had even dismissed some men because it was too expensive to feed them.&lt;ref name=Mahantheresa/&gt;

===British amphibious "descents"===
{{further|Raid on Rochefort}}
Great Britain planned a "descent" (an [[amphibious warfare|amphibious demonstration]] or raid) on [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], a [[joint warfare|joint operation]] to overrun the town and burn shipping in the [[Charente river|Charente]]. The expedition set out on 8 September 1757, [[John Mordaunt (general)|Sir John Mordaunt]] commanding the troops and [[Edward Hawke|Sir Edward Hawke]] the fleet. On 23 September the [[Isle d'Aix]] was taken, but military staff dithered and lost so much time that Rochefort became unassailable.&lt;ref name="Combined1"&gt;Julian Corbett, ''England in the Seven Years' War: A Study in Combined Strategy'', 2 Vols., (London, 1918).&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition abandoned the Isle d'Aix, returning to Great Britain on 1 October.

[[File:William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by William Hoare.jpg|thumb|Under Pitt's leadership, Britain's position as the leading colonial power was confirmed by the Seven Years' War.]]

Despite the debatable strategic success and the operational failure of the descent on Rochefort, William Pitt—who saw purpose in this type of asymmetric enterprise—prepared to continue such operations.&lt;ref name="Combined1"/&gt; An army was assembled under the command of [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough]]; he was aided by [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Sackville]]. The naval squadron and transports for the expedition were commanded by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]]. The army landed on 5 June 1758 at [[Cancalle Bay]], proceeded to [[St.&amp;nbsp;Malo]], and, finding that it would take prolonged siege to capture it, instead attacked the nearby port of St.&amp;nbsp;Servan. It burned shipping in the harbor, roughly 80 French privateers and merchantmen, as well as four warships which were under construction.&lt;ref&gt;N. A. M. Rodger, ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain'', 1649–1815, (London, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The force then re-embarked under threat of the arrival of French relief forces. An attack on [[Le Havre|Havre de Grace]] was called off, and the fleet sailed on to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]; the weather being bad and provisions low, that too was abandoned, and the expedition returned having damaged French privateering and provided further strategic demonstration against the French coast.

Pitt now prepared to send troops into Germany; and both Marlborough and Sackville, disgusted by what they perceived as the futility of the "descents", obtained commissions in that army. The elderly [[Thomas Bligh|General Bligh]] was appointed to command a new "descent", escorted by Howe. The campaign began propitiously with the [[Raid on Cherbourg]]. Covered by naval bombardment, the army drove off the French force detailed to oppose their landing, captured Cherbourg, and destroyed its fortifications, docks, and shipping.

The troops were reembarked and moved to the [[Bay of St.&amp;nbsp;Lunaire]] in Brittany where, on 3 September, they were landed to operate against St.&amp;nbsp;Malo; however, this action proved impractical. Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate: the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of [[Saint-Cast-le-Guildo|St.&amp;nbsp;Cast]], while the army proceeded overland. The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops. At the [[battle of Saint Cast]] a rear-guard of 1,400 under Dury held off the French while the rest of the army embarked. They could not be saved; 750, including Dury, were killed and the rest captured.

==Colonies==
{{Campaignbox Seven Years' War: West Indies}}
The colonial conflict mainly between France and Britain took place in India, North America, Europe, the [[Caribbean]] isles, the [[Philippines]], and coastal Africa. Over the course of the war, Great Britain gained enormous areas of land and influence at the expense of the French.

Great Britain lost [[Menorca]] in the Mediterranean to the French in 1756 but captured the French colonies in [[Senegal]] in 1758. The British [[Royal Navy]] took the French sugar colonies of [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1759)|Guadeloupe]] in 1759 and [[British expedition against Martinique|Martinique]] in 1762 as well as the Spanish cities of [[British expedition against Cuba|Havana in Cuba]], and [[Battle of Manila (1762)|Manila]] in the Philippines, both prominent Spanish colonial cities. However, expansion into the hinterlands of both cities met with stiff resistance. In the Philippines, the British were [[British occupation of Manila|confined to Manila]] until their agreed upon withdrawal at the war's end.

]]

During the war, the [[Iroquois#French and Indian Wars|Seven Nations of The Iroquois Confederacy]] were allied with the French. These were Native Americans of the Laurentian valley—the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], the [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]], the [[Huron people|Huron]], and others. Although the Algonquin tribes and the Seven Nations were not directly concerned with the fate of the Ohio River Valley, they had been victims of the Iroquois Confederation which included the Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Tuscarora tribes. The Iroquois had encroached on Algonquin territory and pushed the Algonquins west beyond Lake Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the Algonquin and the Seven Nations were interested in fighting against the Iroquois. Throughout New England, New York, and the North-west Native American tribes formed differing alliances with the major belligerents. The [[Iroquois]], dominant in what is now [[Upstate New York]], sided with the British but did not play a large role in the war.

In 1756 and 1757 the French captured forts [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)|Oswego]]&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 150–157.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Siege of Fort William Henry|William Henry]] from the British.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 185–201.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter victory was marred when France's native allies broke the terms of capitulation and attacked the retreating British column, which was under French guard, slaughtering and scalping soldiers and taking captive many men, women and children while the French refused to protect their captives.&lt;ref name="Dodge91_2"&gt;Dodge, pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; French naval deployments in 1757 also [[Louisbourg Expedition (1757)|successfully defended]] the key [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] on [[Cape Breton Island]] called Ile du Roi by the French, securing the seaward approaches to Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister William Pitt's focus on the colonies for the 1758 campaign paid off with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|taking of Louisbourg]] after French reinforcements were blocked by British naval victory in the [[Battle of Cartagena (1758)|Battle of Cartagena]] and in the successful [[Forbes Expedition|capture of Fort Duquesne]]&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 280–283.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Battle of Fort Frontenac|Fort Frontenac]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 258–266.&lt;/ref&gt; The British also continued the process of deporting the Acadian population with a wave of major operations against [[Ile Saint-Jean Campaign|Île Saint-Jean]] (present-day [[Prince Edward Island]]), the [[St. John River Campaign|St.&amp;nbsp;John River valley]], and the [[Petitcodiac River Campaign|Petitcodiac River valley]]. The celebration of these successes was dampened by their embarrassing defeat in the [[Battle of Carillon]] (Ticonderoga), in which 4,000 French troops repulsed 16,000 British. When the British led by generals [[James Abercrombie (British Army officer, born 1706)|James Abercrombie]] and [[George Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe|George Howe]] attacked, they believed that the French led by general [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Marquis de Montcalm]] were defended only by a small [[abatis]] which could be taken easily given the British force's significant numerical advantage. The British offensive which was supposed to advance in tight columns and overwhelm the French defenders fell into confusion and scattered, leaving large spaces in their ranks. When the French [[Chevalier de Levis]] sent 1,000 soldiers to reinforce Montcalm's struggling troops, the British were pinned down in the brush by intense French musket fire and they were forced to retreat.

All of Britain's campaigns against New France succeeded in 1759, part of what became known as an [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|''Annus Mirabilis'']]. [[Battle of Fort Niagara|Fort Niagara]]&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 330–339.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|Fort Carillon]]&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 240–249.&lt;/ref&gt; on 8 July 1758 fell to sizable British forces, cutting off French frontier forts further west. Starting in June 1759, the British under [[James Wolfe]] and [[James Murray (British Army officer, born 1721)|James Murray]] set up camp on the Ile d'Orleans across the St. Lawrence River from Quebec, enabling them to commence the 3-month siege that ensued. The French under the Marquis de Montcalm anticipated a British assault to the east of Quebec so he ordered his soldiers to fortify the region of [[Beauport, Quebec City|Beauport]]. On July 31 the [[Battle of Beauport|British attacked]] with 4,000 soldiers but the French positioned high up on the cliffs overlooking the [[Montmorency Falls]] forced the British forces to withdraw to the Ile D'Orleans. While Wolfe and Murray planned a second offensive, British rangers raided French settlements along the St. Lawrence, destroying food supplies, ammunition and other goods in an attempt to vanquish the French through starvation.

[[File:The Death of General Wolfe B.West,1770.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771), on the Plains of Abraham, near Quebec]]

On 13 September 1759, General James Wolfe led 5,000 troops up a goat path to the [[Plains of Abraham]], 1 mile west of Quebec City. &lt;!--the following passage seems to go into far too much detail about one battle for an article on an entire war--&gt;
He had positioned his army between Montcalm's forces an hour's march to the east and [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]]'s regiments to the west, which could be mobilised within 3 hours. Instead of waiting for a coordinated attack with Bougainville, Montcalm attacked immediately.  When his 3,500 troops advanced, their lines became scattered in a disorderly formation.  Many French soldiers fired before they were within range of striking the British.  Wolfe organised his troops in two lines stretching 1 mile across the Plains of Abraham.  They were ordered to load their Brown Bess muskets with two bullets to obtain maximum power and hold their fire until the French soldiers came within 40 paces of the British ranks.  When Montcalm's army was within range of the British, their volley was powerful and nearly all bullets hit their targets, devastating the French ranks.  The French fled the Plains of Abraham in a state of utter confusion while they were pursued by members of the Scottish Fraser regiment and other British forces.  Despite being cut down by musket fire from the Canadiens and their indigenous allies, the British vastly outnumbered these opponents and won the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 355–360.&lt;/ref&gt; General Wolfe was mortally wounded in the chest early in the battle so the command fell to James Murray, who would become the lieutenant governor of Quebec after the war.  The Marquis de Montcalm was also severely wounded later in the battle and died the following day.  The French Canadians led by the Chevalier de Levis staged a counteroffensive on the Plains of Abraham in the spring of 1760, with initial success at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]],&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, pp. 392–393.&lt;/ref&gt; but they were unable to retake Quebec, due to British naval superiority following the [[Battle of Neuville]]. The French forces retreated to [[Montreal]], where on 8 September they surrendered to overwhelming British numerical superiority.

Seeing French and Indian defeat, in 1760 the Seven Nations of The Iroquois Confederacy resigned from the war and negotiated the [[Treaty of Kahnawake]] with the British. Among its conditions was their unrestricted travel between Canada and New York, as the nations had extensive trade between Montreal and Albany as well as populations living throughout the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.sympatico.ca/donald.macleod2/border.html D. Peter MacLeod, "'Free and Open Roads': The Treaty of Kahnawake and the Control of Movement over the New York-Canadian Border during the Military Regime, 1760–1761," read at the Ottawa Legal History Group, 3 December 1992 (1992, 2001)]. Retrieved 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, towards the end of the war, French forces attacked [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St.&amp;nbsp;John's, Newfoundland]]. If successful, the expedition would have strengthened France's hand at the negotiating table. Although they took St. John's and raided nearby settlements, the French forces were eventually defeated by British troops at the [[Battle of Signal Hill]]. This was the final battle of the war in North America, and it forced the French to surrender to [[William Amherst (British Army officer)|Lieutenant Colonel William Amherst]]. The victorious British now controlled all of eastern North America.

The history of the Seven Years' War in North America, particularly the expulsion of the Acadians, the siege of Quebec, the death of Wolfe, and the Battle of Fort William Henry generated a vast number of ballads, broadsides, images, and novels (see [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s ''[[Evangeline]]'', [[Benjamin West]]'s ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'', [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''), maps and other printed materials, which testify to how this event held the imagination of the British and North American public long after Wolfe's death in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=People&amp;PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault: "Canadiana"], Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

Between September 1762 and April 1763, Spanish forces led by [[Pedro Antonio de Cevallos|don Pedro Antonio de Cevallos]], Governor of Buenos Aires (and later first [[Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata|Viceroy of the Rio de la Plata]]) undertook a campaign against the Portuguese in Uruguay and South Brazil. The Spaniards conquered the Portuguese territories of [[Colonia del Sacramento|Colonia do Sacramento]] and [[Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul|Rio Grande de São Pedro]] and forced the Portuguese to surrender and retreat.

Under the Treaty of Paris (1763), Spain had to return to Portugal the colony of Sacramento, while the vast and rich territory of the so-called "Continent of S.

{{Main|Third Carnatic War}}
{{Campaignbox Seven Years' War: East Indies}}
In India, the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in Europe renewed the long running conflict between the French and the British trading companies for influence on the subcontinent. The French allied themselves with the [[Mughal Empire]] to resist British expansion. The war began in Southern India but spread into [[Bengal]], where British forces under [[Robert Clive]] recaptured [[Calcutta]] from the [[Nawab]] [[Siraj ud-Daulah]], a French ally, and ousted him from his throne at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757. In the same year, the British also captured [[Chandernagar]], the French settlement in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrington, ''Plassey, 1757: Clive of India's Finest Hour'' (Praeger, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south, although the French captured [[Cuddalore]], their [[siege of Madras]] failed, while the British commander [[Sir Eyre Coote]] decisively defeated the [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally|Comte de Lally]] at the [[Battle of Wandiwash]] in 1760 and overran the French territory of the [[Northern Circars]]. The French capital in India, [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], fell to the British in 1761; together with the fall of the lesser French settlements of [[Karikal]] and [[Mahé, India|Mahé]] this effectively eliminated French power in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=S.N.|title=History Modern India|year=2006|publisher=[[New Age International University|New Age International]]|location=[[Delhi, India]]|isbn=8122417744|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ga-pmgxsWwoC&amp;pg=PA35 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1758, at the urging of an American merchant, [[Thomas Cumming]], Pitt dispatched an expedition to take the French settlement at [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint Louis]]. The British [[Capture of Senegal|captured Senegal]] with ease in May 1758 and brought home large amounts of captured goods. This success convinced Pitt to launch two further expeditions to take the island of [[Gorée]] and the French trading post on [[River Gambia|the Gambia]]. The loss of these valuable colonies further weakened the French economy.&lt;ref&gt;James L.A.

{{Wikisourcepar|Treaty of Paris (1763)}}

The Anglo-French hostilities were ended in 1763 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], which involved a complex series of land exchanges, the most important being France's cession to Spain of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], and to Great Britain the rest of New France except for the islands of [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]]. Faced with the choice of regaining either [[New France]] or its Caribbean island colonies of [[History of Guadeloupe|Guadeloupe]] and [[History of Martinique|Martinique]], France chose the latter to retain these lucrative sources of sugar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/seven-years-war/ "Seven Years War"].

Spain lost control of [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to Great Britain, but it received from the French the [[Île d'Orléans, Louisiana|Île d'Orléans]] and all of the former French holdings west of the [[Mississippi River]]. The exchanges suited the British as well, as their own Caribbean islands already supplied ample sugar, and, with the acquisition of New France and Florida, they now controlled all of North America east of the Mississippi.{{Citation needed|date = April 2017}}

In India, the British retained the [[Northern Circars]], but returned all the French trading ports. The treaty, however, required that the fortifications of these settlements be destroyed and never rebuilt, while only minimal garrisons could be maintained there, thus rendering them worthless as military bases. Combined with the loss of France's ally in [[Nawab of Bengal|Bengal]] and the defection of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]] to the British as a result of the war, this effectively brought French power in India to an end, making way for [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British hegemony]] and eventual control of the subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, ''The Seven Years' War in Europe 1756–1763'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; France's navy was crippled by the war. Only after an ambitious rebuilding program in combination with Spain was France again able to challenge Britain's command of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kennedy |first= Paul |authorlink= Paul Kennedy |editor= |others= |title= The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery |year= 1976 |month= |url= |type= book |edition= new introduction|publisher=Penguin Books |location= London |isbn= 0-684-14609-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vorderlader.jpg|thumb|left|Historical re-enactment of the [[Battle of Warburg]] fought on 31 July 1760]]

Bute's settlement with France was mild compared with what Pitt's would have been. He had hoped for a lasting peace with France, and he was afraid that if he took too much, the whole of Europe would unite in envious hostility against Great Britain. Choiseul, however, had no intention of making a permanent peace, and, when France went to war with Great Britain during the American Revolution, the British found no support among the European powers.&lt;ref name="Eric Robson 1957"&gt;Eric Robson, "The Seven Years' War," in J O Lindsay, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History'' (1957) 7:465-86.&lt;/ref&gt; France's defeat caused the French to embark upon major military reforms, with particular attention being paid to the artillery.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the [[Gribeauval system|famed French artillery]] that played a prominent role in the wars of the French Revolution and beyond can to be traced to military reforms that started in 1763.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt;

The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on 15 February 1763, at a hunting lodge between [[Dresden]] and [[Leipzig]]. Negotiations had started there on 31 December 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.  Saxony emerged from the war weakened and bankrupt; despite losing no territory, Saxony had essentially been a battleground between Prussia and Austria throughout the conflict, with many of its' towns and cities (including the capital of Dresden) damaged by bombardment and looting.

Austria was not able to retake Silesia or make any significant territorial gain. However, it did prevent Prussia from invading parts of Saxony. More significantly, its military performance proved far better than during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms. Hence, Austria's prestige was restored in great part and the empire secured its position as a major player in the European system.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Teresa of Austria;  Jean-Paul Bled&lt;/ref&gt; Also, by promising to vote for Joseph II in the Imperial elections, Frederick II accepted the Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire. The survival of Prussia as a first-rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and its army, however, was potentially damaging in the long run to Austria's influence in Germany.

Not only that, Austria now found herself estranged with the new developments within the empire itself. Beside the rise of Prussia, [[Augustus III]], although ineffective, could muster an army not only from Saxony, but also Poland, since he was also the King of Poland as well as Elector of Saxony. Bavaria's growing power and independence was also apparent as it asserted more control on the deployment of its army, and managed to disengage from the war at its own will. Most importantly, with the now belligerent Hanover united personally under [[George III of Great Britain]], It amassed a considerable power, and even brought Britain in, on future conflicts. This power dynamic was important to the future and the latter conflicts of the ''Reich''. The war also proved that Maria Theresa's reforms were still insufficient to compete with Prussia: unlike its enemy, the Austrians were almost bankrupt at the end of war. Hence, she dedicated the next two decades to the consolidation of her administration.

Prussia emerged from the war as a great power whose importance could no longer be challenged. Frederick the Great's personal reputation was enormously enhanced, as his debt to fortune (Russia's volte-face after Elizabeth's death) and to British financial support were soon forgotten, while the memory of his energy and his military genius was strenuously kept alive.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; Though depicted as a key moment in Prussia's rise to greatness, the war weakened Prussia.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; Prussia's lands and population were devastated, though Frederick's extensive agrarian reforms and encouragement of immigration soon solved both these problems.  Unfortunately for Prussia, its army had taken heavy losses (particularly the officer corps), and in the war's aftermath, Frederick could not afford to rebuild the Prussian Army to what it was before the war.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; In the War of the Bavarian Succession, the Prussians fought poorly despite being led by Frederick in person.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; During the war with France in 1792–1795, the Prussian Army did not fare well against revolutionary France, and in 1806, the Prussians were annihilated by the French at the Battle of Jena.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; It was only after 1806 when Prussian government brought in reforms to recover from the disaster of Jena that Prussia's rise to greatness later in the 19th century was realized.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; However, none of this had happened yet, and after 1763, various nations all sent officers to Prussia to learn the secrets of Prussia's military power.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; After the Seven Years' War, Prussia become one of the most imitated powers in Europe.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; 
 
Russia, on the other hand, made one great invisible gain from the war: the elimination of French influence in Poland. The [[First Partition of Poland]] (1772) was to be a Russo-Prussian transaction, with Austria only reluctantly involved and with France simply ignored.&lt;ref name="Eric Robson 1957"/&gt; Though the war had ended in a draw, the performance of the Imperial Russian Army against Prussia had improved Russia's reputation as a factor in European politics, as many had not expected the Russians to hold their own against the Prussians in campaigns fought on Prussian soil.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel page 90"/&gt; The American historian David Stone observed that Russian soldiers proved capable of going head-on against the Prussians, inflicting and taking one bloody volley after another "without flinching", and though the quality of Russian generalship was quite variable, the Russians were never decisively defeated once in the war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians defeated the Prussians several times in the war, but the Russians lacked the necessary logistical capability to follow up their victories with lasting gains, and in this sense, the salvation of the House of Hohenzollern was due more to Russian weakness with respect to logistics than to Prussian strength on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 pages 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the fact that the Russians proved capable of defeating in battle the army of a "first-rate" European power on its own soil despite the often indifferent quality of their generals improved Russia's standing in Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A lasting legacy of the war was that it awakened the Russians to their logistic weaknesses, and led to major reforms of the Imperial Russian Army's quartermaster department.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel pages 90-91"&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 pages 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; The supply system that allowed the Russians to advance into the Balkans during the war with the Ottomans in 1787–92, Marshal Alexander Suvorov to campaign effectively in Italy and Switzerland in 1798–99, and for the Russians to fight across Germany and France in 1813–14 to take Paris was created directly in response to the logistic problems experienced by the Russians in the Seven Years' War.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel pages 90-91"/&gt;

The British government was close to bankruptcy, and Britain now faced the delicate task of pacifying its new French-Canadian subjects as well as the many American Indian tribes who had supported France. In 1763, [[Pontiac's War]] broke out as a group of Indian tribes in the Great Lakes region and the Northwest (the modern American Midwest) said to have been led by the Ottawa chief Pontiac (whose role as the leader of the confederation seems to have been exaggerated by the British), unhappy with the eclipse of French power, rebelled against British rule. The Indians had long established congenial and friendly relations with the French fur traders, and the Anglo-American fur traders who had replaced the French had engaged in business practices that enraged the Indians, who complained about being cheated when they sold their furs.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel pages 84-85"&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 pages 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Indians feared that with the coming of British rule might lead to white settlers displacing them off their land, whereas it was known that the French had only come as fur traders.&lt;ref name="Marston, Daniel pages 84-85"/&gt; Pontiac's War was a major conflict in which the British temporarily lost control of the Great Lakes-Northwest regions to the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 pages 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of 1763, the only forts the British held in the region were Fort Detroit (modern Detroit, Michigan ), Fort Niagara (modern Youngstown, New York) and Fort Pitt (modern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) with the rest all being lost to the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only with the British victory at the [[Battle of Bushy Run]] that prevented a complete collapse of British power in the Great Lakes region.&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; King George&amp;nbsp;III's [[Proclamation of 1763]], which forbade white settlement beyond the crest of the Appalachians, was intended to appease the Indians but led to considerable outrage in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], whose inhabitants were eager to acquire native lands. The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, similarly intended to win over the loyalty of French Canadians, also spurred resentment among American colonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D. Peter |last=MacLeod |title=Northern Armageddon: The Battle of the Plains of Abraham |location=Vancouver |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |year=2008 |isbn=9781553654124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act protected Catholic religion and French language, which enraged the Americans, but the Québécois remained loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolution and did not rebel.

The war also brought to an end the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|"Old System" of alliances in Europe]],&lt;ref name=os&gt;I.e., a structure of alliances with European powers, in which Britain had formed grand coalitions against [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ambitions in Europe&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after the war, under the direction of [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], the British attempted to re-establish this system. But after her surprising grand success against a coalition of great powers, European states such as Austria, The Dutch Republic, Sweden, Denmark-Norway, Ottoman Empire, and Russia now saw Britain as a greater threat than France and did not join them, while the Prussians were angered by what they considered a British betrayal in 1762. Consequently, when the [[American War of Independence]] turned into a global war between 1778–83, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and lacking any substantial ally.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Henry Gipson, "The American revolution as an aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1754-1763."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2730">The '''Somali Institute for Peace and Justice in Minneapolis''' ('''SIPJ''') was a [[non profit]] organization based in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. Formed in October 2006, it advocated political unity and the institution of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in [[Somalia]]. The organization had branches in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Hassan Mohamud served as the organization's President,&lt;ref name=PR&gt;[http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/poems/Sep_06/20Sep1.html Somali Institute for Peace and Justice (SIPJ)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927084325/http://www.somaliweyn.com/pages/poems/Sep_06/20Sep1.html |date=2007-09-27 }} Somali Weyn&lt;/ref&gt; and Abdulqadir Abdi as its Vice Chairman.&lt;ref name=NEW&gt;[http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2006/oct/new_minneapolis_organization_hopes_to_tackle_somali_problems.aspx New Minneapolis organization hopes to tackle Somali problems] Hiiraan Online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for the Islamic Courts Union==
SIPJ issued a press release on 19 September 2006 stating "strong and unequivocal" opposition to the [[African Union]] peacekeeping force's presence in [[Somalia]], a force that the AU deployed in response to the [[Islamic Courts Union]]'s attacks on the [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Government]]. SIPJ described the deployment as needless and reckless, suggesting that the [[Ethiopian government]] used "manipulation" to control the "weak" and "subservient" Transitional Government.&lt;ref name=PR/&gt;

At the same time the SIPJ applauded the ICU's "extraordinary achievement on bringing peace and stability" to Somalia.&lt;ref name=PR/&gt;

In an earlier press release, released on 28 November, the SIPJ said the "Islamic Courts [Union] accomplished miracles to pacify and stabilize much of southern Somalia. Such an accomplishment must be congratulated and not be disturbed."&lt;ref name=DISTURBED&gt;[http://www.banadir.com/somali_insti+peace.shtml Press Release against lifting the arms embargo (Resolution 733 of 1992) on Somalia November 28, 2006] Banadir&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South African Springbok Championship Series''' was a [[sports car racing]] series based in [[Southern Africa]].  The series ran from 1966 until 1973.  The series was canceled after two rounds of the 1973 season due to the [[1973 oil crisis|Oil crisis]], and never returned.  The series' signautre event was the [[Kyalami 9 Hours]].  The series was frequented by European teams and drivers, as it took place in November and December after the [[World Sportscar Championship]] and [[Can-Am]] seasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4595">The '''Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law''' is a law promulgated by the [[Parliament of Spain]] in 1977, two years after [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]]'s death.&lt;ref name="Ackar2010"&gt;Ackar, Kadribasic (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_hp7nOXOBuIC&amp;pg=PA132 Transitional Justice in Democratization Processes: The Case of Spain from an International Point of View], ''International Journal of Rule of Law, Transitional Justice and Human Rights'', pp. 132-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The law freed [[political prisoners]] and permitted those exiled to return to Spain, but guaranteed impunity for those who participated in crimes&lt;ref&gt;Miriam M. Basilio, ''Visual Propaganda, Exhibitions, and the Spanish Civil War'' (Ashgate, 2013), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Francoist Spain]].&lt;ref name="Ackar2010"/&gt; The law is still in force, and has been used as a reason for not investigating and prosecuting Francoist [[Human rights in Spain|human rights violations]].&lt;ref name="Aguilar"&gt;Paloma Aguilar, "The Timing and the Scope of Reparation, Truth and Justice Measures: A Comparison of the Spanish, Argentinian and Chilean Cases" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z3qPlIAvD0C&amp;pg=PA505 ''Building a Future on Peace and Justice: Studies on Transitional Justice''] (eds. [[Kai Ambos]], Judith Large, and Marieke Wierda: Springer, 2009), pp. 505, 521-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The act institutionalized Spain's "[[pact of forgetting]]"&amp;mdash;a decision among Spanish parties and political actors, during and after the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], not to address atrocities committed by the [[Spanish State]].&lt;ref&gt;Omar G. Encarnación, ''Spanish Politics: Democracy After Dictatorship'' (Polity, 2008), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ofelia Ferrán &amp; Lisa Hilbink, "Introduction: Legalities of Violence in Contemporary Spain" in ''Legacies of Violence in Contemporary Spain: Exhuming the Past, Understanding the Present'' (Routledge, 2016), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 amnesty has been criticized by scholars for equating "victims and victimizers" and for shielding human rights violators from prosecution and punishment.&lt;ref name="Ackar2010"/&gt; Spain has argued that perpetrators of crimes against humanity cannot be prosecuted for crimes committed before 1939, but the UN takes the view that Francoist crimes should be investigated.&lt;ref name="Publico10Feb2012"&gt;[http://www.publico.es/espana/421451/la-onu-da-la-razon-a-garzon-y-pide-investigar-el-franquismo/comentarios-valorados ''La ONU da la razón a Garzón y pide investigar el franquismo''], ''[[Público (Spain)|Público]]'' (Publico.es), 10/02/2012&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012 the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] demanded the 1977 Amnesty Law to be repealed on the basis that it violates [[international human rights law]]. The Commissioner referred to Spain's obligation to comply with the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. Under international human rights law, there is no [[statute of limitations]] for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref name="Reuters2012"&gt;[http://news.trust.org//item/?map=spain-must-lift-amnesty-for-franco-era-crimes-un Spain must lift amnesty for Franco era crimes-U.N.], Reuters (February 10, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a UN working group of experts called upon Spain to repeal the 1977 law.&lt;ref name="Reuters2013"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-franco/u-n-tells-spain-to-revoke-franco-era-amnesty-law-idUSBRE98T0YJ20130930 U.N. tells Spain to revoke Franco-era amnesty law], Reuters (September 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Judge [[Baltasar Garzón]] briefly began an official inquiry, symbolically indicting Franco for the disappearance of more than 100,000 people. In 2009, [[Manos Limpias]], a far-right syndicate, brought criminal charges against the judge for defying the amnesty law.&lt;ref name="Reuters2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/opinion/sunday/truth-on-trial-in-spain.html Truth on Trial in Spain], ''New York Times'' (February 5, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Garzón was acquitted of the charges of "knowingly acting without jurisdiction" relating to his investigation of Francoist crimes, but was disbarred for 11 years by the [[Spanish Supreme Court]] in 2012 on an unrelated charge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Leggott]], ''Memory, War, and Dictatorship in Recent Spanish Fiction by Women'' (Bucknell University Press, 2015), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] hacker group CyberHunta [[Internet leak|leaked]] over a gigabyte of emails and other documents alleged to belong to Russian political operative and senior [[Kremlin]] official [[Vladislav Surkov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Windrem|first1=Robert|title=Payback? Russia gets hacked, revealing top Putin aide's secrets|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/payback-russia-gets-hacked-revealing-putin-aide-s-secrets-n673956|work=NBC News|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as Russia's "[[Éminence grise|grey cardinal]]", Surkov serves as a political adviser to President [[Vladimir Putin]] and is the architect of Russia's ideology of [[sovereign democracy]].

The document leak included over 2,300 emails from Surkov's inbox.&lt;ref name="DFRL"/&gt; The emails illustrate Russian plans to politically destabilize Ukraine and the coordination of affairs with major opposition leaders in [[Separatist forces of the war in Donbass|separatist]] east Ukraine.&lt;ref name="IBTUK"/&gt; The release included a document sent to Surkov by [[Denis Pushilin]], former Chair of the [[People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic|People's Soviet]] of the [[Donetsk People's Republic]], listing casualties that occurred during 2014.&lt;ref name="DFRL"/&gt; It also included a 22-page outline of "a plan to support nationalist and separatist politicians and to encourage early parliamentary elections in Ukraine, all with the aim of undermining the government in Kiev."&lt;ref name="FP"/&gt;

The Kremlin has said that the leaked documents are fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Shaun|title=Kremlin puppet master's leaked emails are price of return to political frontline|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/26/kremlin-puppet-masters-leaked-emails-vladislav-surkov-east-ukraine|work=The Guardian|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
Washington think tank [[Atlantic Council]]'s Digital Forensic Research Lab conducted an analysis of the emails. They determined that they were genuine, based partially on the routing information.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kramer|first1=Andrew E.|title=Ukrainian Hackers Release Emails Tying Top Russian Official to Uprising|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-emails.html?smid=tw-nytimesworld&amp;smtyp=cur|work=The New York Times|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian entrepreneur [[Yevgeny Chichvarkin]] confirmed that his emails from the document dump were authentic, saying "Yes, this is my original text."&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Russian journalist Svetlana Babaeva also verified that her three emails from the leak were genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amos|first1=Howard|title=Hackers: emails show ties between Kremlin, Ukraine rebels|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_RUSSIA_UKRAINE_HACKING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|work=Associated Press|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kremlin press secretary [[Dmitry Peskov]] suggested that the emails did not belong to Surkov, saying that he "does not use email."&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharkov|first1=Damien|title=Kremlin denies Putin aide's email was hacked—'he does not use email'|url=http://www.newsweek.com/kremlin-denies-putin-aide-hack-because-he-does-not-use-email-514038?rx=us|work=Newsweek|date=27 October 2016|quote='I familiarized myself (with the leak),' he said.

==Publication==
On 23 October 2016, Ukrainian hacker group CyberHunta published correspondence that it alleged was from Surkov's office email account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=КИБЕРХУНТА ПЕРЕДАЕТ ПРИВЕТ СУРКОВУ|url=http://cyberhunta.com/news/kiberhunta-peredaet-privet-surkovu/|publisher=Cyberhunta.com|language=Russian|date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers from the open-source intelligence initiative [[Inform Napalm]] requested additional evidence from an alliance of hacker groups that includes CyberHunta, RUH8, FalconsFlame, and TRINITY. They secured the release of a 1GB Microsoft Outlook data file. Inform Napalm reported that the hackers also were in possession of documents from 2015 and 2016 that were being analysed by intelligence agencies and were not released due to their operational value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bjorn|first1=Falcon|title=SurkovLeaks: 1GB mail cache retrieved by Ukrainian hacktivists (English)|url=https://informnapalm.org/en/surkovleaks/|publisher=Inform Napalm|language=English|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New batches of emails from the leak were further published in November 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stopfake.org/oskolki-russkogo-mira/|title=Осколки «Русского мира»|date=2017-11-13|work=StopFake.org|access-date=2017-11-13|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/leaked-emails-expose-russian-dirty-tricks-cmfkskj82|title=Leaked emails expose Russian dirty tricks|last=Fisher|first=Lucy|date=2018-04-02|work=The Times|access-date=2018-04-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Haynes|first2=Deborah|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The document leak was a [[Microsoft Outlook]] data file (.PST) that included 2,337 emails from the inbox of Surkov's prm_surkova@gov.ru. The released material covers a period from September 2013 to November 2014. The email address appears to have been an office account run by Surkov's aides, including "Masha" and "Yevgenia".&lt;ref name="DFRL"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Digital Forensic Research Lab|title=Breaking Down the Surkov Leaks – DFRLab|url=https://medium.com/dfrlab/breaking-down-the-surkov-leaks-b2feec1423cb#.t4wz7vsnx|website=Medium|publisher=Atlantic Council|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the documents were scans of Surkov's and his family's [[passport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Sean|title=Some hacked e-mails, documents from Putin advisor confirmed as genuine|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/some-hacked-e-mails-documents-from-putin-advisor-confirmed-as-genuine/|work=Ars Technica|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the vast majority of the emails comprise routine briefings and schedules, a small handful are of geopolitical significance or potentially incriminating.&lt;ref name="DFRL"/&gt; These emails illustrate Russian plans to politically destabilize Ukraine and the coordination of affairs with major opposition leaders in separatist east Ukraine.&lt;ref name="IBTUK"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murdock|first1=Jason|title=Surkov leaks: Thousands of hacked emails reportedly from high-ranking Kremlin official published|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/surkov-leaks-thousands-hacked-emails-high-ranking-kremlin-officials-published-1588645|work=International Business Times UK|date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An email sent to Surkov and others on 14 June 2014 by [[Denis Pushilin]], the former Chair of the [[People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic|People's Soviet]] of the [[Donetsk People's Republic]], contains a document listing casualties that occurred from 26 May to 6 June 2014.&lt;ref name="DFRL"/&gt; The list of casualties includes a row for an unnamed soldier listed as "VDV Pskovsky" ("ВДВ Псковский"), a designation for a deployment of [[Russian Airborne Troops]] (VDV) from the city of [[Pskov]].&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; Paratroopers based in Pskov were thought to be among the first of Russia's covert casualties in Ukraine in 2014. The Pskov-based [[76th Guards Air Assault Division]] was awarded the [[Order of Suvorov]] by Putin for unspecified tasks in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian reporters 'attacked at secret soldier burials'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28949582|work=BBC News|date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An email sent to Surkov from a Russian government account on 18 June 2014 detailed the practicalities of Russia absorbing a portion of Ukraine. An email attachment included a briefing paper titled "On the Risks of an Economic Blockade of the LNR and DNR". The paper noted that 30% of the [[Donbass]] electrical supply comes from power plants in [[Zaporizhzhya]]. The document includes suggestions to supplement electrical supply in Donbass with power from the [[Rostov Nuclear Power Plant]] in Russia. The document's author also suggested increasing iron ore shipments and connecting Donbass to the [[Voronezh Oblast]] electricity grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacDonald|first1=Euan|title=Surkov briefed on countering Ukrainian blockade of ‘separatist republics’ |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/russia/surkov-briefed-countering-ukrainian-economic-blockade-separatist-republics.html|work=KyivPost|date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the emails to Surkov from [[Konstantin Malofeev]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukrainian hackers leak emails that show ties between Kremlin, rebels {{!}} Toronto Star|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2016/10/26/ukrainian-hackers-leak-emails-that-show-ties-between-kremlin-rebels.html|work=Toronto Star|agency=Associated Press|date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained a list of recommended candidates for positions in the separatist government prior to their appointments.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

The documents also included a spreadsheet containing the budget for a newspaper in [[Donetsk]].&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt;

On 25 August 2014, a Russian official forwarded an email to Surkov from ''Russian Reporter'' editor Vitaly Leybin. The email bore the title "corrections in the text" and concerned a letter to the Ukrainian government from the "public representatives of the Donbass." A nearly identical article, purportedly from citizens living in Ukraine, appeared in ''Russian Reporter'' days later with only minor changes. Within the week, the letter had appeared on ''[[Russia Today]]'' and other Russian websites.&lt;ref name="DFRL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Общественность Донбасса обратилась к украинцам с требованием остановить войну на востоке страны|url=https://russian.rt.com/article/48117|work=RT|date=2 September 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6layN00y2|archivedate=2016-10-28|language=ru-RU|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the documents included in the leak was a 22-page outline of "a plan to support nationalist and separatist politicians and to encourage early parliamentary elections in Ukraine, all with the aim of undermining the government in [[Kiev]]."&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Standish|first1=Reid|title=Hacked: Putin Aide’s Emails Detail Alleged Plot to Destabilize Ukraine|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/10/25/hacked-putin-aides-emails-detail-alleged-plot-to-destabilize-kiev-surkov-ukraine-leaks/|work=Foreign Policy|date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Fest''' is an annual [[music festival]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], organized by [[Tony Weinbender]], formerly  of [[No Idea Records]]. It is a predominantly [[punk rock]] and [[pop-punk]] festival, though there are also a good number of indie rock, hardcore punk, metal, and ska acts. The Fest first took place May 24 and 25, 2002 and has since attracted a large number of people throughout the years. Bands perform across a variety of venues (varying from small bars to large concert halls) in the downtown Gainesville area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/entertainment/20161026/fifteen-years-of-fest|title=Fifteen years of FEST|work=The Gainesville Sun|first=Levi|last=Bradford|date=October 26, 2016|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fest has also been known for hosting many unofficial house shows. Attendees book the entire [[Holiday Inn]] near the [[University of Florida]] in addition to many surrounding hotels. The Fest takes place each year on the weekend of the Florida-Georgia football game (around Halloween), held in Jacksonville, so downtown Gainesville is left almost entirely to the thousands of people attending and performing at The Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20121025/ENT/121029826 |last=Francischine |first=Tyler |title=The punk-rock infusion of Fest 11|work=The Gainesville Sun|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Teniers the Younger - modello for Theatrum Pictorium 1673.jpg|thumb|Modello for the frontispiece for the ''Theatrum Pictorium'', by Teniers]]
'''''Theatrum Pictorium''''', or ''Theatre of Painting'', is a short-hand name of a book published in the 1660s by [[David Teniers the Younger]] for his employer, the [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]]. It was a catalog of 243 Italian paintings in the Archduke's collection of over 1300 paintings, with engravings of the paintings taken from small models that Teniers had personally prepared. A second edition with page numbers was published in 1673.

During the years 1646-1656  Leopold Wilhelm was governor of the Netherlands and formed one of the greatest art collections of his age. Teniers effectively became its curator after the death of his predecessor [[Jan van den Hoecke]] in 1651. Leopold Wilhelm’s collection came to hold works by [[Hans Holbein the Elder]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Raphael]], [[Giorgione]], [[Paolo Veronese]] and more than 15 works by [[Titian]]. Teniers made a list of the painters in the collection as part of the forward to his 1673 catalog:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Theatrum Pictorium gri 33125009347911 0012.jpg
File:Theatrum Pictorium gri 33125009347911 0013.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This list is an important document that reflects the contemporary taste in paintings in Brussels at that time. Of all the painters, the names [[Magdalena Woutiers]] and [[Madonna Fitta de Milano]] are the only women whose work is documented as being in the Archduke's collection. No matter how illustrious the name however, only works by the better known Italian painters were chosen to be engraved for illustrations. At the end of his governorship, the Archduke and his collection moved to the [[Stallburg]]. This archducal collection now forms the heart of Vienna’s [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]].

Before moving to Vienna in 1659, Archduke Leopold Wilhelm formed his art collection in [[Brussels]], where [[David Teniers the Younger]] painted views of the most prized possessions of his Brussels gallery. He painted several of these in various compositions which are now spread among various collections:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khm.at/en/visit/collections/picture-gallery/history-of-the-collection/ History of the collections] of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Teniers employed a team of 12 engravers for reproducing the 243 paintings in the Theatrum. He produced small copies in oil of each of the chosen paintings, issuing these as models to his engravers and 120 of which were auctioned by the estate of [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7BU-36sK16MC&amp;pg=PA130 Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-century European Paintings in the Robert Lehman Collection: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain and Great Britain], by [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Charles Sterling&lt;/ref&gt; Teniers’ painted copies measuring approximately 17 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm are now spread among various collections. The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] Gallery holds 14 of these works, the largest group in any public collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codart.com/exhibitions/details/1139/ David Teniers and the Theatre of Painting, 19 October 2006 – 21 January 2007] exhibition press release on [[codart]]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 12 engravers, the five who contributed most were [[Jan van Troyen]] with 56, [[Lucas Vorsterman the Younger]] with 52, [[Pieter van Lisebetten]] 40, [[Theodoor van Kessel]] 27, and [[Coryn Boel|Coryn]] or Quirin Boel 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2007/04/vegelin.html History of the project] on website for ''Historians of Netherlandish Art''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Popels]] contributed five engravings.

==Surviving works==
The works listed in the book that survive are generally in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, while the modelli or small models for the engravings have been lost or are in other collections. The engravings and the modelli were inscribed with the dimensions of the original paintings, though their characteristics were often adjusted to take advantage of the maximum illustration possibilities of the album page size. The dimensions were in the form "4 alta 3 lata", which means 4 palm-widths high and 3 palm-widths wide, such as the case with the engraving after [[Francesco Bassano the Younger|Bassano's]] ''Boy with a Flute'':

'''Anthony David Bland''' (21 September 1970 – 3 March 1993) was a supporter of [[Liverpool F.C.]] injured in the [[Hillsborough disaster]]. He suffered severe brain damage that left him in a [[persistent vegetative state]] as a consequence of which the hospital, with the support of his parents, applied for a court order allowing him to 'die with dignity'. As a result, he became the first patient in [[England|English]] legal history to be allowed to die by the courts through the withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment including food and water.

==The Hillsborough disaster==
{{Main|Hillsborough disaster}}
Bland was an 18-year-old Liverpool supporter who travelled with two friends to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]'s [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] football ground for an [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 15 April 1989. During the game, a crush behind the Liverpool goal ensued due to the police losing control of the situation outside the ground. A crush had formed at the outer gates, and the Liverpool fans were eventually let in through a side gate by order of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. However, he failed to close the tunnel access first and thousands more Liverpool fans were sent down this tunnel into pens 3 and 4 which were already overcrowded due to the failure of police officers and club stewards to direct the fans to the appropriate areas. This resulted in the death of 94 people on that day, and a 95th victim in hospital a few days later.

Although Bland survived the initial crush, he had suffered severe brain damage and eventually became the disaster's 96th victim on 3 March 1993, aged 22, after being in a coma for nearly four years. He never regained consciousness and a legal ruling in November 1992 allowed doctors to withdraw his treatment at the request of his family, as there had been no sign of improvement in his condition and the doctors treating him advised that there was no reasonable possibility that he would ever emerge from his persistent vegetative state, and was unlikely to survive more than five years.

== Injuries and prognosis==

Bland suffered serious injuries in the crush at the Leppings Lane terrace. He suffered crushed ribs and two punctured lungs, causing an interruption in the supply of oxygen to his brain. As a result, he sustained catastrophic and irreversible damage to the higher centres of the brain, which had left him in a [[persistent vegetative state]] (PVS).

He was transferred to the care of J. G. Howe, a consultant geriatrician and neurologist at the [[Airedale General Hospital]] near his home in [[Keighley]]. He had some experience in treating those with PVS. Several attempts were made by Howe and his team, along with Bland's father, sister and mother, to try to elicit some response from him and for some signs of interaction. However, all attempts failed. He showed no sign of being aware of anything that took place around him.

[[EEG]] and [[CT scan]]s revealed that whilst the [[brain stem]] remained intact, there was no cortical activity. Indeed, scans subsequently shown to the court showed more space than substance in the relevant part of his brain. His body was being kept alive by artificial nutrition, hydration and constant care. But the medical profession treating him stated that there was no reasonable possibility that he would ever emerge from his vegetative state.

==The law in England and Wales prior to Bland==
===Selective non-treatment of newborn babies===
Prior to Bland, English case law on the non-treatment of patients was restricted to newborn babies. There have been several recorded cases of disabled neonates being 'allowed to die'. A leading case was that of ''[[Re B (a minor)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Re B (a minor)'' [1990] 3 All ER 927&lt;/ref&gt; That case involved a baby with [[Down syndrome]] complicated by [[intestinal obstruction]] which, if left untreated without surgery, would be fatal. The parents felt that it would be in the child's best interests if she were left to die. This was a decision upheld by Lord Justice Dunn at first instance, who lauded the parents' decision as being 'an entirely reasonable one'.

The matter reached the [[Court of Appeal]] who overturned the decision. Any such decision had to be made in the best interests of the child and that the prognosis was that the child would have a reasonable quality of life. However, in other cases, for example ''Re C (a minor) (wardship: medical treatment)'' &lt;ref&gt;''Re C (a minor) (wardship: medical treatment)'' [1989] 2 All ER 782&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Re J (a minor) (wardship: medical treatment)'',&lt;ref&gt;''Re J (a minor) (wardship: medical treatment)'' [1990] 3 All ER 930&lt;/ref&gt; this test has been used to determine that doctors can choose not to treat or provide life prolonging treatment.

===Doctor's potential liability===
In ''R v Arthur''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Arthur'' (1981) 12 BMLR 1&lt;/ref&gt; a baby was born with uncomplicated Down Syndrome and was rejected by the parents. [[Leonard Arthur]], a [[Pediatrics|paediatrician]], wrote in his notes that the 'Parents do not wish it to survive. Nursing care only.' The baby died 69 hours later. During the trial, the defence provided evidence that the child was not physically healthy, resulting in a reduced charge of attempted murder, for which Arthur was acquitted.

This demonstrated that a doctor who deliberately withdrew life-prolonging treatment under any circumstances, and where the patient subsequently died, could be charged with murder. There was a subtle exception. If a patient suffered complications but the doctors felt that it would serve no purpose to apply additional treatments, such as antibiotics to fight infection, as might happen in a case of PVS and the patient subsequently died as a result of the complication then they were not liable under the criminal law. Theoretically, however, they could still find themselves being sued for negligence by the family of the deceased.

In August 1989, four months after Bland was injured, Howe contacted Popper, the Sheffield coroner, who was both legally and medically qualified. He informed Popper of the plan to withdraw all treatment including food and water. This decision had been taken following full consultation with the family and in accordance with their wishes. Howe later said:

{{cquote|It is difficult now [in 2006] to convey my shock on receiving his intimidating reply. Having stated that he [the Coroner] had no jurisdiction over any living person, he advised that I would risk a murder charge should I withdraw treatment. He made it clear that he "... could not countenance, condone, approve or give consent to any action or inaction which could be or could not be construed as being designed or intended to shorten or terminate the life of this young man. This particularly applies to the withholding of the necessities of life, such as food and drink." He requested a reply by return indicating that I had understood his opinion, and whether I would withdraw treatment.}}

The Coroner advised Howe to contact his medical defence society and the Regional Health Authority and copied his letter to the Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (the investigating force), the local regional Health Authority solicitor and Howe's medical defence society. The following day Howe was visited by the police and told that he would be charged with murder if he withdrew treatment and Bland died.

Following the obtaining of the legal advice, which concurred with that of the coroner, the [[Airedale National Health Service Trust]], with the support of Bland's family and Howe, made an application to court to withdraw all life-prolonging treatment. As Bland was unable to speak for himself and was, for legal purposes, deemed an incompetent, the [[Official Solicitor]] was assigned as his [[guardian ad litem|guardian ''ad litem'']]. The Official Solicitor opposed the Trust's application because if the Trust were allowed to pursue the actions proposed by Howe, it would amount in law to the crime of [[murder in English law|murder]].

==The case==
===First instance===
Airedale NHS Trust applied to the courts for a declaration to the effect that:
* they might lawfully discontinue all life-sustaining treatment and medical support measures, including ventilation, nutrition and hydration by artificial means
* any subsequent treatment given should be for the sole purpose of enabling him to end his life in dignity and free from pain and suffering
* if death should then occur, its cause should be attributed to the natural and other causes of his present state
* and that none of those concerned should, as a result, be subject to any criminal or civil liability.

This declaration, apart from the latter part of the declaration{{clarify|which is the latter part?|date=November 2014}} (which was deemed inappropriate{{clarify|by whom, and why?|date=November 2014}}), was granted. The court considered that it was in the patient's best interests for treatment to be withheld and that its discontinuance was in accordance with good medical practice.

Acting on Anthony Bland's behalf, the Official Solicitor appealed this decision.

===The Court of Appeal===
====Expert evidence====
Such was the importance of the case, and the obvious legal ramifications, it attracted a number of expert witnesses to give evidence. These included Professor [[Bryan Jennett]] who, along with Professor [[Fred Plum]], coined the term 'persistent vegetative state' in 1972. Professor Jennett expressed the view that it would be in accordance with good medical practice in the case of Anthony Bland to withdraw the nasogastric artificial feeding. He considered that there was no benefit to continue with the treatment as there was no prospect of recovery of cognitive function.

Other experts in the field of neurology gave evidence. Amongst those was Professor [[Peter O'Behan]] who examined Bland on behalf of the Official Solicitor. Like the experts who gave evidence for the Airedale Trust, Prof. O'Behan's evidence was pessimistic. He stated:

{{cquote|I am confident that from my knowledge of other patients, neuropsychology, previous cases from the literature and from animal experimentation that the patient has no awareness nor can he suffer pain or experience pleasure. Further the prospect of improvement can also confidently be answered since based on what we know of the degree of damage to his brain, the comparison of his case with those recorded in the literature (particularly considering the nature of his damage and the duration of his illness) and the type of systems and signs he exhibits, there is no hint or hope or any prospect of improvement.}}

==Inquest and failed legal challenge==
On 21 December 1993, [[Bradford]] coroner James Turnbull recorded a verdict of accidental death on Tony Bland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/hillsborough-victim-died-accidentally-coroner-says-withdrawal-of-treatment-not-to-blame-1469037.html|title=Hillsborough victim died 'accidentally': Coroner says withdrawal of|author=MALCOLM PITHERS, Northern Correspondent|date=22 December 1993|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same verdict was recorded on the other 95 victims (94 who died on the day of the disaster and a 95th who died a few days later) at the main Hillsborough inquest in March 1991, much to the dismay of the bereaved families who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing and for manslaughter charges to be brought against the police who had been patrolling the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/28/newsid_2531000/2531015.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY - 28 - 1991: Family anger at Hillsborough verdict|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 2016, during the second inquest on all 96 victims, a verdict of Unlawful Killing was issued on all 96 victims. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hillsborough-disaster-verdict-unlawful-killing-david-duckenfield-ruling-by-inquests-jury-over-1989-a7001276.html|title=Hillsborough disaster verdict: Inquest jury delivers 'unlawful killing' ruling over 1989 football deaths|author=Ian Herbert|date=26 April 2016|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Bland's death, a priest and anti-abortion campaigner, Fr James Morrow, started a legal challenge to have the doctor who withdrew his treatment charged with murder, but this was rejected by the [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] in April 1994.

On 28 June 2017, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] announced that David Duckenfield, the police commander, would be charged with manslaughter by gross negligence in relation to the deaths of the other 95 victims, but a charge could not apply in relation to Bland because he died outside of the time limit that was applicable for the time of the alleged offence.&lt;ref&gt;http://cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/hillsborough-charging-decisions/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral and legal issues==
The case brought up a number of moral and legal issues. As a result, the number of previous cases referred to is extensive.

This case is another which delegated to the ''Bolam'' standard. This was a test introduced by the courts in ''[[Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee]]''. The essence of the ''Bolam'' standard is such as to remove liability from medical staff if the treatment they have provided to a patient under the particular circumstances would have been followed by a responsible body of medical personnel, exercising due skill and care in the process. Under Bolam, a doctor need only show that he was following an accepted medical practice - even if that practice was only followed by a minority of medical professionals. This was one of the arguments put forward on behalf of Dr. Howe; that it would be intolerable if Dr. Howe was charged with murder for following what he submitted to be generally regarded as good medical practice.

A long-time critic of the ''Bland'' case, Dr [[Jacqueline Laing]] argues that the implications of the judicial decision deserve revisiting given recent Freedom of Information Act requests revealing financial incentives and staggering compliance{{clarify|what is that supposed to mean?|date=November 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Laing, J 2012 'A Lethal Power?' New Law Journal, 162, 1444&lt;/ref&gt; in rolling out the 2008 NHS End-Of-Life Care strategy. She warns that Bland has been dangerously extended by the Mental Capacity Act 2005 so that novel third parties now have power to remove treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, J 2004 'Mental Capacity Bill - A threat to the vulnerable' New Law Journal 154, 1165. Laing, J 2005 'The Mental Capacity Bill 2004: Human Rights Concerns' Family Law Journal 35, 137-143. Laing, J 2008 'Food and Fluids: Human Law, Human Rights and Human Interests' in Artificial Nutrition and Hydration C. Tollefsen, ed., Springer Press, pp. 77-100 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Andrew Devine==
Tony Bland was one of two people injured at Hillsborough to have been diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. The other was 22-year-old Andrew Devine, also from the Liverpool area, who also suffered massive brain damage as a result of being deprived of oxygen due to crush injuries and in the immediate aftermath of the disaster his parents were warned by doctors that he was likely to die within a few months. In 1994, five years after the disaster and one year after the death of Tony Bland, Devine's family claimed to have seen him following a moving object with his eyes. By March 1997, Devine was able to communicate to others using a touch-sensitive buzzer to answer "yes" or "no" to questions asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/flicker-of-hope-from-brain-damage-victim-astonishes-doctors-1275217.html|title=Flicker of hope from brain damage victim astonishes doctors|author=Annabel Ferriman|date=27 March 1997|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the disaster's 20th anniversary in April 2009, it was reported that he continues to show signs of awareness around him but his condition has barely improved since he was first reported to have emerged from the coma 12 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/04/11/hillsborough-remembered-moving-devotion-of-a-mum-and-dad-whose-son-has-been-comatose-for-20-years-115875-21272202/|title=Hillsborough remembered: Moving devotion of a mum and dad whose son has been comatose for 20 years|author=Kate Mansey|date=11 April 2009|work=mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 460''', adopted on 21 December 1979, after taking note of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], the Council decided to terminate measures taken against [[Southern Rhodesia]] in resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 232|232]] (1966) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 253|253]] (1968) and any subsequent resolutions. The resolution deplored the "loss of life, waste and suffering" over the past 14 years caused by the rebellion in Southern Rhodesia.

The resolution went on to dissolve the Committee established in Resolution 253, and commended Member States, particularly the front-line states, for their implementation of the sanctions against Southern Rhodesia. The Council demanded urgent assistance from the international community to the [[Zimbabwe]]an people, and reminded the parties to uphold the agreement. 

Resolution 460 ended by calling upon the administering power, the United Kingdom, to ensure that no South African forces or other [[mercenary|mercenaries]] remain or enter the country. Finally, the Council decided to keep the situation under review until Southern Rhodesia gained full independence (as Zimbabwe).

The resolution was adopted by 13 votes to none, while [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] abstained.

'''Youth of the Nation''' was an annual [[Christian]] Youth Conference held for 15 years in [[Wanganui]], New Zealand. Unlike many other Christian conferences, YOTN was not held by one specific church or denomination. Youth of the Nation conferences and events were hosted by The Youth Of The Nation Trust in collaboration with other churches from around New Zealand. For the first 8 years the conferences were hosted by the [[Wanganui Christian Youth Workers]]&lt;ref&gt;The official Youth of the Nation Website {{cite web|url=http://www.yotn.net.nz/mainindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014011528/http://www.yotn.net.nz/mainindex.html |archivedate=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; collective, a group of Christian youth pastors &amp; workers from different denominations &amp; churches across the city of Wanganui. This collective included representatives from [[Anglican]], [[Apostolic Church (denomination)|Apostolic]], [[Assemblies of God]], [[Baptist]], [[Open Brethren]], [[Catholic]], Incedo, [[Presbyterian]], Christian Outreach Centre—now known as International Network of Churches—, [[Elim Pentecostal Church|Elim]], [[Salvation Army]], &amp; non-denominational. From 2012 until 2018, the YOTN Trust partnered with churches, not only in Wanganui, but from across New Zealand to host events in different cities.

== Introduction ==

Youth of the Nation (YOTN) aimed to encourage and empower Christian young people to pursue [[Jesus Christ]] with a zeal that will impact their generation. As an event, the goal was to provide a 3-4 day event that was affordable for more New Zealand young people, while maintaining the standards &amp; excellence of some of the leading national conferences.

The vision to hold YOTN came from Wanganui [[Assemblies of God|A/G]] youth pastor, [[Ben Hoyle]]. In 2003, Ben approached the local city youth workers to hold the conference as a city. He recognised that for one church to put on such a large event was too much, and that together the city could pull its resources and achieve the goal. With many of the city youth workers on board, plans were made to hold the very first conference in July 2004.

Each year YOTN gained momentum seeing attendance grow and more young people leave excited about their faith.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"YOTN continues to build in its momentum, magnitude and excellence. It is great to see more and more young people coming and leaving radically changed. The greatest thrill for me is seeing the hunger in the younger generation for the reality of God and a deep desire to walk in God's ways. Long may it continue." - ''[[Illiafi Esera|Ps Iliafi Esera]] (Faith City Church A/G, [[Wanganui]])''&lt;ref&gt;quoted from "Youth of The Nation IV Report" Empowered Magazine Spring 2007 Edition Page 10&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the event moved from the Wanganui Central Baptist Church, where it had been held for 6 years, to the School Hall at Wanganui City College. Then in 2012, YOTN IX was moved to the War Memorial Hall Convention Centre which seats 1500 people, where the conference was held until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Wanganui Chronicle]]'' Monday 16 July 2012 Page A4&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Hoyle resigned as YOTN director in 2018 and Youth of the Nation Trust &amp; events were absorbed into the Fearless Movement of the Assemblies of God NZ under the leadership of Ps Mike Coe from [[Timaru]]. YOTN held it's final conference in April 2018 at Whanganui Central Bpatist Church. The theme for 2018 was 'Possible' and involved reflecting on the past 15 years. Ps Ben Hoyle spoke the final message of conference and Ps Mike Coe closed the conference by announcing the future with Fearless.&lt;ref&gt;''Empowered Magazine'' Edition #2 August 2018 Page 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;
