The '''1977 Bangladesh Air Force mutiny''' was a [[mutiny]] in Dhaka on 1 October 1977 by members of Bangladesh Air force and the Signal corps of Bangladesh Army.&lt;ref name="ffd"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh Says It Has Put Down An Armed Coup |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/02/archives/bangladesh-says-it-has-put-down-an-armed-coup-59-freed-by-hijackers.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2 October 1977 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Bangladesh was under a military government headed by President [[Ziaur Rahman]] who had come to power through a coup. The government of Bangladesh was busy with the [[Japan Airlines Flight 472 (1977)|Japan Airlines Flight 472]] hijacking and the exchange of hostages for ransom.&lt;ref name="ffd" /&gt; The [[Japanese Red Army]] had hijacked the plane and landed it in [[Tejgaon Airport]] in [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref name="hbk"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tales of critical times |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/tales-of-critical-times |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hijackers were warned of the mutiny and told to take defensive position if they saw armed personnel moving towards the plane by the air control tower.&lt;ref name="kjn"&gt;{{cite document |last=Masters |first=Edward E. |authorlink=Edward E.

The '''Accra International Conference Centre''' is an events venue in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]]. Other venues include the [[Ghana Trade Fair Center]] and the [[National Theatre (Accra)|National Theatre]], but the Conference Centre is the most popular due to its size and capacity as compared to the National Theatre, and at the same time smaller than the [[Ghana Trade Fair Centre]] (which was built to host pan-African events).

== Location ==
It is located in the Christiansborg area in Accra Osu and is close to a number of important locations such as the [[Parliament of Ghana]], the [[Accra Sports Stadium]], the [[Independence Arch (Accra)|Independence Square ]] and the [[Black Star Square]].

The '''Bembe''' are an ethnic and linguistic group based in the eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and western [[Tanzania]]. In 1991 the Bembe population of the DRC was estimated to number 252,000 and around 1.5 million in 2005 with no estimate available for the number of Bembe in [[Tanzania]]&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bmb Bembe, ethnologue.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and demography==
The Bembe (Babembe, Beembe, Cuabembe, Wabembe) originate from northeast of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and western [[Tanzania]]. They are representative of numerous ethnic traditions including [[Lega people|Lega]], pre-Lega, Boyo-Kunda, and Bemba. They are a tough and proud people who absorbed other populations and their systems of thought in the process of carving out their current homeland in a time of widespread conflict and under economic pressure from European invaders and slave traders during the 19th century.

The Bembe in [[Congo-Brazzaville]] number 60 to 80,000, mostly living on the plateaus situated to the north of the [[Congo River]], as well as on the shores of [[Stanley Pool]] and in the cities of [[Brazzaville]], [[Dolisie]], and [[Pointe-Noire]]. The Bembe traditionally had close contacts with their neighbors the [[Teke people|Teke]], but influence from the [[Kongo Kingdom]] was essential to their culture and traditions. In Tanzania, some of the Bembe people have become a part of Manyema, and [[Swahili people]] due to culture and language loss. Originally natives of [[Kigoma]] region, the Bembe people of [[Tanzania]] have stretched throughout the country from their home land of [[Kigoma]] to the island of [[Zanzibar]].

==Cultural traditions==
Their social organisation was based on the matrimonial clan, whose members could live in several villages. The family unit generally included three generations. The chief in charge of the village, the nga-bula, mediated with the ancestors.

Hunting was the main activity; before leaving on a hunt, the leader would invoke the ancestral spirits, using as intermediaries statuettes kneeling in the position of a hunter waiting for his prey. The Bembe believed in a creator god, Nzambi, whom they did not depict figuratively. He was the master of the life and death – unless the latter was due to the act of a sorcerer, ndoki, who could magically “eat” the life force of clan members. The ancestors had close ties with the living and received offerings through the “priest” who made appeals to statuettes, the kitebi or bimbi, consecrated by the sorcerer. These figurines were the idealized images of the ancestors and would often wear attributes that allowed them to be identified as medicine men or hunters. The ancestor worship among the Bembe is older, though, and precedes the use of magic statues, [[nkisi]], by the sorcerers.

The Bembe people of [[Tanzania]] have lost their culture for the most part, and the Bembe language is slowly fading. Most of the youth under the age of 30 are unable to speak their mother tongue; instead, they use [[Swahili language|Swahili]] as their first language and follow [[Swahili culture|Swahili]] culture and traditions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==''Bimbi'' figures==
In terms of artistic practice, the Beembe have much in common with other [[Kongo people|Kongo groups]], such as the use of [[nkisi]] figures. However, Bimbi figures are the most distinctive form of Beembe sculpture. ''Bimbi'' are meticulously carved ancestral figures rendered in idealized form. They display extensive geometric incisions representing scarification on their abdomens, and their eyes are inlaid with ceramic or shell shards. ''Bimbi'' typically have a small cavity between their legs, into which medicinal substances were inserted; this practice endowed the figures with protective powers. &lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure usually is upright with knees slightly bent, its large feet with carefully articulated toes standing on the base; the seated position occurs less frequently. Female statuettes have a pronounced, almost square, chin, a large nose and mouth, finely sculpted ears, and hair carved in relief on the forehead. The hands of male sculptures’ are typically turned toward one another and are carrying implements that represent the ancestor's profession in life.

The '''White Liberation Movement''' ({{lang-af|'''Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging'''}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''BBB''') was a small but notorious [[South Africa]]n [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] organisation which became infamous after being banned under the [[Apartheid]] regime, the first [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] organisation to be so banned. It regarded itself as the most [[Far-right politics|far-right]] organisation in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Arthur ''Victory Or Violence - The Story of the AWB of South Africa'' Ostara Publications (2008) p111&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organisation was formed in June 1985 by Professor Johan Schabort.&lt;ref name="Zille 1988 p61"&gt;[[Helen Zille|Zille, Helen]], ''The Right Wing in South African Politics'' in Berger, Peter L. and Godesell, Bobby (editors) ''A Future South Africa: visions, strategies and realities'' Human and Rouseau (1988) p61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/submitted/etd-08022006-105452/unrestricted/04chapter4.pdf HOOFSTUK IV, NEO-NAZISME IN SUID-AFRIKA: MIMETIESE FASCISME, 1970-1995,  p. 157  "Die Ideologiese Grondslae En Ontwikkeling Van Die Blanke Fascistiese Bewegings In Suid-Afrika, 1945- 1995,"  (The ideological foundations and development of white fascist movements in South Africa, 1945-1999) M.A. Thesis University of Pretoria (1999) Visser, Myda Marista] p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; It started as the support organisation for Schabort's ''Blanke Party'' (White Party), which existed only in name.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Arthur ''Victory Or Violence - The Story of the AWB of South Africa'' Ostara Publications (2008) p96&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1987 the BBB went public and sought to recruit members,&lt;ref&gt;Kotzé, H. &amp; Greyling, A., ''Political Organisations in South Africa A-Z'' Tafelberg Publishers (1994) p111&lt;/ref&gt; aiming at both Afrikaners and British whites.

Its honorary leader was Theuns Stoffberg, a former member of the [[Greyshirts]]. Another notable member was Keith Conroy,&lt;ref name="upetd.up.ac.za"&gt;[http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/submitted/etd-08022006-105452/unrestricted/04chapter4.pdf HOOFSTUK IV, NEO-NAZISME IN SUID-AFRIKA: MIMETIESE FASCISME, 1970-1995,  p. 157  "Die Ideologiese Grondslae En Ontwikkeling Van Die Blanke Fascistiese Bewegings In Suid-Afrika, 1945- 1995,"  (The ideological foundations and development of white fascist movements in South Africa, 1945-1999) M.A. Thesis University of Pretoria (1999) Visser, Myda Marista] p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; an Englishman who would later become Kommandant of the AWB's 'Iron Guard'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/keef-of-croydon-stokes-sa-race-fires-english-immigrant-who-heads-awbs-iron-guard-could-be-deported-1494521.html|title='Keef' of Croydon stokes SA race fires: English immigrant who heads|date=29 June 1993|publisher=|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
In August 1987 Schabort attended and spoke at a commemorative service for [[Rudolf Hess]] organised by the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB).&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Arthur ''Victory Or Violence - The Story of the AWB of South Africa'' Ostara Publications (2008) p56&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB would organise inflammatory meeting and marches. The BBB sought to link with international right-wing organisations.&lt;ref name="Kotzé, H. 1994 p112"&gt;Kotzé, H. &amp; Greyling, A., ''Political Organisations in South Africa A-Z'' Tafelberg Publishers (1994) p112&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBB ran a "blatantly racist"&lt;ref name="Kotzé, H. 1994 p112"/&gt; bilingual magazine ''Kommando: Stem van die Blankedom/Kommando: Voice of the White Race'' published by Alan Harvey. Harvey was deputy leader of the South [[Natal Province|Natal]] branch&lt;ref name="upetd.up.ac.za"/&gt; (its leader was Peter Smith); Harvey had previously published and edited the ''South African Patriot'' magazine in [[Durban]], under the "Patriotic Press" imprint.&lt;ref name="upetd.up.ac.za"/&gt; This magazine carried advertisements of several far right organisations around the world, including [[David Duke]]’s the [[National Association for the Advancement of White People]], ''[[National Vanguard (publication)|National Vanguard]]'' magazine issued by the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], ''[[Instauration]]'' magazine, the British cultural magazine Heritage and Destiny, the National Front’s ''Nationalism Today'' (to which Harvey contributed both under his own name and under the pseudonym "John Humphries"), and ''NF News''.&lt;ref name="upetd.up.ac.za"/&gt; Harvey contributed to the BBB’s publication under his own name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/submitted/etd-08022006-105452/unrestricted/04chapter4.pdf Harvey, A.D., The "Save Rhodesia Campaign"-why it failed.

==Ban==
The BBB was banned, and restrictions were placed on the political activities of Schabort in November 1988, in reaction to the massacre of black people in Pretoria by

In December 1988 Schabort re-launched the BBB as the ''Blanke Nasionale Beweging'' (White National Movement) under the nominal leadership of Wynand de Beer; however as its activities were clearly the same as the BBB it was banned in the beginning of 1989.

The government lifted the ban on the BBB in February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Truth and Reconcilliation Commission report Vol 6, section 3, chapter 6 p446&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvet.org.za/displayvideo.php?vid=2D-F5-64|title=CVET - Community Video Education Trust|website=www.cvet.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schabort officially disbanded the BBB and the ''Blanke Party'' in 1990 and joined the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;van Rooyen, Johann ''Hard Right: The New White Power in South Africa'' I.B. Tauris (2004) p96&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the BBB like Keith Conroy would go on to support the [[Afrikaner Volksfront]].

===Later events===
A few members, led by Jean Pierre du Plessis, sought to continue the BBB, with the BBB as the political wing to which would be added an underground organisation called the National Socialist Partisans (NSP). Schabort chose not to become involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/amntrans/pta/plessis.htm Truth and Reconcilliation Amnesty Hearings]&lt;/ref&gt; Du Plessis continued to form the NSP as a [[Clandestine cell system|cell]] ; its flag was "basically white with a red cross and a [[swastika]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/amntrans/pta/vanwyk.htm|title=Truth and Reconcilliation Amnesty Hearings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSP members were arrested in 1991 for the murder of three black people at [[Louis Trichardt]].

Following a bombing of a taxi rank in [[Germiston]] on 26 April 1994 which killed ten people it was claimed in the press that the BBB were responsible; Schabort denied the BBB was responsible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1994/04/26/4/20.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703112954/http://152.111.1.88/argief/berigte/beeld/1994/04/26/4/20.html |archivedate=3 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] described the BBB's ideology as "refined nazism".&lt;ref&gt;Truth and Reconcilliation Commission report Vol 6, section 3, chapter 6 pp445-446&lt;/ref&gt; Schabort himself described the organisation as "openly racist".&lt;ref name="Zille 1988 p61"/&gt; It was [[white supremacist]] and against [[race mixing]]. The BBB regarded blacks as 'mud people' or 'mud race'.&lt;ref name="Kotzé, H. 1994 p112"/&gt; The BBB sought the 'repatriation' (expulsion) of blacks from South Africa, "by violence if necessary".&lt;ref name="Zille 1988 p61"/&gt; It was openly [[Anti-semitism|anti-semitic]], regarding [[Jews]] as existing between white and blacks, and [[Holocaust denial|denied the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Visser, Myda Marista ''Die Ideologiese Grondslae En Ontwikkeling Van Die Blanke Fascistiese Bewegings In Suid-Afrika, 1945- 1995'' (The ideological foundations and development of white fascist movements in South Africa, 1945-1999) M.A. Thesis University of Pretoria (1999) p161&lt;/ref&gt; The BBB was against [[democracy]] and sought a new economic order.

The AWB criticised the BBB for being anti-Christian and atheistic; the BBB's tendency was towards the [[Creativity (religion)|Church of the Creator]]. The BBB used the [[odal rune]] as its symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Visser, Myda Marista ''Die Ideologiese Grondslae En Ontwikkeling Van Die Blanke Fascistiese Bewegings In Suid-Afrika, 1945- 1995'' (The ideological foundations and development of white fascist movements in South Africa, 1945-1999) M.A. Thesis University of Pretoria (1999) p164&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Eugene Worthington''' (January 31, 1936  &amp;ndash; August 14, 2008) was the U.S. former [[honorary consul]] of the [[Cook Islands]] to the United States.&lt;ref name=st&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=Kamehameha grad grew isle ties|url=http://starbulletin.com/2008/08/22/news/story13.html |work=[[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |publisher=|date=2008-08-22 |accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worthington also served as the director of financial and scholarship services at his alma mater, the [[Kamehameha Schools]], from 1974 until 2003.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

Additionally, Worthington served on the [[executive board]] of the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]] and helped to organize the historic [[Hokule'a]] voyage from Hawaii to [[Tahiti]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; He also worked behind the scenes at a large number of other important [[Culture of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] and [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] cultural, educational, athletic and political institutions including the [[Festival of Pacific Arts]], the [[East-West Center]], [[Prince Kuhio Hawaiian Civic Club]] and [[Gates Millennium Scholars]] Program.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Bob Worthington was born in [[Laie]] on the island of [[Oahu]] on January 31, 1936.&lt;ref name=st/&gt; He attended the [[Kamehameha Schools|Kamehameha School for Boys]] [[boarding school]], from which he graduated from in 1955.&lt;ref name=st/&gt; Worthington served as President of the [[student body]] during his senior year at Kamehameha.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt;

He earned a scholarship to [[Occidental College]] in California where he received his bachelor's degree in [[political science]].&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

Worthington moved to the Cook Islands, where he married his Cook Islander wife, Jean Rereao Karika Worthington. He and his family returned to Hawaii in 1974.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

=== Career ===
Worthington was considered to be an advocate of closer cultural ties between Hawaii and other Polynesian island nations, especially the Cook Islands, [[French Polynesia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=ha&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=Kamehameha's 'liaison to the South Pacific', 72 |url=http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008808210349 |work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |publisher=|date=2008-08-21 |accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also advocated for a renewed interest in Polynesian and Hawaiian culture, even before the beginning of the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

Worthington became the director of financial services at the [[Kamehameha Schools]] in 1973.  He remained in that position until his retirement in 2003.&lt;ref name=st/&gt; Under Worthington's guidance, the Kamehameha Schools established [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange]] programs with Polynesian communities in the Cook Islands, New Zealand, [[American Samoa]] and [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref name=st/&gt; For example, he established links between the Kamehameha Schools and a [[Māori people|Māori]] school in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt; During Worthington's thirty year [[tenure]] as financial director, the Kamehameha Schools grew to administer over 15,500 scholastic awards totalling more than $25.4 million.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt;

Worthington placed significant importance on the establishment of cultural, political, [[artistic]] and economic ties between Hawaii and other parts of the [[Pacific Islands|Pacific]], particularly [[Polynesia]]. During the 1980s, Hawaiians artists were not invited to take part in the [[Festival of Pacific Arts]] because Hawaii was considered to be too closely associated only with the United States.&lt;ref name=pina&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=PIAF says farewell to Robert E. Worthington |url=http://www.pina.com.fj/?p=pacnews&amp;m=read&amp;o=28323152648b4ae4a408084f98e2ae&amp;PHPSESSID=e42ac59703c59721f0d0f7893bc650d0|work=[[Pacific Islands News Association]] |publisher=|date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worthington worked behind the scenes to promote the inclusion of Hawaiians in the Festival of Pacific Arts and today Hawaii is a full participant in the event, which takes place every four years.&lt;ref name=pina/&gt;

=== Honorary Consul of the Cook Islands ===
Worthington was appointed the [[honorary consul]] of the [[Cook Islands]] to the United States in 1985.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt;&lt;ref name=pacma&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Long-Time Cook Islands Honorary Counsul Dies|url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/22/long-time-cook-islands-honorary-counsul-dies|work=Honolulu Advertiser|publisher=[[Pacific Magazine]]|date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2008-09-04}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His position, which was based in Hawaii, was formally recognized by the [[United States Department of State]] on March 19, 1985.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt; Worthington, in his capacity as honorary consul, helped to promote tourism in the Cook Islands, expand ties with the United States including Hawaii, secure and negotiate [[landing rights]] in [[Rarotonga]], and expand the Cook Islander [[papaya]] industry.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt; He served as honorary consul for more than twenty years.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt;

In early 2008, the Foreign Minister of Cook Islands [[Wilkie Rasmussen]] announced the closure of the Cook Islands consulate office in Hawaii, which was held by Worthington, due to rising costs and expenses.&lt;ref name=cig&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Hawaii Honorary Consul to Go|url=http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/view_release.php?release_id=1171|work=[[Politics of the Cook Islands|Government of the Cook Islands]]|publisher=|date=2008-02-11|accessdate=2008-09-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005221543/http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/view_release.php?release_id=1171|archivedate=2008-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Bob Worthington died in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], on August 14, 2008, at the age of 72.&lt;ref name=st/&gt; He was survived by his wife, Jean Rereao Karika Worthington; his five children - Teanaroa Paka Nakahili Worthington, Manavaroa Kamaki Worthington, Tapaarii Karika Ki'ilehua Worthington, Tevairangi Marae-Hino Pa'ahana Worthington Lopez and Moana Jean Karika Rule; and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name=ha/&gt;

Worthington's funeral and memorial service was held at the [[Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] Memorial Chapel on the at the Kamehameha Schools in [[Kapalama]], Hawaii.&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; Guests, which included former Cook Islands Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry, came from as far away as New Zealand, Australia, Tahiti and the rest of United States. Worthington's ashes were sprinkled from the Hokule'a into the Pacific Ocean off [[Waikiki]].&lt;ref name=cih&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=Bob’s last journey|url=http://www.ciherald.co.ck/articles/h422c.htm|work=[[Cook Islands Herald]] |publisher=|date=2008-08-30 |accessdate=2008-09-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014140121/http://www.ciherald.co.ck/articles/h422c.htm |archivedate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate "spiritual ceremony" was held in honor of Worthington at the [[Taputapuatea marae]] on the island of [[Raiatea]] in [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title='Spiritual Ceremony' On Raiatea For Hawaii's Late Bob Worthington|url=http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2008/08/27/spiritual-ceremony-on-raiatea-for-hawaiis-late-bob-worthington|work=[[Tahitipresse]]|publisher=Pacific Magazine|date=2008-08-27|accessdate=2008-09-04}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worthington had been best known in French Polynesia for his part in the organization of the first Hawaii to Tahiti voyage of the Hokule'a Polynesian sailing canoe voyage in 1975 through the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]].&lt;ref name=pm/&gt; Another memorial service was held for local Cook Islanders in Sinai Hall in the Cook Islands.&lt;ref name=cih2&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=Locals pay tribute to Bob|url=http://www.ciherald.co.ck/articles/h422d.htm|work=[[Cook Islands Herald]] |publisher=|date=2008-08-30 |accessdate=2008-09-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014084022/http://www.ciherald.co.ck/articles/h422d.htm |archivedate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Prime Minister of the Cook Islands [[Geoffrey Henry]], who attended Worthington's [[funeral|memorial service]] in Hawaii, spoke of his contributions to the Cook Islands, "Bob was always there, incessantly helpful, with iconic efficiency, grace and enthusiasm. He helped secure the support of the [[governor of Hawaii]], allowing us to establish our first office in the United States."&lt;ref name=st/&gt;

Current Cook Islands Prime Minister [[Jim Marurai]] also issued a statement in reaction to Worthington's death saying, "’Bob worked tirelessly for the Cook Islands, ensuring that we took full advantage of the close ties with Hawaii, especially in trade ([[maile lei]]s), scholarships ([[University of Hawaii]], [[East-West Center]]), training and various conferences and workshops."&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;

The '''Brahman''' languages, [[Biyom language|Biyom]] and [[Tauya language|Tauya]], form a subbranch of the [[Rai Coast languages|Rai Coast]] branch of the [[Madang languages]] of Papua New Guinea. The family is named after the cattle station and town of [[Brahman, Papua New Guinea|Brahman]], which lies between the territories of the two languages. 

==Genetic relations==

John Z'graggen (1971, 1975) classified four languages as Brahman, [[Biyom language|Biyom]], [[Faita language|Faita]], [[Isabi language|Isabi]], [[Tauya language|Tauya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.ethnologue.com/15/show_family.asp?subid=91600 Brahman], in the 15th edition of ''Ethnologue''&lt;/ref&gt;
Ross (2005) broke up Brahman, placing Faita among the [[Sogeram languages]] (another sub-branch of Madang) and Isabi among the unrelated [[Goroka languages]] – a position followed by Usher (2018).

[[File:Neerdalen van Celedon over het plein La Virgen Blanca.jpg|thumb|300px|The popular descent of Celedón.]]

'''Celedón''' is a symbol of the villager native of [[Alava]]. Wearing a beret and dressed in a traditional blouse, always accompanied by an [[umbrella]], the personage has been located by the historians in diverse environments. This man or personage opens the holidays of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] in the [[País Vasco|Basque]] province of Araba-[[Álava]] in [[Spain]].

== History ==
Celedón's descent was invented in 1957 by a group of Vitorians anxious to offer the city a particular stamp. They created the decrease of the personage to establish an analogy between the doll and the peasants of the province who were approaching the city to celebrate the holidays.

The tradition affirms that it was born in [[Zalduondo]], a small village of [[Alava]], which in today give wine. They say that the personage was called Juan Celedonio de Anzola. Other investigators aim that Celedón was a brigadier of the Army Carlist born in [[Andagoya]], whose name was Celedón Aguiluz. Since the personage of Celedón was created in 1957, four people have given the body to the legend: Jose Luis Isasi, who supported the title for 22 years, Enrique Oribe, who substituted in 1976, Iñaki Landa, who personified the villager of [[Zalduondo]] from 1980 until 2000, and Gorka Ortiz Urbina that made a début as Celedón in 2001.

== Celedonio Alzola ==
In hindsight, Celedón's "flight" known by the people that live in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], remains the passion for the [[Virgen Blanca Festivities]] of a villager of [[Zalduondo]] in the end of the 18th century. He was called Celedonio Alzola and apparently, was proclaimed as a protagonist of the holidays as soon as he got to [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]]. He used to invite all the persons to go with him and to enjoy all together the celebrations and the holidays of the city. It is also believed that Celedonio lived in a street called "The Shoe Store Street" between 1796 and 1866 and was a very famous bricklayer that used to go to bars with his friends.

In 1957, a group of blouses designed the descent of a doll from the belfry of the [[Iglesia de San Miguel (Vitoria)|Church of San Miguel]] up to the New Square to give the beginning of the holidays of the [[Virgen Blanca]]. The first descent was a fail so they decided to get a person to solve the problem and the idea was a success. The person who appeared was Jose Luis Isasi, in the Town hall of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]]. Since then only four people have been chosen by the squads of blouses and neskas who have personified Celedón or the villager of [[Zalduondo]].

== 50th anniversary of the descent of the Celedón ==
2007 was the 50th anniversary of the descent of Celedón, which went down for the first time in the year 1957. In his first descent the rope broke, although this fact did not prevent Isasi going out to the balcony and giving the beginning to the holidays. On the 50th anniversary Gorka Ortiz de Urbina and Iñaki Landa made an emotive opening procession together, and in the balcony they resembled Isasi, who was away because of a serious disease.

Nowadays in the "balconada" of San Miguel it is possible to see Celedón's sculpture; this sculpture takes the face of Jose Luis Isasi Moltalbán, the first Celedón and one of the creators of Celedón's figure.

'''Climate justice''' is a term used for framing [[global warming]] as an [[ethical]] and [[political]] issue, rather than one that is purely environmental or physical in nature. This is done by relating  the [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] to concepts of [[justice]], particularly [[environmental justice]] and [[social justice]] and by examining issues such as [[egalitarianism|equality]], [[human rights]], [[Individual and group rights|collective rights]], and the historical responsibilities for [[climate change]]. A fundamental proposition of climate justice is that those who are least responsible for climate change suffer its gravest consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Global Humanitarian Forum (1 October 2009) [http://blogit.realwire.com/?ReleaseID=13791 Kofi Annan launches climate justice campaign track], Global Humanitarian Formum, 1 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2011/03/climate-change-impact-injustice/1#.Vb53mXjSZek Wendy Koch, Study: Climate change affects those least responsible], ''[[USA Today]]'', March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/de/node/270716 Africa Speaks up on Climate Change] This appeal states: "In wealthy countries, the looming climate crisis is a matter of concern, as it will affect the wellbeing of the economy. But in Africa, which is hardly contributing to climate change in the first place, it will be a matter of life and death."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term climate justice is also used to mean actual legal action on climate change issues.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example the Climate Justice Programme's [http://www.climatelaw.org/ Climate Law Database].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a report of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] identified 894 ongoing legal actions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Patricia Jolly, [https://www.lemonde.fr/climat/article/2018/10/09/les-pays-bas-sommes-par-la-justice-d-intensifier-leur-lutte-contre-le-changement-climatique_5366987_1652612.html "Les Pays-Bas sommés par la justice d’intensifier leur lutte contre le changement climatique"], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 9 October 2018 (page visited on 18 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for the differential effects of climate change ==
[[File:Mobilization for Climate Justice- Stop Chevron.jpg|thumb|Rally for climate justice (2009).]]
The ability of populations to mitigate and adapt to the negative consequences of climate change are shaped by factors such as income, race, class, gender, capital and political representation.&lt;ref name="ref 100"/&gt; As low-income communities and communities of color possess few if any adaptive resources, they are particularly vulnerable to climate change.&lt;ref name="ref 100"&gt;{{cite book |last=Christian-Smith |first=Juliet |title=A twenty-first century US water policy |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199859443 |author2=Peter H.

== History of the term's use ==

In 2000, at the same time as the [[UNFCCC#2000 – COP 6, The Hague, Netherlands|Sixth Conference of the Parties (COP 6)]], the first Climate Justice Summit took place in [[The Hague]]. This summit aimed to "affirm that climate change is a rights issue" and to "build alliances across states and borders" against climate change and in favor of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=333 CorpWatch: Alternative Summit Opens with Call for Climate Justice], November 19, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in August–September 2002, international environmental groups met in [[Johannesburg]] for the [[Earth Summit 2002|Earth Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020930131246/http://www.worldsummit2002.org/ website worldsummit2002.org] (archive)&lt;/ref&gt; At this summit, also known as Rio+10, as it took place ten years after the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], the Bali Principles of Climate Justice&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejnet.org/ej/bali.pdf Bali Principles of Climate Justice], PDF, August 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; were adopted.

In 2004, the Durban Group for Climate Justice was formed at an international meeting in [[Durban]], South Africa. Here representatives from [[NGO]]s and peoples' movements discussed realistic policies for addressing climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tni.org/en/profile/durban-group-for-climate-justice Durban group for Climate Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Bali Conference]], the global coalition [[Climate Justice Now!]] was founded, and, in 2008, the [[Global Humanitarian Forum]] focused on climate justice at its inaugural meeting in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/president/62/statements/ghfg240608.shtml The Global Humanitarian Forum Annual Meeting 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Climate Justice Action]] Network was formed during the run-up to the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/en/content/climate-change-and-justice-road-copenhagen Climate Change and Justice: On the road to Copenhagen], Heinrich Böll Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed [[civil disobedience]] and [[direct action]] during the summit, and many climate activists used the slogan 'system change not climate change'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indymedia.org/pt/2009/12/932387.shtml 100,000 march for System Change not climate change in Copenhagen with mass arrests] ''[[Indymedia]]'', December 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the [[World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth]] took place in [[Tiquipaya]], Bolivia. It was hosted by the government of Bolivia as a global gathering of civil society and governments. The conference published a "People's Agreement" calling, among other things, for greater climate justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwccc.wordpress.com/support/ World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth, People's Agreement] April 22, Cochabamba, Bolivia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversial interpretations ==

One contentious issue in debates about climate justice is the extent to which [[capitalism]] is viewed as its root cause. This question frequently leads to fundamental disagreements between, on the one hand, liberal and conservative environmental groups and, on the other, leftist and radical organizations. While the former often tend to blame the exesses of [[neoliberalism]] for climate change and argue in favor of market-based reform, the latter view capitalism with its exploitative traits as the underlying central issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spaceformovement.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/space_for_movement2.pdf Space for Movement: Reflections from Bolivia on climate justice, social movements and the state] PDF, edited by Building Bridges collective, July 2010, {{ISBN|978 0 85316 294 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/de/node/272493 Is a Successful Ecological Turnaround of Capitalism Possible?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurricane Katrina case study===
[[File:Hurricane Katrina flooding.jpg|thumb|NASA flood image after [[Hurricane Katrina]].]]

According to one study, [[Hurricane Katrina]] provided insights into how climate change disasters affect different people differently,&lt;ref name="ref 100"/&gt; as it had a disproportionate effect on low-income and minority groups.&lt;ref name="ref 100"/&gt; A study on the race and class dimensions of Hurricane Katrina suggests that those most vulnerable include poor, black, brown, elderly, sick, and homeless people.&lt;ref name="ref 400"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|title=Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability|journal=College Literature|volume=33|issue=3|pages=171–196|doi=10.1353/lit.2006.0037|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low-income and black communities had little resources and limited mobility to evacuate before the storm.&lt;ref name="ref 500"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=James R.|author2=Pais, Jeremy|title=Race, class, and Hurricane Katrina: Social differences in human responses to disaster|journal=Social Science Research|volume=35|issue=2|pages=295–321|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.02.003|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 600"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.06.013 | title=Distribution of impacts of natural disasters across income groups: A case study of New Orleans | journal=Ecological Economics | date=2007 | volume=63 | issue=2-3 | pages=299–306 | first=Michel | last=Masozera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, after the hurricane, low-income communities were most affected by contamination,&lt;ref name="ref 100"/&gt; and this was made worse by the fact that government relief measures failed to adequately assist those most at risk.&lt;ref name="ref 300"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref 400"/&gt;

=== Against states ===

==== Netherlands ====

In 2012, the Dutch lawyer Roger Cox gave the idea of judicial intervention to force action against [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=Urgenda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cox, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/14/judiciary-climate-change?guni=Article:in%20body%20link "It is time for the judiciary to step in and avert climate catastrophe"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 November 2012 (page visited on 6 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Urgenda Foundation, with 900 co-plaintiffs, has filed a lawsuit against the [[Government of the Netherlands]] "for not taking sufficient measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause dangerous climate change".&lt;ref name=Urgenda/&gt;

In 2015, the District Court of The Hague ruled that the government of the [[Netherlands]] must do more to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions to protect its citizens from climate change (Urgenda climate case).&lt;ref name=Urgenda&gt;[http://www.urgenda.nl/en/climate-case/ Urgenda climate case], Urgenda Foundation (page visited on 6 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schiermeier&gt;Quirin Schiermeier, [http://www.nature.com/news/landmark-court-ruling-tells-dutch-government-to-do-more-on-climate-change-1.17841 "Landmark court ruling tells Dutch government to do more on climate change"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 24 June 2015 (page visited on 5 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neslen&gt;Arthur Neslen, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/dutch-government-ordered-cut-carbon-emissions-landmark-ruling "Dutch government ordered to cut carbon emissions in landmark ruling"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 June 2015 (page visited on 5 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as a "precedent-setting judgment"&lt;ref name=Schiermeier/&gt; and as the "world’s first climate liability suit".&lt;ref name=Neslen/&gt;

According to James Thornton, chief executive of [[Client Earth]], "Most remarkably, it is based in essence on established science and the ancient principle of a government's duty of care. That reasoning is applicable in any legal system and will certainly be used by courts in other countries".&lt;ref name=Schiermeier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is also supported by the [http://globaljustice.macmillan.yale.edu/news/oslo-principles-global-climate-change-obligations Oslo Principles on Global Climate Change Obligations].

The '''Coast Veddas''' ({{Lang-ta|கரையோர வேடர்கள்|lit=Karaiyōra Vēṭarkaḷ}}, {{Lang-si|වෙරළේ වැද්දන්|lit=Veraḷē Væddan}}), by self-designation, form a social group within the minority [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] ethnic group of the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern province]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. They are primarily found in small coastal villages from the eastern township of [[Trincomalee]] to [[Batticalao]]. Nevertheless, they also inhabit a few villages south of Batticalao as well. They make a living by [[fishing]], [[slash and burn]] agriculture, [[paddy cultivation]] of rice, [[basket weaving]] for market and occasional wage labor. Anthropologists consider them to be partly descended from the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Vedda people|Vedda]] people, as well as local Tamils.  Residents of the Eastern province consider their Vedar (Tamil for "hunter")&lt;ref&gt;The article uses Vedda to indicate those who are from the interior and Vedar to describe the Coast Veddas&lt;/ref&gt; neighbors to have been part of the local social structure from earliest times, whereas some Vedar elders believe that their ancestors may have migrated from the interior at some time in the past.

They speak a [[dialect]] of [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialect|Sri Lankan Tamil]] that is used in the region. During religious festivals, people who enter a [[trance]] or [[spirit possession]] sometimes use a mixed language that contains words from the [[Vedda language]].&lt;ref name=JonDart73/&gt; Most Vedar are [[Hindu]] [[Saivites]] and worship a plethora of [[Village deities of Tamils of Sri Lanka|folk deities]], as well as the main Hindu deities such as [[Murugan]], [[Ganesha|Pillaiyar]] and [[Mariamman|Amman]]. They also maintain the [[ancestor worship]] tradition of the interior Veddas. Clan divisions, if they still exist, do not play an important role in choosing of marriage partners or place of domicile. Most identify themselves as a [[caste]] among the Tamils as opposed to a separate ethnic group.&lt;ref name=JonDart70&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Their economic conditions have been impacted by the [[Sri Lankan civil war]].

==Identity==
Western observers such as [[James Emerson Tennent]] (1858) and [[Charles Gabriel Seligman]] (1911) have termed the social group Coast Veddahs, Coast Verdas or East Coast Veddas.&lt;ref name=Tennent&gt;Tennent,  p.441&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tennent448&gt;Tennent,  p.448&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists have considered them to be at least partly descended from the Veddas of the interior of the island who had migrated at some unknown period in the past to the east coast, intermarrying with the local Tamils.&lt;ref name=Seligman330-331&gt;Seligman, pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wijesekera,  p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Interior Veddas clans themselves have a number of divisions, each claiming either Sinhalese, Tamil, mixed, or pure Vedda lineages. Vedda identity also depends on whether these clans are [[hunter-gatherers]] or settled agriculturalists. Settled Veddas have tended over a period of time to assume Sinhalese or Tamil identity based on the area of residence. If considered a subdivision of Veddas, then they are by far the largest sub-group amongst the Vedda people.&lt;ref name=JonDart68&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Eastern Province consider those who maintain a primitive life style, or are partly dependent on hunting and gathering, as Vedar without any connotations of ethnic origins.

Vedar are not designated as an indigenous community of Sri Lanka. They are placed within the Sri Lankan caste system. Vedar sometimes refer to themselves as "Veda Vellalar", thus claiming a high caste ranking (the [[Vellalar of Sri Lanka|Vellalar]] are given the highest ritual position within the caste structure of Sri Lankan Tamils in many regions). They also claim to marry into the higher castes of the neighboring region, such as [[Karaiyar]]. But some higher ranked castes did not consider Vedar quite their equals, although still placing them above the lower castes. Members of the Karaiyar caste sometimes downplayed their connections to Vedar as there was stigma attached to such unions. Field studies have indicated that mixed marriages across all caste groups of the eastern littoral was possible with Vedar. Vedar themselves claimed that they would not marry into lower Tamil castes such as [[Ambattan|Ambattar]] (barbers), Vannar (washerman) and [[Pallar]] (agricultural workers), but field studies indicated that such unions did sometimes take place.&lt;ref name=JonDart70/&gt;

Once a non-Vedar married into a Vedar family, he or she was assimilated as part of the Vedar village. Almost all Vedar families had an ancestor who was Tamil or a family member who was married to a Tamil from a neighboring village.&lt;ref name=JonDart69&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Vedar have gradually lost most aspects of their aboriginal identity and culture and no longer identify themselves as Vedar. During the 1980s and 1990s, most Vedar families were displaced from their native villages due to the effects of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]] and were placed in refugee camps along with other Tamil refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vedda.org/coastal-veddas.htm|title=Sri Lanka's Coastal Veddas|last=Harrigan|first=Patrick|date=June 2002|publisher=Cultural Survival trust|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancestors of Vedar migrated to Sri Lanka via the Indian sub continent during the pre-historic period. A number of [[Mesolithic]] sites have been excavated containing human remains dated to 35,000 BCE. Anthropologists consider these skeletal remains to belong to a group ancestral to some of the surviving Vedar groups. Sri Lanka has also yielded [[Megalithic]] burial sites, one of which was excavated close to a present Vedar settlement, [[Kathiraveli]]. The precise time in which some of the Vedar lineage founders migrated to the east coast of Sri Lanka is unknown. The earliest written reference to Vedar is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] chronicle, ''Nadukadu paraveni kalvettu'', which is maintained amongst the custodians of a prominent Hindu temple in the town of [[Tirukovil]] in the [[Ampara District]]. It is a Tamil 14th to 16th-century original text. The chronicle documents the presence of a people who practiced hunting and gathering for survival, exercising jurisdiction over vast jungle tracts close to the [[Akkaraipattu]] township. It names a number of Vedar chiefs, such as Kadariyan and Puliyan. These Vedars were not just hunter-gatherers, but were also accepted as the rightful owners of the forest lands.&lt;ref name=Seligman11-12&gt;Seligman, pp. 11−12&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson (1858) documented the presence of Vedar north of [[Eravur]] who subsisted by fishing or helping the traditional fisherfolk, as well by cutting wood for [[Sri Lankan Moors|Muslim]] traders. He speculated that there were then at least 400 to 500 individuals in the group. He also recorded that it was the [[British Ceylon|British colonial]] officers, as well as [[English Wesleyan Mission|Weslyan missionaries]] who provided land for them to start cultivating [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s and other vegetables.&lt;ref name=Tennent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tennent448/&gt;

Neville (1890) and Seligman (1911) also documented the presence of a subdivision of Vedar called ''Kovil Vanam'' ("Temple precincts" in Tamil) within the southern edges of the [[Batticalo District]]; their name suggests they had originally lived in the jungles close to the [[Kataragama]] temple in the [[Hambantota District]] in the [[Southern Province, Sri Lanka|Southern Province]]. By the early 1900s these Vedar had mingled with the local Tamils and Sinhalese and were not encountered as a separate group any more.&lt;ref&gt;Dharmadasa(Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), pp. 150−151&lt;/ref&gt; Local legends attribute the origins of some Hindu temples in the eastern province to the presence of Vedar. Important Hindu temples in villages such as [[Kokkadichcholai]] and [[Mandur (Sri Lanka)|Mandur]] have such Vedar creation legends. But Vedar are no longer associated with either the ownership or maintenance of these regionally important temples.

==Culture==

===Clans and family organization===
;Clans of the interior Veddas
Interior Veddas have [[clans]] called ''Waruge'' or ''Variga'' that were named after trees, animals or places of origin. Seligman speculated that these clans were territorial, thus hunting territory was divided amongst the clan, not to be violated by members of other clans. These clans were:

# Morana (after Mora tree)
# Unapana (Water)
# Namudana (Namuda tree)
# Ura (Wild boar)
# Ambilo (Ant) 
# Tala (Plains) 
# Rugam (Village name)
# Kovil Vannam (Temple precincts)&lt;ref&gt;Meegaskumbura(Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

Among these, the Morana and Unapana clans claimed superior status to Namudana, Ambilo and Ura clans. Seligman reported that Morana and Unapana clans considered the other three as their servile groups, a classification strongly denied by the others. This also led to so-called servile groups denying such clan association when questioned and claiming Morana or Unapana clan origins.

;Retention of Clan system amongst Vedar
When Seligman inquired about the Waruge divisions of the Vedar, most of them did not remember their clan origins. Of those who remembered, most self-identified as Ura Waruge. Others mentioned clans such as Ogatam, Kavatam, Umatam, Aembalaneduwe and Aembale. They also had memories of other clans such as Morana and Unapana.&lt;ref name=Seligman333&gt;Seligman, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1980s the Vedar had no knowledge of any word ''Waruge'', although they vaguely used the Tamil term ''Vamisam'' (family origin) to indicate some division amongst them. Some had come up with a two-fold division of the Vedars based on the [[Kuti system|Kuti]] or [[Matrilinearity|matrilineal descent system]] popular in the East coast. These Kutis were supposed to have descended from former local chiefs called ''[[Vanniar (Chieftain)|Vanniyar]]'', who had ruled feudal divisions called ''[[Vannimai]]''. But these clan divisions and related rules of [[endogamy]] were not totally followed by all Vedar, and there no practical prohibitions from marrying from each Kuti.&lt;ref name=JonDart70-71&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

As with local Tamils, the preferred marriage pattern is based on [[cross cousin]] preference. [[Parallel and cross cousins|Parallel cousins]] are considered brothers and sisters and are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan endogamy even it is present is of no value. Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to villages that are three to five miles away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other.&lt;ref name=JonDart69/&gt; Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.

===Religion===
{{double image|right|Coastal-1.jpeg|180|Mankerny family 2006.jpg|180|Left:Vedar settlement from 1900. Right:Vedar settlement from 2006.}}Vedar are nominally Hindus; they were known to wear the marks of [[Saivism|Saivite]] [[Hinduism]] such as [[Vibuthi]] ("sacred ash") on their forehead even in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Seligman333/&gt; According to local legends, Vedars are considered to be the builders of most of the regional Hindu temples associated with Hindu high god [[Murugan]]. Although Vedars frequent regionally important Hindu temples and shrines associated with high Hindu deities such as Murugan, [[Ganesha|Pillaiyar]] and [[Shiva|Siva]], they propitiate local deities of [[folk Hinduism]], who are sometimes unique to Veddars. Most of the folk deities are also commonly propitiated by other local Tamils such as [[Bhairava|Vairavar]], [[Virabhadra|Virapathirar]], [[Kali]] and  [[Narasimha|Narasingan]]. Seligman (1911) encountered two unique deities, Kapalpei (“Ship spirit”) and Kumara Deivam (“Young god”)&lt;ref name=Subramaniam&gt;Subramaniam, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; who are peculiar to Vedar. The cult of Kappalpei is based on legends of foreigners coming over by ships and landing along the coast where the Vedar usually lived. They are propitiated to ward off evils and hard times. Kumara Deivam was also noted amongst the primitive Sinhalese village of [[Gonagolla]] in the [[Ampara District]] known as Kumara Devio.&lt;ref name=Seligman336-337&gt;Seligman, pp. 336 - 337&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Dart in the 1980s found that these deities were no longer worshipped, but were replaced by the [[Periyasami cult]].&lt;ref name=JonDart75&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

The worship pattern is a combination of [[Dances of Sri Lanka#Devil Dances|Devil-dancing]] called ''Sandangu'' ("ceremony" in Tamil) and orthodox Hindu [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] rituals. The devil-dancing is unique to Vedar, but the aspect of [[spirit possession]] as a part of devil dancing is not unique to Vedar. Locals Tamils also experience spirit procession and trance states during religious festivals. During devil-dancing ceremonies, related family groups congregate in family-owned worship centers and build platforms known as ''Pandals''. These Pandals may have a weapon, such a lance known as a ''Vel'', installed in their middle, a construction similar to the ''[[Kirikoroha]]'' function of the interior Veddas as well. Male family members dance throughout the night and as part of the ceremony some become possessed by spirits, sometimes those of their recently diseased family members. This pattern is similar in nature to the ancestor-worshipping patterns of the interior Veddas.&lt;ref name=Seligman336-337/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seligman335&gt;Seligman, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Sadangu locations are temporary ones without related permanent structures over them, but some have been turned into temples. In the village of Palchennai, one of these temporary structures has become a temple now identified with Hindu high god [[Vishnu]]. Vedars also participate in Tamil folk dramas called ''[[Terukkuttu|Kuttus]]'' that depict scenes from Hindu epics such as [[Mahabharatha]] and [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref name=JonDart73-76&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), pp. 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===

Vedar use the [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialects|Sri Lankan Tamil dialect]] peculiar to the region, known as Batticaloa Tamil dialect, in their day to day conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. During ''Sadangu'' ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call ''Vedar Sinkalam''(Vedar Sinhala") or ''Vedar Bhasai''&lt;ref name=Subramaniam/&gt; which is the [[Vedda language]] of the interior Vedas.&lt;ref name=JonDart73/&gt; This ''Vedar Sinkalam'' is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language.&lt;ref name=JonDart73&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence at some point in the past that the people were [[bilingual]] in Vedda language and Tamil, but that is no longer the case.&lt;ref name=Seligman332/&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
Native chronicles have documented the presence of Vedar or Vedar-like people throughout the island from the beginning of the historic period.  Vedar presence in the present Eastern province has been noted during the [[Kandyan Kingdom]] period (1469 to 1815). Tennent noted that Vedars were found chiefly from [[Eravur]] to Venloos Bay.&lt;ref name=Tennent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tennent448/&gt; The 1946 Sri Lankan census returned 44 Vedar villages. The largest concentration of villages was close to the [[Vaharai]] peninsula; predominantly Vedar villages there included Ammenthnaveli, Kandaladi, Komatalamadu, Palchennai, Puliyankandadi, Oddumadu, Thaddumunai, Uriyankadu, and Vammivattavan. Vedar are also found further south, in Panichankerni, [[Mankerni]] and Kayankerni. There are also Vedars close to [[Kalkudah]], in a village called Pallanchenai, and in the [[Trincomalee District]], between the towns of [[Muttur (Sri Lanka)|Muttur]] and Foul Point.&lt;ref name=JonDart82-83&gt;Jon Dart (Samarasinghe, S. W. R. de A[''edit'']), pp. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic status==
Native chronicles such as ''Nadu Kadu Paraveni Kalvettu'' mention the socio-economic status of the Vedar as that of primitive hunter gatherers. The chronicles also mention that the chiefs amongst them received gifts such as clothes from settlers and state that the Vedar in turn provided meat and honey to the settler population, indicating a system of [[barter]] trade between the groups. Vedar also seem to have provided manual labor to clear forest lands, in exchange for an annual portion of the food crops harvested. When Tennent visited the east coast in 1858, the Vedar were living in houses that were made of mud and thatch. They were moved seasonally from place to place dependent on the availability of fish and other game. They were surviving primarily as fishermen, as well as wage laborers working for timber merchants,  cutting and transporting timber from the forests.&lt;ref name=Tennent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tennent448/&gt; By the time Seligman visited them in 1911, he considered the Vedar subdivision to be economically better off than the rest of the Indigenous population of the interior. He attributed this to the assimilation of Tamil economic and cultural values by the Vedar clans, as well as to absorption of non-Vedar Tamils into Vedar families by intermarriage.&lt;ref name=Seligman332&gt;Seligman, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done in the 1980s by the anthropologist Jon Dart, indicated that Vedar in general were poorer than the rest of the Tamil and Muslim communities of the Eastern Province, which Dart attributed to their physical isolation in remote villages, as well as prevailing cultural norms that prevented them from fully integrating within the society. His studies did indicate that some Vedar had successfully integrated in Eastern society, with worldly possessions that did not much differ from those of their non-Vedar neighbors.&lt;ref name=JonDart70-71/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seligman332/&gt; The marked impact of the Sri Lankan civil war was also noted, due to the proximity of the Vedar's native villages to the theaters of operations of both rebel [[LTTE]] and  government forces.(See [[Vaharai bombing]])

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the population of [[Portugal]], including population density, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

In 2010 Portugal had 10,572,721 inhabitants.

Portugal is a fairly linguistically and religiously homogeneous country. Ethnically, the [[Portuguese people]] are mainly a combination of ancient paleolithic populations, and the [[proto-Celtic]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Iberians|Iberian]] tribes, para-Celtic [[Lusitanians]]. Some other groups, like the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ([[Visigoths]], [[Suevi]], [[Buri tribe|Buri]], [[Alans]] and [[Vandals]]) and later the [[Moors|Moorish]] ([[Berbers|Berber]]), [[Sephardic Jewish]], and the [[French people|French]] also passed through the country.

Today, Ukrainians, Moldovans, Romanians, Russians, Bulgarians, Brazilians, and Venezuelans form the major foreign communities in the country. Members of [[List of countries where Portuguese is an official language|PALOP]] countries ([[Portuguese-speaking African countries]]) are also immigrants and form communities in the country..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/portugal-ethnic-groups.html|title=Portugal Ethnic Groups {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=11 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese is spoken throughout the country, with only the villages of [[Miranda do Douro]]'s [[Mirandese language]] recognised as a locally co-official language.

==[[Total Fertility Rate]] from 1850 to 1899==

The [[total fertility rate]] is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period.

== Other demographic statistics ==
Portugal has traditionally been one of the most homogenous countries in the world but steady immigration has changed that to some extent.&lt;ref name="WPR2008"/&gt;

It may be surprising to learn however, that much of this immigration has taken place over the last twenty years and back in 1992, just 1.3% of the Portugal population was made up of other nationalities. By 2007, however, that figure had risen to 4.1%.&lt;ref name="WPR2008"/&gt;


The following demographic statistics are from the World Population Review.&lt;ref name="WPR2008"&gt;{{cite |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/portugal-population/ |title=World Population Review: Portugal Population 2018|date=14 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban organization==

===Metropolitan areas and agglomerations===
As of 2001 Census, Portugal had two significant agglomerations: Lisbon Metropolitan Region (3.34 million inhabitants) and Northern Littoral Urban-Metropolitan Region (or Porto Metropolitan Agglomeration) with 2.99 million people, the later with a polycentric nature.&lt;ref name="tgv"&gt;Fernando Nunes da Silva (2005), [http://www.moptc.pt/tempfiles/20060227144758moptc.pdf Alta Velocidade em Portugal, Desenvolvimento Regional], CENSUR, IST  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624061135/http://www.moptc.pt/tempfiles/20060227144758moptc.pdf |date=24 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These broader agglomerations are distinct from the political metropolitan areas of [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]] – ''[[Grande Área Metropolitana de Lisboa]]'' (2,8&amp;nbsp;million) and ''[[Grande Área Metropolitana do Porto]]'' (1,8&amp;nbsp;million). Together they hold 43% of the total population.

===Largest urban areas===

When considering the number of inhabitants in consistent single urban areas, de facto cities in mainland Portugal, per the new with increased density of human-created structures, and excluding suburban and rural areas, Portugal has two cities with about one million inhabitants each (Lisbon and Porto), ten others with more than 50,000 inhabitants and 14 cities with populations between 20,000 and 40,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="tgv"/&gt;

===Largest cities===
Portugal has 151 localities with city status (''cidade''). Every city is included into a municipality (''[[Municipalities of Portugal|município]]''). This is a list of population by city, which means that it refers to the number of inhabitants in the city proper, excluding inhabitants from the same municipality but living outside the urban area of the city in other civil parishes (''[[freguesias]]'') of the municipality. In some cases, the entire municipality and the city proper cover the same territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.igeo.pt/atlas/Cap2/Cap2d_2.html UMA POPULAÇÃO QUE SE URBANIZA, Uma avaliação recente – Cidades, 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006143612/http://dev.igeo.pt/atlas/Cap2/Cap2d_2.html |date=6 October 2014 }} Nuno Pires Soares, Instituto Geográfico Português (Geographic Institute of Portugal)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Immigration to Portugal}}
[[File:COB data Portugal.PNG|right|500px|thumb|Foreign-born naturalised citizens in [[Portugal]] by 2001.]]
In 1992, 1.3% of the population was foreign, by 2007 the number had grown to 4.1% or 435,736 people.&lt;ref name=sef&gt;{{Citation

Since the independence of the former [[Portuguese empire|African colonies]], Portugal saw a steady immigration from Africa, most notably [[Cape Verde]], Angola and [[Guinea-Bissau]], but also [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Mozambique]] and former [[Portuguese India]] in Asia.

Portugal saw migration waves due to labor shortages since 1999, first from Eastern Europe (1999–2002), in two distinctive groups, a ''Slav'' (Ukraine, Russia and Bulgaria) and an ''East Latin'' (Romania and Moldavia), that stopped and started declining as the labour market became saturated.

Since 2003, most of the immigrants came from [[Brazil]], China and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Family reunification was seen as important for a successful integration in the country, thus the government eased it, and in 2006, more than 6 in 10 new immigrants were family members of legal foreign residents in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww1.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=362482&amp;visual=26&amp;tema=4 Imigração: Novos imigrantes legais em Portugal aumentaram 50% em 2006 – OCDE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210125522/http://ww1.rtp.pt/noticias/index.php?article=362482&amp;visual=26&amp;tema=4 |date=10 February 2012 }} – RTP.pt&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a significant number of elderly Western European residents in search of quality of life, namely from France, German, the Netherlands and United Kingdom.

===Ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities===
{{see also|Immigration to Portugal|Racism in Portugal}}
[[Anti-racism]] laws prohibit and penalize racial discrimination in [[house|housing]], business, and health services. In 2007 approximately 332,137 legal immigrants live in the country, representing approximately 5% of the population. The country also has a resident [[Romani people|Romani]] (Gypsy) population of approximately 40,000 people.

Discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other [[state services]] is illegal. The law mandates access to public buildings and to newly built private buildings for such persons.

The great majority of the Portuguese population belongs to the [[Catholic Church in Portugal|Roman Catholic Church]]. Religious observance remains strong in northern areas, with the population of Lisbon and southern areas generally less devout and strongly anticlerical. Religious minorities include a little over 300,000 [[Protestants]] and [[LDS Church|Mormons]]. There are also about 50,000 [[Muslims]] and 10,000 [[Hindu]]s. Most of them came from [[Goa]], a former [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colony]] on the west coast of India (Some Muslims also came from former two Portuguese African colonies with important Muslim minorities: [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Mozambique]]). There are also about 1,000 [[Jew]]s. Portugal is also home to less than 10,000 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], mostly Chinese from Macau and a few Indians from Goa.

{{Georgians}}
The documented ties between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Poland]] reach back to the 15th century, when the Georgian (Kartlian) [[Constantine I of Georgia|Constantine I]] sent a diplomatic mission to the Polish King [[Alexander Jagiellon]]. Later, Polish King [[Jan III Sobieski]] tried to establish contacts with Georgia. Many Georgians participated in military campaigns led by Poland in the 17th century.
[[Bogdan Gurdziecki]], a Georgian, who was the greatest authority on all things Persian working in the Polish king's diplomatic service, made frequent diplomatic trips to Persia, on which he obtained, among other things, guarantees upholding earlier privileges for missionaries. Already during the rule of King [[John II Casimir of Poland|Jan Kazimierz]], he sent on missions to Isfahan, and King Jan III Sobieski availed himself of Gurdziecki's talents in like manner (in 1668, 1671, 1676–1678, in 1682–1684, and in 1687). Gurdziecki remained at the court of the shah for several years in the capacity of special resident and representative of the Polish king; it was he who delivered to the shah Suleiman news about the victory of the Christian forces at Vienna (1683).

Several Georgian politicians, intellectuals and military officers left Georgia for Poland after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] armies [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|invaded]] the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] (DRG) in February 1921, taking over the government and establishing the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in the same March. Although not very numerous and consisting of a few hundred members, the Georgian community of Poland was very active politically and culturally. The best remembered are, however, the Georgian military personnel who served in the [[Military of Poland|Polish ranks]] from the early 1920s until the end of [[World War II]].

== Georgian Prometheism ==

Active diplomatic contacts developed between the short-lived DRG and Poland was part of [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s well-known political concept known as [[Prometheism]]. Its aim was to greatly reduce the power of the [[Russian Empire]] and subsequently, the [[Soviet Union]], by supporting nationalist independence movements of the major non-Russian peoples that lived within the borders of Russia or the Soviet Union. 
[[Image:Geo-Polish officers.jpg|thumb|300px|Polish and Georgian officers serving in the [[Polish Army]], 1925]]
The Georgian Promethean groups were one of the most active within the movement. This was not overlooked by the [[Bolsheviks]], who in 1930 organized the assassination of [[Noe Ramishvili]], a prominent Georgian political leader and a major promoter of Prometheism.

The 1932 Polish-Soviet mutual nonaggression pact precipitated the downfall of the Promethean movement though the Georgians continued their activities in various cultural and social organizations. The most important was the Committee of Georgia founded as early as 1921 by several Georgian intellectuals led by Sergo Qurulashvili. They had close contacts with the centers of Georgian political emigration across [[Europe]], primarily in [[Paris]]. The Committee organized various meetings and social activities and provided material support for the Georgian émigrés. It also published its own publications, ''ProGeorgia'' (1922), and ''Propartia'' (1923). From 1923 to 1924, Qurulashvili also directed the journal ''Schlos Wschodu'' pertaining to the Georgian problems. The Georgians organized also the Union of Georgian Students and the Polish-Georgian Society led by Prince Pavle Tumanishvili. The activities of these organizations were limited, however, due to financial difficulties.

== Georgians in the Polish military service ==
[[Image:Mj Giorgi Mamaladze.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Major Giorgi Mamaladze, later murdered in the 1940 Katyn massacre]]
Immediately after the fall of the DRG, [[Noe Zhordania]], the head of the [[Government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Exile|Georgian government-in-exile]], addressed the friendly nations, particularly [[France]], [[Greece]] and [[Poland]], to help in maintaining the professional military cadres. The government of Poland promptly responded, and from 1922 to 1924, hundreds of Georgian [[Junker (Russia)|Junkers]] and officers, recommended by Zhordania’s government, were accepted in the Polish military schools. Several professional officers of the former DRG attended military training courses at the Polish army centers. Although not obligated to do so, virtually all of them were subsequently enrolled in the Polish army as contract officers. In the subsequent decade, the total number of Georgian military servicemen reached 1,000.  
      
At the outbreak of [[World War II]], most of the Georgian officers took part in the [[Polish September Campaign|1939 Defensive War]], and several of them commanded their own regiments composed of Polish soldiers.  The most notable officers were:

[[Zachariasz Bakradze|Zakaria Bakradze]], [[generał dywizji]], deputy commander of Polish 15th Infantry Division.
[[Aleksander Czcheidze|Aleksandre Chkheidze]], [[generał brygady]], deputy commander of Polish 16th Infantry Division.
[[Ivane Kazbegi]], generał brygady.
[[Aleksandre Koniashvili]], generał brygady.
[[Kirile Kutateladze]], generał brygady.
[[Aleksandre Zakariadze]], generał brygady.
[[Viktor Lomidze]], the commander of {{ORP|Gryf|1936|6}}.
[[Jerzy Tumaniszwili]], captain of the navy, who was awarded [[Virtuti Militari]].
[[Valerian Tevzadze]], [[podpułkownik]], the commander of the northern sector of the Polish defences during the siege of Warsaw.
[[Mikheil Kvaliashvili]], major, the commander of a cavalry battalion within the 15th [[Uhlan]]s Regiment.

Several Georgian officers were captured by the Soviet forces during the 1939 campaign. General Chkheidze, Major Mamaladze, Captain Skhirtladze and Captain Rusiashvili were killed during the infamous [[Katyn Massacre]], from 1940 to 1941. Many others spent several years in the [[gulag]] camps. 
[[Image:StGrigolPeradze.jpg|thumb|upright|St. [[Grigol Peradze]]]]
During the occupation of Poland, the Germans reorganized the [[Warsaw]]-based Committee of Georgia and placed it under their tight control. The occupation administration encouraged the Georgian soldiers in the Polish service to join the [[Georgian Legion (1941–1945)|Georgian Legion]] of the [[Wehrmacht]]. Some of them responded to the Nazi request, but subsequently joined the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]]. The notable [[Georgian Orthodox]] priest and Professor [[Grigol Peradze]] of [[Warsaw University]] ended his life in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] (1942), when he deliberately entered a gas-chamber instead of a [[Jew]]ish prisoner who had a large family.

The American [[John Shalikashvili|John Malchase David Shalikashvili]], general of the United States Army who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997, was born in Warsaw, Poland, where his father also served in the army.

After the war, most Georgians either left for [[Western Europe]] or were deported to the Soviet camps though some of them (e.g., General V. Tevzadze) remained in the Polish anti-Communist underground for several decades.

The '''Harifal''' (Urdu حریفال  حریف ال) are a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe inhabiting the [[Sherani District]] in the [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]], and, to a lesser extent, the surrounding districts of [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dry-net.org/uploaded_files/091220_potential_of_livestock_breeds_of_Baluchistan_final_.pdf|title=Assessing the potential of the indigenous livestock breeds of Baluchistan|author=Abdul Raziq Kakar|publisher=Drynet|date=20 December 2009|accessdate=29 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229122217/http://www.dry-net.org/uploaded_files/091220_potential_of_livestock_breeds_of_Baluchistan_final_.pdf|archivedate=29 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe mostly populates the western slopes of Shinghar, a mountain in the [[Suleiman Range]], though a considerable number reside in the [[Zhob District]]. There is also a scattered population in the [[Duki, Pakistan|Duki]] subdivision of [[Loralai District]], Sanjavi subdivision of the [[Ziarat District]], a small population in [[Quetta]], and some in Zarkanai [[Daraban]] of [[Dera Ismail Khan district]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The word ''Harifal'' is also [[transliterated]] as Airf Aal, Haripal, and Hurreepaul.

The two union councils of Sherani district, Shinghar Harifal south with 23 villages (13,883 people) and Shinghar Harifal north with 31 villages (12,228 people), are altogether occupied by the Harifal tribe. The main bulk of the tribe lives in clusters of villages in the central block of Mt. Shinghar. The Harifal tribe is relatively small and tractable compared to other tribes{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

The total voters&lt;ref&gt;ECP SHERANI&lt;/ref&gt; of the Harifal tribe is numbered at 8,728, and gender-wise breakup is as follows: male: 4,797 and female: 3,931.
 
There is an ancestral link between the Harifal and the [[Shirani (Pashtun tribe)|Shirani tribe]], but the Harifal is considered separate.

==Etymology==
The term Harifal has undergone etymological change. As it is pronounced in the manner favoured by Pathan/Afghan.
Harifal, in [[Pashto language|Pashto]], is the corrupted form of ''Arif Aal'', meaning progeny of '''Arif''', the founder of the tribe. The actual name of this eponymous ancestor was "Arif-Ullah". The word Harifal has undergone change over time, and so it has been variously transliterated as '''Arif Aal''', '''Haripal''', and '''Harifal'''. These words are all [[homophone]]s but [[heterograph]]s, and Harifal is the most correct one. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==History==
Under Arif's leadership, the Shiranis sent a portion of their tribe to occupy [[Bargha]]. Arif later married a [[Shirani (Pashtun tribe)|Shirani]] women (according to tradition, his second wife and the mother of the Ibrahikhail sub-tribe), and thus became the [[eponymous ancestor]] of the Harifal tribe.

This account is corroborated by [[Olaf Caroe]], who wrote that "the genealogies frequently supply actual confirmation of observable differences today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desistore.com/thepathans.html p 04]&lt;/ref&gt;

An account of the warlike nature of the Harifal and Sherani tribes is given by the Scottish historian [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] in his book ''An account of the kingdom of Caubul, and its dependencies in [[Iran|Persia]], [[Tartary]], and [[India]]: comprising a view of the Afghaun nation, and a history of the Dooraunee monarch'', "The Sheeraunees [Sheranis] are at war with all the tribes that pass through their country in their annual migrations. They may, indeed, be said to be at war with all the world, since they plunder every traveller that comes within their reach; and besides, make incursions into parts of Damaun, with the inhabitants of which they have no quarrel. While I was in their neighbourhood, they stopped the body of a Dooraunee of rank, which was going through their country to be buried at Candahar, and detained it till a ransom had been paid for it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=FOc-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA384&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=Hurreepaul&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zmQt3xuFgL&amp;sig=d-3vBm-6l5BpTXiqExSRjb9F__U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TbMFT5095uPhBNP20Y0I&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Hurreepaul&amp;f=false An account of the kingdom of Caubul, and its dependencies in Persia, Tartary ... - Mountstuart Elphinstone - Google Books (page 383)]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to the influence of legendary accounts of Arif's peaceful nature, the Harifal restrained their warlike nature and became relatively docile. The Harifal are more quiet and industrious, and their habits are decidedly averse from the system of violence pursued by other tribes. In personal bravery and endurance of privation and hardship, they are esteemed superior to other inhabitants around. In manner they are mild, inoffensive and tenacious in respectability.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Historical records==
[[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] (1779–1859) says "The tribes of Hurreepaul (sic) and Kuppeep resemble the Sheeraunees, of which tribe they are branches; and their residence is in the hills and valleys at the western base of Tukhti Solimaun. To the north of the Hurreepaul is the country near the junction of the Gomul and Zhobe, sometimes pastured on by wandering Cankers. North of it is Wauneh, a low plain situated on the hills that slope down to the valley of the Gomul."&lt;ref name="desistore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desistore.com/thepathans.html |title=This site is under construction |publisher=Desistore.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Baluchistan Through the Ages'', "The Haripals claim a Saiad descent, and allege that their progenitor, Harif, was a Saiad from Pishin, who migrated to the [[Shirani (Pashtun tribe)|Shirani]] country, married a Shirani woman, and was affiliated with the Shiranis".&lt;ref&gt;Baluchistan through the ages P68. vol ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Benjamin Edwardes]] says "It is by the Zirkunnee Pass that caravans go to [[Kandahar]]. About five or six miles to the south of the Zirkunnee Pass, is the Pass of Drabund, the mouth of which is about eight miles from Drabund itself. Not very far from midway between the town and the Pass of Drabund, but rather nearer to the latter, are ruins of the former fort of Akhoond Gool Hubeeb. This Akhoond, I was informed, belonged to a tribe called Hurrial, connected with the Sheraunees; the same probably as that of 'Hurreepaul,' mentioned by Mr. Elphinstone as a branch of the Sheraunees, residing 'in the hills and valleys at the western base of [[Takht-e-Sulaiman|Tukht-e-Sulaiman]]'."&lt;ref&gt;A year on the Punjab frontier, by Herbert Benjamin Edwardes in 1848-49 (Volume 1 ) page 551-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Qazi Abdul Haleem Asar Afghani (1910-1987), a well known [[Pashto language|Pashto]] writer (District Mardan, Tehsil Takht Bhai) holds that "Harifal is a minor tribe living in and around Daraban amongst Sheranis. In the twelfth generation of this tribe was a renowned saint by the name of Sheikh Ahmed Zinda-pir.

Sheikh Ahmed Zinda-pir had five sons; eldest among them was Sadar-ud-din, who later became famous by the name of Sheikh Sadar-ud-din Sadar Jahan; an erudite and noted [[Sufi]] saint. He migrated to India to spread the word of [[Islam]]. In India he reached "[[Malerkotla|Malir Kotla]] and settled there. Sheikh later married daughter of Sultan Behlul Lodhi. This gave much impetus to his reputation. Stories of Hazrat Shaikh's erudition and piety spread far and wide and gradually Malerkotla became the seat of Sufism in India."&lt;ref&gt;Roohani Rabita au Roohani Taroon by Qazi Abdul Haleem Asar p 415&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaikh Sadar Ud-din also known as Haidar Shaikh was born at Daraban, the winter dwellings of the Harifal tribe, in 1437. In 1449, he reached [[Multan]] and became the disciple of [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya]]. When his master was sure that his disciple was well versed in spirituality, he asked him to go out and help humanity. The Sheikh chose a raised mound near the old village of Maler to build his hut, and there he used to spend his time in prayer.

One distinguished member of this family was Zulfiqar Ali Khan who, although not a nawab, was a figure in the literary history of the riyasat. A close friend of allama [[Muhammad Iqbal]], he was the author of the first biography of the famous poet, titled ''A Voice from the East''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010421/windows/main1.htm |title=The Tribune - Windows - Main Feature |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date=2001-04-21 |accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claims;&lt;ref&gt;The British India founded&lt;/ref&gt; that Maler kotla's ruling family, though famed as Pathan, is actually Sayyid in its origin, for its ancestral progenitor was Sayyid Husain who migrated from Ghaur during the reign of caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (646–705 the 5th Umayyad Caliph) and settled in the region neighboring `Kooh-e-Sulaiman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waqarkhan.com/malerkotla-info/ My State, Malerkotla&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Harifal tribe lives on [[Shinghar]], which are separated from the Sulaiman Mountains by the valley of Lahar. The main peak of Shinghar is 9,273 feet above sea level, and the mountain extends from Kurchpina in the north to Sulyazai valley in the south. With relation to nearby towns, is to the west of the [[Takht-e-Sulaiman]], and about 50&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Zhob]]. The [[Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation]] has reported finding significant coal deposits near Shinghar{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. The average elevation of Harifal territory is 2,043 meters from sea level.

Harifal territory is situated 372 kilometers south west of the capital, [[Islamabad]]. The location is sparsely populated, with 21 people per square kilometer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinci.com/travel/pax/q/6310842/Haripal/PK/Pakistan/0/ The Travel World Atlas: Haripal, Balochistān, Pakistan (tribal area) - Detailed Information, Weather, Photos, Videos, Animals, Nature, Wildlife, Maps, Hazards - 6310842&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant form of vegetation in the area is the [[olive]] tree, though [[Ephedra]] is also abundantly found in Harifal territory. Known locally as "oman," the plant was once purchased in large quantities by Quetta Marker Company{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

There is also a dense forest of edible pine ([[Pinus gerardiana]]) (In Urdu چلغوزا پائن) which covers the mountains, growing at an elevation from 1800 meters to 3350 meters.

The nearby village of Ghwanza contains a shrine of the [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint Hazrat Babakr Nika Harifal, which is frequently visited by pilgrims.

===Weather and climate===
Harifal territory is in a very strong (vii) [[earthquake zone]], with occurrences of earthquakes at 6-7 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]].

Harifal has an [[arid]] (0.05 - 0.2 p/pet) climate. Land area is not cultivated; most of the natural [[vegetation]] is still intact. The landscape is mostly covered with closed to open grassland. There is a moderate occurrence of periods with extreme drought. Additionally, flood risk is low.

The climate is classified as a [[subtropical]] steppe (low-latitude dry), with a subtropical thorn wood land [[biozone]].

Weather varies according to the locality, and the heat or the cold is felt in different spots in the same latitude with very different degrees of intensity, according to the configuration of the country. Winter is mild; on the plain the snow melts as it falls, and does not lie long even on the summits of the mountains. In general the temperature is moderate. September is on average the month with most sunshine. Rainfall and other precipitation have no distinct peak month.

===Demographics===
The Harifal are divided into clans, the clans into sections and sections into subsections.

According to the 1901 census, the population of Harifal was 1,593, with the following divisions of sub-tribes: Ibrahikhail (180), Hamakzai (sic)(5), Hasankhail (706), Naqibkhail (630), and Umerzai (3).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{Relevance inline|date=December 2016}}

According to the 1998 census its population is 36,111. An estimated 5.64% of the children below 5 years old are underweight, with a mortality of 66 per 1,000 births.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Heath Bunting''' is a contemporary British artist born in 1966. Based in [[Bristol]], he is the founder of the site [http://www.irational.org irational.org] (with [[Daniel García Andújar]], Rachel Baker and Minerva Cuevas) and was one of the early practitioners in the 1990s of [[Net.art]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Bunting's work is based on creating open and democratic systems by modifying communications technologies and social systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/bunting/biography/] Media.Kunst.Netz.

==''Own, Be Owned, or Remain Invisible''==
Created in 1998, [http://www.irational.org/heath/_readme.html _readme.html] (''Own, Be Owned or Remain Invisible'') is a work of [[netart|net.art]] that spoke to the time period in which it was created, and yet still remains relevant to the contemporary moment. The piece is a simple [[web page]] with a white background and light grey text taken from an article about Heath Bunting. A vast majority of the words are [[hypertext]], but not all. As coded for by simple [[HTML]] [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]], hyperlinked words turn from grey to black once visited.

===Appropriation===
In [http://www.irational.org/heath/_readme.html ''Own, Be Owned or Remain Invisible''] Bunting makes use of [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]].&lt;ref name="greene"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Art-World-Rachel-Greene/dp/0500203768], Greene, Rachel (2004). Internet Art. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20376-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work utilises an article about Heath Bunting written by [[James Flint (British novelist)|James Flint]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. Instead of presenting the article in its traditional form, Bunting [[hyperlink|links]] nearly every word to [insert word].com and alters the color-scheme of the document as per his white-on-white period.&lt;ref name="bookchin"&gt;[http://art.teleportacia.org/exhibition/miniatures/about_heath.html N.Bookchin about heath bunting], Natalie Bookchin for Art.Teleportacia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership===
[http://www.irational.org/heath/_readme.html ''Own, Be Owned or Remain Invisible''] addresses the commercialisation of the Internet. By clicking one of the [[hyperlink]]ed words, the reader is transported to the [[domain name|domain]], which may or may not be owned. At the time of this work's creation, 1998, many of the domain names were not owned, but are registered today. In contrast, some domain may have been owned in the past twelve years, but are no longer owned any more, thereby touching on the transience of Internet ownership.&lt;ref name="olia"&gt;[http://www.mail-archive.com/nettime-l@kein.org/msg00280.html &lt;nettime&gt; Goodbye Classic?], Olia Lialina.&lt;/ref&gt; Bunting's work also shows the range of banal or absurd domain names that companies have purchased.&lt;ref name="mediaartnet"&gt;[http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/readme/ Bunting, Heath: _readme], Media Art Net.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all words in the article are hyperlinked, however. Bunting effectively takes ownership of the following words by leaving them as normal text:
::Heath Bunting Heath Bunting [[flyposter]], graffiti artist art radio pirate bulletin board Heath Kings Cross phone-in, Heath Heath. mother bogus [[Glaxo]]
::website Heath Heath Heath Anti with E Backspace [[cyberlounge]] Heath [[jodi.org]], Heath [[CCTV]] marketing databases. create disbelief. Heath http://www.irational.org.
Through these words he spells out how the article touches on his own [[Identity formation|identity]].&lt;ref name="dietz"&gt;[http://www.walkerart.org/archive/0/B8739D27E26E7AD0616F.htm beyond.interface.bunting], Steve Dietz.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility===
In a 1997 interview, Bunting was quoted as saying the issue with the internet at the time was visibility vs. invisibility.&lt;ref name="nettime"&gt;[http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-9708/msg00098.html Interview Baumgaertel], Tilman Baumgaertel [[interview]] with Heath Bunting.&lt;/ref&gt; This topic is addressed in _readme.html through the work's color scheme and use of hypertext. Before clicking on a [[hyperlink]]ed word, the text of the article all appears light grey. However, clicking on a link changes that word's color to black. Additionally, all subsequent occurrences of the word turn to black, thereby making the [[domain name|domain]] much more visible on the page. Visibility is a relevant issue in current [[internet culture]] with concerns over what is public vs. private on the internet, [[Search engine marketing|SEM marketing tactics]] and [[search engine]] sophistication. If all links in [http://www.irational.org/heath/_readme.html _readme.html] (''Own, Be Owned or Remain Invisible'') are clicked, the only words that are left as light grey are those describing the [[identity formation|identity]] of Heath Bunting, suggesting that he, himself, chooses to "remain invisible."

==King's Cross Phone-In==

Communications and [[Social network|networking]] took center stage in Heath Bunting's 1994 [[Performance art|performative art]] project entitled "King’s Cross Phone-In."  On Friday, 5 August 1994, Bunting orchestrated a scheme that involved many people calling public phones in and in the surrounding area of [[London King's Cross railway station]]. [http://irational.org/cybercafe/xrel.html] On his then-website Cybercafe.org, founded in 1992, Bunting posted the phone numbers to all of the public phones and encouraged his followers to do one of the following: call in a pattern, call at a certain time, call and speak to a stranger, or show up and pick up the telephone. [http://tiger.towson.edu/users/nbosle1/bunting.html] Bunting used his website as an informative source to let his readers know how to partake in his project.

[[File:Kings Cross Station Platforms, London - Sept 2007.jpg|thumb|left|alt=King's Cross Station|''[[London King's Cross railway station]]''.]]

When 5 August arrived, Bunting went to King’s Cross to pick up telephone calls. Many people called in and he witnessed as casual passers-by engaged in conversations with strangers who were perhaps halfway across the world. The project brought people together, if only for a few brief moments, to create a network through the communication medium of telephones. In Digital Humanities, a class by Professor Michael Shanks at [[Stanford University]], the project is described: “the train station was transformed into an art platform and the unsuspecting commuters and workers in the area became the audience.” [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927221322/http://foresight.stanford.edu:3455/DigitalHumanities/229] After the phone-in art was completed, Bunting reported back to his followers about the experience on his website and encouraged others to do the same. [http://irational.org/cybercafe/xrep.html] All of these are still available at [http://www.irational.org/ Irational.org].

This is an early example of a [[flash mob]] and instigating action through a then-passive medium. Bunting's work has been compared to the work of [[Allan Kaprow]], one of the pioneers in performance art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==BorderXing==
Commissioned by the TATE of Britain and the Luxembourg-based Fondation Musée d'Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean (MUDAM) in 2002, Borderxing details ways to cross international borders throughout Europe without legal documentation. It provides video, photography, maps, and necessary materials on the project website. It demonstrate how to succeed without being located by dogs, and when not to run to avoid being shot. There is even a supplemental botanical guide so you can avoid poisonous plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/419 |title=Rules of Crime: Kayle Brandon &amp; Heath Bunting |last=Phillips |first=Lisa |publisher=New Museum News |date=2004–2005 |website=newmuseum.org |access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunting reveals that restriction of movement set in place by governments and bureaucracies. The project shows not only the restriction of physical borders, but the concept that the internet is not a borderless space. Bunting limits access to the project. You must be at a designated location to access the site or apply to be an authorized client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.tate.org.uk/intermediaart/borderxing.shtm |title= BorderXing Guide |author=&lt;!--Not stated --&gt;|publisher=Tate |date=2002–2003 |website=www2.tate.org.uk |access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hellenic Football Federation''' ('''HFF'''), also known as the '''Greek Football Federation''' ({{lang-el|Ελληνική Ποδοσφαιρική Ομοσπονδία; ΕΠΟ}}), is the governing body of [[association football|football]] in [[Greece]]. It contributes in the organisation of [[Superleague Greece]] and organizes the [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] and the [[Greece national football team|Greece national team]]. It is based in [[Athens]].

==History==
[[File:Old Hellenic Football Federation.png|left|thumb|logo|120px|Old crest (1994–2005)]]
The Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) was founded on 14 November 1926 by a decision of the three major Unions of the country: Athens, Piraeus and Thessalonica. Its foundation marked the organization of Greek football in compliance with international standards. Since then, the HFF has grown into the biggest sports federation in Greece, as football in the country is regarded as the "king of sports"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.greeceindex.com/sports/greek_football_federation.html|title = History of Greek Football|date = |accessdate = October 31, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; coming first in the preferences of sports fans.

The HFF is considered a private legal entity and a non-profit organization with registered offices in [[Athens]]. It is the only exclusively qualified body&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in Greece to represent the interests of Greek football and prohibits any political, religious or racial discrimination.

In 1927, the HFF became a member of [[FIFA]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and in 1954 became one of the first members of [[UEFA]]. Amongst its obligations as member of international sports bodies, the HFF accepts the statutes, regulations, directives and decisions issued by FIFA and UEFA. The HFF also has to ensure that they are accepted by all individuals and clubs in Greek football.

On 3 July 2006, [[FIFA]] ruled the HFF was failing to adhere to the principles of the FIFA statutes regarding FIFA's political independence. Accordingly, the HFF was indefinitely suspended from international football. In response, Greek officials proposed a change in FIFA's law. However, FIFA ruled it too constituted an interference of the government in matters that should be under the football federation's jurisdiction. As such, FIFA concluded Greece would not be able to meet its 15 July 2006 deadline and should therefore be suspended until further notice. The suspension would have meant Greek clubs would not be allowed to participate in international competitions, and that the [[Greece national football team|Greece national team]] would not be able to participate in international matches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/en/media/index/0,1369,118144,00.html?articleid=118144 FIFA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070311124406/http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?hlid=400310&amp;CPID=219&amp;clid=517&amp;lid=554&amp;title=Fifa+suspend+Greece Sky Sports]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also doubts cast over whether the [[2007 UEFA Champions League Final|2007 UEFA Champions League final]] will be played at Athens' [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Olympic Stadium]] as previously scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/football/ucl/news/news_detail22.html|title=MasterCard - Global Leading Company in Payment Solutions Offering Credit, Debit, Prepaid Cards &amp; More|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 7 July 2006, the Greek government ratified a new version of the sports law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/0,1518,426387,00.html|title=Fifa-Sperre: Griechische Regierung lenkt ein|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=12 July 2006|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; granting the HFF independence and therefore adherence to FIFA's laws. FIFA announced the lifting of its ban that day, judging that the amendments adhered to FIFA and UEFA statutes. This allowed Greece to participate in [[UEFA Euro 2008]] and also allowed Greek clubs to participate in European competitions.

On 11 December 2008, HFF president Vassilis Gagatsis resigned from his position after an eight-year tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazzetta.gr/content/view/18671/3/ Gagatsis resigns as EPO president] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; New elections were held on 17 January 2009, making Giorgos Sarris the new president. However, Sarris' election was controversial, with reports claiming the election was not fair and that [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] owner [[Evangelos Marinakis]] had allegedly using his power to help appoint Sarris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/blog/broken-promises-the-sad-tale-of-greek-football/|title = Broken promises – the sad tale of Greek football|date = October 2, 2014|accessdate = October 31, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.internationalpolicydigest.org/2014/09/26/europe-s-football-battlefield/|title = Europe's Football Battlefield|date = September 26, 2014|accessdate = October 31, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the HFF announced its new partnership with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], which also became the official supplier of clothes and equipment for the Greece national team. On the eve of the announcement, Giorgos Sarris praised the new partnership&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.nike.com/news/nike-and-hellenic-football-federation-announce-partnership|title = Nike and Hellenic Football Federation announce partnership|date = April 10, 2013|accessdate = October 31, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; hoping that "it will contribute to the overall advancement of domestic football".

=== 2015 Greek football scandal ===
{{Main|2015 Greek football scandal}}

The 2015 Greek football scandal emerged on 6 April 2015 when prosecutor Aristidis Korreas' 173-page work was revealed. [[Telephone tapping]] operated by the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|National Intelligence Service of Greece]] since 2011 has played a significant role in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://directnews.gr/athletics/60110-olo-to-porisma-tou-eisaggelea-ar-korea-gia-ta-sthmena-sto-podosfairo-protagonistikos-o-rolos-tou-vaggelh-marinakh-eggrafa.html | script-title = el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page = 12 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015 | title = Archived copy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410102133/http://directnews.gr/athletics/60110-olo-to-porisma-tou-eisaggelea-ar-korea-gia-ta-sthmena-sto-podosfairo-protagonistikos-o-rolos-tou-vaggelh-marinakh-eggrafa.html | archive-date = 10 April 2015 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prosecutor's conclusion, Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis along with HFF members Theodoros Kouridis and Georgios Sarris, were suspected of directing a criminal organization since 2011. The goal behind their scheme was allegedly to "absolutely control Greek football's fate by the methods of blackmailing and fraud",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://europe.newsweek.com/greece-charges-41-over-match-fixing-football-scandal-deepens-327763 | title=Greece charges 41 over match-fixing as football scandal deepens | publisher = europe.newsweek.com | date = 27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://directnews.gr/athletics/60110-olo-to-porisma-tou-eisaggelea-ar-korea-gia-ta-sthmena-sto-podosfairo-protagonistikos-o-rolos-tou-vaggelh-marinakh-eggrafa.html | script-title = el:Πόρισμα εισαγγελέα Αριστείδη Κορρέα για την ύπαρξη εγκληματικής οργάνωσης στο ποδόσφαιρο | page = 159 | language = Greek | publisher = Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges | date = 3 December 2014 | accessdate = 6 April 2015 | title = Archived copy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410102133/http://directnews.gr/athletics/60110-olo-to-porisma-tou-eisaggelea-ar-korea-gia-ta-sthmena-sto-podosfairo-protagonistikos-o-rolos-tou-vaggelh-marinakh-eggrafa.html | archive-date = 10 April 2015 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/politics/op-ed-greek-officials-still-playing-dirty/article/404010|title=Op-Ed: Greek officials still playing dirty|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/04/sixteen-charged-greek-football-match-fixing-investigation|title=Sixteen reportedly charged in Greek football match-fixing investigation|work=the Guardian|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalpolicydigest.org/2014/09/26/europe-s-football-battlefield/|title=Europe’s Football Battlefield|work=International Policy Digest|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sdna.gr/gr/news-in-english/arthro-news-in-english/36238/marinakis-accused-for-bribery/ | title=Marinakis accused for bribery | publisher = sdna.gr | date = 13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploiting the self-governing ("autonomy") status of national football federations promoted by FIFA and UEFA. 

In 2016, a temporary administration was placed by FIFA and UEFA due to the scandal.

On 28 December 2017 an envelop with a bullet was sent to the new president Evangelos Grammenos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdna.gr/podosfairo/ellada/article/414783/sok-esteilan-sfaira-ston-vaggeli-grammeno#disqus_thread_414783 sdna.gr]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
The HFF has also been subject to allegations of other crimes, including [[blackmail]] and [[tax evasion]]. In November 2013, a team of prosecutors raided the headquarters of the HFF in order to find evidence of illegal activity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/11/15/prosecutors-examine-epos-illegal-activities/|title = Prosecutors examine EPO's Illegal Activities|date = November 15, 2013|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://euobserver.com/opinion/126274|title = Greek corruption undermining recovery|date = October 28, 2014|accessdate = October 31, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been allegations some of the teams have failed to pay their taxes by submitting fake documents.

Since 2015, the HFF has also been under judicial investigation  regarding the existence of a "pyramid's economic scheme" in the Greek referees' society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/article/751250/h-megali-mpizna-tis-diaitisias|title=H μεγάλη μπίζνα της διαιτησίας|author=Θάνος Σαρρής|date=28 May 2015|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=38405&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=64207048|title=Υπόθεση «πυραμίδας» στη διαιτησία!|author=Pegasus Interactive|work=ethnos.gr|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdna.gr/news-english/article/135584/ex-referees-bring-elements-about-pyramid-scheme|title=Ex-referees bring elements about "pyramid scheme"|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giorgos Girzikis, ex-president of the HFF, is also under penal prosecution for three [[felony]] economic crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=soccer&amp;id=2399048|title=Soccer-Greek soccer chief charged with forgery|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensourcesinfo.org/crime-and-football/|title=Crime and football|author=Paulo Felix|work=OSINT|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6450">'''Hip hop activism''' is a term coined by the [[hip hop]] intellectual and journalist [[Harry Allen (journalist)|Harry Allen]]. It is meant to describe an activist movement of the post- [[baby boomer]] generation. 

The hip hop generation was defined in ''The Hip- Hop Generation: Young Blacks and the Crisis in African American Culture'' as African Americans born between 1965 and 1984. This group is situated between the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and the assassination of [[Malcolm X]] on one end and hip hop's explosion during the 1970s and 1980s. But the hip-hop generation can be more loosely defined to include minorities born between 1965 and 1984 who have grown up within a culture of hip hop music, dance, fashion and art. 
[http://www.alternet.org/story/28118/]

Some of the issues of [[social justice]] the movement addresses are [[minority rights|minority]] and [[immigration]] rights, educational access, prison reform and transportation policy. In recent years [[California]]'s [[California Proposition 187 (1994)|Proposition 187]] and [[California Proposition 21 (2000)|Proposition 21]] have also been a focus of hip hop activism. The movement also addresses a broad range of social change practices like [[Youth activism|youth organizing]] and [[Youth development|development]], cultural work, and intercultural exchanges.

== Evolution and context ==

The mid-1990s were a particularly active period for the hip-hop agenda. In 1994, [[C. Delores Tucker]] told a [[United States Senate|Senate]] panel that the hip-hop generation, "coaxed by [[gangster rap]],' would "trigger a crime wave of epidemic proportions that we have never seen the likes of." And then added, "Regardless of the number of jails built, it will not be enough." 

In his book ''[[Can't Stop Won't Stop (book)|Can't Stop Won't Stop]]'', author [[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Jeff Chang]] traces the evolution of the hip hop activist movement noting that it was initially mostly grass roots and locally focused. But as movements against the [[prison-industrial complex]] and [[police brutality]] emerged simultaneous to movements against corporate [[globalization]], many young hip hop activists began to organize nationally.

As hip hop has become a globalized art form, hip hop's progressive, activist agenda has traveled with it around the world.  Organizers in Paris, Cape Town, Sweden, New Zealand Chile and in countless other countries have employed the tools of hip hop to work for change in communities, empower youth and give voice to unchecked issues.  While gangster rap has been blamed by cultural critics for triggering crime waves, hip hop activism has stood up against the prison industrial complex, addressed [[environmental racism]] (many went on to encompass [[green politics]]) and corrupt systems that cause poverty around the world.  Global hip hop activism does not only employ rap music, but also works within the other pillars of hip hop, such as creating youth empowerment projects by teaching graffiti art or break dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Chang. "Its a Hip Hop World" Nov/Dec 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, a movement called Afro-Reggae was started by former drug dealers to help keep favela children out of the drug trade by teaching them to be emcees and break dancers.  The movement gained international fame in the documentary "Favela Rising"&lt;ref&gt;Favela Rising, favelarising.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anti-Injustice Movement (aka The AIM) is a rapidly expanding international hip-hop activist movement composed of political emcees (aka 'raptivists'), protest poets, DJs, street dancers, graffiti writers and activists who are fighting many forms of global injustice via peaceful and creative means.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== California Propositions 187 and 21 ==

A significant factor in the national organizing of hip-hop activist in recent years can be attributed to legislation passed in response to waves of migration and immigration from [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. This legislation included Proposition 187, which ended [[affirmative action]] and [[bilingual education]] in California, and Proposition 21, which demanded tougher sentencing and longer incarceration for juvenile offenders. Opponents like  [[Paul Johnston (author)|Paul Johnston]] claim that Proposition 187 has only served to increase political, cultural and class factions while marginalizing specific minority populations.
In his essay ''The Emergence of Transnational Citizenship Among Mexican Immigrants in California''  Johnston notes the cultural tensions created by the new legislation.  He explains,

:"These measures failed to halt the flow of undocumented workers to the United States, from Mexico as well as the traumatized Central American communities to the south. Instead, they quickly consolidated a deep divide in the social structure of the state, based on differences in citizenship status. The growth of this population, its increasingly criminalized and vulnerable status, and its impoverished, furtive, marginalized way of life under the new anti-immigrant policy regime has created circumstances that might fairly be described as a new [[apartheid]] in California."

Despite criticism the measures were passed and are supported by many Californians and their politicians. The discontent the legislation spurred, however, continues to be a focus of hip hop activists throughout the United States.

[[File:Decorated Incipit Page - Google Art Project (6850309).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Decorated incipit page to the [[Gospel of Matthew]], 1120–1140]]

The '''incipit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|n|s|ɪ|p|ɪ|t}})&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|incipit}} The ''OED''-recommended pronunciation competes in everyday usage with several others: [ɪnˈsɪpɪt], [ˈɪnkɪpɪt], [ɪnˈkɪpɪt], [ˈɪntʃɪpit], and [ɪnˈtʃɪpɪt]. Of these, the use of second-syllable stress and of [k] for letter ''c'' is endorsed by [[Merriam-Webster]] on its dictionary web site ([http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incipit]). Pronunciations with [tʃ] are based on the Italian rendition of letter ''c'' before ''i''.  For discussion of the variants, see [http://archive.choralnet.org/194865 ChoralNet].&lt;/ref&gt; of a text is the first few words of the text, employed as an identifying label. In a [[musical composition]], an incipit is an initial sequence of [[Musical note|notes]], having the same purpose. The word ''incipit'' comes from [[Latin]] and means "it begins". Its counterpart taken from the ending of the text is the '''explicit''' ("it ends").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the development of [[title (publishing)|titles]], texts were often referred to by their incipits, as with for example ''[[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]''. During the [[medieval period]] in Europe, incipits were often written in a different [[Typeface|script]] or colour from the rest of the work of which they were a part, and "incipit pages" might be heavily decorated with illumination. Though the word ''incipit'' is Latin, the practice of the incipit predates [[classical antiquity]] by several millennia and can be found in various parts of the world. Although not always called by the name of ''incipit'' today, the practice of referring to texts by their initial words remains commonplace.

==Historical examples==

===Sumerian===
In the [[clay tablet]] [[archive]]s of [[Sumer]], catalogs of documents were kept by making special catalog tablets containing the incipits of a given collection of tablets.

The catalog was meant to be used by the very limited number of official [[scribe]]s who had access to the archives, and the width of a clay tablet and its resolution did not permit long entries. This is a Sumerian example from Lerner:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Honored and noble warrior
Where are the sheep
Where are the wild oxen
And with you I did not
In our city
In former days
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Hebrew===
[[File:First page of the first tractate of the Talmud (Daf Beis of Maseches Brachos).jpg|thumb|The first page of the [[Vilna]] Edition of the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Berachot, folio 2a., with the word "Me-ematai" in the box at the top]]

Many books in the [[Hebrew Bible]] are named in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] using incipits. For instance, the first book (Genesis) is called ''Bereshit'' ("In the beginning ...") and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], which begins "How lonely sits the city...", is called ''Eykha'' ("How"). A readily recognized one is the "Shema" or ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' in the [[Torah]]: "Hear O Israel..."&amp;nbsp;– the first words of the prayer encapsulating Judaism's monotheism (see beginning [[Deuteronomy]] 6:4 and elsewhere).

All the names of [[Weekly Torah portion|Parashot]] are incipits, the title coming from a word, occasionally two words, in its first two verses. The first in each book are, of course, called by the same name as the book as a whole.

Some of the [[Psalms]] are known by their incipits, most noticeably [[Psalm 51]] (Septuagint numbering: Psalm 50), which is known in [[Western Christianity]] by its Latin incipit ''[[Psalm 51|Miserere]]'' ("Have mercy").

In the [[Talmud]], the chapters of the [[Gemara]] are titled in print and known by their first words, e.g. the first chapter of [[Mishnah|Mesekhet]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berachot]] ("Benedictions") is called Me-ematai ("From when"). This word is printed at the head of every subsequent page within that chapter of the tractate.

In [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] usage, the incipit is known as the "dibur ha-matḥil" (דיבור המתחיל), or "beginning phrase", and refers to a section heading in a published monograph or commentary that typically, but not always, quotes or paraphrases a classic biblical or rabbinic passage to be commented upon or discussed.

Many religious songs and prayers are known by their opening words.

Sometimes an entire monograph is known by its "dibur hamatḥil". The published mystical and [[exegesis|exegetical]] discourses of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] rebbes (called "ma'amarim"), derive their titles almost exclusively from the "dibur ha-matḥil" of the individual work's first chapter.

===Ancient Greek===

The final book of the [[New Testament]], the [[Book of Revelation]], is often known as the Apocalypse after the first word of the original Greek text, [[wikt:ἀποκάλυψις|ἀποκάλυψις]] ''apokalypsis'' “revelation”, to the point where that word has become synonymous with what the book describes, i.e. the [[End time|End of Days]] ([[wikt:ἔσχατον|ἔσχατον]] ''eschaton'' “[the] last” in the original).

===Papal bulls===
{{main|List of papal bulls}}
Traditionally, [[Papal Bull|papal bulls]], documents issued under the authority of the [[Pope]], are referenced by their [[Latin]] incipit.

===Hindu texts===
Some of the [[mantras]], [[sukta]]s from the hymns of the [[Rigveda|Vedas]], conform to this usage.

==Modern uses of incipits==

The idea of choosing a few words or a phrase or two, which would be placed on the spine of a book and its cover, developed slowly with the birth of [[printing]], and the idea of a title page with a short title and subtitle came centuries later, replacing earlier, more verbose titles.

The modern use of standardized titles, combined with the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD), have made the incipit obsolete as a tool for organizing information in libraries.

However, incipits are still used to refer to untitled poems, songs, and prayers, such as [[Gregorian chant]]s, [[opera]]tic arias, many prayers and hymns, and numerous poems, including those of [[Emily Dickinson]]. That such a use is an incipit and not a title is most obvious when the line breaks off in the middle of a grammatical unit (e.g. [[Shakespeare]]'s [[sonnet]] 55 "Not marble, nor the gilded monuments").

[[Law Latin|Latin]] legal concepts are often designated by the first few words, for example, ''habeas corpus'' for ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' ("may you have the person to be subjected [to examination]").

Many [[word processor]]s propose the first few words of a document as a default file name, assuming that the incipit may correspond to the intended title of the document.

The space-filling, or place-holding, text [[lorem ipsum]] is known as such from its incipit.

Occasionally, incipits have been used for humorous effect, such as in the [[Alan Plater]]-penned television series ''[[The Beiderbecke Affair]]'' and its sequels, in which each episode is named for the first words spoken in the episode (leading to episode titles such as "What I don't understand is this..." and "Um...I know what you're thinking").

Musical incipits are printed in standard music notation. They typically feature the first few [[bar (music)|bars]] of a piece, often with the most prominent musical material written on a single [[staff (music)|staff]] (the examples given at right show both the single-staff and full-score incipit variants). Incipits are especially useful in music because they can call to mind the reader's own musical memory of the work where a printed title would fail to do so. Musical incipits appear both in catalogs of music and in the tables of contents of volumes that include multiple works.

In choral music, sacred or secular pieces from before the 20th century were often titled with the incipit text. For instance, the proper of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and the [[Latin]] transcriptions of the biblical psalms used as prayers during services are always titled with the first word or words of the text. [[Protestant]] hymns of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are also traditionally titled with an incipit.

==In computer science==

In computer science, long [[String (computer science)|strings of characters]] may be referred to by their incipits, particularly [[Key (cryptography)|encryption keys]] or [[product key]]s. Notable examples include [[FCKGW]] (used by [[Windows XP]]) and [[09 F9]] (used by [[Advanced Access Content System]]).

Intersex people have been treated in different ways by different cultures. Whether or not they were socially tolerated or accepted by any particular culture, the existence of intersex people was known to many ancient and pre-modern cultures and legal systems, and numerous historical accounts exist.

==Ancient history==

===Sumer===
A [[Sumer]]ian [[creation myth]] from more than 4,000 years ago has [[Ninmah]], a [[mother goddess]], fashioning humanity out of clay.&lt;ref name="The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.1.2# |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |accessdate=9 December 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224092841/http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.1.2 |archivedate=24 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She boasts that she will determine the fate – good or bad – for all she fashions:

{{quotation|Enki answered Ninmah: "I will counterbalance whatever fate – good or bad – you happen to decide.
Ninmah took clay from the top of the abzu [ab: water; zu: far] in her hand and she fashioned from it first a man who could not bend his outstretched weak hands.
Enki looked at the man who cannot bend his outstretched weak hands, and decreed his fate: he appointed him as a servant of the king.
(Three men and one woman with atypical biology are formed and Enki gives each of them various forms of status to ensure respect for their uniqueness)
...Sixth, she fashioned one with neither penis nor vagina on its body. Enki looked at the one with neither penis nor vagina on its body and gave it the name ''Nibru'' (eunuch(?)), and decreed as its fate to stand before the king.&lt;ref name="The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature" /&gt;}}

=== Ancient Judaism ===
In traditional Jewish culture, intersex individuals were either ''[[androgynos]]'' or ''[[Tumtum (Judaism)|tumtum]]'' and took on different gender roles, sometimes conforming to men's, sometimes to women's.{{explain|date=October 2018}}

=== Ancient Islam ===
By the eighth century CE, records of Islamic legal rulings discuss individuals known in Arabic as ''khuntha.'' This term, which has been translated as "hermaphrodite," was used to apply to individuals with a range of intersex conditions, including [[Mixed gonadal dysgenesis|mixed gonadal disgenesis]], male [[hypospadias]], [[partial androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[5α-Reductase deficiency|5-alpha reductase deficiency]], gonadal [[aplasia]], and [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gesink|first=Indira Falk|date=July 2018|title=Intersex Bodies in Premodern Islamic Discourse|url=|journal=Journal of Middle East Women's Studies|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=14|pages=|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In premodern Islamic law, [[inheritance]] was determined based on sex, so it was sometimes necessary to attempt to determine the biological sex of sexually ambiguous heirs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first recorded case of this sort has been attributed to the seventh-century [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] caliph named '[[Ali]], who attempted to settle an inheritance case between five brothers in which one brother had both a male and female [[Urinary meatus|urinary opening]]. 'Ali advised the brothers that sex could be determined by site of urination in a practice called ''hukm al-mabal''; if urine exited the male opening, the individual was male, and if it exited the female opening, the individual was female. If it exited both openings simultaneously, as it did in this case, the heir would be given half of a male inheritance and half of a female inheritance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haneef|first=Sayed Sikandar Shah|last2=Abd Majid|first2=Mahmood Zuhdi Haji|date=December 2015|title=Medical Management of Infant Intersex: The Juridico-Ethical Dilemma of Contemporary Islamic Legal Response|url=|journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science|volume=50|pages=809-829|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the thirteenth century CE, [[Shafi‘i|Shafi'i]] law expert Abu Zakariya al-Nawawi ruled that an individual whose sex could not be determined by ''hukm al-mabal'', such as those with urination from both openings or those with no identifiable sex organs, was assigned the intermediary sex category ''khuntha mushkil''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Both [[Hanafi]] and [[Hanbali]] lawmakers also recognized that [[puberty]] could clarify a new dominant sex in intersex individuals who were labeled ''khuntha,'' male, or female in childhood. If a ''khuntha'' or male developed female secondary sex characteristics, performed vaginal sex, lactacted, menstruated, or conceived, this person's legal sex could change to female. Conversely, if a ''khuntha'' or female developed male secondary sex characteristics, performed penetrative sex with a woman, or had an erection, their legal sex could change to male. This understanding of the effect of puberty on intersex conditions appears in Islamic law as early as the eleventh century CE, notably by [[Ibn Qudamah|Ibn Qudama]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the sixteenth century CE, [[Ibrāhīm al-Ḥalabī|Ibrahim al-Halabi]], a member of the [[Hanafi]] school of [[jurisprudence]] in Islam, directed slave owners to use special gender-neutral language when freeing intersex slaves. He recognized that language manumitting "males" or "females" would not directly apply to them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Ancient South Asia===
The [[Tirumantiram]] [[Tirumular]] recorded the relationship between intersex people and [[Shiva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maraikkappatta Pakkangal: மறைக்கப்பட்ட பக்கங்கள்|last=Winter |first=Gopi Shankar|year=2014 |publisher=Srishti Madurai |isbn=9781500380939 |oclc=703235508 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|date=September 2018}}

[[Ardhanarishvara]], an androgynous composite form of male deity [[Shiva]] and female deity [[Parvati]], originated in [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] culture as far back as the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54930404|title=Encyclopaedia of the Śaivism|last=Swami.|first=Parmeshwaranand,|date=2004|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=8176254274|edition= 1st|location=New Delhi|oclc=54930404}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A statue depicting Ardhanarishvara is included in India's [[Meenakshi Temple|Meenkashi Temple]]; this statue clearly shows both male and female bodily elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shankar|first=Gopi|date=March–April 2015|title=The Many Genders of Old India|url=|journal=The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|volume=22|pages=24–26|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the presence of intersex traits, Ardhanarishvara is associated with the ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]],''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History|last=|first=|publisher=Zone Books|year=1996|isbn=|editor-last=Herdt|editor-first=Gilbert|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third sex category that has been accepted in South Asia for centuries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After interviewing and studying the ''hijra'' for many years, Serena Nanda writes in her book ''Neither Man Nor Woman: The Hijras of India'' as follows: "There is a widespread belief in India that ''hijras'' are born [[hermaphrodite]]s [intersex] and are taken away by the ''hijra'' community at birth or in childhood, but I found no evidence to support this belief among the ''hijras'' I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens."&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena. Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India, p. xx. Canada: Wadworth Publishing Company, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Herdt, the ''hijra'' differentiate between "born" and "made" individuals, or those who have physical intersex traits by birth and those who become ''hijra'' through penectomy, respectively.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to Indian tradition, the ''hijra'' perform a traditional song and dance as part of a family's celebration of the birth of a male child; during the performance, they also inspect the newborn's genitals to verify its sex. Herdt states that it is widely accepted that if the child is intersex, the ''hijra'' have a right to claim it as part of their community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded but provokes parental fear.&lt;ref name="warne2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s11154-008-9084-2| issn = 1389-9155| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 227–236| last1 = Warne| first1 = Garry L.| last2 = Raza| first2 = Jamal| title = Disorders of sex development (DSDs), their presentation and management in different cultures| journal = Reviews in Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders| date = September 2008| url = http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11154-008-9084-2| pmid=18633712}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''hijra'' are mentioned in some versions of the [[Ramayana]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] epic poem from around 300 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ramayana-Indian-epic|title=Ramayana {{!}} Indian epic|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[myth]] about the hero [[Rama]] instructing his devotees to return to the city [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]] rather than follow him across the city's adjacent river into banishment.

In the [[Tantra|Tantric]] sect of Hinduism, there is a belief that all individuals possess both male and female components. This belief can be seen explicitly in the Tantric concept of a Supreme Being with both male and female [[Sex organ|sex organs,]] which constitutes "one complete sex" and the ideal physical form.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Ancient Greece===

According to DeVun, a "traditional Hippocratic/Galenic model of sexual difference – popularized by the late antique physician [[Galen]] and the ascendant theory for much of the Middle Ages – viewed sex as a spectrum that encompassed masculine men, feminine women, and many shades in between, including hermaphrodites, a perfect balance of male and female".&lt;ref name="devun-2018"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1057/s41280-018-0080-8| issn = 2040-5960| volume = 9| issue = 2| pages = 132–146| last = DeVun| first = Leah| title = Heavenly hermaphrodites: sexual difference at the beginning and end of time| journal = Postmedieval| date = June 2018| url = http://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41280-018-0080-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeVun contrasts this with an Artistotelian view of intersex, which argued that "hermaphrodites were not an intermediate sex but a case of doubled or superfluous genitals", and this later influenced Aquinas.&lt;ref name="devun-2018" /&gt;

In the [[classical mythology|mythological tradition]], [[Hermaphroditus]] was a beautiful youth who was the son of [[Hermes]] (Roman [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) and Aphrodite (Venus).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 4.287–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid wrote the most influential narrative&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Moral Mirror of Roman Art'', p. 77; Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; of how Hermaphroditus became androgynous, emphasizing that although the handsome youth was on the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Rites of passage|cusp of sexual adulthood]], he rejected love as [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] had, and likewise at the site of a reflective pool.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Moral Mirror of Roman Art'', p. 78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; There the water nymph [[Salmacis]] saw and desired him. He spurned her, and she pretended to withdraw until, thinking himself alone, he undressed to bathe in her waters. She then flung herself upon him, and prayed that they might never be parted. The gods granted this request, and thereafter the body of Hermaphroditus contained both male and female. As a result, men who drank from the waters of the spring Salmacis supposedly "grew soft with the vice of ''[[#Impudicitia|impudicitia]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ex Festo 439L; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; The myth of [[Hylas]], the young companion of Hercules who was [[Lympha#Divine madness|abducted by water nymphs]], shares with Hermaphroditus and Narcissus the theme of the dangers that face the beautiful adolescent male as he transitions to adult masculinity, with varying outcomes for each.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Moral Mirror of Roman Art'', p. 216, note 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny notes that "there are even those who are born of both sexes, whom we call hermaphrodites, at one time ''[[androgyn]]i''" (''andr-'', "man," and ''gyn-'', "woman", from the Greek).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 7.34: ''gignuntur et utriusque sexus quos hermaphroditos vocamus, olim androgynos vocatos''; Veronique Dasen, "Multiple Births in Graeco-Roman Antiquity," ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'' 16.1 (1997), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the era also saw a historical account of a congenital eunuch.&lt;ref name = "Philostratus" /&gt;

The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] (latter 1st-century BC) wrote of "hermaphroditus" in the first century BCE:

{{quotation|Hermaphroditus, as he has been called, who was born of Hermes and Aphrodite and received a name which is a combination of those of both his parents. Some say that this Hermaphroditus is a god and appears at certain times among men, and that he is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman, in that he has a body which is beautiful and delicate like that of a woman, but has the masculine quality and vigour of man. But there are some who declare that such creatures of two sexes are monstrosities, and coming rarely into the world as they do they have the quality of presaging the future, sometimes for evil and sometimes for good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harvard University Press| last = [[Diodorus Siculus]]| others = C H Oldfather (trans.)| title = Library of History (Book IV)| location = Cambridge, MA| series = Loeb Classical Library Volumes 303 and 340| date = 1935| url = http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html#6| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080927074542/http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html#6| archivedate = 2008-09-27| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Isidore of Seville]] (''c.'' 560–636) described a hermaphrodite fancifully as those who "have the right breast of a man and the left of a woman, and after coitus in turn can both sire and bear children."&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]], ''Eytmologiae'' 11.3. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Roman law, as many others, a hermaphrodite had to be classed as either male or female.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn E. Roller, "The Ideology of the Eunuch Priest," ''Gender &amp; History'' 9.3 (1997), p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; Roscoe states that the hermaphrodite represented a "violation of social boundaries, especially those as fundamental to daily life as male and female."&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe, "Priests of the Goddess," p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anasyromenos statuette, Rome art market.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Aphroditos]]]]
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman religion]], a hermaphroditic birth was a kind of ''[[prodigium]]'', an occurrence that signalled a disturbance of the ''[[pax deorum]]'', Rome's treaty with the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Veit Rosenberger, "Republican ''nobiles'': Controlling the ''Res Publica''," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; But Pliny observed that while hermaphrodites were once considered [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#portentum|portents]], in his day they had become objects of delight (''deliciae'') who were [[human trafficking|trafficked]] in an exclusive slave market.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'' 520c; Dasen, "Multiple Births in Graeco-Roman Antiquity," p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Clarke, depictions of Hermaphroditus were very popular among the Romans:
{{quotation|Artistic representations of Hermaphroditus bring to the fore the ambiguities in sexual differences between women and men as well as the ambiguities in all sexual acts. ... (A)rtists always treat Hermaphroditus in terms of the viewer finding out his/her actual sexual identity. ... Hermaphroditus is a highly sophisticated representation, invading the boundaries between the sexes that seem so clear in classical thought and representation.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, ''Looking at Lovemaking'', pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In c.400, [[Augustine]] wrote in ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'' that humans were created in two sexes, despite "as happens in some births, in the case of what we call androgynes".&lt;ref name="devun-2018" /&gt;

Historical accounts of intersex people include the [[sophist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Favorinus]], described as a [[eunuch]] (εὐνοῦχος) by birth.&lt;ref name = "Philostratus"&gt;Philostratus, VS 489&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swain, Simon, "Favorinus and Hadrian," in ''ZPE'' 79 (1989), 150-158&lt;/ref&gt; Mason and others thus describe Favorinus as having an [[intersex]] trait.&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;Mason, H.J., Favorinus’ Disorder: Reifenstein's Syndrome in Antiquity?, in Janus 66 (1978) 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horstmanshoff (2000) 103 n. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Amato (intr., ed., comm.) and Yvette Julien (trans.), ''Favorinos d'Arles, Oeuvres I. Introduction générale - Témoignages - Discours aux Corinthiens - Sur la Fortune'', Paris: Les Belles Lettres (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad sense of the term "eunuch" is reflected in the compendium of ancient [[Roman law]]s collected by [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century known as the Digest or [[Pandects]]. Those texts distinguish between the general category of eunuchs (''spadones'', denoting "one who has no generative power, an impotent person, whether by nature or by castration",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2344853
|title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary''|accessdate=21 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; D 50.16.128) and the more specific subset of ''castrati'' (castrated males, physically incapable of procreation). Eunuchs (''spadones'') sold in the slave markets were deemed by the jurist [[Ulpian]] to be "not defective or diseased, but healthy", because they were anatomically able to procreate just like [[monorchid]]s (D 21.1.6.2). On the other hand, as [[Julius Paulus]] pointed out, "if someone is a eunuch in such a way that he is missing a necessary part of his body" (D 21.1.7), then he would be deemed diseased. In these Roman legal texts, ''spadones (eunuchs)'' are eligible to marry women (D 23.3.39.1), institute posthumous heirs (D 28.2.6), and adopt children (Institutions of Justinian 1.11.9), ''unless'' they are ''castrati''.

In ''Abnormal'' (''Les anormaux''), [[Michel Foucault]] suggested it is likely that, "from the Middle Ages to the sixteenth century ... hermaphrodites were considered to be monsters and were executed, burnt at the stake and their ashes thrown to the winds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foucault | first = Michel | authorlink = Michel Foucault | title = Abnormal: Lectures at the Collège de France 1974-1975 | date = 2003 | publisher = Verso | page = 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Christof Rolker disputes this, arguing that "Contrary to what has been claimed, there is no evidence for hermaphrodites being persecuted in the Middle Ages, and the learned laws did certainly not provide any basis for such persecution".&lt;ref name="rolker-2014" /&gt; [[Canon Law]] sources provide evidence of alternative perspectives, based upon prevailing visual indications and the performance of gendered roles.&lt;ref name="Rolker"&gt;{{Cite paper| last = Rolker| first = Christof| title = Double sex, double pleasure?

In the late twelfth century, the canon lawyer [[Huguccio]] stated that, "If someone has a beard, and always wishes to act like a man (excercere virilia) and not like a female, and always wishes to keep company with men and not with women, it is a sign that the male sex prevails in him and then he is able to be a witness, where a woman is not allowed".&lt;ref name="Raming"&gt;{{cite book | title = A History of Women and Ordination | last1 = Raming | first1 = Ida | last2 = Macy | first2 = Gary | last3 = Bernard J | first3 = Cook | publisher = [[Scarecrow Press]] | date = 2004 | page = 113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the ordination of 'hermaphrodites', Huguccio concluded: "If therefore the person is drawn to the feminine more than the male, the person does not receive the order.

The 17th-century English jurist and judge [[Edward Coke]] (Lord Coke), wrote in his ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England]]'' on laws of succession stating, "Every heire is either a male, a female, or an hermaphrodite, that is both male and female. And an hermaphrodite (which is also called ''Androgynus'') shall be heire, either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Coke|E Coke]], The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England, Institutes 8.a.

A few historical accounts of intersex people exist due primarily to the discovery of relevant legal records, including those of [[Thomas(ine) Hall]] (17th-century USA), [[:es:Eleno de Céspedes|Eleno de Céspedes]], a 16th-century intersex person in Spain {{es}}, and [[Fernanda Fernández]] (18th-century Spain).

During the [[Victorian era]], medical authors introduced the terms "true hermaphrodite" for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, verified under a microscope, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy.

'''Iramba''', also known as '''Nilamba''' (there is no distinction between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}) is a [[Bantu language]] of spoken by the [[Nilamba people|Nilamba]] and [[Iambi people]] of the [[Iramba District in Singida Region]] of [[Tanzania]]. 

Forms of the name occur with and without the prefix ''ni-'' or ''i-'', as well as ''iki-'' (Swahili ''ki-'') as the [[noun-class]] prefix for 'language', and variation of ''r ~ l ~ ly'' in the root. This results in a large number of superficial variants, including ''Nilamba, Niramba, Nilyamba, Nyilamba, Ikinilamba, Ikiniramba, Ilamba, Iramba, Kinilamba, Kiniramba''; there is also ''Nilambari''. 

The 50,000 Iambi speak a slightly divergent dialect, sometimes listed as a distinct language. On the other hand, the [[Isanzu language]] is sometimes included as a dialect.&lt;ref name="Guthrie" /&gt;

'''Italians in Albania''' is related to the [[Italian people|Italian]] migration into what is today [[Albania]] that has been going on, in different migrating cycles, for centuries, beginning after the [[Roman empire]] times right to the modern age. Actually (January first, 2017) there are 1,385 Italians residents in Albania &lt;ref&gt;[http://ucs.interno.gov.it/FILES/AllegatiPag/1263/INT00041_Anagrafe_Italiani_estero_AIRE_ed_2017.pdf AIRE statitics: Albania]&lt;/ref&gt; Other figures show about 19,000 Italians living and working in Albania. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-27733135&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The territory of what is now Albania was fully conquered by the Romans in the century before [[Augustus]]. Roman colonists from the Italian peninsula settled in some cities and [[castra]], like [[Dyrrachium]] (from where started the famous [[Via Egnatia]] that reached [[Constantinople]]) and [[Buthrotum]]. Later, with the definitive subdivision of the Roman Empire, Albania (a country fully latinised, according to historian [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]]&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen."The provinces of the Roman Empire" Section: Roman Dalmatia&lt;/ref&gt;) went to the dependencies of Byzantium. Albania was successively invaded by the barbarians, some of whom created ephemeral lordships (end 6th century: Slavic, 619 AD: Avaric, later Serbian), while only on the coast survived the autochthonous population, mainly in Durrachium and surroundings that were linked by commerce to southern Italy. 

From 917 to 1019 Albania was almost totally absorbed by the Bulgarian kingdom. In the XI century Albania returned under Byzantium, and began to undergo the military penetration of the southern Italy's Normans and subsequent kings of Sicily and Naples. Also was present the commercial presence of Venice, who took advantage of the fourth crusade (1204) to seize it, even if the feudal lords gave themselves to the despot of Epirus Michele Angelo Comneno. The centuries from the year 1000 to the [[Duecento]] and early [[Trecento]] were characterized by a consistent migration of Italians to Albania (mainly as merchants and military personnel but also as religious people).

Conquered in 1230 by the Vlach-Bulgarian tsar [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|John Asjan II]], shortly after Albania passed for the most part to the Serbian kings of the [[Rascia]]. The battle of Kosovo (1389) brought in Albania the Turks, who, first contained by the League of Albanian peoples created in 1444 by Giorgio Castriota, known as [[Skanderbeg]], after his death (1467) conquered all Albania and maintained their rule on the country until the early XX century. During these ottoman centuries there were few Italians in Albania.

With [[WW1]] started the tentative of "assimilation" of Albania by the [[kingdom of Italy]], that was characterized by the arrival of many thousands of colonists (mostly with Albanian roots) from Italy during the [[Mussolini]] fascism. 
[[File:S m. vittorio Emanuele III a Librazo - panoramio (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|300px|"King of Albania" Victor Emmanuel III visiting Albania in 1941]]

In 1919 the island of [[Saseno]] was given to Italy and a small group of fishermen with their families moved from [[Apulia|Puglia]] to live in the island (where they remained until 1947, when the island was officially returned to Albania)&lt;ref&gt;Olinto Mileta. Popolazioni dell'Istria, Fiume, Zara e Dalmazia 1850-2002. ediz. A.D.E.S. Trieste, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1939 Italy and Albania were united under the crown of [[Victor Emmanuel III]]. In April 1939 the [[Albanian Parliament]] proclaimed the Italian King and Emperor Vittorio Emanuele III as the new King. He took the title ''[[King of Albania]]'', which he formally retained until he abdicated as Albanian monarch in September 1943.

===Twentieth century===

Italian naval strategists in the early 1900s eyed the port of [[Vlorë]] and the island of [[Sazan]] at the entrance to the [[Bay of Vlorë]] with considerable interest, as it would give Italy control of the entrance to the Adriatic Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, B. J: ''Albania at War, 1939–1945'', page 5. Hurst, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Albania could provide Italy with a beachhead in the Balkans. Before [[World War I]] Italy and [[Austria-Hungary]] had been instrumental in the creation of an independent Albanian state. At the outbreak of war, Italy had seized the chance to occupy the southern half of Albania, to avoid it being captured by the Austro-Hungarians. That success did not last long, as post-war domestic problems, Albanian resistance, and pressure from United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], forced Italy to pull out in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/albania/25.htm Albania: A Country Study: Albania's Reemergence after World War I, Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mussolini took power in Italy in 1922, he turned with renewed interest to Albania. He complained that the Treaty of London of 1915 had promised to Italy an area around Valona, but the Allies "betrayed" their promises in the 1919 Peace conference. Italy began penetration of Albania's economy in 1925, when Albania agreed to allow it to exploit its mineral resources.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/albania/28.htm Albania: A Country Study: Italian Penetration, Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini favoured a process of "assimilation" of Albania into Italy, with economical influence and finally a military occupation in 1939. He started also sending colonists to Albania: Italian citizens began to settle in Albania as [[colonists]] and to own land so that they could gradually transform it into Italian soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1=Raphael | last1=Lemkin | first2=Samantha | last2=Power | year= 2008 | title=Axis Rule in Occupied Europe | publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. | isbn = 978-1-58477-901-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0in2wOY-W0C | pages=99–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of colonization began in 1926 with 300 colonists.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sjöberg|first=Örjan|title=Rural Change and Development in Albania|year=1991|publisher=Westview Press|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;The first Italians to colonise Albania were fishing families from [[Apulia]], who moved to the island of [[Sazan]] opposite [[Vlora]] in 1918. The island was officially part of Italy from the end of [[World War I]] to 1947.

In 1926, the Italian government, in agreement with Albanian authorities, sent 300 Italian colonists to Kamez, near [[Tirana]], to promote agricultural development.&lt;ref&gt;http://google.com/search?q=cache:x9tD5qB0w4QJ:https://mail.sssup.it/~thoma/papers/caselli_thoma_2003.pdf+coloni+italiani+in+albania&amp;hl=it&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=68&amp;gl=it Italian hegemony in Albania&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Italians were farmers from [[Arberesh]] communities in southern Italy. They were initially successful, and created the company ''Ente industria agraria albanese'' with an agricultural school, but the regime of [[King Zog]] expelled them in 1931, fearing excessive Italian influence in Albanian society and politics.

After the occupation of Albania in April 1939, Mussolini sent nearly 11,000 Italian colonists to Albania. Most of them were from the [[Veneto]] region and [[Sicily]]. They settled primarily in the areas of [[Durrës|Durazzo]], [[Vlorë|Valona]], [[Shkodër|Scutari]], Porto Palermo, [[Elbasani]] and Santi Quaranta. They were the first settlers of a huge group of Italians to be moved to Albania. In addition to these colonists, 22,000 Italian casual laborers went to Albania in April 1940 to construct roads, railways and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Richard. ''Mussolini as Diplomat'' p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian colonists and the Italian "assimilation" were more or less welcomed in spring 1939 when Albania was united to Italy, and were greeted by most Albanians when Albania was enlarged two years later by the Italian &amp; Germany conquest of [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Greece]]. 

{{Quote|''However the unification -even if nominal and done only with the king Victor Emmanuel III- was effective and accepted by the population of Italy and Albania without any real disagreement from the first day of the Italian military occupation of Albania in 1939 until September 1943. Some Albanians still remember those years as a period when they were part of western Europe and out of Balkan problems.'' Borgogni Massimo}}

In those years the architecture of the main cities of Albania was greatly improved: the centre of [[Tirana]] was the project of [[Florestano Di Fausto]], [[Gherardo Bosio]] and Armando Brasini, well known architects of the [[Benito Mussolini]] period in Italy. 
[[File:Tirana, palazzo dell'università 04.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Tirana University building, made by Brasini]]
[[Image:Kryeministria2, Tirane.jpg|thumb|right|300px||Office of the [[Prime Minister of Albania]], built by Bosio in [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalist]] style]]


Brasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre. He created the Tirana University building. Bosio made: 
* Project for the Masterplan of [[Tirana]], [[Albania]], 1939
* [[Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard|"Martyrs of the Nation" Boulevard]], [[Tirana]], [[Albania]], 1939–41 
* [[Hotel Dajti|Grand Hotel Dajti]], [[Tirana]], [[Albania]], 1939–41 
* [[Casa del Fascio]], [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] 1939–41
* Palazzo della Luogotenenza (now housing the Office of the [[Prime Minister of Albania|Prime Minister]]), [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] 1939–41
* [[Presidential Palace, Tirana]], [[Albania]] 1939–41

The master plan for Tirana underwent revisions by the Albanian architect Eshref Frashëri, the Italian architect Castellani, and the Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler. The rectangular parallel road system of Tirana e Re district took shape, while the northern portion of the main Boulevard was opened. These urban plans formed the basis of future developments in Albania after the [[Second World War]].

After the Italian surrender in September 1943 started a period of years very difficult for the Italians in Albania, mainly under the communist dictator [[Enver Hoxha|Hoxha]] regime.

===After WW2===

No Italian colonists remain in Albania. The few who remained under the communist regime of Enver Hoxha escaped (with their descendants) to Italy in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1992/03/19/sono-tornate-casa-le-italiane-albania.html|title=SONO TORNATE A CASA LE ITALIANE D' ALBANIA|work=Archivio - la Repubblica.it|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actually are represented by the association "ANCIFRA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancifra.wordpress.com/chi-sono/|title=Chi siamo?|work=A N C I F R A|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the economic crisis of the late 2000s in Italy, it is estimated that nearly 20,000 Italians (and Albanians with Italian passport) have moved to Albania in order to open up businesses, attend university, or retire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-27733135&lt;/ref&gt; However their number seems to be a lot smaller, because the officially registered Italian citizen in Albania are less than two thousands in the 2010s. Most of them are living in the capital, in Durazzo and in Valona.

==The Italian ruled enclaves in Middle Ages Albania==

During the Middle Ages and early [[Renaissance]] the Italians ruled on the coast of Albania 3 areas: Buthrotum in the south in front of [[Corfu]], Durres in the center-north and the border area of the [[Venetian Albania]] near actual [[Montenegro]]. Hundreds of Italians moved to these enclaves in order to administer and rule militarily (and also to populate).

===Buthrotum (Butrinto in Italian)===

It remained an outpost of the Byzantine empire fending off assaults from the [[Normans]] until 1204 when following the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] fragmented, Buthrotum falling to the breakaway [[Despotate of Epirus]]. 
[[File:Butrint (Buthrotum, Butrinto). Venetian enclave facing Corfu..jpg|thumb|200px|Butrinto, a Venetian enclave in southern Albania]] 
In the following centuries, the area was a site of conflict between the Byzantines, the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] of southern Italy, and the [[Venice|Venetians]], and the city changed hands many times. In 1267, [[Charles of Anjou]] took control of both Buthrotum and Corfu, leading to further restorations of the walls and the Great Basilica.
The dogal [[Republic of Venice]] purchased the area including Corfu from the Angevins in 1386&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romeartlover.it/Butrinto.html Venetian Butrinto]&lt;/ref&gt;; however, the Venetian merchants were principally interested in Corfu and Buthrotum once again declined.

By 1572 the wars between Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] had left Buthrotum ruinous and at the order of Domenico Foscarini, the Venetian commander of Corfu, the administration of Buthrotum and its environs was shifted to a small triangular fortress associated with the extensive fish weirs. The area was lightly settled afterwards, occasionally being seized by the Ottoman Turks, in 1655 and 1718, before being recaptured by the Venetians. Its fisheries were a vital contributor to the supply of Corfu, and olive growing together with cattle and timber were the principal economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;During his short career as an ensign in a Venetian regiment, 20-year-old [[Casanova]] spent 3&amp;nbsp;days on Butrinto guarding galley slaves cutting and loading timber on 4 galleys. He mentions the objective of this once-a-year routine was mainly to 'show the flag' and safeguard Venice's rights to that nearly deserted outpost. Giacomo Casanova, ''Histoire de ma vie'', Librairie Plon, Paris, vol II, chap V, p. 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] of 1797 split between France and Austria the territory of the Republic of Venice, which France had just occupied and abolished, and under article 5 of the treaty, Butrinto and the other former Venetian enclaves in Albania came under French sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_campoformio1.html|title=Treaty of Campo Formio 1797|publisher=|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dyrrachium (Durres in English, Durazzo in Italian)===
[[File:Albania - Rosaccio Giuseppe - 1598.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Map of the coast in northern Durrës (Durazzo) from Giuseppe Rosaccio in 1598]]

Dyrrachium was conquered from the Byzantines  in February 1082 when [[Alexios I Komnenos]] was defeated by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund]] in the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]. Byzantine control was restored a few years later, but the Normans under Bohemund returned to besiege it in 1107–08, and sacked it again in 1185 under King [[William II of Sicily]].{{sfn|ODB|loc="Dyrrachion" (T. E. Gregory), p. 668}} In 1205, after the [[Fourth Crusade]], the city was transferred to the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]], which formed the "Duchy of Durazzo". This Duchy was conquered in 1213. In 1257, Durrës was briefly occupied by the King of Sicily, [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred of Hohenstaufen]]. It was re-occupied by the Despot of Epirus [[Michael II Komnenos Doukas]] until 1259, when the Despotate was defeated by the Byzantine [[Empire of Nicaea]] in the [[Battle of Pelagonia]]. In the 1270s, Durrës was again controlled by Epirus under [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]], the son of Michael II, who in 1278 was forced to yield the city to Charles d' Anjou ([[Charles I of Sicily]]). 
In the early 14th century, the city was ruled by a coalition of Anjous, Hungarians, and Albanians of the Thopia family. In 1317 or 1318, the area was taken by the Serbs and remained under their rule until 1342. At that time the Popes, supported by the Anjous, increased their diplomatic and political activity in the area, by using the Latin bishops, including the archbishop of Durrës. The city had been a religious center of Catholicism after the Anjou were installed in Durrës. In 1272, a Catholic archbishop was installed, and until the mid-14th century there were both Catholic and Orthodox archbishops of Durrës.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf Etleva Lala (2008) Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Irish pilgrims who visited Albania on their way to Jerusalem in 1322, reported that Durrës was "inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians".&lt;ref&gt;''Itinerarium Symonis Simeonis et Hugonis Illuminatoris ad Terram Sanctam'', edited by J. Nasmith, 1778, cited in:

:"''Inhabitatur enim Latinis, Grecis,  Judeis perfidis, et  barbaris Albanensibus''" (Translation in R. Elsie: ''For it is inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians'').&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1392 the Venetians took control of the city, that they called "Durazzo" and maintained the rule until 1508 when Durazzo fell to the Turks. Some venetian families moved to live -and administer- in Durazzo during those years.

===Venetian Albania (Shkodra, in Italian Scutari)===

The Venetian territories around [[Kotor|Cattaro]] in actual [[Montenegro]]  lasted from 1420 to 1797 and were called [[Venetian Albania]], a province of the Venetian Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will. ''The Renaissance''. pag. 121&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Venetian seside properties in Montenegro 1448.svg|thumb|right|250px|Albania veneta in 1448, when reached the northern Albania coast]]

In the early years of the [[Renaissance]] the territories under Venetian control included areas from actual coastal Montenegro to northern Albania until Durrës. In northern Albania, the [[siege of Shkodra]] in 1478–1479 culminated in the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1479)|Treaty of Constantinople]]: this city (called Scutari in Italian) was ruled by the [[Republic of Venice]] since 1396. 

During the Venetian rule the city adopted the [[Statutes of Scutari]], a civic law written in [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. Venetians built the ''St. Stephen's Church'' (later converted into the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Mosque]] by the Turks) and the [[Rozafa Castle]]. In 1479 the city -defended stubbornly by many venetian soldiers- fell to the Ottomans and the defenders of the citadel moved to Italy and [[Venetian Dalmatia]], while many Albanians from the region retreated into the mountains.
 
Venetians retained Durrës – that they called "Durazzo" – and surrounding areas after a huge siege by the Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1466, but it fell to Ottoman forces in 1508. Also in this case, the Christian population moved away and many venetian families -who were living in Durazzo- moved to Venetian Dalmatia.

'''''Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil'''''—commonly referred to as '''''Leviathan'''''—is a book written by [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) and published in 1651 (revised [[Latin]] edition 1668).&lt;ref name="Newey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aVAMccAgim8C&amp;dq= ''Luise Gottsched the Translator''], Camden House, 2012, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It's in this edition that Hobbes coined the expression ''auctoritas non veritas facit legem'', which means "authority, not truth, makes law": book 2, chapter 26, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IY8o8On4gJ4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA133&amp;dq=%22Authoritas+non+Veritas+facit+Le+m%22 133].&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from the [[bible|biblical]] [[Leviathan]]. The work concerns the structure of society and legitimate government, and is regarded as one of the earliest and most influential examples of [[Social contract|social contract theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Hobbes's Moral and Political Philosophy |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/}} (Retrieved 11 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leviathan'' ranks as a classic Western work on [[Power in international relations|statecraft]] comparable to [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]''. Written during the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651), ''Leviathan'' argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]. Hobbes wrote that civil war and the brute situation of a [[state of nature]] ("[[bellum omnium contra omnes|the war of all against all]]") could only be avoided by strong, undivided government.

==Content==

===Frontispiece===
After lengthy discussion with Thomas Hobbes, the Parisian [[Abraham Bosse]] created the [[etching]] for the book's famous [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] in the ''géometrique'' style which Bosse himself had refined. It is similar in organisation to the frontispiece of Hobbes' ''[[De Cive]]'' (1642), created by Jean Matheus. The frontispiece has two main elements, of which the upper part is by far the more striking.

In it, a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape, clutching a sword and a [[crosier]], beneath a quote from the [[Book of Job]]—"''Non est potestas Super Terram quae Comparetur ei. Iob. 41 . 24''" ("There is no power on earth to be compared to him. Job 41 . 24")—linking the figure to the monster of that book. (Due to disagreements over the precise location of the [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|chapters and verses]] when they were divided in the [[Late Middle Ages]], the verse Hobbes quotes is usually given as Job 41:33 in modern Christian translations into English, Job 41:25 in the [[Masoretic text]], [[Septuagint]], and the [[Luther Bible]]; it is Iob 41:24 in the [[Vulgate]].) The torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons, in the style of [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]]; all are facing inwards with just the giant's head having visible features. (A manuscript of ''Leviathan'' created for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1651 has notable differences – a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces, all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions.)

The lower portion is a [[triptych]], framed in a wooden border. The centre form contains the title on an ornate curtain. The two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right. Each side element reflects the equivalent power – [[castle]] to church, [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] to [[mitre]], [[cannon]] to [[excommunication]], [[weapon]]s to [[logic]], and the [[battle]]field to the [[ecclesiastical court|religious court]]s. The giant holds the symbols of both sides, reflecting the union of secular, and spiritual in the sovereign, but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state.

===Part I: Of Man===
Hobbes begins his treatise on politics with an account of human nature. He presents an image of man as matter in motion, attempting to show through example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically, that is, without recourse to an incorporeal, immaterial soul or a faculty for understanding ideas that are external to the [[human mind]].
Hobbes proceeds by defining terms clearly and unsentimentally. Good and evil are nothing more than terms used to denote an individual's appetites and desires, while these appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or away from an object. Hope is nothing more than an appetite for a thing combined with opinion that it can be had. He suggests the dominant political theology of the time, [[Scholasticism]], thrives on confused definitions of everyday words, such as ''incorporeal substance'', which for Hobbes is a contradiction in terms.

Hobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the ''[[summum bonum]]'', or greatest good, as previous thought had done. Not only is the concept of a ''summum bonum'' superfluous, but given the variability of human desires, there could be no such thing. Consequently, any political community that sought to provide the greatest good to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them. The result would be [[civil war]].

However, Hobbes states that there is a ''summum malum'', or greatest evil. This is the fear of violent death. A political community can be oriented around this fear.

Since there is no ''summum bonum'', the natural state of man is not to be found in a political community that pursues the greatest good. But to be outside of a political community is to be in an anarchic condition. Given human nature, the variability of human desires, and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires, the [[state of nature]], as Hobbes calls this anarchic condition, must be a [[bellum omnium contra omnes|war of all against all]]. Even when two men are not fighting, there is no guarantee that the other will not try to kill him for his property or just out of an aggrieved sense of honour, and so they must constantly be on guard against one another. It is even reasonable to preemptively attack one's neighbour.

{{quote|In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation nor the use of &lt;!--"nor use of the"? - thus in Penguin edn--&gt;commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIII.9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The desire to avoid the state of nature, as the place where the ''summum malum'' of violent death is most likely to occur, forms the polestar of political reasoning. It suggests a number of [[natural law|laws of nature]], although Hobbes is quick to point out that they cannot properly speaking be called "laws," since there is no one to enforce them. The first thing that reason suggests is to seek peace, but that where peace cannot be had, to use all of the advantages of war.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIV.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust, and every man must be considered to have a right to all things.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', XIII.13.&lt;/ref&gt; The second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one's right to all things where others are willing to do the same, to quit the state of nature, and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things. Hobbes concludes Part One by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign.

===Part II: Of Common-wealth===
The purpose of a [[commonwealth]] is given at the start of Part II: {{quote|THE final cause, end, or design of men (who naturally love liberty, and dominion over others) in the introduction of that restraint upon themselves, in which we see them live in Commonwealths, is the foresight of their own preservation, and of a more contented life thereby; that is to say, of getting themselves out from that miserable condition of war which is necessarily consequent, as hath been shown, to the natural passions of men when there is no visible power to keep them in awe, and tie them by fear of punishment to the performance of their covenants...}}

The commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: ''I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.''

The sovereign has twelve principal rights&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Leviathan, XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) [[Right of revolution|change the form of government]].
# Because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from [[Social contract|subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them]], the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.
# The sovereign exists because the majority has consented to his rule; the minority have agreed to abide by this arrangement and must then assent to the sovereign's actions.
# Every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his [[British subject|subjects]] and cannot be accused of [[injustice]].
# Following this, the sovereign cannot justly be [[Regicide|put to death]] by the subjects.
# Because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord. Therefore, the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse, who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes, and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.
# To prescribe the rules of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[property]].
# To be judge in all cases.
# To make [[war powers|war and peace]] as he sees fit and to command the army.
# To choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.
# To reward with riches and [[honour]] or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or [[wikt:ignominy|ignominy]].
# To establish laws about honour and a scale of worth.

Hobbes explicitly rejects the idea of ''[[Separation of Powers]]''. In item 6 Hobbes is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of [[free speech]] should they be considered desirable by the sovereign to promote order.

====Types of commonwealth====
There are three ([[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and [[democracy]]):

{{quote|The difference of Commonwealths consisted in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude. And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth. For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part. When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy.}}

And only three; since unlike [[Politics_(Aristotle)#Classification_of_constitutions|Aristotle]] he does not sub-divide them into "good" and "deviant":

{{quote|Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire. There be other names of government in the histories and books of policy; as [[tyrant|tyranny]] and [[oligarchy]]; but they are not the names of other forms of government, but of the same forms misliked. For they that are discontented under monarchy call it tyranny; and they that are displeased with aristocracy call it oligarchy: so also, they which find themselves grieved under a democracy call it anarchy, which signifies want of government; and yet I think no man believes that want of government is any new kind of government: nor by the same reason ought they to believe that the government is of one kind when they like it, and another when they mislike it or are oppressed by the governors.}}

And monarchy is the best, on practical grounds:

{{quote|The difference between these three kinds of Commonwealth consisteth not in the difference of power, but in the difference of convenience or aptitude to produce the peace and security of the people; for which end they were instituted. And to compare monarchy with the other two, we may observe: first, that whosoever beareth the person of the people, or is one of that assembly that bears it, beareth also his own natural person. And though he be careful in his politic person to procure the common interest, yet he is more, or no less, careful to procure the private good of himself, his family, kindred and friends; and for the most part, if the public interest chance to cross the private, he prefers the private: for the passions of men are commonly more potent than their reason. From whence it follows that where the public and private interest are most closely united, there is the public most advanced. Now in monarchy the private interest is the same with the public. The riches, power, and honour of a monarch arise only from the riches, strength, and reputation of his subjects. For no king can be rich, nor glorious, nor secure, whose subjects are either poor, or contemptible, or too weak through want, or dissension, to maintain a war against their enemies; whereas in a democracy, or aristocracy, the public prosperity confers not so much to the private fortune of one that is corrupt, or ambitious, as doth many times a perfidious advice, a treacherous action, or a civil war.}}

====Succession====
The right of succession always lies with the sovereign. Democracies and aristocracies have easy succession; monarchy is harder:

{{quote|The greatest difficulty about the right of succession is in monarchy: and the difficulty ariseth from this, that at first sight, it is not manifest who is to appoint the successor; nor many times who it is whom he hath appointed. For in both these cases, there is required a more exact ratiocination than every man is accustomed to use.}}

Because in general people haven't thought carefully. However, the succession is definitely in the gift of the monarch:

{{quote|As to the question who shall appoint the successor of a monarch that hath the sovereign authority... we are to consider that either he that is in possession has right to dispose of the succession, or else that right is again in the dissolved multitude. ... Therefore it is manifest that by the institution of monarchy, the disposing of the successor is always left to the judgement and will of the present possessor.}}

But, it is not always obvious who the monarch has appointed:

{{quote|And for the question which may arise sometimes, who it is that the monarch in possession hath designed to the succession and inheritance of his power}}

However, the answer is:

{{quote|it is determined by his express words and testament; or by other tacit signs sufficient.}}

And this means:

{{quote|By express words, or testament, when it is declared by him in his lifetime, viva voce, or by writing; as the first emperors of Rome declared who should be their heirs.}}

Note that (perhaps rather radically) this does '''not''' have to be any blood relative:

{{quote|For the word heir does not of itself imply the children or nearest kindred of a man; but whomsoever a man shall any way declare he would have to succeed him in his estate. If therefore a monarch declare expressly that such a man shall be his heir, either by word or writing, then is that man immediately after the decease of his predecessor invested in the right of being monarch.}}

However, practically this means:

{{quote|But where testament and express words are wanting, other natural signs of the will are to be followed: whereof the one is custom. And therefore where the custom is that the next of kindred absolutely succeedeth, there also the next of kindred hath right to the succession; for that, if the will of him that was in possession had been otherwise, he might easily have declared the same in his lifetime...}}

====Religion====
In ''Leviathan'', Hobbes explicitly states that the sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine, and that if he does not do so, he invites discord. Hobbes presents his own religious theory, but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign (when that was re-established: again, ''Leviathan'' was written during the Civil War) as to whether his theory was acceptable. 

====Taxation====
Thomas Hobbes also touched upon the sovereign's ability to tax in ''Leviathan'', although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Aaron Levy |date = October 1954|title=Economic Views of Thomas Hobbes |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=589–595 |doi=10.2307/2707677 |jstor=2707677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes believed that equal justice includes the equal imposition of taxes. The equality of taxes doesn’t depend on equality of wealth, but on the equality of the debt that every man owes to the commonwealth for his defence and the maintenance of the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/pdf/hobbes2.pdf |title=Leviathan: Part II. Commonwealth; Chapters 17–31 |format=PDF |publisher=Early Modern Texts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes also championed public support for those unable to maintain themselves by labour, which would presumably be funded by taxation. He advocated public encouragement of works of Navigation etc. to usefully employ the poor who could work.

===Part III: Of a Christian Common-wealth===
In Part III Hobbes seeks to investigate the nature of a ''Christian'' commonwealth. This immediately raises the question of which [[scripture]]s we should trust, and why. If any person may claim [[supernatural]] [[revelation]] superior to the civil law, then there would be chaos, and Hobbes' fervent desire is to avoid this. Hobbes thus begins by establishing that we cannot infallibly know another's personal word to be [[divinity|divine]] revelation:

{{quote|When God speaketh to man, it must be either immediately or by mediation of another man, to whom He had formerly spoken by Himself immediately. How God speaketh to a man immediately may be understood by those well enough to whom He hath so spoken; but how the same should be understood by another is hard, if not impossible, to know. For if a man pretend to me that God hath spoken to him supernaturally, and immediately, and I make doubt of it, I cannot easily perceive what argument he can produce to oblige me to believe it.}}

This is good, but if applied too fervently would lead to all the Bible being rejected. So, Hobbes says, we need a test: and the true test is established by examining the books of scripture, and is:

{{quote|So that it is manifest that the teaching of the religion which God hath established, and the showing of a present miracle, joined together, were the only marks whereby the Scripture would have a true prophet, that is to say, immediate revelation, to be acknowledged; of them being singly sufficient to oblige any other man to regard what he saith.}}

{{quote|Seeing therefore miracles now cease, we have no sign left whereby to acknowledge the pretended revelations or inspirations of any private man; nor obligation to give ear to any doctrine, farther than it is conformable to the Holy Scriptures, which since the time of our Saviour supply the place and sufficiently recompense the want of all other prophecy}}

"Seeing therefore miracles now cease" means that only the books of the Bible can be trusted. Hobbes then discusses the various books which are accepted by various [[sect]]s, and the "question much disputed between the diverse sects of Christian religion, from whence the Scriptures derive their authority". To Hobbes, "it is manifest that none can know they are God's word (though all true Christians believe it) but those to whom God Himself hath revealed it supernaturally". And therefore "The question truly stated is: by what authority they are made law?"

Unsurprisingly, Hobbes concludes that ultimately there is no way to determine this other than the civil power:

{{quote|He therefore to whom God hath not supernaturally revealed that they are His, nor that those that published them were sent by Him, is not obliged to obey them by any authority but his whose commands have already the force of laws; that is to say, by any other authority than that of the Commonwealth, residing in the sovereign, who only has the legislative power.}}

He discusses the [[Ten Commandments]], and asks "who it was that gave to these written tables the obligatory force of laws. There is no doubt but they were made laws by God Himself: but because a law obliges not, nor is law to any but to them that acknowledge it to be the act of the sovereign, how could the people of [[Israel]], that were forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what God said to [[Moses]], be obliged to obedience to all those laws which Moses propounded to them?" and concludes, as before, that "making of the Scripture law, belonged to the civil sovereign."

Finally: "We are to consider now what office in the Church those persons have who, being civil sovereigns, have embraced also the Christian faith?" to which the answer is: "Christian kings are still the supreme pastors of their people, and have power to ordain what pastors they please, to teach the Church, that is, to teach the people committed to their charge."

There is an enormous amount of biblical scholarship in this third part. However, once Hobbes' initial argument is accepted (that no-one can know for sure anyone else's divine revelation) his conclusion (the religious power is subordinate to the civil) follows from his logic. The very extensive discussions of the chapter were probably necessary for its time. The need (as Hobbes saw it) for the civil sovereign to be supreme arose partly from the many sects that arose around the civil war, and to quash the ''Pope of Rome's challenge'', to which Hobbes devotes an extensive section.

===Part IV: Of the Kingdom of Darkness===
Hobbes named Part IV of his book Kingdom of Darkness. By this, Hobbes does not mean [[Hell]] (he did not believe in Hell or [[Purgatory]])&lt;ref&gt;Chapter XLVI: ''Lastly, for the errors brought in from false or uncertain history, what is all the legend of fictitious miracles in the lives of the saints; and all the histories of apparitions and ghosts alleged by the doctors of the Roman Church, to make good their doctrines of hell and purgatory, the power of [[exorcism]], and other doctrines which have no warrant, neither in reason nor Scripture; as also all those traditions which they call the unwritten word of God; but old wives' fables?'',&lt;/ref&gt; but the darkness of [[ignorance]] as opposed to the light of true knowledge. Hobbes' interpretation is largely unorthodox and so sees much darkness in what he sees as the misinterpretation of [[Scripture]].

: This considered, the kingdom of darkness... is nothing else but a confederacy of deceivers that, to obtain dominion over men in this present world, endeavour, by dark and erroneous [[doctrine]]s, to extinguish in them the light...&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-j.html |title=Chapter XLIV |access-date=27 September 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803200902/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-j.html#CHAPTERXLIV |archive-date=3 August 2004 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes enumerates four causes of this darkness.

The first is by extinguishing the light of scripture through misinterpretation. Hobbes sees the main abuse as teaching that the [[kingdom of God]] can be found in the church, thus undermining the authority of the civil sovereign. Another general abuse of scripture, in his view, is the turning of [[consecration]] into [[conjuration]], or silly [[ritual]].

The second cause is the [[demonology]] of the heathen poets: in Hobbes's opinion, [[demon]]s are nothing more than constructs of the brain. Hobbes then goes on to criticize what he sees as many of the practices of Catholicism: "Now for the worship of [[saint]]s, and [[icon|image]]s, and [[relic]]s, and other things at this day practiced in the Church of Rome, I say they are not allowed by the word of God".

The third is by mixing with the Scripture diverse relics of the religion, and much of the vain and erroneous [[Greek philosophy|philosophy of the Greeks]], especially of [[Aristotle]]. Hobbes has little time for the various disputing sects of philosophers and objects to what people have taken "From Aristotle's civil philosophy, they have learned to call all manner of Commonwealths but the popular (such as was at that time the state of Athens), [[tyranny]]". At the end of this comes an interesting section (darkness is suppressing true knowledge as well as introducing falsehoods), which would appear to bear on the discoveries of [[Galileo Galilei]]. "Our own navigations make manifest, and all men learned in human sciences now acknowledge, there are [[antipodes]]" (i.e., the Earth is round) "...Nevertheless, men... have been punished for it by authority ecclesiastical. But what reason is there for it? Is it because such opinions are contrary to true religion? That cannot be, if they be true." However, Hobbes is quite happy for the truth to be suppressed if necessary: if "they tend to disorder in government, as countenancing rebellion or sedition? Then let them be silenced, and the teachers punished" – but only by the civil authority.

The fourth is by mingling with both these, false or uncertain traditions, and feigned or uncertain history.

Hobbes finishes by inquiring who benefits from the errors he diagnoses:

: [[Cicero]] maketh honourable mention of one of the Cassii, a severe judge amongst the Romans, for a custom he had in criminal causes, when the testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient, to ask the accusers, ''cui bono;'' that is to say, what profit, honour, or other contentment the accused obtained or expected by the fact. For amongst presumptions, there is none that so evidently declareth the author as doth the benefit of the action.

Hobbes concludes that the beneficiaries are the churches and churchmen.

A '''love hotel''' is a type of short-stay hotel found around the world operated primarily for the purpose of allowing guests privacy for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. The name originates from "Hotel Love" in [[Osaka]], which was built in 1968 and had a rotating sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stripes.com/military-life/my-months-in-a-love-hotel-1.63008 |title=My months in a love hotel |first=Erik |last=Slavin |date=25 March 2007 |work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinguishing characteristics==
[[File:Love hotel kabukicho Tokyo 1.jpg|left|thumb|Love hotel with no windows]]
Love hotels can usually be identified using symbols such as hearts and the offer of a room rate for a {{nihongo|"rest"|休憩|kyūkei}} as well as for an overnight stay.&lt;ref name="basil"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Japanese love hotels: A photo essay | journal=Consumption, Markets, and Culture |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 203–221 |last=Basil |first= Michael |date=June 2007 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/gcmc/2007/00000010/00000002/art00011 |doi= 10.1080/10253860701256315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of a "rest" varies, typically ranging from one to three hours. Cheaper daytime off-peak rates are common. In general, reservations are not possible, and leaving the hotel will forfeit access to the room; overnight-stay rates become available only after 22:00. These hotels may be used for [[prostitution]], although they are sometimes used by budget-travelers sharing accommodation.

[[File:Love hotel kabukicho Tokyo 2.jpg|left|thumb|Some love hotels have multiple complex entrances designed for the discretion of customers]]
[[File:Love Hotel - Tokyo.jpg|thumb|Discreet room selection]]
Entrances are discreet, and interaction with staff is minimized. Rooms are often selected from a panel of buttons, and the bill may be settled by [[pneumatic tube]], [[Automated teller machine|automatic cash machine]], or paying an unseen staff member behind a pane of frosted glass. [[Parking lots]] will often be concealed and windows will be few, so as to maximize privacy.&lt;ref name=nippon&gt;{{cite news|last=Ikkyon|first=Kim|title=Japan’s Affection for Love Hotels|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/views/b02701/|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=Nippon.com|publisher=Nippon Communications Foundation|date=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although cheaper hotels are often simply furnished, higher-end hotels may feature fanciful rooms decorated with [[anime]] characters, be equipped with rotating beds, ceiling mirrors, [[karaoke]] machines,&lt;ref name="nzherald"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wakao |first=Aiko |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/3/story.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10444540 |title=Developing a passion for love hotels |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=9 June 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unusual lighting. They may be styled similarly to [[dungeon]]s or other fantasy scenes, sometimes including [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Haggart |first=Blayne |url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/life/a-night-in-a-japanese-love-hotel/article25423912/ |title=A night in a Japanese love hotel |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |location=Toronto |date=16 October 2002 |accessdate=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These hotels are typically either concentrated in city districts close to stations, near highways on the city outskirts, or in industrial districts. Love hotel architecture is sometimes garish, with buildings shaped like castles, boats or UFOs and lit with neon lighting.&lt;ref name="basil" /&gt; However, some more recent love hotels are very ordinary looking buildings, distinguished mainly by having small, covered, or even no windows.&lt;ref name="chaplin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japanese Love Hotels: A Cultural History |last=Chaplin |first=Sarah |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-41585-3 &lt;!-- or 0-415-48754-4 --&gt; |page= 149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==

===Japan===
The history of {{nihongo|love hotels|ラブホテル|rabu hoteru}} can be traced back to the early [[Edo period]], when establishments appearing to be inns or teahouses with particular procedures for a discreet entry or even with secret tunnels for a discreet exit were built in [[Edo]] and in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Ihara |first= Saikaku | title= The Life of an Amorous Man |others=Translated by Kengi Hamada |year= 1964 |publisher= Charles E. Tuttle Company |place= Rutland, Vermont |isbn= 978-0-8048-1069-2 |pages =113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern love hotels developed from tea rooms ({{nihongo|''chaya''|茶屋}}) used mostly by [[prostitutes]] and their clients but also by lovers. After [[World War II]], the term {{nihongo|''tsurekomi yado''|連れ込み宿|lit. "bring-along inn"}} was adopted, originally for simple lodgings run by families with a few rooms to spare. These establishments appeared first around [[Ueno, Tokyo|Ueno]], [[Tokyo]] in part due to demand from Occupation forces, and boomed after 1958 when legal [[Prostitution in Japan#Postwar era|prostitution was abolished]] and the trade moved underground.

The introduction of the automobile in the 1960s brought with it the "[[motel]]" and further spread the concept. Japanese housing trends at the time were characterized by small homes with sleeping areas being used as common areas during the day and, as a result, little opportunity for parents to privately engage in intercourse. Married couples therefore began to frequent love hotels. By 1961, there were around 2,700 ''tsurekomi'' inns in central [[Tokyo]] alone. Hotels of the time featured unusual attractions such as [[Swing (seat)|swings]] and vibrating beds. The Meguro Emperor, the first [[castle]]-style love hotel, opened in 1973 and brought in an average of approximately [[JPY|¥]]40 million monthly.&lt;ref name=nippon /&gt;

In 1984, the [[Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Law]] placed love hotels under the jurisdiction of the police. For that reason, new hotels were built to avoid being classified as "love hotels"; the garish, over-the-top, bizarre designs and features of the past were significantly downplayed. Beginning in the 1980s, love hotels were also increasingly marketed toward women. A 2013 study showed that couples' selections of rooms at love hotels were made by women roughly 90% of the time. The Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Law was amended in 2010, imposing even stricter limitations and blurring the line between regular hotels and love hotels.&lt;ref name=nippon2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ikkyon|first1=Kim|title=Love Hotels Clean Up Their Image|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/views/b02702/|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=Nippon.com|publisher=Nippon Communications Foundation|date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping in mind legislation and a desire to seem more fashionable than competitors, an ever-changing palette of terms is used by hotel operators. Alternative names include "romance hotel", "fashion hotel", "leisure hotel", "amusement hotel", "couples hotel", and "boutique hotel".&lt;ref name="chaplin" /&gt;

Love hotels have enough cultural significance to be added to the first edition of [[emoji]]s in [[unicode|unicode 6.0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/~scherer/emoji4unicode/snapshot/utc#e-4B8|title=Background data for Unicode proposal|publisher=Unicode COnsortium|date=2010-04-27|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-3-archive.html#Japanese_Carrier|title=Unicode Technical Report#51: Unicode emoji Version 1.0|publisher=Unicode COnsortium|date=2015-06-09|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
Love hotels ({{lang-ko|러브호텔}}), also known as love motels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,266708,00.html |title=World Cup: Why Some Teams Just Can't Win|date=28 June 2002 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author=Enrique Zaldua|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared in [[South Korea]] in the mid-1980s. They were originally called "Parktel" ({{lang-ko|박텔}}). Their boom and growth was originally attributed to the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] which took place in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name="may2005"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Choi Min-woo |author2=Nam Koong-wook  |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/200505/17/200505172212067939900091009101.html |title=Love hotels not just for secret liaisons anymore |work=[[JoongAng Daily]] |date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=24 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050519030635/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/200505/17/200505172212067939900091009101.html |archivedate=19 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotels have historically been seen as seedy, with some residents speaking out against them and not wanting them within certain distances of schools and residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1907462 |title='Love hotel' label roils residents |author=Choi Joon-ho |date=19 August 2002 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |work=[[JoongAng Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=1880642 |title=Anti-Love Hotel Campaign Spreads All Over the Country |date=5 October 2000 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |work=[[JoongAng Daily]] |author=Jeon Ik-jin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some hotel owners have tried to remove that element from their business by upgrading, offering cleaner modern services, and removing some of the more sexual elements from their decor.&lt;ref name="may2005" /&gt; They are considered a taboo topic in South Korea and a photo exhibit of love motels taken by a foreigner created a controversy in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/opinion/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090520000053 |title=What are we trying to hide in this era?|author=Kim Seong-kon |authorlink=Kim Seong-kon |date=30 March 2010|accessdate=27 June 2011|work=[[The Korea Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
[[Thailand]] has had love motels since 1935 and there are approximately 100 establishments in [[Bangkok]] most densely located around [[Ratchadaphisek Road]]. The government no longer issues building permits for these types of motels, but some businesses work around the laws. In addition to short-stay, the motels are also used by foreign travellers on a budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/investigation/176572/the-seedy-side-of-bangkok-love-motels |title=The seedy side of Bangkok's love motels |first=Maxmilian |last=Wechsler |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |work=[[Bangkok Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Similar establishments also exist in some other Asian countries including [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/aroundtown/feature/the-insider-love-hotels |title=The Insider: Love hotels |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out Singapore]] |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2007/08/26/culture/its-ladies-first-now-in-japanese-love-hotels/ |title=It's ladies first now in Japanese love hotels |first=Donald |last=Richie |authorlink=Donald Richie |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=26 August 2007 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}  Review of ''Japanese Love Hotels: A Cultural History''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthew Alexander|last2=Chien Chuan Chen|last3=Andrew MacLaren|last4=Kevin D.

The same concept also exists in Central and South America. In [[Guatemala]], they are called "autohotels";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/print-narrative.cfm?destID=3558&amp;catID=3558027613 |chapter=Guatemala: Tips on Accommodations |title=Frommer's Guatemala |edition=1st |first=Eliot |last=Greenspan |publisher=[[Frommer's]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-04730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Chile]] "motel" or "hotel pajero" (couples' hotel); in the [[Dominican Republic]], "cabañas", "moteles" or "estaderos"; in [[Panama]] they are called "push buttons" or "push" for short;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapeartist.com/blog/push-the-love-motels-of-panama/|title=PUSH – The Love Motels of Panama - EscapeArtist|date=20 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], "albergue transitorio" or more informally, "telo". In [[Mexico]], Brazil, [[Colombia]] and Puerto Rico, they are simply called "motels" (the word is exclusively used for love hotels). In Brazil motels (approximately 5000) are part of the urban landscape. Very popular, they are associated with erotic transgression, but also with romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Motel Brasil.

In [[Nigeria]], love hotels are called "short-time". They are often dingy accommodations in densely populated areas. Some other hotels offer "short-time" services unofficially.

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], certain motels in low-income areas often serve similar functions as a Japanese love hotel.  Colloquially known as "no-tell motels" or "hot-sheets joints", these are becoming scarce as local laws increasingly require renters' identification information to be recorded and given to law enforcement agencies. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] recently struck down warrantless searches of hotel records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/document/eff-amicus-los-angeles-v-patel|title=EFF Amicus - Los Angeles v.

In Oceania, [[New Zealand]] opened its first love hotel in May 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/nz-s-first-love-motel-set-open-doors-4166455 |title=NZ's first love motel set to open doors |publisher=[[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] |date=11 May 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514170019/http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/nz-s-first-love-motel-set-open-doors-4166455 |archive-date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]] opened its first love hotel in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/love-shack-where-minibreaks-last-just-an-hour-20110812-1iqwj.html |title=Love shack where mini-breaks last just an hour |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]] |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic aspects ==
The annual revenue of the love hotel industry in Japan is estimated at more than $40 billion,&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/07/02/japan.love.hotels/index.html |first=Morgan |last=Neill |title=Love hotel business zooms despite downturn |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure double that of Japan's anime market.

It is estimated that more than 500 million visits to Japan's 37,000&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; love hotels take place each year, which is the equivalent of around 1.4 million couples,&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; or 2% of Japan's population, visiting a love hotel each day.&lt;ref name="chaplin"/&gt; In recent years, the love hotel business has drawn the interest of the [[structured finance]] industry.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite journal |first= Tim |last= Kelly |journal=[[Forbes]] |url=http://members.forbes.com/forbes/2006/0605/106.html |title=Love for Sale |date=6 May 2006 |accessdate=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several transactions have been completed where the [[cash flow]]s from a number of such hotels have been [[securitization|securitised]] and sold to international investors and buy-out funds.&lt;ref name="nzherald" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

"'''Man vs technology'''" is a [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in [[literature]] that places a [[fictional character|character]] against [[technology]].

''[[Frankenstein]]'' is often considered the classic exposition of this theme, with a scientifically created human becoming a destructive monster.

It is also a common theme in [[science fiction]], with ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]'' being popular examples. Another example would be in "[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]" when Frank and Dave battle their flight computer, the [[HAL 9000]].

Often, it is external as well as internal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} It is mostly external conflict.

[[File:Media_independence_trends.pdf|thumb|421x421px|Media independence trends, UNESCO's World Trends Report 2018]]
'''Media independence''' is the absence of external control and influence on an institution or individual working in the [[Media (communication)|media]]. It is a measure of one's capacity to "make decisions and act according to its own logic,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and distinguishes [[independent media]] from [[state media]].

The concept of media independence has often been contested as a normative principle in media policy and [[journalism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title="What We Talk About When Talk About "Media Independence".", Javnost - The Public. Journal of the European Institute for Communication and Culture.|last=Karppinen|first=Kari|last2=Moe|first2=Hallvard|publisher=Routledge Taylor and Francis Group|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://doi.org/10.1080/13183222.2016.1162986|pages=105–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Couldry (2009) considers that [[digital transformation]]s tend to compromise the press as a common good (with a blurring of the difference between journalism and advertising, for example) by the technological, political and social dynamics that it brings.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} For this reason, authors such as Daniel Hallin,&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, Daniel C. 2006. “The Passing of the ‘High Modernism’ of American Journalism Revisited.” Political Communication Report 16 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kelly McBride]], and [[Tom Rosenstiel]]&lt;ref&gt;McBride, Kelly, and Tom Rosenstiel. 2013. “Introduction: New Guiding Principles for a New Era of Journalism.” In The New Ethics of Journalism. Principles for the 21st Century, edited by KellyMcBride and Tom Rosenstiel, 1–6. London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt; consider other norms (such as [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participation]]) to be more relevant. Karppinen and Moe state that "what we talk about when we talk about media independence, then, are the characteristics of the relations between, on the one side, specific entities ranging from media institutions, via journalistic cultures, to individual speakers, and, on the other, their social environment, including the state, political interest groups, the market or the [[Popular culture|mainstream culture]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Two factors tend to influence media independence. The disruption and crisis in [[business model]]s that have supported print and [[Broadcasting|broadcast media]] for decades have left [[Old media|traditional media]] outlets more vulnerable to external influences as they seek to establish new revenue sources. In many regions, [[Austerity|austerity measures]] have led to large-scale budget cuts of [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]], dislocating employees and limiting innovation in programming.

An indicator of a lack of independence is the level of [[public trust]] in the credibility of [[journalism]]. According to the [[Edelman Trust Barometer]], trust in media seems to be declining, reflecting declines of trust in government, business and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]].&lt;ref&gt;Edelman. 2017. Trust Barometer. Edelman. Available at https://www.edelman.com/trust2017/. Accessed 11 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, [[Digital media|online media]] has become more and more popular, gaining trust throughout the world, but for Mindi Chahal, awareness on the risk of "[[Fake news|fake-news]]", [[filter bubble]]s and [[algorithm]]s has begun to change perceptions of the credibility of online information.&lt;ref&gt;Chahal, Mindi. 2017. The fake news effect and what it means for advertisers. Marketing Week. Available at https://www.marketingweek.com/2017/03/27/the-fake-news-effect/. Accessed 25 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anya Schiffrin]] says that despite the initial optimism that [[social media]] would reduce such tendencies by enabling broader [[Digital citizen|citizen participation in media]], there are growing signals that social media are similarly susceptible to [[Regulatory capture|political capture]] and [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]], further impacting on the trust that users may have towards information on these platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Schriffen, Anya. 2017b. In the Service of Power: Media Capture and the Threat to Democracy. Washington, DC: Center for International Media Assistance. Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/resource/service-power-media-capture-threat-democracy/&lt;/ref&gt;

Media regulators impact on the [[editorial independence]] of the media, which is still deeply entwined with political and economic influences and pressures. Private media - functioning outside of governments' control and with minimum official regulation - are still dependent on advertising support, risking potential misuse of advertisers as a political tool by larger advertisers such as governments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emerging technologies|New technologies]] has added new meaning to what constitutes media independence. The collection, selection, aggregation, synthesis and [[Data processing|processing of data]] are now increasingly delegated to forms of [[automation]]. While the sharing of social media posts is crucial in elevating the importance of certain news sources or stories, what appears in individual news feeds on platforms such as [[Facebook]] or news aggregators such as [[Google News]] is the product of other forces as well. This includes algorithmic calculations, which remove professional editorial judgement, in favor of past consumption patterns by the individual user and his/her social network. In 2016, users declared preferring algorithms over editors for selecting the news they wanted to read.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, David, Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, Nic Newman, and Richard Fletcher. 2016. Reuters Institute Digital News Report. Digital News Report. Oxford: Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. Available at http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/. Accessed 22 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite apparent neutrality algorithms may often compromise editorial integrity, and have been found to lead to discrimination against people based on their race, socio-economic situation and geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;Turow, Joseph. 2013. Branded Content, Media Firms, and Data Mining: An Agenda for Research. Presentation to ICA 2013 Conference, London, UK.

Algorithmic Accountability: Journalistic investigation of computational power structures. Digital Journalism 3 (3): 398–415.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
The role of [[Regulatory agency|regulatory authorities]] (license broadcaster institutions, content providers, platforms) and the resistance to political and commercial interference in the autonomy of the media sector are both considered as significant components of media independence. In order to ensure media independence, [[Regulatory agency|regulatory authorities]] should be placed outside of governments' directives. this can be measured through legislation, agency statutes and rules.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Government regulations ===

==== Licensing ====
The process of issuing licenses in many regions still lacks transparency and is considered to follow procedures that are obscure and concealing. In many countries, regulatory authorities stand accused of political bias in favor of the government and [[ruling party]], whereby some prospective broadcasters have been denied licenses or threatened with the withdrawal of licenses. In many countries, diversity of content and views have diminished as [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fostered directly or indirectly by States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This not only impacts on [[competition]] but leads to a concentration of power with potentially excessive influence on [[public opinion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanretty, Chris. 2014. Media outlets and their moguls: Why concentrated individual or family ownership is bad for editorial independence. European Journal of Communication 29 (3): 335–350.&lt;/ref&gt; Buckley et al. cite failure to renew or retain licenses for editorially critical media; folding the regulator into government ministries or reducing its competences and mandates for action; and lack of due process in the adoption of regulatory decisions, among others, as examples in which these regulators are formally compliant with sets of legal requirements on independence, but their main task in reality is seen to be that of enforcing [[political agenda]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Steve, Kreszentia Duer, Toby Mendel, and Sean O. Siochru. 2008. Broadcasting, Voice, and Accountability : A Public Interest Approach to Policy, Law, and Regulation. Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Government endorsed appointments ====
State control is also evident in the increasing politicization of regulatory bodies operationalized through transfers and appointments of party-aligned individuals  to senior positions in regulatory authorities.

==== Internet regulation ====
Governments worldwide have sought to extend regulation to internet companies, whether [[Internet providers|connectivity providers]] or [[application service provider]]s, and whether domestically or foreign-based. The impact on journalistic content can be severe, as internet companies can err too much on the side of caution and take down news reports, including algorithmically, while offering inadequate opportunities for redress to the affected news producers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Self-regulation ===

==== Regional ====
In [[Western Europe]], [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] provides an alternative to state regulatory authorities. In such contexts, [[newspaper]]s have historically been free of licensing and regulation, and there has been repeated pressure for them to self-regulate or at least to have in-house [[Ombudsman|ombudsmen]]. However, it has often been difficult to establish meaningful self-regulatory entities.

In many cases, self-regulations exists in the shadow of state regulation, and is conscious of the possibility of [[Interventionism (politics)|state intervention]]. In many countries in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], self-regulatory structures seems to be lacking or have not historically been perceived as efficient and effective.&lt;ref&gt;Fengler, Susanne, Tobias Eberwein, Salvador Alsius, Olivier Baisnée, Klaus Bichler, Boguslawa Dobek-Ostrowska, Huub Evers, et al. 2015. How effective is media self-regulation? Results from a comparative survey of European journalists. European Journal of Communication 30 (3): 249–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of satellite delivered channels, delivered directly to viewers, or through cable or online systems, renders much larger the sphere of unregulated programing. There are, however, varying efforts to regulate the access of [[programmer]]s to satellite transponders in parts of the [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]n region, the [[Arab world|Arab region]] and in [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]]. The Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter was an example of efforts to bring formal standards and some regulatory authority to bear on what is transmitted, but it appears to not have been implemented.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;UNESCO. 2014. World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development. Paris: UNESCO Available at https://en.unesco.org/world-media-trends-2017/previous-editions&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International organizations and NGO's ====
Self-regulation is expressed as a preferential system by journalists but also as a support for media freedom and development organizations by intergovernmental organizations such as [[UNESCO]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s. There has been a continued trend of establishing self-regulatory bodies, such as press councils, in conflict and post-conflict situations.

Major internet companies have responded to pressure by governments and the public by elaborating self-regulatory and complaints systems at the individual company level, using principles they have developed under the framework of the [[Global Network Initiative]]. The Global Network Initiative has grown to include several large telecom companies alongside internet companies such as [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and others, as well as [[Civil society|civil society organizations]] and academics.&lt;ref&gt;Global Network Initiative (GNI). 2017. Global Network Initiative Adds Seven Companies in Milestone Expansion of Freedom of Expression and Privacy Initiative. Available at https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/global-network-initiative-adds-seven-companies-in-milestone-expansion-of-freedom-of-expression-and-privacy-initiative/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]]’s 2013 publication, ICT Technology Sector Guide on Implementing the [[United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]], impacts on the presence of independent journalism by defining the limits of what should or should not be carried and prioritized in the most popular digital spaces.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. Shift and Institute for Human Rights and Business, 2013. https://www.ihrb.org/pdf/eu-sector-guidance/EC-Guides/ICT/EC-Guide_ICT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Private sector ====
[[File:RDR_indicator_scores_for_policy_transparency_in_regards_to_third-party_requests_for_content_or_account_restriction.png|thumb|298x298px|Ranking Digital Rights indicator scores for policy transparency in regards to third-party requests for content or account restriction]]
Public pressure on technology giants has motivated the development of new strategies aimed not only at identifying ‘[[fake news]]’, but also at eliminating some of the structural causes of their emergence and proliferation. Facebook has created new buttons for users to report content they believe is false, following previous strategies aimed at countering [[Online hate speech|hate speech and harassment online]]. These changes reflect broader transformations occurring among tech giants to increase their transparency. As indicated by the [[Open Technology Institute|Ranking Digital Rights]] Corporate Accountability Index, most large internet companies have reportedly become relatively more forthcoming in terms of their policies about transparency in regard to third party requests to remove or access content, especially in the case of requests from governments.&lt;ref&gt;Ranking Digital Rights. 2015. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/.

Ranking Digital Rights. 2017. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2017/.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, the study signaled a number of companies that have become more opaque when it comes to disclosing how they enforce their own terms of service, in restricting certain types of content and account.&lt;ref&gt;Ranking Digital Rights. 2017. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2017/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fact-checking and news literacy ====
[[File:Ranking_Digital_Rights_2015.jpg|thumb|217x217px|Ranking Digital Rights indicator scores for policy transparency in regard to their terms of service enforcement (which impact upon content or account restrictions)]]
In addition to responding to pressure for more clearly defined self-regulatory mechanisms, and galvanized by the debates over so-called ‘fake news’, internet companies such as Facebook have launched campaigns to educate users about how to more easily distinguish between ‘fake news’ and real news sources. Ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|United Kingdom national election in 2017]], for example, Facebook published a series of advertisements in newspapers with ‘Tips for Spotting False News’ which suggested 10 things that might signal whether a story is genuine or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/188118808357379|title=Tips to Spot False News {{!}} Facebook Help Center {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been broader initiatives bringing together a variety of donors and actors to promote [[Fact checking|fact-checking]] and [[Information and media literacy|news literacy]], such as the News Integrity Initiative at the [[City University of New York]]’s School of Journalism. This 14 million USD investment by groups including the [[Ford Foundation]] and Facebook was launched in 2017 so its full impact remains to be seen. It will, however, complement the offerings of other networks such as the International Fact-Checking Network launched by the [[Poynter Institute]] in 2015 which seeks to outline the parameters of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poynter.org/international-fact-checking-network-fact-checkers-code-principles|title=International Fact-Checking Network fact-checkers’ code of principles|website=Poynter|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences in media systems ==
The media systems around the world are often put under pressure by the widespread [[delegitimisation]] by political actors of the media as a venerable institution along with the profession of [[journalism]], and the growing efforts made towards media capture, particularly [[Digital media|online media]], which has often been regarded as more resistant to such form of control than other types of media.

=== Delegitimisation of models ===
[[File:Effect_of_deligitimisation_of_media_on_society.png|thumb|379x379px|Effect of deligitimisation of media on society]]

==== Discreditation ====
Powerful actors such as [[government]]s have often been seen to initiate and engage in the process of systematic attacks on the media by trivializing it, or sometimes characterizing it as an ‘enemy’ has widespread implications for the independence and well-being of the sector. This can be particularly apparent during [[election]]s. A common tactic is to blur the distinction between [[Mainstream media|mainstream news media]], and the mass of unverified content on [[social media]]. [[Delegitimisation]] is a subtle and effective form of [[propaganda]], reducing the public’s confidence in the media to perform a collective function as a check on government. This can be seen as being linked [[Polarization (politics)|political]] and [[social polarization]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Attacks on media ====
In some regions, delegitimisation is reportedly combined with wider attacks on independent media:  key properties have been closed down or sold to parties with ties to the government. Newer entrants linked to state power and vast resources gain sway. Opposition to these pressures may strengthen the defense of the press as civil society and mobilize the public in protest, but in some cases, this conflict leads to fear-induced [[apathy]] or withdrawal. Advertisers and investors may be scared-off by delegitimisation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Criminal defamation ====
Efforts to curtail [[Defamation|criminal defamation]] are still ongoing in many regions but the dangers from civil law suits with high costs and high risk are also rising, leading to a greater likelihood of [[bankruptcy]] of media outlets. Independence is weakened where the right of journalists to criticize public officials is threatened. A general assault on the media can lead to measures making [[Safety of journalists|journalists]] more frequently liable for publishing state secrets and their capacity to shield sources can be reduced. Delegitimizing the media makes it easier to justify these legal changes that make the news business even more precarious.

=== Media capture ===
Media capture refers to the full range of forces that can restrict or skew coverage. It has been defined as "a situation where the media have not succeeded in becoming autonomous in manifesting a will of their own, nor able to perform their main function, notably of informing people. Instead, they have persisted in an intermediate state, with vested interests, and not just the government, using them for other purposes."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engaging in Polarized Society: Social Media and Political Discourse in Ethiopia. In Digital Activism in the Social Media Era|last=Gagliardone|first=Iginio|last2=Matti|first2=Pohjonen|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2016|isbn=|location=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40949-8_2|pages=25–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mungiu-Pippidi considers that capture corrupts the main role of the media: to inform the public, with media outlets instead opting to trade influence and manipulate information.&lt;ref&gt;Mungiu-Pippidi, Alina. 2013. Freedom without Impartiality: The Vicious Circle of Media Capture. In Media Transformations in the Post-Communist World, edited by Peter Gross and Karol Jakubowicz. Plymouth: Lexington Books.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinguishing feature of media capture is the collaboration by the private sector. Cases abound across all regions of [[blog]]gers and [[Citizen journalism|citizen journalists]] putting a spotlight on specific issues and reporting on the ground during [[protest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, Stuart, and Einar Thorsen, eds. 2009.

Full capture can also be complicated to achieve. Paid [[Internet troll|trolls]] leading to phenomena such as paid [[Twitter]] and mob attacks, along with [[fake news]] and [[rumor]]s, are reportedly able to widely disseminate their attacks on independent journalists with the aid of bots. Across much of [[Africa]], a trend of "serial callers" has become increasingly common. Also observed in other regions, such as in North America where the phenomenon is commonly referred to as "[[astroturfing]]", serial callers are often individuals commissioned by political actors to constantly phone in to popular radio call in programmes with the intention of skewing or influencing the program in their interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In some cases, the programme might be structurally biased towards such actors (e.g., there will be a dedicated phone for those that have planned to phone in with particular political sympathies) but in other cases the process is more ad hoc with sympathetic callers flooding particular radio programs.

=== Financial regulations and business models ===

==== Concentration of media ownership ====
Financial threats on media independence can be [[Concentration of media ownership|concentrated ownership]] power, bankruptcy, or unsustainable funding for [[Public broadcasting|public service broadcasters]]. Capital controls for media are in place in all regions to manage foreign direct investment in the media sector. Many governments in Africa, [[Latin America]] and [[Caribbean]], and the Asia and Pacific regions have passed stringent laws and regulations that limit or forbid foreign media ownership, especially in the broadcasting and telecom sectors, with mixed impact on editorial independence. In Latin America, almost two thirds of the 15 countries covered by a [[World Bank]] study on foreign direct investments impose restrictions on foreign ownership in the newspaper-publishing sector. Almost all countries specify a cap on the foreign investment in media sector, although increasingly the strategy in the region has been to absorb private and foreign capital and experience of media management without losing ownership and political control of the media sector.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more complex to regulate ownership issues when the companies are internet platforms spanning multiple jurisdictions, although [[European Union|European]] competition and tax law has responded to some of the challenges in this regard, with unclear impact on the issue of independence of journalistic content on Internet companies.

==== New business models ====
Across the industry, media outlets have been re-evaluating where the value in media content lies, with a corresponding increase in government development programs, corporate benefactors and other special interests funding or cross-funding media content. These kinds of funding have been common historically in [[international broadcasting]], and they typically influence actual media content, framing, and the ‘red lines’ different from professional principles that reporters feel unable to cross. While larger media companies have relied on attracting their own advertisers online, many online intermediaries such as Google Ads now exist, which effectively has meant that small online media companies can get some revenues without having to have dedicated facilities—although the requirements of platforms like Facebook for video content, and the power to change news feeds without consultation do compromise editorial autonomy. In addition, the media organization concerned can no longer exert strong control over what [[Advertising|advertisements]] are shown, nor can it benefit from accessing full audience data to strengthen its own revenue prospects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Journalist perceptions ===
[[File:Trends_in_journalists_percetion_of_the_credibility_of_journalism.svg|thumb|481x481px|Trends in journalists perception of the credibility of journalism]]
According to the Worlds of Journalism Study, journalists in 18 of the 21 countries surveyed in Western Europe and North America perceived their freedom to make editorial decisions independently to have shrunken in the past five years. In all other regions, a plurality of journalists in most countries reported their editorial freedom to have strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;Worlds of Journalism Study 2016. The Worlds of Journalism Study is an academically driven project that was founded to regularly assess the state of journalism throughout the world. Its most recent wave brought together researchers from 67 countries, who interviewed 27,500 journalists between 2012 and 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While there remains a marked decline in print advertising sales in these States, some [[newspaper]]s are reporting an increase in [[Online advertising|digital advertising]] revenues and subscriptions that have enabled expansions of newsrooms that previously faced significant financial difficulty. This development partly reflects the relationship between major news brands and electoral cycles but it may also signal a growing willingness on the part of readers to pay for quality digital content.&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, Lahiri. 2017.

=== Mitigating political and economic interference ===
Several tools and organizations commit to mitigate political and economic interference in the media system.

==== Regulatory bodies ====
In some countries, the rise of [[Trade association|trade bodies]] as a dominating site of [[advocacy]] seems to limit the plurality of voices involved or consulted to those representing mainly owner interests in decision-making. This has occurred as the [[lobbying]] power of media elites has increased with ownership consolidation, particularly in North America. In some cases, the relative formal independence of the media regulator from government may have made it more vulnerable to capture by commercial interests. Some of the board members from these trade bodies and associations sit on government working groups and are members of committees. Such members often facilitate the associations’ indirect participation in the drafting of media laws and [[policy]].

==== Professionalization of regulatory bodies ====
According to the [[World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018]], there is a strong societal demand for the professionalization of regulatory and media bodies:

* Governmental alliances such as the [[Freedom Online Coalition]] and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] such as [[IFEX (organization)|IFEX]] and the [[Media Legal Defence Initiative]]
* [[Training]] of lawyers and judges are gaining popularity. UNESCO has provided training in this vein to 5,000 employees of the judicial sector in Latin America, and is commencing a similar initiative in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/courier/2017-april-june/training-judges-online-safeguard-journalists|title=Training Judges Online to Safeguard Journalists|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* There is also an increase in [[Educational technology|online training]] for journalism. [[Massive open online course|Massive Open Online Courses]] (MOOCs) and increased [[internet access]] in all regions of the world: There are a number of distance learning programs based in the United States and United Kingdom, such as the [[Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas|Knight Centre for Journalism in the Americas]], which also offers courses in Spanish serving countries in Latin America. The [[BBC Academy]] is another prominent example. The [[University of South Africa]] offers online degrees and short courses, including in media, to a global audience.
*[[Technology company|Technology companies]] are demonstrating a growing interest in these activities, particularly as they attempt to influence policy at a domestic level. [[Google]], [[Facebook]], and others have recently established policy offices also in Africa and the Arab region with a mandate to support the development of conducive policies and legal frameworks, as well as informed lawyers and policymakers, for their products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Journalistic standards ====

*[[Ethical code|Codes of ethics]] are a common way to promote journalistic standards. While there have been a number of codes of ethics for journalists that aspire to universal status, and even some for ‘[[Digital journalism|online journalists]]’ and [[blog]]gers, most transnational news agencies and broadcasters adhere to their own codes, although not all are publicly available.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* In most regions, newspapers have developed their own [[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]] with consistent values and standards that publishers and journalists should observe. Some newspapers have also appointed an [[ombudsman]] or readers’ representative to handle complaints from the public.
* In many countries, press councils and associations function like trade unions for journalists seeking to improve working conditions and to remove barriers journalists face when gathering news. 
* Depending on the country, independent press councils are formed on a non-statutory basis and in some cases, they are mandated by law.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Donor priorities ====
[[File:Donors_priorities_in_media_development.png|thumb|313x313px|Donors priorities in media development, UNESCO]]
Donor support of [[media development]] and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] non-governmental organizations can vary widely. A report by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]]’s [[Center for International Media Assistance]] (CIMA) highlighted the swings in funding by tracking [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) funding to different regions over the past three years.&lt;ref&gt;Kalathil, Shanthi. 2017. A Slowly Shifting Field: Understanding Donor Priorities in Media Development. CIMA Digital Report. Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA). Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/publication/slowly-shifting-field/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Private foundation]]s based in the [[North–South divide|Global North]] are increasingly providing grants to media organizations in the Global South. Such funds are often directed to cover specific topics of interest, such as health or education, and these donations can either support or weaken [[editorial independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffrin, Anya. 2017a. Same Beds, Different Dreams? Charitable Foundations and Newsroom Independence in the Global South. Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA) &amp; National Endowment for Democracy. Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/resource/beds-different-dreams-charitable-foundations-newsroom-independence-global-south/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender equality ==

=== The media workplace ===
In the newsroom, women sometimes face hostility. This can be partly explained by the lack of organizational policies relating to [[gender equality]] and reporting mechanisms for [[harassment]]. The [[International Women's Media Foundation|International Women’s Media Foundation]]’s 2011 global study of [[Women in media|women in the news media]], found that more than half of the news media organizations surveyed had a company-wide policy on gender equality, but with significant variations between regions. More than two-thirds of organizations based in Western Europe and Africa had such policies, compared with a quarter in the Middle East and North Africa and less than 20 per cent in Central and Eastern European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF). Available at https://www.iwmf.org/resources/global-report-on-the-status-of-women-in-the-news-media/. Accessed 8 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Institute for Gender Equality]]’s 2013 report, which looked at 99 major media houses across [[Europe]], found that a quarter of organizations had policies that included a provision for gender equality, often as part of broader equality directives in the society. It was notable that of the 99 organizations, public service bodies were much more likely than commercial ones to have equality policies in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/4d10b3c9-c97f-45a6-842c-c4003f743e70/language-en|title=European Institute for Gender Equality annual report 2013.|date=2015-03-17|website=publications.europa.eu|language=en|others=European Institute for Gender Equality|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media monitoring and advocacy ===

==== Regional organizations ====
Several regional gender monitoring initiatives exist. The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote "gender equality in and through the media" in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://genderlinks.org.za/what-we-do/sadc-gender-protocol/about-the-alliance-2/|title=About the Alliance - Gender Links|work=Gender Links|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender Links promotes media [[Advocacy journalism|advocacy]] through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gamag.net/|title=GAMAG – Global Alliance on Media and Gender|website=gamag.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender Links is currently developing [[Center of excellence|Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media]] in 108 newsrooms across Southern Africa and has established eight Centres of Excellence for Gender in Media Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://genderlinks.org.za/program/centres-of-excellence/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[World Association for Christian Communication]] (WACC), the [[The Global Media Monitoring Project|Global Media Monitoring Project]] (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The ‘End News Media Sexism’ campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary approach]] and uses a variety of different tools to promote [[awareness]], including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://waccglobal.org/articles/wacc-launches-end-news-media-sexism-campaign|title=WACC Launches "End News Media Sexism" campaign|website=waccglobal.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FEMNET|African Women’s Development and Communication Network]] (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote [[Women's empowerment|women’s empowerment]] in Africa, prioritizes women’s development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local [[capacity building]] initiatives, such as facilitating women’s access to [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://femnet.org/|title=FEMNET - The African Women's Development and Communication Network|website=FEMNET - The African Women's Development and Communication Network|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, the South Asia Women’s Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled "Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia". Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO’s [[International Programme for the Development of Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.swaninterface.net/|title=South Asia Women's Network|website=www.swaninterface.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National organizations ====
A number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women’s representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its Arabic acronym TAM) is a [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter [[stereotype]]s of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women’s access to decision-making positions and civic participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tam.ps/en/|title=.:: TAM ::.|website=tam.ps|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional associations ===
Formal and informal networks of women media professionals support women in media. The [[Alliance for Women in Media]] (AWM), established in 1951 participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents. In 1975, it began its annual programme of awards to recognize the work of programme-makers and content-providers in promoting women and women's issues.

Marie Colvin Journalists' Network - a bilingual Arabic-English [[online community]] of women journalists working in the Arab world - aims to assist vulnerable women journalist who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or psychological care. The network links experienced journalists with new or isolated journalists for mentoring and peer-to-peer support, while also working closely with experts in media law, [[digital security]], and health and safety to ensure specialized advice and assistance.&lt;ref&gt;n.d. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Marie Colvin Journalists’ Network. Available at https://mariecolvinnetwork.org/en/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women’s representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women’s union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifj.org/press-room/publications-reports/browse/4/|title=Publications &amp; Reports: IFJ|website=www.ifj.org|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orfeón Donostiarra''' is a concert choir based in [[San Sebastián]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=| title=Orfeon Donostiarra/Donostiako Orfeoia| url=http://www.onct.mairie-toulouse.fr/en/concerts/players/download/Orfeon-Donostiarra-bio.rtf| publisher= | date=| accessdate=15 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The choir was formed in 1897 in [[San Sebastián]]. The first music directors were Miguel Oñate, Luzuriaga and Esnaola. In June 1906 the group was awarded the Gran Prix of Paris. The next music director was Juan Gorostidi, who served until his death 1968, when Antxón Ayestarán became the next conductor. Since 1986 the choir is conducted by its presend music director José Antonio Sáinz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=| title=Orfeón Donostiarra| url=http://fundacionprincipedeasturias.org/en/awards/1984/orfeon-donostiarra-1/text/| publisher=Premios Príncipe de Asturias | date=| accessdate=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the heart of the Chorus's repertoire are the most important ''a capella'' works from the 18th century to our time, as well as the great nineteenth and twentieth century large scale orchestral choral works.

'''Qualified Mental Retardation Professional''' (QMRP) is a term first used in federal standards developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s for intermediate care facilities for the developmentally disabled.

==Qualifications==

Under federal law, any person working as a Qualified Mental Retardation Professional is required to meet the minimum requirements outlined in "Appendix J, Survey Procedures And Interpretive Guidelines For Intermediate Care Facilities For Persons With Mental Retardation."&lt;ref&gt;http://myqmrp.com/APPENDIX%20J.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Appendix J (W160 through W163) requires a QMRP to have a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[human services]] or a related field of study, plus at least one year of experience working with people diagnosed as developmentally disabled. [[Registered nurses]] and [[physicians]] also qualify to serve as a QMRP.

Some states, including [[California]], require a QMRP to be licensed to work in the state.  Other states, including [[Texas]] (which has over 900 [[Intermediate Care Facility]]/DD homes) and [[Alabama]], do not require licensing.

==Shifts in terminology==

In 2010, [[Rosa's Law]]&lt;ref&gt;A Short Look at Rosa's Law and What It Changes http://myqidp.com/Rosa%27s%20Law%20and%20changes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; changed the terminology from "Mental Retardation" to "Intellectual Disability.”

This change has prompted several states and organizations to change the designation of a QMRP to either "QDDP," meaning "Qualified Developmental Disability Professional," or "QIDP," meaning "Qualified Intellectual Disability Professional".

In December 2013, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) formally updated Appendix J to change the language used to describe developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107ap_j_intermcare.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that, as facilities start to phase out or convert to other programs (such as waiver-type settings) for people with disabilities, the terms QMRP, QDDP, and QIDP may be removed completely.

==Professional organizations==

There are several professional organizations for QMRPs.

The most notable organization, the [http://www.qddp.org/ National Association of QDDPs], holds annual meetings around the United States and offers a network for QMRPs to stay in contact with other QMRP groups.  There are also state-level organizations that provide training and resources to QMRPs.

Some organizations have started providing consulting services including training, standards, and reports such as the [http://www.ppat100.com/ Private Provider's Association of Texas], [http://myqidp.com My QIDP], and the [http://www.theqmrp.com/ QMRP], a California-based organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24637">'''Sámi orthography''' refers to the various [[orthography|orthographies]] used by the seven [[Sámi languages]] that have their own [[literary language]]: [[Southern Sami]], [[Ume Sámi]], [[Lule Sami]], [[Northern Sami]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]], [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] and [[Kildin Sami]].

==Orthographical trends==
Three different orthographical trends can be identified for these Sámi languages. The first one uses the principle of having the Sámi orthography be the same as it is for the majority language of that country as its basis. This trend goes back to the traditions where the Sami language was first being used as a written language, i.e., in [[Sweden]]. The literary language there that followed this principle was based on the old [[Ume Sami]] literary language from the 18th century. This same literary language was partially used as the basis for the modern literary languages of [[Southern Sami]] and [[Lule Sami]]. The oldest orthography for Northern Sámi in Norway, that of [[Knud Leem]], upholds this tradition. The second tradition goes back to [[Rasmus Rask|Rasmus Rask's]] revision of Leem's orthography, as Rask builds on the phonemic principle. North Sami, Inari Sami, and Skolt Sami follow this tradition. The third tradition is represented by the Kildin Sami language for which a written language has been created three times: first by Russian missionaries using the Cyrillic alphabet as the basis for the language's orthography, then using the Latin alphabet at the end of 1920s into the 1930s as part of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s language policy for minority languages, and finally once again returning to the Cyrillic alphabet at the end of the 1970s.

==A unified literary language==
The Sámi strongly feel that they are one people. For this reason, proposals for a united Sami literary language have been made.{{Who|date=June 2018}} The differences amongst the various languages are, however, too large to make this feasible.

==The six literary languages==
With the exception of [[Kildin Sámi]], the Sámi languages that have their own literary language are written with the standard [[Latin alphabet]] with the addition of some special characters.

===Southern Sami===
{{main|Southern Sami}}

Southern Sami follows the principle of using the majority language of the particular country it is being used in as the basis for its orthography and thus has two separate versions: the Norwegian standard and the Swedish standard. The letters enclosed in parentheses are letters that are only used in foreign words. In addition, ''ï'' {{IPA|[ɨ]}} is a central version of ''i'' {{IPA|[i]}}. Although this difference is clearly indicated in dictionaries, most texts do not distinguish between the two. The [[collating order]] is however based on Norwegian across both sides of the border.

===Lule Sámi===
{{main|Lule Sami}}

Like Southern Sámi, Lule Sámi follows the principle of using the majority language of the particular country it's being written in as the basis for its orthography and thus has two separate versions: the Norwegian standard and the Swedish standard. The standard orthography for Lule Sami was approved in 1983.

* In Norway, Áá,	Åå,	Ńń,	and Ææ are known to be used.
* In Sweden, Áá,	Åå,	Ńń,	and Ää are known to be used.

===Northern Sámi===
{{main|Northern Sami orthography}}

Northern Sámi has a long orthographic history, which has witnessed no less than nine different versions. The most recent version was approved in 1979 and last modified in 1985:

'''Shelta''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|l|t|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaeilge|Irish]]: ''Seiltis'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=shelta|title=tearma.ie - Dictionary of Irish Terms - Foclóir Téarmaíochta|author=|date=|website=tearma.ie|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[language]] spoken by [[Irish Travellers]], particularly in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=McArthur&gt;McArthur, T. (ed.) ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'' (1992) [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely known as the [[Cant (language)|Cant]], to its native speakers in Ireland as De Gammon, and to the linguistic community as Shelta.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"&gt;Kirk, J. &amp; Ó Baoill (eds.), D. ''Travellers and their Language'' (2002) [[Queen's University Belfast]] {{ISBN|0-85389-832-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was often used as a [[cryptolect]] to exclude outsiders from comprehending conversations between Travellers,&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; although this aspect is frequently over-emphasised.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; The exact number of native speakers is hard to determine due to sociolinguistic issues&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; but ''[[Ethnologue]]'' puts the number of speakers at 30,000 in UK, 6,000 in Ireland, and 50,000 in the US. The figure for at least the UK is dated to 1990; it is not clear if the other figures are from the same source.&lt;ref name=e12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sth |title=Shelta |publisher=Ethnologue |date=2009|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistically Shelta is today seen as a [[mixed language]] that stems from a community of travelling people in Ireland that was originally predominantly [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking. The community later went through a period of widespread bilingualism that resulted in a language based heavily on [[Hiberno-English]] with heavy influences from Irish.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; As different varieties of Shelta display different degrees of anglicisation (see below), it is hard to determine the extent of the Irish [[substratum]]. The ''Oxford Companion to the English Language'' puts it at 2,000–3,000 words.&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt;

==Names and etymology==
The language is known by various names. People outside the Traveller community often refer to it as ''[[Cant (language)|(the) Cant]]'', the etymology of which is a matter of debate.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; Speakers of the language refer to it as ''(the) Cant'',&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; ''Gammon''&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; or ''Tarri''.&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; Amongst linguists, the name ''Shelta'' is the most commonly used term.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt;

Variants of the above names and additional names include ''Bog Latin'',&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; ''Caintíotar'',{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} ''Gammon'',&lt;ref name=Dolan&gt;Dolan, Terence Patrick (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Hiberno-English'' (2004) [[Gill &amp; MacMillan]] {{ISBN|0-7171-3535-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sheldru'',&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; ''Shelter'',&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; ''Shelteroch'',&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; ''the Ould Thing'',&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; ''Tinker's Cant''.&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt;

===Etymology===
The word Shelta appears in print for the first time in 1882 in the book ''The Gypsies'' by the "gypsiologist" [[Charles Leland]], who claimed to have discovered it as the "fifth Celtic tongue". The etymology of the word has long been a matter of debate: Modern [[Celtic studies|Celticists]] are convinced that Irish ''{{lang|ga|siúl}}'' {{IPA-ga|ʃuːlʲ}} "to walk" is at the root, either via a term such as ''{{lang|ga|siúltóir}}'' {{IPA-ga|ʃuːlˠt̪ˠoːrʲ}} "a walker" or a form of the [[gerund]] ''{{lang|ga|siúladh}}'' (cf. ''an lucht siúlta'' {{IPA-ga|ənˠ lˠuxt̪ ʃuːlˠt̪ˠə||}}, "the walking people" (lit. ''the people of walks''),&lt;ref&gt;Collins Irish Dictionary, HarperCollins 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional Irish term for Travellers).&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; The ''Dictionary of Hiberno-English'' cites it as possibly a corruption of the word "Celt".&lt;ref name=Dolan/&gt; Since Shelta is a mixture of English and Irish grammar, the etymology is not straightforward. The language is made up mostly of Irish lexicon, being classified as a grammar-lexicon language with the grammar being English-based.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Origins and history==
[[Linguist]]s have been documenting Shelta since at least the 1870s. The first works were published in 1880 and 1882 by Charles Leland.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; Celtic language expert [[Kuno Meyer]] and [[Romani language|Romani]] expert [[John Sampson (linguist)|John Sampson]] both assert that Shelta existed as far back as the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Kuno. 1909. The secret languages of Ireland. Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society, New Series, 2: 241–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest but undocumented period linguists surmise that the Traveller community was [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking until a period of widespread [[bilingualism]] in Irish and [[Hiberno-English]] (or Scots in Scotland) set in, leading to [[Creole language|creolisation]] (possibly with a trilingual stage).&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; The resulting language is referred to as ''Old Shelta'' and it is suspected that this stage of the language displayed distinctive features, such as non-English syntactic and morphological features, no longer found in Shelta.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt;

Within the [[diaspora]], various sub-branches of Shelta exist. [[English Shelta]] is increasingly undergoing [[anglicisation]], while [[American Irish-Traveller's Cant]], originally also synonymous with Shelta, has by now been almost fully anglicised.&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt;

==Linguistic features==
[[Sociologist]] [[Sharon Gmelch]] describes the Travellers' language as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gmelch |first=Sharon |title=Nan: The Life of an Irish Travelling Woman |year=1986 |publisher=Souvenir Press |location=London |isbn=0-285-62785-6 |page=234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Irish Travelers use a secret argot or cant known as Gammon. It is used primarily to conceal meaning from outsiders, especially during business transactions and in the presence of police. Most Gammon utterances are terse and spoken so quickly that a non-Traveler might conclude the words merely had been garbled. Most Gammon words were formed from [[Irish language|Irish]] by applying four techniques: reversal, [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], [[affix]]ing, and substitution. In the first, an Irish word is reversed to form a Gammon one – ''mac'', or son, in Irish became ''kam'' in Gammon. In the second, consonants or consonant clusters were transposed. Thirdly, a sound or cluster of sounds were either prefixed or suffixed to an Irish word. Some of the more frequently prefixed sounds were ''s'', ''gr'', and ''g''. For example, ''Obair'', work or job, became ''gruber'' in Gammon. Lastly, many Gammon words were formed by substituting an arbitrary consonant or consonant cluster in an Irish word. In recent years, modern slang and [[Romani language|Romani]] (the language of the [[Romani people|gypsies]]) words have been incorporated. The [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] are English. The first [[vocabulary]] collected from Irish Travelers was published in 1808, indicating that Gammon dates at least back to the 1700s. But many early Celtic scholars who studied it, including the eminent [[Kuno Meyer]], concluded it was much older.}}

Thus, it is not [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with either English or Irish, out of design.

Shelta is a secret language. Travellers do not like to share the language with outsiders, named “Buffers”, or non-travellers. When speaking Shelta in front of Buffers, Travellers will disguise the structure so as to make it seem like they aren't speaking Shelta at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lexicon===
While Shelta is influenced by English grammar, it is also a mixture of Gaelic and Irish words as well. The word order itself is altered, with syllables reversed and many of the original words are Irish that have been altered or reversed. Many Shelta words have been disguised using techniques such as [[back slang]] where sounds are transposed (for example ''gop'' "kiss" from Irish ''póg'') or the addition of sounds (for example ''gather'' "father" from Irish ''athair'').&lt;ref name=McArthur/&gt; Other examples include ''lackin'' or ''lakeen'' "girl" from Irish ''cailín'', and the word ''rodas'' "door" from Irish ''doras''. The word for “son” is changed from the Gaelic ''mac'' to the Shelta ''kam.'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper and Hudson|first=Jared and Charles|date=1971|title=Irish Traveler Cant|url=|journal=Journal of English Linguistics|volume=5|pages=80|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

It also contains a certain number of introduced lexical items from Romani such as the term ''gadje'' "non-Traveller" or "kushti" (from the [[Romanichal]] word for "good"). Ten percent of the Gammon language comes from [[Romani language|Romani]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Liégeois, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3A2bGG3_NAYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Roma+in+europe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ApPkU5DWMpPT7Aac2IDgCg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Roma%20in%20europe&amp;f=false Roma in Europe], Council of Europe, 2007, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammar===
Shelta shares its main syntactic features with Hiberno-English and the majority of its morphological features such as -s plurals and past tense markers.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; Compare:

=== Phonology ===
Shelta has 27 consonants and six vowels.

The consonants are /p, pʲ, b, bʲ, m, mʲ, w, t, tʲ, d, dʲ, n, nʲ, θ, ð, r, rʲ, l, ʎ, ʃ, t͡ʃ, y, k, kʲ, g, gʲ, χ/. Many words are complex by incorporating numerous consonants within, as in the word skraχo for “tree, bush’ with the consonant /χ/ being a hissing sound that is held in the back of the throat, and is held longer than other consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidentally, there is not as much importance put on gender in Shelta. Plurals are shown with the English suffix /–s/ or /-i/, such as gloχ for “man” becomes gloχi for “men”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pidgins, Creoles and Mixed Languages|last=Velupillai|first=Viveka|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2015|isbn=978 90 272 5271 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loanwords==
Some Shelta words have been borrowed by mainstream English speakers, such as the word "bloke" meaning "a man" in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary – etymology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
There is no standard orthography. Broadly speaking, Shelta can either be written following an Irish-type orthography or an English-type orthography. For example, the word for "married" can either be spelled ''lósped'' or ''lohsped'', a "woman" can either be spelled ''byohr'' or ''beoir''.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt;

==Comparison texts==
Below are reproductions of the ''[[Lord's Prayer]]'' in Shelta as it occurred a century ago, current Shelta, and modern English and Irish versions for comparison. The 19th century Shelta version shows a high Shelta lexical content while the Cant version shows a much lower Shelta lexical content. Both versions are adapted from Hancock&lt;ref name=Hancock86&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/454664 |last=Hancock |first=I. |year=1986 |title=The cryptolectal speech of the American roads: Traveller Cant and American Angloromani |journal=American Speech |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=206–220 [pp. 207–208] |publisher=Duke University Press |jstor=454664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who notes that the Cant reproduction is not exactly representative of actual speech in normal situations.

'''Shilha''' {{IPAc-en|'|ʃ|ɪ|l|h|ə}} is a [[Berber language]] native to [[Shilha people]]. It is spoken by more than seven million people in southwestern [[Morocco]]. The endonym is '''Tacelḥiyt''' {{IPA|/taʃlʜijt/}}, and in recent English publications the language is often rendered ''Tashelhiyt'' or ''Tashelhit''. The alternative name '''Tasusiyt''' ("language of the [[Sous]]") has been gaining currency among native speakers. In [[Moroccan Arabic]] the language is called ''Šəlḥa'', from which the alternative English name ''Shilha'' is derived.&lt;ref&gt;When referring to the language, anthropologists and historians prefer the name "Shilha", which is in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Linguists writing in English prefer "Tashelhiyt".&lt;/ref&gt; In French sources the language is called ''tachelhit'', ''chelha'' or ''chleuh''.

Shilha is spoken in an area covering c. 100,000 square kilometres,&lt;ref&gt;The Shilha language area is approximately the size of Iceland, or the US state of Kentucky.&lt;/ref&gt; comprising the western part of the [[High Atlas]] mountains and the regions to the south up to the [[Draa River]], including the [[Anti-Atlas]] and the alluvial basin of the [[Oued Sous|Sous River]]. The largest urban centres in the area are the coastal city of [[Agadir]] (population over 400,000) and the towns of [[Guelmim]], [[Taroudant]], [[Oulad Teima]], [[Tiznit]] and [[Ouarzazate]].

In the north and to the south, Shilha borders on [[Arabic]]-speaking areas. In the northeast, roughly along the line [[Marrakesh]]-[[Zagora, Morocco|Zagora]], there is a [[dialect continuum]] with [[Central Atlas Tamazight]]. Within the Shilha area, there are several Arabic-speaking enclaves, notably the town of Taroudant and its surroundings. Substantial Shilha-speaking migrant communities are found in most of the larger towns and cities of northern Morocco and outside Morocco in Belgium, France, Germany, Canada, the United States and Israel.

Shilha possesses a distinct and substantial literary tradition that can be traced back several centuries before the [[French protectorate in Morocco|colonial era]]. Many texts, written in Arabic script and dating from the late 16th century to the present, are preserved in manuscripts. A modern printed literature in Shilha has developed since the 1970s.

== Naming ==
Shilha speakers usually refer to their language as ''Tašlḥiyt''.&lt;ref&gt;Justinard (1914:2), Destaing (1920:166), Galand (1988, 1.14).&lt;/ref&gt; This name is morphologically a feminine noun, derived from masculine ''Acelḥiy'' "male speaker of Shilha".&lt;ref&gt;In most of its usages, ''Acelḥiy'' simply means "a speaker of Shilha". It is not known whether children of Shilha speakers in the migrant communities who have not acquired an active knowledge of the language still identify themselves as ''Acelḥiy''. There is also an ethnic (racial) dimension to the term: white native speakers of Shilha generally refer to black native speakers (the modern descendants of liberated slaves) with the term ''asuqqiy'', a pejorative term derived from Arabic ''suq'' "market" (where slaves were bought and sold). The literature offers no information on the self-designation of black speakers.&lt;/ref&gt; Shilha names of other languages are formed in the same way, for example ''Aɛṛab'' "an Arab", ''Taɛṛabt'' "the Arabic language".&lt;ref&gt;Destaing (1920:20, 166). See also {{section link| |Semantics of feminine nouns}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''Acelḥiy'', though now freely used as an [[exonym and endonym|endonym]] among Shilha speakers, is [[exonym and endonym|exonymic]] in origin, as the nominal stem ''šlḥ'' goes back to the Arabic noun ''šilḥ'' "bandit" (plural ''šulūḥ'').&lt;ref&gt;Stumme (1899:3); see also Dozy, R. (1881), ''Supplément aux dictionnaires arabes'', Leyde: Brill, p. I:781, ''shilḥ'', plural ''shulūḥ'' "voleur, brigand".&lt;/ref&gt; The initial ''A-'' in ''Acelḥiy'' is the Shilha nominal prefix (see {{section link| |Inflected nouns}}). The ending ''-iy'' (borrowed from the [[nisba (onomastics)|Arabic suffix]] ''-iyy'') forms denominal nouns and adjectives. There are also variant forms ''Acelḥay'' and ''Tacelḥayt'', with ''-ay'' instead of ''-iy'' under the influence of the preceding consonant ''ḥ''.&lt;ref&gt;Stumme (1899:3); Laoust (1936:v).&lt;/ref&gt; The plural of ''Acelḥiy'' is ''Icelḥiyn''; a single female speaker is a ''Tacelḥiyt'' (noun homonymous with the name of the language), plural ''Ticelḥiyin''.

In Moroccan colloquial Arabic, a male speaker is called a ''Šəlḥ'', plural ''Šluḥ'', and the language is ''Šəlḥa'',&lt;ref&gt;Fox and Abu-Talib (1966:155), Colin (1993:976).&lt;/ref&gt; a feminine derivation calqued on ''Tašlḥiyt''. The Moroccan Arabic names have been borrowed into English as ''a Shilh'', ''the Shluh'', and ''Shilha'', and into French as ''un Chleuh'', ''les Chleuhs'', and ''chelha'' or, more commonly, ''le chleuh''.

The exonymic, uncomplimentary origin of the names ''Tacelḥiyt'' and ''Acelḥiy'' now seems lost from memory in Morocco among both Berbers and Arabs,&lt;ref&gt;At least, the existing lexicographical sources for Moroccan Arabic and Shilha do not record a pejorative meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; but Stumme (1899:3) noted that a speaker of Shilha will call himself an ''Acelḥiy'' while being fully aware that it is a term of abuse, taking his revenge by calling an Arab ''izikr'' "rope" (referring to the well-known [[Keffiyeh|Bedouin headgear]]).

The now usual names ''Tacelḥiyt'' and ''Icelḥiyn'' seem to have gained the upper hand relatively recently, as they are attested only in those manuscript texts which date from the 19th and 20th centuries. In older texts, the language is still referred to as ''Tamaziɣt'' or ''Tamazixt'' "Tamazight". For example, the author [[Mohammed Awzal|Awzal]] (early 18th c.) speaks of ''nnaḍm n Tmazixt ann ifulkin'' "a composition in that beautiful Tamazight".&lt;ref&gt;Awzal, ''Baḥr al-Dumūʿ'', v. 5 (edition in van den Boogert 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Sous is the most heavily populated part of the language area, the name ''Tasusiyt'' (lit. "language of Sous") is now often used as a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for the entire language.&lt;ref&gt;Justinard (1914:2), Laoust (1936:vi).&lt;/ref&gt; A speaker of ''Tasusiyt'' is an ''Asusiy'', plural ''Isusiyn'', feminine ''Tasusiyt'', plural ''Tisusiyin''.

== Number of speakers ==
[[File:Percent of Tashlhit speakers in Morocco by census 2004.png|thumb|Percentage of Shilha speakers per region according to 2004 census&lt;ref&gt;Based on data found [http://www.hcp.ma/Recensement-general-de-la-population-et-de-l-habitat-2004_a633.html Here]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Completely reliable data on the number of Berberophones in Morocco do not exist. Ethnologue, in its 17th-20th editions (2014-2017) cited the numbers yielded by the Moroccan census of 2004, according to which there were around 4 million speakers of Tashelhiyt, accounting for 13 percent of the total population. In its 21st edition (2018), [https://www.ethnologue.com/language/shi Ethnologue] quotes a number of around 7 million speakers for the year 2016 (source not mentioned), or 20 percent of the population. Assuming that Ethnologue’s 2016 figure is correct, it appears that the 2004 census seriously underreported the number of speakers, as it is highly unlikely that the proportion of Tashelhiyt speakers in Morocco has actually risen by 7 percentage points between 2004 and 2016.

Some authors mention a much higher number of Shilha speakers. Stroomer (2001a) estimated that there are "some 6 to 8 million" speakers, and he subsequently (2008) raised the number to "some 8 to 9 million".&lt;ref&gt;Stroomer (2001a:183n1), Stroomer (2008:289n1).&lt;/ref&gt; Stroomer does not refer to any published sources supporting his estimates, which are certainly too high.

Although many speakers of Shilha, especially men, are bilingual in Moroccan Arabic, there are as yet no indications that the survival of Shilha as a living language will be seriously threatened in the immediate future. Because of the rapid growth of the [[Demographics of Morocco|Moroccan population]] over the past decades (from 12 million in 1961 to over 33 million in 2014), it is safe to say that Shilha is now spoken by more people than ever before in history.

== Dialects ==
Dialect differentiation within Shilha, such as it is, has not been the subject of any targeted research, but several scholars have noted that all varieties of Shilha are mutually intelligible. The first was Stumme, who observed that all speakers can understand each other, "because the individual dialects of their language are not very different."&lt;ref&gt;Stumme (1899:4).&lt;/ref&gt; This was later confirmed by Ahmed Boukous, a Moroccan linguist and himself a native speaker of Shilha, who stated: "Shilha is endowed with a profound unity which permits the Shluh to communicate without problem, from the Ihahan in the northwest to the Aït Baamran in the southwest, from the Achtouken in the west to the Iznagen in the east, and from Aqqa in the desert to Tassaout in the plain of Marrakesh."&lt;ref&gt;Boukous (1977:126).&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists no sharply defined boundary between Shilha dialects and the dialects of [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] (CAT). The dividing line is generally put somewhere along the line Marrakesh-Zagora, with the speech of the Ighoujdamen, Iglioua and Aït Ouaouzguite ethnic groups&lt;ref&gt;Shilha ethnic names are quoted here in a conventional French orthography, as is usual in berberological literature. These names are also often given in an Arabicized form, for example Ghoujdama, Glaoua, Fetouaka, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to Shilha, and that of the neighboring Inoultan, Infedouak and Imeghran ethnic groups counted as CAT.

== Writing systems ==
Shilha has been written with several different alphabets. Historically, the Arabic script has been dominant. Usage of the Latin script emerged in the late 19th century. More recently there has been an initiative to write Shilha in Tifinagh.

=== Tifinagh ===
{{Main|Tifinagh}}
Tifinagh (or rather, Neo-Tifinagh) was introduced in the late 1990s and its use is now supported by the Moroccan authorities, in a standardised form promulgated by the Institut Royal de la Culture Amazighe (IRCAM, Rabat). Publications entirely printed in Tifinagh still remain rare, and only a tiny proportion of Shilha speakers, if any, are able to handle the new script with confidence. Its main role is emblematic, that of a cultural icon. As such, Tifinagh has entered the public space, with town signs now showing the name in Tifinagh as well as in Arabic and Latin script.

=== Latin script ===
Many Shilha texts from the oral tradition have been published since the 19th century, transcribed in Latin script. Early publications display a wide variety of transcription systems. Stumme (1899) and Destaing (1920, 1940) use an elaborate phonetic transcription, while Justinard (1914) and Laoust (1936) employ a transcription based on French orthographical conventions. A new standard was set by Aspinion (1953) who uses a simple but accurate, largely phonemic transcription with hyphenation.

Most academic publications of recent decades use a fairly [[Berber Latin alphabet|uniform transcription-orthography in Latin script]] (as used in this article).&lt;ref&gt;In this article, the graphs ''š'' and ''ž'' are used instead of standard ''c'' and ''j'' in order to make the transcribed examples more accessible to readers with no background in berberology.&lt;/ref&gt; The most unusual feature of this orthography is the employment of the symbol ɛ (Greek epsilon) to represent {{IPA|/ʢ/}} (voiced epiglottal fricative), for example ''taɛmamt'' {{IPA|/taʢmamt/}} "turban". Except with ''ḥ'' (= IPA {{IPA|/ʜ/}}), the subscript dot indicates pharyngealisation, for example ''aḍrḍur'' {{IPA|/adˤrdˤur/}} "deaf person". Geminated and long consonants are transcribed with doubled symbols, for example ''tassmi'' "needle", ''aggʷrn'' "flour". Word divisions are generally disjunctive, with clitics written as separate words (not hyphenated).

=== Arabic script ===

;Traditional orthography
Traditional Shilha manuscript texts are written in a conventionalized orthography in [[Maghrebi script|Maghribi Arabic script]].&lt;ref&gt;On the peculiarities of Maghribi script and orthography see van den Boogert (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; This orthography has remained virtually unchanged since at least the end of the 16th century, and is still used today in circles of traditional Islamic scholars (''ṭṭlba''). The main features of the traditional orthography are the use of two extra letters (''kāf'' with three dots for ''g'', and ''ṣād'' with three dots for ''ẓ'') and full vocalization (vowels written with ''fatḥah'', ''kasrah'' and ''ḍammah''). Clitical elements are written connected to a noun or verb form (conjunctive spelling).&lt;ref&gt;For a full description of the traditional orthography see van den Boogert (1997:61–67) and the article [[Berber orthography]].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Modern orthography
Since the 1970s, a fair number of books in Shilha have been published inside Morocco, written in a newly devised, practical [[Berber Arabic alphabet|orthography in Arabic script]]. The main features of this orthography are the representation of vowels ''a, i, u'' by the letters ''alif, yāʼ, wāw'', and the non-use of vocalization signs other than ''shaddah'' (to indicate gemination of consonants) and ''ḍammah'' (to indicate labialization of velar and uvular consonants). The consonant ''g'' is written with گ, and ''ẓ'' is either written with زٜ (''zāy'' with dot below) or not distinguished from ''z''. Word separations are mostly disjunctive.

== Literature ==
{{Main|Shilha literature}}
Shilha has an extensive body of [[oral literature]] in a wide variety of genres (fairy tales, animal stories, taleb stories, poems, riddles, and tongue-twisters). A large number of oral texts and ethnographic texts on customs and traditions have been recorded and published since the end of the 19th century, mainly by European linguists (see {{section link| |References and further reading}}).

Shilha possesses a pre-colonial literary tradition. Numerous texts written in Arabic script are preserved in manuscripts dating from the past four centuries. The earliest datable text is a compendium of lectures on the "religious sciences" (''lɛulum n ddin'') composed in metrical verses by Brahim u Ɛbdllah Aẓnag (Ibrāhīm ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Ṣanhājī, died 1597). The best known writer in this tradition is [[Mohammed Awzal|Mḥmmd u Ɛli Awzal]] (Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Hawzālī, died 1749), author of ''al-Ḥawḍ'' "The Cistern" (a handbook of [[Maliki]] law in verse), ''Baḥr al-Dumūʿ'' "The Ocean of Tears" (an adhortation, with a description of Judgment Day, in verse) and other texts.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Boogert (1997) offers a first exploration of Shilha manuscript literature, including an edition and translation of Awzal's work ''Baḥr al-Dumūʿ''. An older edition of this work, in the original Arabic script, is in Stricker (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, a modern literature in Shilha has been developing.

== Previous research ==
The first attempt at a grammatical description of Shilha is the work of the German linguist Hans Stumme (1864–1936), who in 1899 published his ''Handbuch des Schilḥischen von Tazerwalt''. Stumme's grammar remained the richest source of grammatical information on Shilha for half a century. A problem with the work is its use of an over-elaborate, phonetic transcription which, while designed to be precise, generally fails to provide a transparent representation of spoken forms. Stumme also published a collection of Shilha fairy tales (1895, re-edited in Stroomer 2002).

The next author to grapple with Shilha is [[Saïd Cid Kaoui]] (Saʿīd al-Sidqāwī, 1859-1910), a native speaker of Kabyle from Algeria. Having published a dictionary of [[Tamahaq language|Tuareg]] (1894), he then turned his attention to the Berber languages of Morocco. His ''Dictionnaire français-tachelh'it et tamazir't'' (1907) contains extensive vocabularies in both Shilha and Central Atlas Tamazight, in addition to some 20 pages of useful phrases. The work seems to have been put together in some haste and must be consulted with caution.

On the eve of the First World War there appeared a small, practical booklet composed by Captain (later Colonel) Léopold-Victor Justinard (1878–1959), entitled ''Manuel de berbère marocain (dialecte chleuh)''. It contains a short grammatical sketch, a collection of stories, poems and songs, and some interesting dialogues, all with translations. The work was written while the author was overseeing military operations in the region of [[Fez, Morocco|Fès]], shortly after the imposition of the French protectorate (1912). Justinard also wrote several works on the history of the Sous.

Emile Laoust (1876–1952), prolific author of books and articles about Berber languages, in 1921 published his ''Cours de berbère marocain'' (2nd enlarged edition 1936), a teaching grammar with graded lessons and thematic vocabularies, some good ethnographic texts (without translations) and a wordlist.

Edmond Destaing (1872–1940) greatly advanced our knowledge of the Shilha lexicon with his ''Etude sur la tachelḥît du Soûs. Vocabulaire français-berbère'' (1920) and his ''Textes berbères en parler des Chleuhs du Sous (Maroc)'' (1940, with copious lexical notes). Destaing also planned a grammar which was to complete the trilogy, but this was never published.

Lieutenant-interpreter (later Commander) Robert Aspinion (…?–...?) is the author of ''Apprenons le berbère: initiation aux dialectes chleuhs'' (1953), an informative though somewhat disorganized teaching grammar. Aspinion's simple but accurate transcriptions did away with earlier phonetic and French-based systems.

The first attempted description in English is ''Outline of the Structure of Shilha'' (1958) by American linguist [[Joseph R. Applegate|Joseph Applegate]] (1925–2003). Based on work with native speakers from Ifni, the work is written in a dense, inaccessible style, without a single clearly presented paradigm. Transcriptions, apart from being unconventional, are unreliable throughout.

The only available accessible grammatical sketch written in a modern linguistic frame is "Le Berbère" (1988) by Lionel Galand (1920–2017), a French linguist and berberologist. The sketch is mainly based on the speech of the Ighchan (Iɣeccan) ethnic group of the Anti-Atlas, with comparative notes on [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]] of Algeria and [[Air Tamajeq language|Tuareg]] of Niger.

More recent, book-length studies include Jouad (1995, on metrics), Dell and Elmedlaoui (2002 and 2008, on syllables and metrics), El Mountassir (2009, a teaching grammar), Roettger (2017, on stress and intonation) and the many text editions by Stroomer (see also {{section link| |References and further reading}}).

== Phonology ==

=== Stress and intonation ===
Stress and intonation in Shilha are the subject of a monograph by Roettger (2017), who used instrumental testing. He established the fact that Shilha does not have lexical stress (Roettger 2017:59), as noted earlier by Stumme (1899:14) and Galand (1988, 2.16).

=== Vowels ===
Shilha has three phonemic vowels, with length not a distinctive feature.&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 2.4).&lt;/ref&gt; The vowels show a fairly wide range of allophones.&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 2.13).&lt;/ref&gt; The vowel /a/ is most often realized as [a] or [æ], and /u/ is pronounced without any noticeable rounding except when adjacent to ''w''. The presence of a pharyngealized consonant invites a more centralized realization of the vowel, as in ''kraḍ'' {{IPA|[krɐdˤ]}} "three", ''kkuẓ'' {{IPA|[kkɤzˤ]}} "four", ''sḍis'' {{IPA|[sdˤɪs]}} "six" (compare ''yan'' {{IPA|[jæn]}} "one", ''sin'' {{IPA|[sin]}} "two", ''semmus'' {{IPA|[smmʊs]}} "five").

|align="center"|Close

|-

|
|align="center"|a
|}

Additional phonemic vowels occur sporadically in recent loan-words, for example /o/ as in ''rristora'' "restaurant" (from French).

==== Transitional vowels and "schwa" ====
In addition to the three phonemic vowels, there are non-phonemic transitional vowels, often collectively referred to as "[[schwa]]". Typically, a transitional vowel is audible following the onset of a vowelless syllable CC or CCC, if either of the flanking consonants, or both, are voiced,&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 2.1).&lt;/ref&gt; for example ''tigemmi'' {{IPA|[tigĭmmi]}} "house", ''ameḥḍar'' {{IPA|[amɐ̆ʜdˤɐr]}} "schoolboy". In the phonetic transcriptions of Stumme (1899) and Destaing (1920, 1940), many such transitional vowels are indicated.

Later authors such as Aspinion (1953), use the symbol ⟨e⟩ to mark the place where a transitional vowel may be heard, irrespective of its quality, and they also write ⟨e⟩ where in reality no vowel, however short, is heard, for example ⟨akessab⟩ {{IPA|[akssæb]}} "owner of livestock", ⟨ar išetta⟩ {{IPA|[ar iʃtta]}} "he's eating". The symbol ⟨e⟩, often referred to as "schwa", as used by Aspinion and others, thus becomes a purely graphical device employed to indicate that the preceding consonant is a syllable onset: [a.k⟨e⟩s.sab], [a.ri.š⟨e⟩t.ta].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Dell and Elmedlaoui (2002:232), who observe the same practice in transcriptions of Moroccan Arabic. The practice is almost never applied entirely consistently. For example, the noun ''idrimn'' "money" is written as ⟨idrimen⟩, with ⟨e⟩ indicating that ''m'' is the onset of the last syllable: [id.ri.m⟨e⟩n]. But when a vowel follows, as in ''idrimn inu'' "my money", ⟨e⟩ should not be written, because the syllabic structure then becomes [id.rim.ni.nu]. In such cases Aspinion and others routinely write ⟨idrimen inu⟩, with superfluous ⟨e⟩.&lt;/ref&gt; As Galand has observed, the notation of "schwa" in fact results from "habits which are alien to Shilha".&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 2.1), "le plus souvant les nombreuses notations de [ə] que l'on observe chez les berbèrisants résultent d'habitudes étrangères au chleuh".&lt;/ref&gt; And, as conclusively shown by Ridouane (2008), transitional vowels or "intrusive vocoids" cannot even be accorded the status of [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowels. It is therefore preferable not to write transitional vowels or "schwa", and to transcribe the vowels in a strictly phonemic manner, as in Galand (1988) and all recent text editions.&lt;ref&gt;Text published in the modern orthography in Arabic script also do not represent transitional vowels or "schwa".&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Treatment of hiatus ====
[[Hiatus (linguistics)|Hiatus]] does not occur within a morpheme, i.e. a morpheme never contains a sequence of two vowels without an intervening consonant. If hiatus arises when a morpheme-final vowel and a morpheme-initial vowel come together in context, there are several strategies for dealing with it.&lt;ref&gt;The effects of these strategies are often not accurately represented in transcriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the two vowels may be elided or, alternatively, the semivowel ''y'' may be inserted to keep the vowels apart:
:: /tumẓin ula asngar/ → ''tumẓin ulasngar'' or ''tumẓin ula y asngar'' "barley as well as maize"
::/fukku anɣ/ → ''fukkanɣ'' or ''fukku y anɣ'' "set us free!"
Less commonly, vowels /i/ and /u/ may change into ''y'' and ''w'': /ddu-at/ "go ye!" (imperative plural masculine) is realized either as ''dduyat'' (with inserted ''y'') or as ''ddwat''.

=== Consonants ===
[[File:Tamazightchelha.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in Shilha (Chelha).]]
Shilha has thirty-three phonemic consonants. Like other Berber languages and Arabic, it has both [[Pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] ("emphatic") and plain dental consonants. There is also a distinction between [[Labialization|labialized]] and plain [[dorsal consonant|dorsal]] [[obstruent]]s. Consonant [[gemination]] or length is contrastive.

The chart below represents the consonants in the standard Latin transcription. Where the transcription differs from the IPA orthography, the Latin transcription is bolded.

Additional phonemic consonants occur sporadically in recent loan-words, for example /bʷ/ as in ''bbʷa'' "(my) father" (from Moroccan Arabic), and /p/ as in ''laplaž'' "beach" (from French).

==== Semivowels ====
The semivowels /w/ and /y/ have vocalic allophones ''u'' and ''i'' between consonants (C_C) and between consonant and pause (C_# and #_C). Similarly, the high vowels /u/ and /i/ can have consonantal allophones ''w'' and ''y'' in order to avoid a hiatus. In most dialects,&lt;ref&gt;The speech of the Ighchan, and possibly other Shilha variants, often retains the original semivowels (Galand 1988, 2.9), and this can also be seen in premodern manuscript texts (van den Boogert 1997:249).&lt;/ref&gt; the semivowels are thus in complementary distribution with the high vowels, with the semivowels occurring as onset or coda, and the high vowels as nucleus in a syllable. This surface distribution of the semivowels and the high vowels has tended to obscure their status as four distinct phonemes, with some linguists denying phonemic status to /w/ and /y/.&lt;ref&gt;Applegate (1958), Dell &amp; Elmedlaoui (1985, 2002), Ridouane (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Positing four distinct phonemes is necessitated by the fact that semivowels and high vowels can occur in sequence, in lexically determined order, for example ''tazdwit'' "bee", ''tahruyt'' "ewe" (not *''tazduyt, *tahrwit''). In addition, semivowels /w/ and /y/, like other consonants, occur long, as in ''afawwu'' "wrap", ''tayyu'' "camel's hump".&lt;ref&gt;This issue is discussed in connection with other languages by Dixon (2010:284).&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of four phonemes also results in a more efficient description of morphology.&lt;ref&gt;Van den Boogert (1997:247–8), with examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the examples below, /w/ and /y/ are transcribed phonemically in some citation forms, but always phonetically in context, for example ''ysti-'' "the sisters of", ''dars snat istis'' "he has two sisters".

==== Gemination and length ====
There is a phonemic contrast between single and non-single (geminated or long) consonants:
::''tuga'' "grass" vs. ''tugga'' "testimony"
::''tamda'' "pool" vs. ''tamdda'' "sparrowhawk"
Gemination and lengthening play a role in the morphology of nouns and verbs:
::''agllid'' "king", ''igldan'' "kings" (''ll'' becomes ''l'')
::''imgr'' "he harvested", ''ar imggr'' "he is harvesting" (''g'' becomes ''gg'')
All consonants can in principle occur geminated or long, although phonemic ''xxʷ'' and ''ṛṛ'' do not seem to be attested. The uvular stops only occur geminated or long (''qq, qqʷ'').&lt;ref&gt;See Van den Boogert (1997:244–245).&lt;/ref&gt;

Four consonants have each two corresponding geminate or long consonants, one phonetically identical and one different:
::''ḍ'' : ''ḍḍ'' and ''ṭṭ''
::''w'' : ''ww'' and ''ggʷ''
::''ɣ'' : ''ɣɣ'' and ''qq''
::''ɣʷ'' : ''ɣɣʷ'' and ''qqʷ''
In the oldest layers of the morphology, ''ḍ'', ''w'', ''ɣ'', ''ɣʷ'' always have ''ṭṭ'', ''ggʷ'', ''qq'', ''qqʷ'' as geminated or long counterparts:
::''ɣrs'' "slaughter", ''ar iqqrs'' "he is slaughtering" (compare ''krz'' "plough", ''ar ikkrz'' "he is ploughing")
::''izwiɣ'' "be red", ''izggʷaɣ'' "it is red" (compare ''isgin'' "be black", ''isggan'' "it is black")
Whether a non-single consonant is realized as geminated or as long depends on the syllabic context. A geminated consonant is a sequence of two identical consonants /CC/, metrically counting as two segments, and always separated by syllable division, as in ''tamdda'' [ta.md.da.] "sparrowhawk". A long consonant is a consonant followed by a [[chroneme]] /C:/, metrically counting as a single segment and belonging to one syllable, as in ''tugga'' [tu.g:a.] "testimony". When a morpheme contains a non-single consonant, it can be either geminated or long, depending on the context:
::/azzl-Ø/ ''azzl!'' [az.zl.] "run!" (geminate)
::/azzl-at/ ''azzlat!'' [az:.lat.] "run!" (long)
It is also possible for two identical consonants to occur in sequence, both being released separately and constituting the onset and nucleus of a vowelless syllable. Such sequences are transcribed with an intervening apostrophe:
::''uššan'n'' [u.š:a.n'n.] "jackals"
::''ixmm'm'' [i.xm.m'm.] "he pondered"
::''frṭ'ṭṭu'' [fr.ṭ'ṭ.ṭu.] "bat"

=== Syllable structure ===
Shilha syllable structure has been the subject of a detailed and highly technical discussion by phoneticians. The issue was whether Shilha does or does not have vowelless syllables. According to John Coleman, syllables which are vowelless on the phonemic level have "schwa" serving as vocalic nucleus on the phonetic level. According to Rachid Ridouan on the other hand, Shilha's apparently vowelless syllables are truly vowelless, with all phonemes, vowels as well as consonants, capable of serving as nucleus. The discussion is summed up in Ridouan (2008, with listing of relevant publications), where he conclusively demonstrates that a perfectly ordinary Shilha phrase such as ''tkkst stt'' "you took it away" indeed consists of three vowelless syllables [tk.ks.tst:.], each made up of voiceless consonants only, and with voiceless consonants (not "schwa") serving as nucleus. Many definitions of the syllable that have been put forward do not cover the syllables of Shilha.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Syllable: A phonological unit consisting of a vowel or other unit that can be produced in isolation, either alone or accompanied by one or more less sonorous units" (P.H. Matthews, ''Oxford concise dictionary of linguistics'', Second Edition, Oxford: OUP, 2007). See also [[Syllable]], which contains references to other languages with vowelless syllables.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Syllable types ====
The syllable structure of Shilha was first investigated by Dell and Elmedlaoui in a seminal article (1985). They describe how syllable boundaries can be established through what they call "core syllabification". This works by associating a nucleus with an onset, to form a core syllable CV or CC. Segments that are higher on the sonority scale have precedence over those lower on the scale in forming the nucleus in a core syllable, with vowels and semivowels highest on the scale, followed by liquids and nasals, voiced fricatives, voiceless fricatives, voiced stops and voiceless stops. When no more segments are available as onsets, the remaining single consonants are assigned as coda to the preceding core syllable, but if a remaining consonant is identical to the consonant that is the onset of the following syllable, it merges with it to become a long consonant. A morpheme boundary does not necessarily constitute a syllable boundary. Example:
::''ddan s yaw wurti kšmn iss ad ššin tazart d waḍil''
::"they went to a garden and entered it to eat figs and grapes"
Core syllabification:
::d (da) (ns) (ya) w (wu) r (ti) k (šm) (ni) s (sa) (dš) (ši) n (ta) (za) r (td) (wa) (ḍi) l
Coda assignment:
::(d:a) (ns) (ya) (w:ur) (tik) (šm) (ni) (s:a) (dš) (šin) (ta) (zar) (td) (wa) (ḍil)
Application of core syllabification produces the following Shilha syllable types:

{| class="wikitable" border='1'

|width="80"|C V
|width="80"|C: V

Shilha syllable structure can be represented succinctly by the formula CX(C), in which C is any consonant (single/long), and X is any vowel or consonant (single) and with the restriction that in a syllable CXC the X, if it is a consonant, cannot be higher on the resonance scale than the syllable-final consonant, that is, syllables such as [tsk.] and [wrz.] are possible, but not *[tks.] and *[wzr.].

Exceptional syllables of the types X (vowel or single/long consonant) and V(C) (vowel plus single/long consonant) occur in utterance-initial position:
::''rgl t'' [r.glt.] "close it!" (syllable C)
::''ffɣat'' [f:.ɣat.] "go out!" (syllable C:)
::''awi t id'' [a.wi.tid.] "bring it here!" (syllable V)
::''aški d'' [aš.kid.] "come here!" (syllable VC)
Another exceptional syllable type, described by Dell and Elmedlaoui (1985), occurs in utterance-final position, when a syllable of the type CC or CC: is "annexed" to a preceding syllable of the type CV or C:V, for example ''fssamt'' "be silent!" is [fs.samt.] not *[fs.sa.mt.].

Since any syllable type may precede or follow any other type, and since any consonant can occur in syllable-initial or final position, there are no phonotactical restrictions on consonant sequences. This also means that the concept of the consonant cluster is not applicable in Shilha phonology, as any number of consonants may occur in sequence:
::''frḥɣ s lmɛrft nnk''
::[fr.ḥɣs.lm.ɛrf.tn.nk.] (six syllables, fourteen consonants, no vowels)
::"I'm glad to make your acquaintance"

==== Metrics ====
The metrics of traditional Shilha poems, as composed and recited by itinerant bards (''inḍḍamn''), was first described and analyzed by Hassan Jouad (thesis 1983, book 1995; see also Dell and Elmedlaoui 2008). The traditional metrical system confirms the existence of vowelless syllables in Shilha, and Jouad's data have been used by Dell and Elmedlaoui, and by Ridouane to underpin their conclusions.

The metrical system imposes the following restrictions:
*each line in a poem contains the same number of syllables as all the other lines
*each syllable in a line contains the same number of segments as its counterpart in other lines
*each line contains one particular syllable that must begin or end with a voiced consonant
*each line is divided into feet, with the last syllable in each foot stressed ("lifted") in recitation
Within these restrictions, the poet is free to devise his own metrical form. This can be recorded in a meaningless formula called ''talalayt'' which shows the number and the length of the syllables, as well as the place of the obligatory voiced consonant (Jouad lists hundreds of such formulae).

The system is illustrated here with a quatrain ascribed to the semi-legendary Shilha poet [[Hemmou Talb|Sidi Ḥammu]] (fl. 18th century) and published by Amarir (1987:64):
::''a titbirin a tumlilin a timgraḍ''
::''ab bahra wr takkamt i lxla hann lbaz''
::''igan bu tassrwalt ig lxatm ɣ uḍaḍ''
::''ak kʷnt yut ukan iɣli d ignwan izug''
 
::"O white doves, O pets!
::Do not venture into the desert too often, for there is the falcon,
::Wearing small trousers; he'll put a ring on [your] finger,
::To strike you but once — then he ascends into the sky and is gone!"

Application of Dell and Elmedlaoui's core syllabification reveals a regular mosaic of syllables:

The poem is composed in a metre listed by Jouad (1995:283) and exemplified by the formula ''a láy, la li la láy, la li la lá, li lád'' (the ''d'' in the last syllable indicates the position of the compulsory voiced consonant).

== Grammar ==
=== Nouns ===
On the basis of their morphology, three types of Shilha nouns can be distinguished, two indigenous types and one type of external origin:
*inflected nouns
*uninflected nouns
*unincorporated loans
The relevant morpho-syntactic categories are gender, number and state.&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 4.9–12).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inflected nouns ====
Inflected nouns are by far the most numerous type. These nouns can be easily recognised from their outward shape: they begin with a nominal prefix which has the form (t)V-:
::''aggu'' "smoke"
::''igigil'' "orphan"
::''uṣkay'' "hound"
::''tadggʷat'' "evening"
::''tibinṣrt'' "marsh mallow (plant)"
::''tuḍfit'' "ant"
Inflected nouns distinguish two genders, masculine and feminine; two numbers, singular and plural; and two states, conventionally referred to by their French names as ''état libre'' (free state) and ''état d'annexion'' (annexed state)&lt;ref&gt;Both Galand (1988. 4.11) and Kossmann (2012:67n7) rightly point out that the annexed state in Berber is not to be confused with the construct state of the Semitic languages.&lt;/ref&gt; and glossed as '''EL''' and '''EA'''. Gender and number are all explicitly marked, but historical and synchronic sound changes have in some cases resulted in the neutralization of the difference between EL and EA.

The nominal prefix has no semantic content.&lt;ref&gt;That is, it is not a sort of (in)definite article, although it may be demonstrative in origin.&lt;/ref&gt; It is made up of one or both of two elements, a gender prefix and a vocalic prefix. Singular feminine nouns may also have a gender suffix. For example, the noun ''tazdwit'' "bee" has the feminine prefix ''t-'', the vocalic prefix ''a-'' and the feminine singular suffix ''-t'' added to the nominal stem ''zdwi''. While feminine inflected nouns always have the feminine prefix, masculine nouns do not have a gender prefix in the free state (EL); for example ''abaɣuɣ'' "fox" has no gender prefix, but only a vocalic prefix ''a-'' added to the nominal stem ''baɣuɣ''.

Gender is thus marked unambiguously, albeit asymmetrically. In just a handful of nouns, the morphological gender does not conform to the grammatical gender (and number): ''ulli'' "sheep and goats" is morphologically masculine singular, but takes feminine plural agreement; ''alln'' "eyes" is morphologically masculine plural, but takes feminine plural agreement; ''tarwa'' "(someone's) children, offspring" is morphologically feminine singular, but takes masculine plural agreement.

The annexed state (EA) is regularly formed by reducing the vocalic prefix to zero and, with masculine nouns, adding the masculine gender prefix ''w-'':&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 4.11).&lt;/ref&gt; 
::EL ''t-a-zdwi-t'' "bee" → EA ''t-zdwi-t''
::EL ''a-baɣuɣ'' "fox" → EA ''w-baɣuɣ''
With some nouns, the original vocalic prefix has fused with a stem-initial vowel, to produce an inseparable (and irreducible) vowel:
::EL ''ayyur'' "moon, month" → EA ''w-ayyur'' (not *''w-yyur'')
::EL ''t-afuk-t'' "sun" → EA ''t-afuk-t'' (not *''t-fuk-t'')
With feminine nouns that have an inseparable vocalic prefix, the difference between EL and EA is thus neutralized.

While most inflected nouns have a vocalic prefix ''a-'', some have ''i-'' (in some cases inseparable), and a few have ''u-'' (always inseparable). When a masculine noun has the vocalic prefix ''i-'' (separable or inseparable), the masculine gender prefix ''w-'' changes to ''y-''. The table below presents an overview (all examples are singular; plurals also distinguish EL and EA):

|t-isn-t
|-
|"mouflon"
|udad
|w-udad
|"light"
|t-ufaw-t
|t-ufaw-t
|}

The EA is not predictable from the shape of the noun, compare:
::''afus'' "hand" → EA ''wfus''
::''afud'' "knee" → EA ''wafud''
The phonological rules on the realization of /w/ and /y/ apply to the EA as well. For example, the EA of ''a-mɣar'' "chief" is /w-mɣar/, realized as ''wmɣar'' after a vowel, ''umɣar'' after a consonant:
::''ifka t i wmɣar'' "he gave it to the chief"
::''imun d umɣar'' "he accompanied the chief"
Inflected nouns show a great variety of plural formations, applying one or more of the following processes:
*suffixation (masculine ''-n'', feminine ''-in'')
*vowel change (insertion or elision, or [[apophony|ablaut]])
*consonant gemination or degemination
*stem extension (''+aw, +iw, +t, +w'', always in combination with a suffix)
There are also irregular and suppletive plurals. The feminine singular suffix ''-t'' is naturally lost in the plural.

Independent from these processes, the separable vocalic prefix ''a-'' is always replaced with ''i-''. An inseparable vocalic prefix either remains unchanged, or changes as part of vowel change (but if the vocalic prefix is inseparable in the singular, it may be separable in the plural, as with ''aduz'' "dune", and vice versa, as with ''aydi'' "dog"; see table below).

Below is a sample of nouns, illustrating various plural formations.

The plural is generally not predictable from the shape of the singular, compare:
::''a-duku'' "shoe", plural ''i-duka-n''
::''a-ruku'' "utensil", plural ''i-ruku+t-n''
Many nouns have more than one plural, for example ''a-žnwiy'' "knife", plural ''i-žnway'' (vowel change) or ''i-žnwiy-n'' (suffixation).

Many Shilha place-names are morphologically inflected nouns:
::''A-nammr'' "Anammeur"
::''I-ɣʷrays-n'' " Irhoreïsene"
::''T-a-rudan-t'' "Taroudant"
::''T-i-zgzaw-in'' "Tizegzaouine"
The same is the case with Shilha ethnic names:
::''Amml-n'' "the Ammeln" (singular ''Imml'')
::''Aštuk-n'' "the Achtouken" (singular ''Aštuk'')
::''I-lall-n'' "the Ilallen" (singular ''I-lillu'')
::''I-skʷta-n'' "the Isouktan" (singular ''A-sktu'')
Among the inflected nouns are found many incorporated loans. Examples include (see also {{section link| |Loan-words}}):
::''t-a-kira'' "wax" (from Latin)
::''a-ɣanim'' "reeds" (from Punic)
::''urti'' "garden" (from early Romance)
::''a-muslm'' "Muslim" (from Arabic)
::''t-a-bra-t'' "letter, missive" (from Arabic)

==== Uninflected nouns ====
This is the least common type, which also includes some loans. Examples:
::''dikkuk'' "cuckoo"
::''fad'' "thirst"
::''gmz'' "thumb"
::''kḍran'' "tar" (from Arabic)
::''lagar'' "station" (from French)
::''laẓ'' "hunger"
::''maṭiša'' "tomatoes" (from Spanish?)
::''mllɣ'' "index finger"
::''sksu'' "couscous"
::''wazdwit'' "light afternoon meal"
::''wiẓugn'' "cricket"
::''xizzu'' "carrots"

It is probable that all uninflected nouns were originally masculine. The few that now take feminine agreement contain elements that have been reanalyzed as marking feminine gender, for example ''ttždmnni'' "type of spider" (initial ''t'' seen as feminine prefix), ''hlima'' "bat" (not an Arabic loan-word, but final ''a'' analyzed as the Arabic feminine ending).

Many uninflected nouns are collectives or non-count nouns which do not have a separate plural form. Those that have a plural make it by preposing the pluralizer ''id'', for example ''id lagar'' "stations".

The uninflected noun ''mddn'' or ''middn'' "people, humans" is morphologically masculine singular but takes masculine plural agreement.

Names of people and foreign place-names can be seen as a subtype of uninflected nouns, for example ''Musa'' (man's name), ''Muna'' (woman's name), ''Fas'' "Fès", ''Brdqqiz'' "Portugal". Gender is not transparently marked on these names, but those referring to humans take gender agreement according to the natural sex of the referent (male/masculine, female/feminine).

==== Unincorporated loans ====
These are nouns of Arabic origin (including loans from French and Spanish through Arabic) which have largely retained their Arabic morphology. They distinguish two genders (not always unambiguously marked) and two numbers (explicitly marked). A notable feature of these nouns is that they are borrowed with the Arabic definite article, which is semantically neutralized in Shilha:
::Moroccan Arabic ''l-fraš'' "the bed" → Shilha ''lfraš'' "the bed, a bed"
::Moroccan Arabic ''š-šariž'' "the basin" → Shilha ''ššariž'' "the basin, a basin"
The Arabic feminine ending ''-a'' is often replaced with the Shilha feminine singular suffix '' t'':
::Moroccan Arabic ''l-faky-a'' → Shilha ''lfaki-t'' "fruit"
::Moroccan Arabic ''ṛ-ṛuḍ-a'' → Shilha ''ṛṛuṭ-ṭ'' "tomb of a saint"
Arabic loans usually retain their gender in Shilha. The exception are Arabic masculine nouns which end in ''t''; these change their gender to feminine in Shilha, with the final ''t'' reanalyzed as the Shilha feminine singular suffix ''-t'':
::Moroccan Arabic ''l-ḥadit'' "the prophetic tradition" (masculine) → Shilha ''lḥadi-t'' (feminine)
::Moroccan Arabic ''l-mut'' "death" (masculine) → Shilha ''lmu-t'' (feminine)
Arabic plurals are usually borrowed with the singulars. If the borrowed plural is not explicitly marked for gender (according to Arabic morphology) it has the same gender as the singular:
::''lbhim-t'' "domestic animal" (feminine), plural ''lbhaym'' (feminine)
::''lbzim'' "buckle" (masculine), plural ''lbzaym'' (masculine)
Loan-words whose singular is masculine may have a plural which is feminine, and marked as such (according to Arabic morphology), for example ''lɛlam'' "flag" (masculine), plural ''lɛlum-at'' (feminine).

==== Use of the annexed state ====
The annexed state (EA) of an inflected noun is used in a number of clearly defined syntactical contexts:&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 4.11).&lt;/ref&gt;
*when the noun occurs as subject in postverbal position:
::''tfulki tmazirt nnun'' (it.is.beautiful EA-country of.you) "your country is beautiful"
:compare:
::''tamazirt nnun tfulki'' (EL-country of.you it.is.beautiful) "[as for] your country, it is beautiful"
*after most prepositions (see also {{section link | |Prepositions}}):
::''tiskrt d uẓalim'' "EL-garlic with (and) EA-onions" (EL ''aẓalim'')
::''tangult n uɣrum'' "a EL-loaf of EA-bread" (EL ''aɣrum'')
*after numerals 1 to 10 and after the indefinite numeral (see also {{section link | |Numerals}}):
::''kraṭṭ tmkilin'' "three EA-dishes" (EL ''timkilin'')
::''mnnaw wussan'' "many EA-days" (EL ''ussan'')
*after some elements indicating descent and origin which require a following noun phrase (see also {{section link| |Possessed nouns}}):
::''ayt Ugadir'' "the people of Agadir"
::''bu tɣanimt'' "he with EA-reed: flute player" (EL ''taɣanimt'')
Outside these contexts, the EL is used. Uninflected nouns and unincorporated loans, which do not distinguish state, remain unchanged in these contexts.

==== Semantics of feminine nouns ====
The formation of feminine nouns from masculine nouns is a productive process. A feminine noun is formed by adding both the feminine nominal prefix ''t-'' (and, if necessary, a vocalic prefix), and the feminine singular suffix ''-t'' to a masculine noun. The semantic value of the feminine derivation is variable.

For many nouns referring to male and female humans or animals (mainly larger mammals), matching masculine and feminine forms exist with the same nominal stem, reflecting the sex of the referent:
::''adgal'' "widower" → ''tadgalt'' "widow"
::''amuslm'' "Muslim" → ''tamuslmt'' "Muslima"
::''ikni'' "twin boy" → ''tiknit'' "twin girl"
::''afullus'' "cock, rooster" → ''tafullust'' "chicken"
::''izm'' "lion" → ''tizmt'' "lioness"
::''udad'' "mouflon" → ''tudatt'' "female mouflon"
In a few cases there are suppletive forms:
::''argaz'' "man, husband" ― ''tamɣart'' "woman, wife"
::''ankkur'' "buck" ― ''taɣaṭṭ'' "goat"
Feminine nouns derived from masculine nouns with inanimate reference have diminutive meaning:
::''aẓru'' "stone" → ''taẓrut'' "small stone"
::''ifri'' "cave" → ''tifrit'' "hole, lair"
::''lbit'' "room" → ''talbitt'' "small room"
::''ṣṣnduq'' "box" → ''taṣṣnduqt'' "little box"
::''urti'' "garden" → ''turtit'' "small garden"
Conversely, a masculine noun derived from a feminine noun has augmentative meaning:
::''tamda'' "lake" → ''amda'' "large lake"
::''tigmmi'' "house" → ''igmmi'' "large house"
::''tiznirt'' "fan palm" → ''iznir'' "large fan palm"
Feminine nouns derived from masculine collective nouns have singulative meaning:
::''asngar'' "maize" → ''tasngart'' "a cob"
::''iﬁfl'' "peppers" → ''tiﬁflt'' "a pepper"
::''biṭlžan'' "aubergines" → ''tabiṭlžant'' "an aubergine"
::''luqid'' "matches" → ''taluqitt'' "a match"
Femine derivations are also used as names of languages, professions and activities:
::''ahulandiy'' "Dutchman" → ''tahulandiyt'' "the Dutch language"
::''fransis'' "the French" → ''tafransist'' "the French language"
::''amzil'' "blacksmith" → ''tamzilt'' "blacksmith's profession"
::''inmmtri'' "beggar" → ''tinmmtrit'' "begging"
::''lmumsik'' "miser" → ''talmumsikt'' "avarice"
::''gʷma'' "(my) brother" → ''tagʷmat'' "brotherhood"
There is an overlap here with feminine nouns denoting females:
::''tafransist'' "Frenchwoman" and "the French language"
::''tinmmtrit'' "beggarwoman" and "begging"

====Nominal deictic clitics ====
There are three deictic clitics which can follow a noun: proximal ''a-d'' "this, these", distal ''a-nn'' "that, those" (compare {{section link| |Verbal deictic clitics}}) and anaphoric ''lli'' "the aforementioned":
::''tammnt '''ad''' ur tɣʷli'' "[as for] '''this''' honey, it is not expensive"
::''yaɣ uṣmmiḍ taɣaṭṭ '''ann''' bahra'' "the cold has badly afflicted '''that''' goat"
::''ifk ṭṭir '''lli''' i tazzanin ar srs ttlɛabn'' "[and then] he gave '''the''' bird to some children to play with"

===Personal pronouns===
There are three basic sets of personal pronouns:
*independent
*direct object clitics
*suffixes
In addition, there are two derived sets which contain the suffixed pronouns (except in 1st singular):
*indirect object clitics
*possessive complements
Gender is consistently marked on 2nd singular, and on 2nd and 3rd plural. Gender is not consistently marked on 3rd singular and 1st plural. Gender is never marked on 1st singular.

The independent ("overt") pronouns are used to topicalize the subject or the object.
::'''''nkkʷni''' wr a nlssa turẓyin n waggʷri'' "[as for] us, we don't wear sandals [made] of alfa"
::''tumɣarin '''nttntin''' a ybnnun andaru n ifullusn'' "[as for] the women, they're the ones who build a chicken coop"
They are also used with certain pseudo-prepositions such as ''zund'' "like", ''abla'' "except":
::''ɛlah, '''nkki''', giɣ aɣyul zund '''kyyi'''?'' "why, [as for] me, am I an ass like you?"
::''ur iqqadda ay yakʷr abla '''kʷnni''''' "no one could have stolen [it] except you"

The direct object clitics are used with transitive verbs:
::''yuzn '''tn''' s tmzgida'' "he sent them to the Koranic school"
::''iɣ '''yyi''' yut ar ttrwalɣ'' "when he beats me I run away"
The 3rd singular feminine variant ''stt'' is used after a dental stop, compare:
::''awi '''tt''' id'' "bring her here!" (imperative singular)
::''awyat '''stt''' id'' "bring her here!" (imperative plural masculine)
The direct object clitics are also used to indicate the ''subject'' with pseudo-verbs,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kossmann (2012:86–7),&lt;/ref&gt; and with the presentative particle ''ha'' "here is, ''voici''":
::''waḥdu yyi'' (alone me) "I alone"
::''kullu tn'' (all them) "they all, all of them"
::''laḥ t'' (absent him) "he's not there, he's disappeared"
::''manza tt'' (where her) "where is she?"
::''ha yyi'' (here.is me) "here I am"
The pronominal suffixes are used with prepositions to indicate the object (see {{section link| |Prepositions}}), and with a closed set of necessarily possessed kinship terms to indicate possession (see {{section link| |Possessed nouns}}). The plural forms add an infix ''-t-'' before the suffix with kinship terms, for example ''baba-t-nɣ'' "our father" (never *''baba-nɣ''); this infix also occurs with some prepositions as a free or dialectal variant of the form without the ''-t-'':
::''flla-sn'' or ''flla-t-sn'' "on them"
::''dar-sn'' "with them" (never *''dar-t-sn'')
The indirect object clitics convey both benefactive and detrimental meaning:
::''alliɣ immut ur '''as''' d ifil walu'' (when he.died not to.her hither he.left anything) "when he died he didn't leave her anything"
::''tamurɣi tšša y '''as''' tibḥirt nns'' (EL-locust she.ate to.her EL-vegetable.garden of.her) "the locusts have eaten her vegetable garden"
The possessive complements follow the noun (see {{section link| |Possession}}).

=== Prepositions ===
Prepositions can have up to three different forms, depending on the context in which they are used:
*before a noun or demonstrative pronoun
*with a pronominal suffix
*independent in relative clause
The form before nouns and demonstrative pronouns and the independent form are identical for most prepositions, the exception being the dative preposition ''i'' (independent ''mi, mu'').

Most prepositions require a following inflected noun to be in the annexed state (EA) (see {{section link| |Use of the annexed state}}). Exceptions are ''ar'' "until", ''s'' "toward" (in some modern dialects, and in premodern texts) and prepositions borrowed from Arabic (not in the table) such as ''bɛd'' "after" and ''qbl'' "before".

The instrumental and allative prepositions ''s'' "by means of" (with EA) and ''s'' "toward" (with EL) were still consistently kept apart in premodern manuscript texts. In most modern dialects they have been amalgamated, with both now requiring the EA, and with the pre-pronominal forms each occurring with both meanings: ''sr-s'' "toward it" (now also "with it"), ''is-s'' "with it" (now also "toward it").

The use of the different forms is illustrated here with the preposition ''ɣ'' "in":
::''iḍr unẓar izwarn '''ɣ''' ukššum n ktubr'' "the first rain fell '''in''' the beginning of October" (with noun)
:: ''ggawrn '''gisnt''' ar ssan lqhwa'' "they sit '''in them''' [i.e., cafés] drinking coffee" (with pronominal suffix)
:: ''urti '''ɣ''' llan lašžar lli stɣllanin ar ittyiswa'' "a garden '''in which''' there are fruit-bearing trees is usually irrigated" (independent)
Two prepositions can be combined:
::''illa yglgiz lli yttzdaɣn '''ɣ ddu''' tsbnit'' "there is a [type of] beetle which lives below the dung" (''ɣ ddu'', lit. "in under")
::''ar ttddan '''s dar''' uḥžžam ɣ Tfrawt'' "they always go to a barber in Tafraout" (''s dar'', lit. "to at")

Spatial relations are also expressed with phrases of the type "on top of":
::''ɣ iggi n umdduz'' "on top of the dung heap"
::''ɣ tama n uɣaras'' "beside the road"
::''ɣ tuẓẓumt n wasif'' "in the midst of the river"
The preposition ''gi(g)-'' "in" with pronominal suffixes, with all its free and dialectal variants,&lt;ref&gt;Gathered from published texts.&lt;/ref&gt; is presented below. The other prepositions display much less variety.

=== Numerals ===
The inherited cardinal numeral system consists of ten numerals (still in active use) and three numeral nouns (now obsolete) for "a tensome", "a hundred" and "a thousand". There is also an indefinite numeral meaning "several, many" or "how many?" which morphologically and syntactically patterns with the numerals 1 to 10. For numbers of 20 and over, Arabic numerals are commonly used.

==== Numerals 1 to 10, indefinite numeral ====
These are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 4.11).&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of feminine "one" and "two" is irregular.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|width="120"| ||width="120"| Masculine ||width="120"| Feminine
|-
| "one" || ya-n|| ya-t
|-
| "two" || sin|| sna-t
|-
| "three" || kraḍ|| kraṭ-ṭ
|-
| "four" || kkuẓ|| kkuẓ-t
|-
| "five" || smmus|| smmus-t
|-
| "six" || sḍis|| sḍis-t
|-
| "seven" || sa|| sa-t
|-
| "eight" || tam, ttam|| tam-t, ttam-t
|-
| "nine" || tẓa, ttẓa|| tẓa-t, ttẓa-t
|-
| "ten" || mraw || mraw-t
|-
| indefinite|| mnnaw || mnnaw-t
|}

The numerals 1 to 10 are constructed with nouns (inflected nouns in the EA), the gender of the numeral agreeing with that of the noun:
::''yan wagʷmar'' "one EA-horse"
::''yat tfunast'' "one EA-cow"
::''sin wagʷmarn'' "two EA-horses"
::''snat tfunasin'' "two EA-cows".&lt;ref&gt;All examples of numerals with horses and cows are extrapolated from attested constructions.&lt;/ref&gt;
The same obtains with the indefinite numeral:
::''mnnaw wagʷmarn'' "several/many EA-horses, how many horses?"
::''mnnawt tfunasin'' "several/many EA-cows, how many cows?"
Numerals ''yan, yat'' "one" also serve as indefinite article, for example ''yan urumiy'' "one Westerner, a Westerner", and they are used independently with the meaning "anyone" (''yan''), "anything" (''yat''):
::''ur iẓri ḥtta yan'' "he didn't see anyone"
::''ur ksuḍɣ yat'' "I'm not afraid of anything"
The final ''n'' of masculine ''yan'' "one" and ''sin'' "two" is often assimilated or fused to a following ''w'', ''y'' or ''l'':
::/yan w-ass/ → ''yaw wass'' "one EA-day"
::/yan w-sggʷas/ → ''ya wsggʷas'' "one EA-year"
::/yan lmakan/ → ''yal lmakan'' "a place"
::/sin y-sggʷas-n/ → ''si ysggʷasn'' "two EA-years"
::/sin y-ir-n/ → ''siy yirn'' "two EA-months"

==== Teens ====
The teens are made by connecting the numerals 1 to 9 to the numeral 10 with the preposition ''d'' "with". In the premodern language, both numerals took the gender of the counted noun, with the following noun in the plural (EA):
::''sin d mraw wagʷmarn'' (two with ten EA-horses) "twelve horses"
::''snat d mrawt tfunasin'' (two with ten EA-cows) "twelve cows"
In the modern language, fused forms have developed in which the first numeral is always masculine,&lt;ref&gt;Examples in Destaing (1920) sub "onze, douze", etc.&lt;/ref&gt; while the following noun is in the singular, and connected with the preposition ''n'' "of":&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 4.15).&lt;/ref&gt;
::''sindmraw n wagʷmar'' (twelve of EA-horse) "twelve horses"
::''sindmrawt n tfunast'' (twelve of EA-cow) "twelve cows"

==== Tens, hundreds, thousands ====
There are three inherited nouns to denote "a tensome", "a hundred" and "a thousand". These now seem to be obsolete, but they are well attested in the premodern manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;See van den Boogert (1997:286–7).&lt;/ref&gt; Morphologically, they are ordinary inflected nouns.

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|width="120"| ||width="240" align="center" colspan="2"| Singular ||width="240" align="center" colspan="2"| Plural
|-
| ||EL || EA ||EL ||EA
|-
| "a tensome" 	|| t-a-mraw-t|| t-mraw-t|| t-i-mraw-in|| t-mraw-in
|-
| "a hundred" 	|| t-i-miḍi|| t-miḍi|| t-i-maḍ|| t-maḍ
|-
| "a thousand" 	|| ifḍ|| y-ifḍ|| afḍa-n|| w-afḍa-n
|}

The tens, hundreds and thousand were formed by combining the numerals 1 to 10 with the numeral nouns:
::''snat tmrawin'' (two EA-tensomes) "twenty"
::''snat tmaḍ'' (two EA-hundreds) "two hundred"
::''sin wafḍan'' (two EA-thousands) "two thousand"
The numeral nouns are connected with the preposition ''n'' "of" to a noun, which is most often in the singular:
::''timiḍi n wagʷmar'' (EL-hundred of EA-horse) "a hundred horses"
::''snat tmaḍ n wagʷmar'' (two EA-hundreds of EA-horse) "two hundred horses"
::''ifḍ n tfunast'' (EL-thousand of EA-cow) "a thousand cows"
::''sin wafḍan n tfunast'' (two EA-thousands of EA-cow) "two thousand cows"
In the modern language the Arabic tens are used, which have developed a separate feminine form:
::''ɛšrin n wagʷmar'' (twenty of EA-horse) "twenty horses"
::''ɛšrint n tfunast'' (twenty of EA-cow) "twenty cows"
The numerals between the tens are most frequently made with the Arabic numerals 1 to 10:
::''xmsa w ɛšrin n wagʷmar'' (five and twenty of EA-horse) "twenty-five horses"
::''xmsa w ɛšrint n tfunast'' (five and twenty of EA-cow) "twenty-five cows"
The Arabic hundreds and thousands are used in the modern language, taking the places of the original numeral nouns while the original syntax is maintained:
::''miya n wagʷmar'' (hundred of EA-horse) "a hundred horses"
::''snat id miya n wagʷmar'' (two PL hundred of EA-horse) "two hundred horses"
::''alf n tfunast'' (thousand of EA-cow) "a thousand cows"
::''sin walfiwn n tfunast'' (two EA-thousands of EA-cow) "two thousand cows"
There is also a vigesimal system built on the Arabic numeral ''ɛšrin'' "twenty, score",&lt;ref&gt;Aspinion (1953:254).&lt;/ref&gt; for example ''sin id ɛšrint n tfunast'' (two PL score of EA-cow) "forty cows".

==== Ordinal numerals ====
"First" and "last" are usually expressed with relative forms of the verbs "be first" and "be last":
::''tawriqqt izwarn'' (page which.is.first) "the first page"
::''ussan ggʷranin'' (days which.are.last) "the last days"
There are also agent nouns derived from these verbs which are apposed to a noun or used independently:
::''aḍrf amzwaru'' (furrow the.first.one) "the first furrow"
::''tuška d tamggarut'' (she.arrived hither the.last.one) "she arrived last"

The other ordinals are formed by prefixing masc. ''wis-'', fem. ''tis-'' to a cardinal numeral,&lt;ref&gt;Galand (1988, 4.18).&lt;/ref&gt; which is then constructed with a plural noun in the usual manner:
::''wis-kraḍ wussan'' (ORD-three EA-days) "the third day"
::''tis-kraṭṭ twal'' (ORD-three EA-times) "the third time"
The ordinal prefixes is also used with Arabic numerals and with the indefinite numeral:
::''wis-xmsa w-ɛšrin n dulqqiɛda'' "the 25th [day] of [the month] Dhū'l-Qaʽda"
::''wis-mnnawt twal'' "the how-manieth time?"

Because four of the numerals 1 to 10 begin with ''s'', the geminated ''ss'' that results from the prefixation of ''wis-, tis-'' (as in ''wissin'', ''wissmmus'', etc.) is often generalized to the other numerals: ''wissin, wisskraḍ, wisskkuẓ'', etc.

=== Verbs ===
A Shilha verb form is basically a combination of a person-number-gender (PNG) affix and a mood-aspect-negation (MAN) stem.

==== Sample verb ====
The workings of this system are illustrated here with the full conjugation of the verb ''fk'' "to give". The Perfective negative goes with the negation ''wr'' "not". The Imperfective goes with the preverbal particle ''ar'' (except usually the imperative, and the relative forms).

|}

The verb "give" has the full complement of four different MAN stems:
::Aorist ''fk(i)'' ― ''fk'' in 1st, 2nd and 3rd singular, 1st plural, and the imperatives, but ''fki'' in 2nd and 3rd plural
::Perfective ''fki/a'' ― ''fki'' in 1st and 2nd singular, but ''fka'' with the other forms
::Perfective negative ''fki'' ― all forms
::Imperfective ''akka'' (an irregular formation) ― all forms

==== Person-number-gender affixes ====
There are two basic sets of PNG affixes, one set marking the subject of ordinary verb forms, and another set marking the subject of imperatives.

Two suffixes (singular ''-n'', plural ''-in'') are added to the 3rd singular and masculine 3rd plural masculine verb forms respectively to make relative forms (also known as "participles"), as in ''i-fka-n'' "who gives", ''fka-n-in'' "who give".&lt;ref&gt;Each relative form is now used for both genders. An obsolete feminine singular relative form ''t-…-t'' is found in some manuscript texts, for example ''tikki t-ɛḍm-t'' (gift which.is.glorious) "a glorious gift" (modern ''tikki y-ɛḍm-n'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mood-aspect-negation stems ====
A few verbs have just one MAN stem. The majority of verbs have two, three or four different MAN stems.&lt;ref&gt;A fifth MAN stem, the Imperfective negative, is sporadically found in manuscript texts (see Van den Boogert 1997:270).&lt;/ref&gt; The Aorist stem serves as the [[Lemma (morphology)|citation form]] of a verb. The list below offers an overview of MAN stem paradigms. Around 15 paradigms of non-derived verbs can be recognized, based on the formation of the Perfective and the Perfective negative. Further subdivisions could be made on the basis of the formations of the Imperfective. All sections in the list contain a selection of verbs, except sections 12, 14, and 15, which contain a full listing.

|}

==== Stative verbs ====
Shilha has around twenty verbs which express basic adjectival meanings. These "stative" verbs are still recognizable as a separate group on the basis of their MAN stem paradigms. In earlier stages of the language, they had their own separate set of PNG markers, which are sporadically found in premodern manuscripts:&lt;ref&gt;See van den Boogert (1997:271–272).&lt;/ref&gt;
::''iḍ ɣzzif'' "the night, it is long" (cf. modern ''iḍ i-ɣzzif'')
::''rẓag-t isafarn'' "medicines are bitter" (cf. modern ''rẓag-n isafarn'')
In the modern language, these verbs take the regular PNG markers. Only the original singular relative form without prefix ''y-'' may still be encountered, for example ''adrar mqqur-n'' or ''adrar i-mqqur-n'' (mountain which.is.big) "big mountain". Stative verbs do not have a separate Perfective negative form. The table shows a selection of stative verbs.

|}

====Verbal deictic clitics====
There are two deictic clitics which are used with verbs to indicate movement toward or away from the point of reference: centripetal ''d'' "hither" and centrifugal ''nn'' "thither":

::''ur issin man ass '''d''' wrrin'' "he knew not on which day they would return (toward him)"
::''nɣiɣ awn babatun luḥɣ '''nn''' ixf nns ɣ wanu'' "I killed your father and threw his head (away from me) into a waterhole"

The use of these clitics is compulsory (idiomatic) with certain verbs. For example, the verb "come" always goes with the centripetal particle, and "find" with the centrifugal clitic:

::''yuška '''d''' darsn yan urqqas zɣ Ɛli Umḥawš'' "a messenger came to their place from Ali Oumhaouch"
::''iggʷz s wanu yaf '''nn''' ixf n izimmr'' "he descended into the waterhole and found the head of a ram"

When the verbal deictic clitics occur after an object pronoun, they change to ''id'' and ''inn'':
::''iga tn '''id''' ɣ yan uqqrab'' "he put them in a pouch"
::''ar tn '''inn''' nttgga ɣ txuba'' "we always put them in jars"

=== Possession ===
==== Within a noun phrase ====
A possessive construction within a noun phrase is most frequently expressed as Possessee ''n'' Possessor. The preposition ''n'' "of" requires a following inflected noun to be in the annexed state. This kind of possessive construction covers a wide range of relationships, including both alienable and inalienable possession, and most of them not involving actual ownership:
::''anu n Dawd'' "Daoud's waterhole"
::''imi n tsraft'' "the entrance of the grain silo"
::''tarwa n Brahim'' "Brahim's children"
::''igʷdar n idqqi'' "pots of clay"
::''imikk n tisnt'' "a little salt"
::''atig n usngar'' "the price of maize"
::''tiɣʷrdin n imkli'' "after lunch"
::''lmdint n Ssnbul'' "the city of Istanbul"
::''aɣllay n tafukt'' "the rising of the sun"
::''aɣaras n sskʷila'' "the road to school"
::''ddin n Wudayn'' "the religion of the Jews"
::''lqqiṣt n Yusf'' "the story of Joseph"
Many such possessive constructions are compounds, whose meaning cannot be deduced from the ordinary meaning of the nouns:
::''aɣaras n walim'' "road of straw: the Milky Way"
::''imi n wuššn'' "mouth of jackal: a length measure (the distance between the outstretched tips of thumb and little finger)"
::''talat n tilkin'' "ravine of lice: nape, back of the neck"
::''tassmi n ifrgan'' "needle of hedges: type of bird"
The possessor can itself be a possessee in a following possessive construction:
::''lmudda n tgldit n Mulay Lḥasan'' "the period of the reign of Moulay Lahcen"
::''luqt n warraw n wulli'' "the time of the giving birth of the sheep and goats"
As a rule, the preposition ''n'' assimilates to, or fuses with, a following ''w'', ''y'', ''l'' or ''m'':&lt;ref&gt;For the sake of transparency, the preposition "of" is consistently transcribed as ''n'' in the examples in this article. Unassimilated realizations occur in deliberate speech.&lt;/ref&gt;
::/awal n w-aɛrab-n/ → ''awal w waɛrabn'' "the language of the Arabs"
::/a-ḍbib n y-isa-n/ → ''aḍbib y yisan'' "horse-doctor"
::/luq-t n w-nẓar/ → ''luqt unẓar'' "the season of rain"
::/a-gllid n y-muslm-n/ → ''agllid imuslmn'' "the king of the Muslims"
::/a-sngar n miṣr/ → ''asngar m Miṣr'' "maize of Egypt"

The possessor can also be expressed with a pronominal possessive complement. This consists of a pronominal suffix added to the preposition, which then takes the shape ''nn-'' (see {{section link| |Pronouns}}). The form of the 1st singular possessive complement is anomalous: ''nw'' after a vowel, and ''inw'' after a consonant (or, in some dialects, ''niw''):
::''agayyu nu'' "my head"
::''ifassn inu'' "my hands"
::''aḍar niw'' "my leg"
::''aqqrab nnk'' "your (sg.m.) pouch"
::''lumur nnm'' "your (sg.f.) affairs"
::''timlsa nns'' "her clothes"
::''rriy nns'' "his opinion"
::''aḍu nns'' "its smell"
::''adžarn nnɣ'' "our neighbours"
::''tawwuri nnun'' "your (pl.m.) occupation"
::''timddukkal nnunt'' "your (pl.f.) friends"
::''lmɛišt nnsn'' "their (m.) livelihood"
::''tikʷyaḍ nnsnt'' "their (f.) locks of hair"

==== Within a clause ====
There are two ways to express possession within a clause. The most common way is to use the "exist with" construction:
::''tlla dars yat txsayt'' (she.exists with.him one EA-pumpkin) "he has a pumpkin"
::''ur dari ylli wmya ma nn lssaɣ'' (not with.me it.exists EA-anything what thither I.wear) "I've got nothing to wear"
The verb "exist" is usually omitted, leaving a verbless clause:
::''darnɣ argan ar inkkr ɣ tagant'' (with.us EL-argan it.is.growing in EA-forest) "we have an argan tree growing in the forest"
::''is ur dark kra yaḍnin?'' (question not with.you something other) "don't you have something different?"
Alternatively, the verb ''ṭṭf, ṭṭaf'' "hold, possess" can be used:
::''iṭṭaf yan uɣyul immuddu srs'' (he.possesses one EA-donkey he.travels with.it) "he has a donkey which he travels with"
::''nkki wr ṭṭifɣ luraqq inu'' (I not I.possess papers of.me) "[as for] me, I haven't got my papers"
In addition, there is the verb ''ili'' "possess", whose use is restricted to (inalienable) part-hole relationships and kinship relationships:
::''liɣ alln ɛdlnin'' (I.possess EL-eyes which.are.good) "I have good eyes"
::''lan sḍis tarwa'' (they.possess six EA-children) "they have six children"
In al its usages ''ili'' can be replaced with ''ṭṭaf'' or the "exist with" construction, but not the other way around:
::''azrg ila yan uskti'', or ''azrg iṭṭaf yan uskti'' (EL-hand-mill it.possesses one EL-handle) "a hand-mill has one handle"
::''ṭṭafɣ snat tgʷmma'', not *''liɣ snat tgʷmma'' (I.possess two EA-houses) "I have two houses"

==== Possessed nouns ====
These are a subtype of uninflected nouns. As with proper names, gender is not transparently marked on possessed nouns, which take gender agreement according to the natural sex of the referent. Plurals are either suppletive or made with the preposed pluralizer ''id''. Most possessed nouns are consanguinal kinship terms which require a possessive suffix (the table contains a selection).

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
|width="350"| ||width="120"| Singular ||width="120"| Plural || Remarks
|-
| "the mother(s) of"	|| ma-	|| id ma- ||
|-
| "the father(s) of"	|| baba-	|| id baba-	||
|-
| "the daughter(s) of"	|| ylli-	|| ysti-	||
|-
| "the son(s) of"	|| yiw-, yu-, ywi-	|| (t-arwa)	|| the plural is a pl.m. inflected noun "sons, offspring"
|-
| "the sister(s) of"	|| wlt-ma-	|| yst-ma-	|| compound, lit. "the daughter(s) of the mother of"
|-
| "the brother(s) of"	|| gʷ-ma-	|| ayt-ma-	|| compound, lit. "the son(s) of the mother of"
|-
| "grandmother: the mother of the mother of"	|| ždda-	|| 	|| Arabic loan
|-
| "grandfather: the father of the mother of"	|| ti-ma-	|| 	|| compound
|-
| "grandmother: the mother of the father of"	|| tabt-ti-	|| 	|| compound
|-
| "grandfather: the father of the father of"	|| žddi-	|| 	|| Arabic loan
|}

These kinship terms cannot occur without pronominal suffix. Example:

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
|width="120"|ultma-Ø|| width="200"|"my sister"
|-
|ultma-k || "your (sg.m.) sister"
|-
|ultma-m || "your (sg.f.) sister"
|-
|ultma-s || "her sister, his sister"
|-
|istma-t-nɣ || "our sisters"
|-
|istma-t-un || "your (pl.m.) sisters"
|-
|istma-t-unt || "your (pl.f.) sisters"
|-
|istma-t-sn || "their (m.) sisters"
|-
|istma-t-snt || "their (f.) sisters"
|}

If these nouns are part of an NP-internal possessive construction, possession must be indicated twice:
::''baba-s n tslit'' (father-her of EA-bride) "the father of the bride"
::''yiwi-s n gʷma-Ø'' (son-his of brother-my) "my brother's son"
::''illi-s n wasif'' (daughter-its of EA-river) "the daughter of the river: fever" (compound)
The suffix must also added when possession is expressed in a clause:
::''ur iṭṭif abla yat ultma-s'' (not he.possesses except one sister.his) "he only has one sister"
Some kinship terms are not possessed nouns but inflected nouns which take possessive complements (see examples above).

Another group of possessed nouns require a following noun phrase, occurring only in an NP-internal possessive phrase. A following inflected noun must be in the EA.

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
|width="220"| ||width="95"| Singular ||width="95"| Plural
|-
| "the son(s) of, native(s) of"	|| w	|| ayt
|-
| "the female native(s) of"	|| wlt	|| yst
|}

These four possessed nouns occur as first element in compound kinship terms (see above; ''w'' then becomes ''gʷ'' in ''gʷ-ma-'' "the brother of"). They also serve to indicate descent, origin and ethnicity:
::''Ḥmad u Musa'' "Ahmed son of Moussa" (name of a famous saint)&lt;ref&gt;The possessed noun ''wlt'', the feminine counterpart of ''w'', is not used in genealogies; thus, Fadma the daughter of Moussa is ''Faḍma Musa'', not *''Faḍma wlt Musa'' (cf. Aspinion 1953:30).&lt;/ref&gt;
::''u Brayyim'' "member of the Aït Brayyim ethnic group"
::''u bṛṛa'' "native of outside: a foreigner"
::''u Trudant'' "a native of Taroudant"
::''ayt Ugrsif'' "the natives of Aguercif"
::''ult Uglu'' "native woman of Aglou"
::''ist Tfrawt'' "the women of Tafraout"
When ''w'' is followed by another (phonemic) ''w'' the result is ''ggʷ'':
::/w wižžan/ → ''Ggʷižžan'' "native of Ouijjane" (also surname: Gouijjane)
::/a-rgaz w w-rgaz/ → ''argaz ggʷrgaz'' "a man, son of a man: a man of virtue"
''Ayt'' occurs in many Shilha ethnonyms:
::''Ayt Bubkr'' "the Sons of Boubker" (Aït Boubker), singular ''U Bubkr''
::''Ayt Wafqqa'' "the Sons of Ouafka" (Aït Ouafka), singular /w wafqqa/ → ''Ggʷafqqa''

==== Proprietive and privative elements ====
The proprietive elements masc. ''bu'' "he with, he of" and fem. ''mm'' "she with, she of" are borrowed from Arabic (original meaning "father of", "mother of"). They are used as versatile formative elements to make nicknames, and require a following inflected noun to be in the annexed state. The plural is formed with the pluralizer ''id'':
::''bu sa yiwaliwn'' (he of seven EA-words) "a liar"
::''bu tagant'' (he of EA-forest) "wild boar"
::''bu tbratin'' (he with EA-letters) "postman"
::''id bu waga'' (PL he with EA-bucket) "French colonial soldiers (wearing a ''[[kepi|képi]]'')"
In many cases, ''bu'' fuses with a following nominal prefix:
::/bu w-marg/ (he with EA-poetry) → ''bumarg'' "a poet"
::/bu y-gʷra/ (he with EA-frogs) → ''Bigʷra'' "Biougra" (place-name)
The feminine ''mm'' is encountered less frequently:
::''mm igrtal'' (she with EA-mats) "prayer room in a mosque"
::''id mm ifalan'' (PL she with EA-threads) "needles"

The privative elements masc. ''war'' "he without" and fem. ''tar'' "she without" are made up of a gender prefix (masculine ''w-'', feminine ''t-'') and an element ''ar'' which is probably related to the negation ''wr'' "not". They do not require the annexed state, and should probably be translated as "who does not have", with the following noun phrase as object:
::''war ašrik'' (he without EL-partner) "God"
::''id war tawwuri'' (PL he without EL-job) "the unemployed"
::''tar azal'' (she without EL-daylight) "wide-brimmed hat"
::''tar laman'' (she without certainty) "the world, worldly existence"

== Lexicon ==
Shilha retains a large native (non-borrowed) lexicon, supplemented by borrowings from the languages with which its speakers came into contact.

=== Sources ===
The main available lexicographical sources for the modern language are: Stumme 1899 (contains Shilha–German wordlist, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–246) ; Destaing 1920 (French–Shilha); Cid Kaoui 1907 (French-Shilha, not entirely reliable); Jordan 1934 (Shilha–French, extracted from Laoust 1921); Destaing 1940 (a collection of texts with copious lexicographical notes and a Shilha index); Ibáñez 1954 (Spanish–Shilha); Boumalk and Bounfour 2001 (Shilha-French). An indigenous source for the premodern language is in van den Boogert (1998). These sources will be made accessible, with much additional data, in Stroomer's ''Dictionnaire tachelhit–français'' (forthcoming). No reliable wordlist in Shilha and English is available in print.&lt;ref&gt;The wordlist in Applegate (1958: 45–71) is useless because of its generally unreliable transcriptions.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loan-words ===
The earliest identifiable loan is ''tiyni'' "dates" (cf. [[Tamasheq]] ''tehäyne'', [[Ghadamès language|Ghadamès]] ''aβēna''), from [[Egyptian language|Egyptian-Coptic]] (cf. Coptic ''bnne, beni, benni'' "date palm-tree; dates"&lt;ref&gt;Crum, W.E. (1939). ''A Coptic Dictionary''. Oxford: Clarendon, p. 40b; Coptic ⟨b⟩ represented /β/ or /v/.&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Phoenician language|Phoenician-Punic]], a Northwest-Semitic language, was spoken in parts of North Africa, especially in what is now Tunisia, up to the 5th century CE. Punic loans are found in several Berber languages, among them Shilha. Examples (etymons are cited from Hebrew, another Northwest-Semitic language which is closely related to Phoenician-Punic, but much better attested):
::''agadir'' "fortress" (cf. Hebrew ''gādēr'' "wall")
::''aẓalim'' "onions" (cf. Hebrew ''b&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;ṣālîm'')
::''aɣanim'' "reeds" (cf. Hebrew ''qānîm'')
::''tifst'' "flax, linen" (premodern Shilha, cf. Hebrew ''pišt-'')
The verb ''lmd'' "to learn" is probably also a Punic loan (cf. Hebrew ''lāmad'').

The noun ''uday'' "Jew" probably came to the Berber languages from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] language spoken by early Jewish immigrants in North Africa (cf. Aramaic-Syriac ''yūdāy-ā'' vs. Hebrew ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hûdî'', Arabic ''yahūdī''; the Aramaic noun is also the source of Greek ''ἰουδαῖος'', Latin ''iūdaeus'').

It has been noted&lt;ref&gt;Van den Boogert (1997:221).&lt;/ref&gt; that the numerals 5 to 9 seem to be [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] loans. The corresponding numerals in Phoenician-Punic and in Arabic, the historically most likely origin, do not seem to be the source. A comparison:

A variety of [[Romance language|Latin/Romance]] was spoken in parts of northern Morocco right up to the advent of Islam. Loans from Latin and early Romance include:
::''afullus'' "cock, rooster" (Latin ''pullus'' "young animal, chick")
::''afurnu'' "oven" (cf. Latin ''fornus'')
::''asnus'' "ass's foal" (Latin ''asinus'' "ass")
::''fliyyu'' "pennyroyal" (plant, cf. Latin ''pulēium'')
::''ikikr'' "chickpeas" (Latin ''cicer'')
::''tafala'' "peel, spade" (Latin ''pāla'')
::''talima'' "file" (Latin ''līma'')
::''tayuga'' "yoke, pair" (early Romance singular *''iuga'', cf. Latin plural ''iuga'', singular ''iugum'' "yoke")
::''urti'' "garden" (early Romance, cf. Latin ''hortus'')
::''taɣawsa'' "thing" (Latin ''causa'')
::''takira'' "wax" (Latin ''cēra'')
::''tibitas'' "beets" (early Romance ''betas'', cf. Latin singular ''bēta'')
::''tifiras'' "pears" (early Romance *''piras'', cf. Latin plural ''pira'', singular ''pirum'')
Later Romance loans can be distinguished by the fact that original ''s'' becomes ''š'' instead of ''s'' as in the earlier loans. Presumably, the later loans originated from [[Ibero-Romance languages|Ibero-Romance]], with which Berber speakers came into contact in [[al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain). Examples include:
::''acaqqur'' "axe" (cf. premodern Spanish ''segur'', Latin ''securis'')
::''cemrir'' "hat" (cf. Spanish ''sombrero'')
::''acenti'' "rye" (cf. Spanish ''centeno''; in medieval Shilha ''šəntin'', a form which naturally developed into a feminine plural ''ticentin'', from which masculine singular ''ašnti'' was back-formed).
Another probable loan from a Romance language is ''tabaɣa'' "tobacco".&lt;ref&gt;The etymon of ''tabaɣa'' seems to be ''tabaca'' rather than ''tabaco''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also borrowed from Romance are the names of the months of the Julian [[Berber calendar|calendar]]:&lt;ref&gt;Original Berber (Shilha) names of the month are attested in manuscripts, see van den Boogert (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]] nouns borrowed since the colonial era came via Arabic, as shown by the presence of the Arabic definite article:
::''lficta'' "feast" (Spanish ''fiesta'')
::''sskʷila'' "school" (Spanish ''escuela'')
::''lbakit'' "package" (French ''paquet'')
::''ṭṭumubil'' "car" (French ''automobile'')
The noun ''atay'' [atæj] "tea" is a unique loan, from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''thee'' [tej].&lt;ref&gt;Tea was introduced into Morocco by Dutch and English traders through the international port of Agadir at the end of the 18th century (Bellakhdar 1997:230).&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the most numerous group of loans is from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. As with most languages spoken in the Islamic cultural sphere, Shilha has adopted many hundreds of words from Arabic, which now permeat the entire lexicon (except body parts and other basic vocabulary). Loans include verbs and nouns as well as numerals, prepositions, conjunctions and adverbs. Borrowed verbs are completely absorbed into the Shilha verbal system. Many of the borrowed nouns were not incorporated into the nominal morphological system, thus constituting a subgroup of their own (see above, {{section link| |Unincorporated nouns}}).

Although some nouns denoting typically Islamic concepts such as ''timzgida'' "mosque", ''taẓallit'' "ritual prayer", ''uẓum'' "fasting", which certainly belong to the very oldest layer of Arabic loans,&lt;ref&gt;Van den Boogert and Kossmann (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; are incorporated into Shilha morphology, but that many equally central Islamic concepts are expressed with unincorporated nouns (for example ''lislam'' "Islam", ''lḥajj'' "pilgrimage to Mecca", ''zzka'' "alms tax" ). It is possible that during the early stages of islamization such concepts were expressed with native vocabulary or with earlier, non-Arabic loans. One such term which has survived into the modern era is ''tafaska'' "ewe for slaughter on the (Islamic) [[Eid al-Adha|Feast of Immolation]]",&lt;ref&gt;The Feast of Immolation itself is known in Shilha as ''lɛid n tfaska'' "the feast of the sacrificial ewe".&lt;/ref&gt; from ''pascha'',&lt;ref&gt;Pronounced in classical times as [pask&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;a] or [paska].&lt;/ref&gt; the Latinized name of the Jewish festival of [[Passover]] (''Pesaḥ'') or, more specifically, of the [[Passover sacrifice|paschal lamb]] (''qorbān Pesaḥ'') which is sacrificed during the festival. Another example is ''ibkkaḍan'' "sins", obsolete in the modern language, but attested in a premodern manuscript text,&lt;ref&gt;Aẓnag (late 16th century), ''Lɛqayd n ddin'', in the phrase ''ingaẓn n tarwa…da ssiridn ibkkaḍan'' "the pains of childbirth are washing away the sins".&lt;/ref&gt; whose singular ''abkkaḍu'' is borrowed from Romance (cf. Spanish ''pecado'', Latin ''peccātum''; modern Shilha uses ''ddnub'' "sins", from Arabic).

== Secret languages ==
Destaing&lt;ref&gt;Destaing (1920:21).&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a secret language (''argot'') called ''inman'' or ''tadubirt'' which is spoken by "some people of Sous, in particular the descendants of Sidi Ḥmad u Musa." He quotes an example: ''is kn tusat inman?'' "do you speak the secret language?"

Two secret languages used by Shilha women are described by Lahrouchi and Ségéral (2009). They are called ''tagnawt'' (cf. Shilha ''agnaw'' "deaf-mute person") and ''taɛžmiyt'' (cf. Moroccan Arabic ''ɛəžmiya'' "foreign language") or ''taqqžmiyt''. They employ various processes, such as reduplication, to disguise the ordinary language.

After the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|May 12, 2008, earthquake]] in the Chinese province of [[Sichuan]], there was '''a series of allegations of corruption against officials involved in the construction of schools''' in regions affected by the quake. It gained momentum in May and June 2008, and the allegations culminated in protests from grieving parents of children who died in the earthquake as a result of the collapse of various schools in the quake zone.

The scandal eventually became a focal point of reporting on the earthquake rescue efforts, with Chinese civil engineers, bloggers, activists, and foreign media bringing attention to the allegations. Various discussions reports alleged that local government officials and construction companies were negligent in the construction of schools, and that they ignored civil engineering standards, saved materials and took shortcuts while pocketing the difference.

Despite initial openness to independent reporting and foreign media, the Chinese government attempted to downplay the issue and suppress criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/03/chinaearthquake.china?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront "Police break up protest by parents of China earthquake victims"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, local government attempted to entice grieving parents into monetary compensation in exchange for their silence. While Chinese authorities were initially praised by international media for its rapid and effective response to the earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=China's Management Revolution: Spirit, Land, Energy|first=Charles-Edouard|last=Bouée|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13754101|title=Silence on the Square|date=2009-05-28|accessdate=2012-02-24|publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ten-Year Century: Explaining the First Decade of the New Millennium|first=James|last=Sutherland|year=2010|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school construction scandal severely undermined the initial positive reactions, particularly among Western media. Postings about the scandal flooded Chinese online portals and discussion boards, and popularized the phrase "[[Tofu-dreg projects|tofu-dreg schoolhouses]]" (Chinese:豆腐渣校舍). The internet activism resulted in a pledge by the federal government to conduct investigations into the allegations, but it was ostensibly not followed up with any substantial action.

Over 7,000 schoolrooms collapsed in the course of the earthquake, mostly in rural areas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7400524.stm "China anger over 'shoddy schools' "], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', May 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; reportedly leading to the death of nearly 5,000 students (though some parents believe the real figure is twice that officially cited&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;) and the injury of over 15,000 students.&lt;ref name="gm" /&gt; The total death toll of the quake was around 70,000 people, with some 375,000 injuries. A month after the quake, nearly 20,000 people remained missing, while five million were rendered homeless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gBr_dOzJ9Pnc_U9gSgtTgE-cR-KwD918N6TO7 "Parents of China quake victims express anger"], ''[[Associated Press]]'' via ''[[Google]]'', June 12, 2008{{dead link|date=October 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disproportionate number of school collapses led to open discussions that they were not built to adequate standards. The grieving parents and critical journalists pointed out that "hundreds of schools collapsed instantly — even newly constructed ones — while older buildings nearby were often unscathed."&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080616.CHINA16/TPStory/TPInternational/Asia/ "Beijing can't muzzle outrage over deadly collapsed schools"]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, has led to allegations of corruption on the part of [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Education Ministry]] officials and contractors who were said to be complicit in constructing the school buildings dangerously below government-mandated standards, while pocketing the remaining surplus.&lt;ref name="gm" /&gt; On May 26, Wang Xuming, a spokesman for the Education Ministry, stated that the ministry would complete a reassessment of school buildings in quake zones and that those who had cut corners on school construction would be “severely punished.”&lt;ref&gt;“China reiterates severe punishment for companies producing substandard building materials,” Xinhua, May 29, 2008, http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/29/content_8279397.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Some parents protested what they argued, one month after the event, amounts to government inaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/world/parents-in-uprising-in-china-quake-town-20080613-2px8.html "Parents in uprising in China quake town"], ''[[Associated Press]]'' via ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', June 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and opinions==

===Factors in building collapse===
The earthquake has caused collapse of more than 6.5 million buildings and damaged some 23 million more.  Four factors determine the damage to a particular building, according to geologist Liu Jie ({{zh|s=刘杰}}), Director of Earthquake Prediction Department of (China's) Center for Seismic Monitoring Station Network under the [[China Earthquake Administration]] ('''CEA'''), who arrived in quake zone the same day of the main quake.  Besides the quake's magnitude and intensity in the area, the location of the building played an important role. In some towns that Liu surveyed, all buildings sitting on the earthquake fault line collapsed, while buildings tens of meters away did not. Building structure was also a factor. Buildings with larger spans tend to collapse more easily. The fourth factor was the quality of the building. If a building's designed fortification intensity is above the quake's intensity at the location, the collapse of a building can be definitively attributed to its engineering quality, Liu explained. On the other hand, if the quake's intensity exceeds the designated code, it would be hard to determine whether the earthquake engineering quality is the deciding factor of its collapse.&lt;ref name="damage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Experts explain Great Wenchuan Earthquake (权威详解汶川大地震)|publisher=Sichuan Earthquake Administration (SCEA, 四川地震局)|url=http://www.eqsc.gov.cn/manage/html/ff808181126bebda01126bec4dd00001/_content/08_08/05/1217907519725.html|accessdate=2008-08-05|language=Chinese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910002400/http://www.eqsc.gov.cn/manage/html/ff808181126bebda01126bec4dd00001/_content/08_08/05/1217907519725.html|archivedate=September 10, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modes of building collapse===
Despite these factors, some Chinese civil engineers expressed a different view and joined the public in criticizing the initial official attribution of school collapses.  According to ''[[Caijing]]'', "earthquake intensity exceeding the designed resistance does not mean that buildings built to quality specifications will definitely collapse.  Even if they collapse, there are different ways by which they collapse and variation within building design. Such collapses should not necessarily lead to heavy human casualties."&lt;ref name="Poor quality"&gt;{{ cite news| url=http://www.caijing.com.cn/2008-06-03/100067212.html| title=Collapse of schools were due to poor quality of buildings (学校倒塌缘于建筑质量过差)| publisher=Finance and Economics (《财经》)| author=Zhang, Yingguang; Chen, Zhongxiaolu, Yang, Binbin (张映光 陈中小路 杨彬彬)| date=2008-06-03| accessdate=2008-09-30| language=Chinese}}{{zh|s=他们指出，地震超过预计强度，并不意味着符合建筑质量标准的建筑物必然倒塌。即使倒塌，由于建筑质量的差异，也有不同的倒塌方式，并不意味着必然造成如此重大的人员伤亡。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GB50223-2004''', the national standard for classification of civil seismic fortification before the earthquake, specified Class B for schools exceeding 600 in capacity, kindergartens and child care centers exceeding 200, meaning they must be built to at least 1 liedu higher than the zoned seismic fortification intensity of the area.  However, it contained a provision to allow low-rise (three stories and lower) schools to be built to meet the area's fortification intensity (Class C).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url=http://www.shuigong.com/papers/jianzhu/20051113/paper4797.shtml|trans-title=Common Class B and Class A buildings |title=常见的乙类、甲类建筑| publisher=Water Resources Engineering Network (水利工程网)| author=LIU, Yongguang (刘永光)| date=2005-10-12| accessdate=2008-09-30| language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The government rushed a revision to the standard after the Wenchuan earthquake.

In perspective, Yingxiu Primary School had a collapsed four-story building built in 1999, where 3/4 of the 473 students were dead,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=http://edu.people.com.cn/GB/1053/7272971.html|trans-title=Principal of Yingxiu Primary School hears cry for help during dreams |title=映秀小学校长梦中听见救命声| publisher=New Capical Newspaper via People.com.cn (人民网转载《新京报》)| date=2008-05-21| accessdate=2008-09-30| language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Xuankou Middle School had several collapsed buildings from 3 to 4 stories built in 2006, where more than 80% of the 1,200+ students stayed alive.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;Both schools are located in the town of [[Yingxiu]], Wenchuan nearly at the epicenter of the main quake.

Following GB50223-2004, Xuankou Middle School should have been built to resist VII + I in seismic intensity.  Beichuan Middle School and Yingxiu Primary School could have passed with fortification intensity of VII liedu had they been built after 2004; but because they were built before the publication of even GB 500011-2001, they could be using older standards or none at all.&lt;ref&gt;Standards cited in this article do not contain provisions about mandatory [[seismic retrofit]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempt to interfere with survey==
In justifying the relatively long time CEA used to produce the intensity diagram of the Wenchuan earthquake, Vice President of [http://www.iaee.or.jp/ International Association for Earthquake Engineering] XIE Lili ({{zh|s=谢礼立}}) who was a member of the survey team indicated that "some (local government) may want to make more serious estimations of earthquake damage, so they could obtain more compensation,"&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=http://www.caijing.com.cn/2008-09-01/110009619.html| title=CEA formally releases intensity diagram of the Wenchuan earthquake (中国地震局正式公布汶川地震烈度分布图)| work=Caijing| author=LI, Jun (李军)| date=2008-09-01| accessdate=2008-09-30| language=Chinese }}{{zh|s=有的受灾地区可能希望将地震破坏程度评估得严重一些，这样可以多争取补助；}}&lt;/ref&gt;
hinting attempts to interfere with the survey.  The same news article quoted ''persons in the know'' who suggested that another motivation for attempted interference would be to boost intensity in order to evade responsibility for not following seismic design codes.  Despite later denial by CEA that the published intensity reflected such interference, MA Zongjin ({{zh|s=马宗晋}}), Chairman of the National Expert Committee for Wenchuan Earthquake who is also the Chairman of the National Expert Committee for Disaster Prevention, openly confirmed that "some local workers wanted to increase (report of) local damages or seismic intensity"&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news| url=http://web.xwwb.com/wb2008/wb2008news.php?db=4&amp;thisid=21623| title=Direct damage of the Great Wenchuan Earthquake amounts to RMB 84.51 trillion (汶川大地震直接损失８４５１亿)| publisher=Noon News | agency=Xinhua| date=2008-09-04| accessdate=2008-09-30| language=Chinese}}{{zh|s=一些地方的工作人员，都希望把地方的灾害损失或者地震烈度提高一下}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppression of dissent==
In July 2008, local governments in the Sichuan Province coordinated a campaign to silence angry parents whose children died during the earthquake through monetary contracts. If the parents refused, officials threatened that they would receive nothing. Although Chinese officials have advocated a policy of openness in time before the Olympic Games, the pressure on parents to sign demonstrates that officials are determined to create an appearance of public harmony rather than investigate into the corruption or negligence of the construction of schools. The payment amounts vary by school but are roughly the same. In Hanwang, parents were offered a package valued at 8,800 USD in cash and a per-parent pension of nearly 5,600 USD. Many parents said they signed the contract, even if no real investigation ensues. Furthermore, officials have continued to use traditional methods of silencing: riot police officers have broken up protests by parents; the authorities have set up cordons around the schools; and officials have ordered the Chinese news media to stop reporting on school collapses.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Edward, "China Presses Hush Money on Grieving Parents," [[New York Times]], July 24, 2008, https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/world/asia/24quake.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2008, Liu Shaokun (刘绍坤), a Sichuan school teacher, was detained for disseminating rumors and destroying social order. Liu’s family was later told that he was being investigated on suspicion of the crime of inciting subversion. Liu, a teacher at Guanghan Middle School (四川省德阳市广汉中学), Deyang City, Sichuan Province, traveled to heavily hit areas after the May 12 Sichuan earthquake, took photos of collapsed school buildings, and put them online. In a media interview, he expressed his anger at “the shoddy ‘tofu’ buildings.” Liu was detained on June 25, 2008 at his school. He was ordered to serve one year of [[re-education through labor]]. Under RTL regulations, public security authorities may issue an order to anyone to serve up to four years of RTL without trial or formal charge. After being denied several visits, the family turned to international human rights organizations, who reported the case and urged the government to release him, which drew attention in the international community. On September 26, 2008, Liu was finally released to serve his sentence outside of RTL.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights in China, "Press Release: Family Visits Still Denied to Sichuan School Teacher Punished after Quake-Zone Visit," July 29, 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/66524 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109000918/http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/66524 |archivedate=2009-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Dissident who criticised quake response detained." http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/18/1&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially tolerating independent reporting, China's security forces have begun to clamp down on dissent and public complaints.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt; According to [[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights In China]], sources inside China said that on the evening of June 10, 2008, Huang Qi, Pu Fei, a volunteer for Tianwang, and Zuo Xiaohuan, a former teacher at Leshan Teachers College were missing after they were forced into a car by unidentified individuals.&lt;ref name="hrichina.org" /&gt; In the afternoon of June 12, 2008, Lawyer Xu, Tianwang's legal counsel, went to the Jinyang Police Station of Chengdu to file a missing persons report.&lt;ref name="hrichina.org" /&gt; The police reportedly told Xu that Huang Qi has been detained, and that the related legal procedure notice would be sent to his family but refused to disclose the grounds for Huang's detention. Huang Qi's 74-year-old mother, Pu Wenqing, said that the family had not received any notice from the police over the past few days.&lt;ref name="hrichina.org" /&gt;

'''Social photography''' is a subcategory of [[photography]] focusing upon the technology, interaction and activities of individuals who take photographs. [[Digital cameras]], [[Image hosting service|photo sharing websites]] and the [[Internet]] have enabled new tools and methods of [[social networking]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.epicedits.com/2008/01/21/writing-project-social-photography/ Writing Project - Social Photography], January 21, 2008, last accessed May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; while consumer trends such as [[Flashpacking#Flashpacking|flashpacking]] and [[adventure travel]] have led to a worldwide increase in socially connected photographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Flashpacker: A New Breed of Traveler | date=2006-03-24 | publisher= | url =http://www.breakingtravelnews.com/article/20060324134038880 | work =Hotel Travel News | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of easy-to-use [[open source]] [[blogging]] methods, inexpensively-priced equipment and [[content management system]] applications has led to an increase in photography for [[social change]]&lt;ref&gt;"Social Change Photography", [http://www.fiftycrows.org/ FiftyCrows.org], last accessed May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and amateur photojournalism.&lt;ref&gt;"Wireless Digital Camera Guide", [http://www.photographyreview.com/wirelesscameracrx.aspx PhotographyReview.com],  last accessed May 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Expand upon Geotagging, auto-geotagging, online mapping --&gt;
Some extensions of social photography include [[geotagging]] and [[online mapping]], while online social networking destinations like [[Facebook]] have led to an increase in the popularity of technology employing the real-time transfer of images.  Where Facebook allows for users to instantly upload a picture from their mobile phone to their profile, there have recently been a number of services sprouting up that allows users to create real time photo streams. 

A [[wireless digital camera]] enables photographers to connect to cellular networks or other [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]] to share photos, print wirelessly and save photos directly to an image hosting website.&lt;ref&gt;"The professionals, the media and the people", [http://thedemocraticimage.opendemocracy.net/category/hughes-leglise/ The Democratic Image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719140633/http://thedemocraticimage.opendemocracy.net/category/hughes-leglise/ |date=2008-07-19 }},  Hughes Leglise, April 21st, 2007, last accessed May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Geographic areas serviced by outdoor [[WiFi]] networks permit extended applications for [[geocaching]] which can include the use of [[GPS|Global Positioning Systems]] and [[smartphones]].

Some news networks and online broadcasters encourage viewers to send in photographs of live, breaking and current events, enabling citizen journalists and amateur photographers to participate in the news gathering process.

Some business companies started to look for individuals who can take images opposed to [[Stock photography|stock-photos]] that would help evolve their brand and this is typically done through social photography. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.markedperception.com/the-importance-of-great-photography-in-social-media/|title=The importance of great photography in social media|work=Advertising, Marketing and Design Agency In Leeds|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15483">'''Stephen Symonds Foster''' (November 17, 1809 – September 13, 1881) was a radical American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] known for his dramatic and aggressive style of public speaking, and for his stance against those in the church who failed to fight slavery. His marriage to [[Abby Kelley Foster|Abby Kelley]] brought his energetic activism to bear on [[women's rights]]. He spoke out for [[Temperance movement|temperance]], and agitated against any government, including his own, that would condone slavery.

Foster helped establish the New Hampshire Anti-Slavery Society, and belonged to the 'New Hampshire radicals' group within the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]. Foster wrote anti-slavery tracts and published in 1843 a widely discussed book that met with protest and critical response: ''The Brotherhood of Thieves; or A True Picture of the American Church and Clergy: A Letter to Nathaniel Barney, of Nantucket.'' At [[Liberty Farm]] where they lived, Foster and his wife formed a link on the [[Underground Railroad]], and helped fugitive slaves gain their freedom.

{{TOClimit|limit=2}}

==Early life==
Foster was born in [[Canterbury, New Hampshire]] on November 17, 1809. His parents Sarah and Asa Foster had twelve children, Stephen was the ninth. The family attended the local [[Congregational church]], and took part in Canterbury's anti-slavery society.&lt;ref name=Sterling130&gt;Sterling, 1991, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster apprenticed to a carpenter but left at age 22 to study to become a [[missionary]]. He went to [[Dartmouth College]] where his brother Asa had graduated and studied the classics, including Greek and Latin. Foster embraced abolitionism at this time, and in his third year invited [[Angelina Grimké]] to speak to the Young Men's Anti-Slavery Society.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, 1991, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; During his senior year, Foster was arrested and put in prison for not paying a debt of $12.14 to a local clockmaker; Foster was shocked to find that debtors were locked up with violent criminals and thieves, in common cells swarming with rats, lice and fleas. From prison, Foster wrote a letter of protest which was published in a local paper. His friends raised bail after two weeks, but Foster's letter aroused indignation among citizens who later cleaned out the jail and then passed a law which banned imprisonment for debt.&lt;ref name=Sterling131&gt;Sterling, 1991, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Foster redoubled his efforts in school, especially his rhetoric and public speaking courses, and graduated in 1838 third in his class.&lt;ref name=Sterling130/&gt;

Foster subsequently enrolled at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York City. There, he was forbidden by faculty to host an anti-slavery meeting he had scheduled. He was offered a scholarship if he would quit speaking of abolition, but Foster rejected this, saying he "could not be bought to hold his peace."&lt;ref name=Sterling131/&gt; In the spring of 1839, he left New York to take a position as traveling lecturer for the New Hampshire Anti-Slavery Society.&lt;ref name=Sterling131/&gt;

==Abolition==
Foster was known to interrupt church services to denounce organized religion's complicity in slavery. In 1841, he was expelled from his Congregationalist church in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].

In [[Portland, Maine]] in 1842, Foster was wounded in a riot outside a meetinghouse. Pro-slavery supporters wished to prevent Foster and the radical abolitionist John Murray Spear from speaking. When the mob attacked, Foster took twenty blows to the head and had his coat torn in half. He was pulled from the crowd by women of the Portland Anti-Slavery Society who helped him escape through a back window. Spear was beaten nearly to death on the front steps of the meeting house. Local abolitionists took the men in and tended to their recuperation.&lt;ref&gt;The First Parish in Portland, Maine; Unitarian Universalist. History, page 3. [http://www.firstparishportland.org/history3.html ''Anti-Slavery.''] Retrieved on April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, he wrote the book ''The Brotherhood of Thieves; or A True Picture of the American Church and Clergy: A Letter to Nathaniel Barney, of Nantucket'' and in 1844 Foster's fellow abolitionist [[Parker Pillsbury]] published it through the Boston Anti-Slavery Office. The book went through twenty editions.

In 1844, Foster appeared in front of the New England Antislavery Convention holding an iron collar in one hand and iron [[manacles]] in the other. He said "Behold here a specimen of the religion of this land, the handiwork of the American church and clergy."&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, 2007, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster was called a "[[come-outer]]",&lt;ref&gt;McKivigan, John R. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMsg4ByOaY8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA153&amp;lpg=RA1-PA153 ''Abolitionism and American Religion,'' p. 153.] Retrieved on April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase which denoted a person who dissented from religious orthodoxy. More specifically, it meant that Foster would not join a church which held a neutral position on the issue of slavery, and he would not take part in a government that let slavery happen. The phrase was derived from the Bible verse, II Corinthians 6:17 which read "Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, said the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you."&lt;ref&gt;Von Frank, Albert J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj7f249hSwsC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338 ''The trials of Anthony Burns,'' p. 338.] Retrieved on April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the eclectic Free Convention in [[Rutland (town), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]] in June 1858, Foster spoke after Pillsbury to say "any law, constitution, court, or government, any church, priesthood, creed, or Bible, any Christ, or any God, that, by silence or otherwise, authorizes man to enslave man, merits the scorn and contempt of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;Vermont History Journal.

Retrieved on April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and fatherhood==
In 1845, after a four-year courtship, Foster married [[Abby Kelley Foster|Abby Kelley]], a more famous social activist and a dynamic speaker who had occasionally joined with him on the abolitionist lecture circuit. They continued to travel and lecture together until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] started in 1861. In early 1847, anticipating a family, the two bought a farm in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] and called it [[Liberty Farm]]; there they lived until Foster's death in 1881. The Fosters used the farm to shelter escaping slaves on the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref name=nps&gt;National Park Service. [http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/pwwmh/ma42.htm  Liberty Farm]. Retrieved on April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1847, Paulina Wright "Alla" Foster was born at Liberty Farm, the only child that the couple would have. To care for the infant, Abby Kelley Foster stayed home at first, helped occasionally by her sister-in-law Caroline Foster. The young girl's parents soon found that they could lecture separately or together as long as Alla was being looked after; more often it was Abby Kelley Foster who left her husband watching the girl. Once when Alla was three, and her mother was out on a speaking tour, Stephen Symonds Foster was asked by Alla to buy her a harmonica and a churn, and Foster responded that he had little money, and could only buy her the necessities. Foster himself was about to leave on a speaking engagement and intended to send the girl to be cared for by her grandparents. Foster anticipated that she would be lonely and might need a toy wagon. Foster wrote to his wife, saying "I got the harmonica &amp; wagon, &amp; received for them a whole wagon load of kisses. She was careful, however, as she always is, to save some "for mother". I am struck with the fact that she always insists on your right to an equal part of every thing which I possess, if she attaches any value to it. One would almost think her specially commissioned to look after your rights, in your absence ... "&lt;ref&gt;Worcester Women's History Project.

==Women's rights==
In May 1850, Abby Kelley Foster went to Boston to take part in an annual [[American Anti-Slavery Society|Anti-Slavery Society]] meeting. Afterward, Abby met with ten others including [[Wendell Phillips]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Harriot Kezia Hunt]], [[Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis]] and [[Lucy Stone]] to help plan for a women's rights convention.&lt;ref&gt;McMillen, 2008, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; They determined that it would be held near Liberty Farm in Worcester. That October, both Foster and his wife were among the featured speakers at the first [[National Women's Rights Convention]]. The two spoke again at the annual convention in Cleveland 1853 and in New York in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, 1881, pp. 140, 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, amid tensions building up between factions of women's rights activists, Foster spoke out at a national meeting of the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA) to accuse [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] of advocating "Educated Suffrage"—the right of upper-class white women to vote. Foster implied strongly that Stanton should step down as president of AERA.&lt;ref name=Buhle258&gt;Buhle, 1978, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Brown Blackwell]] tried to calm the waters by saying that all present, including Stanton and [[Susan B. Anthony]], believed in "negro suffrage".&lt;ref name=Buhle258/&gt; [[Frederick Douglass]] widened the gap when he stood up and stated his position against Stanton's use in her address of the pejorative term [[Sambo (racial term)|'Sambo']].&lt;ref name=Buhle258/&gt; The words of Foster and Douglass served to define a major split which separated women's rights activists into two camps; those like Stanton and Anthony who felt that educated women deserved the right to vote before or at the same time as uneducated men, and those like Stone, Douglass and Foster who felt that the political situation called for a drive to achieve suffrage for the African-American man, followed by a new focus on suffrage for women of all races.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, 1978, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1874, Worcester city officials put Liberty Farm up for auction to pay back taxes. In a manner similar to prior protests made by women's rights activists such as Lucy Stone, the Fosters refused to pay taxes on the {{convert|65|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm because Abby Kelley Foster was not given the right to vote and was thus subject to [[No taxation without representation|"taxation without representation"]]. A sympathetic neighbor bid on the property and then allowed Foster to buy it back from him. This became a yearly event, as the Fosters never paid their taxes directly.&lt;ref name=nps/&gt;

Foster died at Liberty Farm on September 12, 1881.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times. September 13, 1881.

The '''Sylhetis''' or '''Sylheti people''' ({{lang-syl|ꠍꠤꠟꠐꠤ}}, {{lang-bn|সিলেটি}}) are an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] [[ethnic group]] which originated from or are native of the [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet region]] of [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Barak Valley]] of the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Assam]], and speak the [[Sylheti language]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian M. Rasinger (2007). ''Bengali-English in East London: A Study in Urban Multilingualism''. pp. 26-27. Retrieved on 2017-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Price (2000). ''Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe''. pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; There are sizeable populations in the Indian states of [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Manipur]]. Established diaspora communities exist in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], the [[Middle East]], [[Italy]] and other parts of the world. Sylhetis today maintain a distinct identity separate from or in addition to having a [[Bengalis|Bengali]] identity, due to linguistic differences, geographical uniqueness and historical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Tanweer Fazal (2012).

Retrieved on 2018-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaspora==
Lord Cornwallis introduced the [[Permanent Settlement]] Act of Bengal in 1793 and it altered the social, political and economic landscape of the Sylhet region; socioeconomic ramification  for former landlords was severe as the land changed hands. On juxtapose, colonial administration opened new windows of opportunities for young men, who sought employment merchant ship companies. Young men from Sylhet boarded ships primarily at Kolkata, Mumbai and Singapore. Some of these early Sylheti seamen visited Britain and America and sought employment. By virtue of [[Magna Carta]] Libertatum, Sylhetis could enter and settle Britain freely (while a declaration of intent was required to enter the USA). Diaspora patterns indicate a strong connection between Sylheti diaspora and the movement of Sylheti seamen.&lt;ref&gt;Across Seven Seas and Thirteen Rivers: Life Stories of Pioneer Sylheti Settlers in Britain, Caroline Adams, Tassaduq Ahmed and Dan Jones, THAP (1987), London, {{ISBN|978-0906698143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sylheti diaspora population grew in response to a need for an economic sustenance during the British Raj, when many Sylheti men left the region in search of employment. During this period, young men from Sylhet often worked as lascars in the British merchant marine. Some abandoned their ships in London in search of economic opportunity, while others found alternative routes to enter the country. Chain migration led to the eventual settlement of large numbers of Sylhetis in working-class neighbourhoods in London’s East End and other industrial towns and cities such as Luton, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, and Oldham.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Alexander, Joya Chaterji and Annu Jalais, The Bengal Diaspora: Rethinking Muslim Migration, p.2, Routledge (2015) London.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today Sylheti diaspora numbers around one million, mainly concentrated in United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, France, Australia, [[Portugal]], Spain, [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and the Middle East and other European Countries. However, a 2008 study showed that 95% of Sylheti diaspora live in the UK.&lt;ref name="diasporas"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.diasporas.ac.uk/assets/Zeitlyn%20working%20paper.pdf|date=September 2008|title= Challenging Language in the Diaspora|journal=Bangla Journal|author=Benjamin Zeitlyn|volume=6|issue=14|pages=126–140|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, most Sylhetis live in [[New York City]], though sizable populations also live in [[Atlanta]], [[Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], and [[Detroit]].

Some argue that remittances sent from [[Sylheti]] diaspora around the world back to Bangladesh have negatively affected development in Bangladesh, where a lack of government initiatives has caused economic inertia.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diaspora Engagement and Development in South Asia|author1=Yong, T.T.|author2=Rahman, M.M.|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137334459|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaBEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108|page=108|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to neo-classical theory, the poorest would move to the richest countries and those from densely populated areas would move to more sparsely peopled regions. This has clearly not been the case. The brain drain was a movement from core to core, purely on economic maximisation, while it was young Sylheti pioneers with access to financial resources that migrated from a severely overpopulated Bangladesh to the overcrowded streets of Spitalfields, poorest from all parts of Bangladesh migrated to Sylhet for a better life, causing a severe overcrowding and scarcity of resources in Sylhet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anne J. Kershen |year=2005 |title=Strangers, Aliens and Asians: Huguenots, Jews and Bangladeshis in Spitalfields, 1660–2000 |publisher=Routledge |page=19 |isbn=978-0-7146-5525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caste and class==
Sylheti Hindus are socially stratified into four castes, called [[varna|chaturvarna]], and Muslims into three social classes. The caste system derived from Hindu system of [[varna]], 'colour' and [[jāti|jati]], 'ethnicity', which divides people into four colours: White, Red, Yellow and Black. White people are Brahmans, who are destined to be priests, teachers and preachers; Red people are Kshatriyas, who are destined to be kings, governors, warriors and soldiers; Yellow people are Vyasas, who are born to be cattle herders, ploughmen, artisans and merchants; and Black people are Shudras, who are born to be labourers and servants to the people of twice born caste.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata (12.181)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiltebeitel, Alf (2011). Dharma : its early history in law, religion, and narrative. Oxford University Press. pp. 529–531.{{ISBN|978-0-19-539423-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; People from all caste denominations exist among Hindus in Sylhet.

Class system among Muslims evolved during the halcyon days of the Mughal Empire and it is divided into three layers: Ashraf, Ajlaf and Arzal. Ashraf is the noble class destined to be priests, teachers, preachers, kings, governors, warriors and soldiers; Ajlaf is the middle class destined to be cattle herders, ploughmen, artisans and merchants; and Arzal is the working class destined to labour and provide services to all others.&lt;ref&gt;Habib, Mohammed (1358), The Political Theory of the Delhi Sultanate&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asghar Ali Engineer.

It shows three philosophers - one young, one middle-aged, and one old.
The work was commissioned by the Venetian noble [[Taddeo Contarini]], a Venetian merchant with an interest in the occult and [[alchemy]]. ''The Three Philosophers'' was finished one year before the painter died. One of Giorgione’s last paintings, it is now displayed at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. 
The painting was finished by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].

==Description==
''The Three Philosophers ''was finished around 1509, and the current name of the work derives from a writing of [[Marcantonio Michiel]], (1484–1552) who saw it just some years after in a Venetian villa.&lt;ref&gt;Marcantonio Michiel, ''Notizie d’opere di disegno'', manuscript, Venice (see Zeleny)&lt;/ref&gt; The three figures portrayed are allegorical: an old bearded man, possibly a Greek philosopher;  an [[Arab]] philosopher; and a sitting young man, enclosed within a natural landscape.{{sfnp|Beckett|1994|p=167|ps=}} In the background is a [[village]] with some mountains, the latter marked by a blue area whose meaning is unknown. The young man is observing a cave on the left of the scene, and apparently measuring it with some instruments. Since the end of the 19th century scholars and critics rejected on various grounds the earlier view that it is a representation of the three [[Magi]] gathered before Jesus' grotto.&lt;ref&gt;Settis S.,(1990), ''Giorgione's Tempest: Interpreting the Hidden Subject'', University Of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lesmaterialistes.com/english/avicenna-and-averroes-giorgione-s-three-philosophers|title=Avicenna-and-Averroes -The Three Philosophers|publisher=lesmaterialistes.com|access-date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:David Teniers the Younger - Archduke Leopold William in his Gallery at Brussels - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|354px|''Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and the artist in the archducal picture gallery in Brussels''. The painting  shows rather faithfully the original painting as displayed in the dukes collection, high up left corner,  by [[David Teniers the Younger]], (c. 1650, in [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]])]]
&lt;!-- [[File:Giorgione 030.jpg|thumb|upright|Sheet held by the oldest philosopher]] --&gt;

Various interpretations about Giorgione's picture have been proposed. The Three Philosophers, the old man, the Arab figure and the young man, could be a depiction of transmission of knowledge, the [[Transmission of the Classics]] from the ancient Greeks philosophy through the Arab translations, that became actual again around the [[Italian Renaissance]]. The old man is representing a Greek philosopher, such as [[Plato]] or [[Aristotle]], whose writings have been copied and  transmitted through the Arab [[philosopher]]s to the [[Italian Renaissance]].{{sfnp|Beckett|1994|p=167|ps=}} The Arab philosopher is possibly representing the [[polyhistor]] [[Avicenna]] or [[Averroes]], both Arab philosophers and [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Arab scientist]]s from the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Beckett |first=Wendy |title=The Story of Painting, The Essential Guide to the History of Western Art |year=1994 |publisher=Dorling Kidersley |isbn=978-0751301335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212112030/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education www.britannica.com ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/45755/Avicenna|title=Avicenna|publisher=global.britannica.com|access-date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young man could be seen as the new Renaissance science with roots in the past, looking into the empty darkness of the cave, symbolizing the yet undiscovered secrets.{{sfnp|Beckett|1994|p=167|ps=}} The cave might also symbolize the philosophic concept of [[Plato's Cave]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lesmaterialistes.com/english/avicenna-and-averroes-giorgione-s-three-philosophers|title=Avicenna-and-Averroes -The Three Philosophers|publisher=lesmaterialistes.com|access-date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New hypotheses about the figures, their identities and the symbolism are still currently advanced. In a note about the picture G. C. Williamsom, early in the 20th century, stated that "It represents [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]] and his son [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]] showing to [[Aeneas]] the future site of Rome".&lt;ref&gt;G. C. Williamson, ed.,(1903), ''The Anonimo. Notes on Pictures and Works of Art in Italy Made by an Anonymous Writer in the Sixteenth Century'', (trans. Paolo Mussi), London: George Bell and Sons, p. 102 [https://archive.org/details/anonimonotesonpi00michuoft]&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility that the three men are [[King Solomon]], [[Hiram I]], King of Tyre, and [[Hiram Abiff]] has been advanced by Neil K. MacLennan and Ross S. Kilpatrick.&lt;ref&gt;by Neil K. MacLennan and Ross S. Kilpatrick, ''King Solomon &amp; the Temple Builders: A Biblical Reading of Giorgione`s Painting "The Three Philosophers" ''[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/Giorgione_Three_Philosophers.html Heredom 9(2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the figure of the young man can be inscribed neatly in a right-angled triangle for which the [[Pythagorean theorem]] applies. [[:la:Carina Zeleny|Karin Zeleny]], relying on a reading of [[Polydore Vergil]]&lt;ref&gt;Polydore Vergil, ''De inventoribus rerum, libri tres'', Venetia, 1499&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed that the philosophers are the teachers of [[Pythagoras]] - [[Pherecydes of Syros]] and [[Thales]]. Thales has been painted as a Jew, while Pherecydes was mistakenly believed to be a Syrian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khm.at/fileadmin/content/KHM/Ausstellungen/2007/Bellini-Giorgione-Titian/GiorgioneCodeE.pdf Zeleny K., ''The Giorgione Code'', Kunsthistorisches Museum Papers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223722/http://www.khm.at/fileadmin/content/KHM/Ausstellungen/2007/Bellini-Giorgione-Titian/GiorgioneCodeE.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was modified by Frank Keim who claimed that the older philosopher is in fact [[Aristarchus of Samos]]&lt;ref&gt;Keim F., ''Die Entdeckung der Jupitermonde 105 Jahre vor Galileo Galilei'', 2009, Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have asserted that the figures are typical representations  for three stages of humanity (youth, middle and old age), three epochs of European civilization (Antiquity, Middle Age, Renaissance), the three [[Abrahamic religions]] or some combination of such general conceptions.&lt;ref&gt;see Settis S., MacLennan and Kilpatrick, 'op. cit'&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Augusto Gentili]] proposed that the picture illustrates the waiting for the Antichrist, based on conjunctionist astrology. On the sheet held by the oldest philosopher the word 'eclipsis' and an astronomical diagram can be seen. The [[great conjunction]] of 1503 and the eclipse the same year were believed to be signs announcing its coming.&lt;ref&gt;Gentili A., ''Giorgione'', Giunti Editore (coll. Dossier d'art), 1999, (Googlebooks)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Theatrum Pictorium''==
This painting was documented in [[David Teniers the Younger]]'s catalog ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]'' of the art collection of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]] in 1659 and again in 1673,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009347911#page/n86/mode/1up 39] in [[Theatrum Pictorium]], 1673&lt;/ref&gt; but the portrait had already found fame in Teniers' portrayals of the Archduke's art collection:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.washington.edu/englhtml/engl569/berger/teniers/teniersmap.html|title=David Teniers and the Cabinet of Archduke Leopold William|publisher=courses.washington.edu|access-date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tenier's copies that he made of the exhibits have long been recognised as a valuable historical resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2007/04/vegelin.html|title=historians of Nederlandish art - David Teniers’s ''Theatrum Pictorium'' |publisher=www.hnanews.org|access-date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting is now displayed at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. While working on this picture, David Teniers the Younger made tiny separate copies of each and every picture as a [[study (art)|study]] for the final big painting, depicting the duke's collection. In this small copy that measures 21.5 x 30.9&amp;nbsp;cm, he put a trident in the older man's hand, but that was not in the original painting nor depicted in the final painting, the ''Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Gallery in Brussels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renruskin.blogspot.se/2014/06/week-6-venetian-art-in-late-17th-and.html|title=venetian-art-in-late-17th - showing David Teniers the Younger's copy. |publisher=renruskin.blogspot.se|access-date=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original painting the old man holds only a script. This possibly could have been an allusion to the weapon of Poseidon, the god of the sea in classical mythology, but it is David Teniers the Younger's own speculation.

'''Toto''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken on the border of [[India]] and [[Bhutan]], by the tribal [[Toto people]] in [[Totopara]], [[West Bengal]] along the border with [[Bhutan]]. It is also spoken in Subhapara, Dhunchipara, and Panchayatpara hillocks on India-Bhutan border in [[Jalpaiguri district]], [[West Bengal]] (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

==Status==
Toto is listed as a [[list of endangered languages in India|critically endangered language]] by [[UNESCO]], with perhaps 1,000 speakers.&lt;ref name="doherty"&gt;{{cite web|title=India's tribal people fast becoming lost for words|date=April 29, 2012|work=The Age|author=Ben Doherty|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/indias-tribal-people-fast-becoming-lost-for-words-20120429-1xted.html |accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most families in the community speak Toto at home. Most children learn Toto at home, although they use [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in school.

[[Anthropological Survey of India]] (AnSI) set out to conduct a study on language of the primitive Toto tribe, whose population has dwindled to 1,536, they did not realize that the language is more endangered than the tribe itself. Researchers and even the members of Toto community admit that the language is under threat and influence of other languages, particularly Nepali and Bengali, is increasing day by day. Despite the language lacking a script, members of the community, whose literacy rate as per sample survey carried out in 2003 was just 33.64 per cent, have penned books and poems in their language albeit in the Bengali script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/toto-language-more-endangered-than-tribe/article6270931.ece|title= Toto Language More Endangered than Tribe |date= |accessdate=2015-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Himalayan Languages Project]] is working on the first grammatical sketch of Toto. Himalayan Languages Project have arguably contributed more to advancing Tibeto-Burman linguistics than all other working scholars combined. [[George van Driem]] outlines the contributions of linguistics, archaeology and genetics to the population history of the greater Himalayan region. He emphasizes the role of genetics in the study of Tibeto-Burman linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the  Greater Himalayan Region Containing an Introduction to the Symbiotic Theory of Language&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

=== Vowels ===
Toto Language consists of 25 segmental Phonemes of which 19 are consonants and 6 are vowels. The phonemes of this language are as follows:
Vowels:
These are 6 vowel phonemes in Toto language. They can be classified horizontally into three as front unrounded, central unrounded and back rounded vowels and vertically as close, close-mid, open-mid and open.

The following minimal pairs establish the phonetics status of the vowel

'''/i/~/u/'''

/Jiya/		‘rat’

/Juya/		‘bird’

'''/i/~/e/'''

/iŋ/		‘brother in-law’

/eŋ/		‘ginger’

/ciwa/		‘tear’

/cewa/		‘cut’ (cloth)

'''/i/~/a/'''

/guJi/		‘owl’

/guJa/		‘pocket’

/nico/		‘fire’	

/naco/		‘two’

'''/e/~/o/'''

/jo/		‘breast’

'''/e/~/a/'''

/lepa/		‘brain’

/lapa/		‘jungle betel leaf’

/kewa/		‘birth’

/kawa/		‘sound’

There are eight diphthongs realized in Toto language. These are /ei/, /ai/, /oi/, /ui/, /əi/, /eu/, /au/ and /ou/. Diphthong /ui/ occurs in all positions, /eu/ occurs initial and medial positions, /ai/, /oi/, /əi/, and /ei/ occur medial and final positions. While /ou/ and /au/ occur only in the medial positions.&lt;ref name="Languages of India"/&gt;
Furthermore, with regard to consonants, Toto has an inventory of ten [[Obstruent|obstruents]], eight of which are contrastive in voicing.  Toto also distinguishes the voiceless obstruents /t/ and /p/ with its [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] equivalents /tʰ/ and /pʰ/, respectively. &lt;ref name="Languages of India"/&gt;

Several [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] are not officially recognized. Taken together, these groups ([[wiktionary:未|未]][[wiktionary:识|识]][[wiktionary:别|别]][[wiktionary:民|民]][[wiktionary:族|族]] ''wèi shíbié mínzú)'' number more than 730,000 people; if considered as a single group, they would constitute the twentieth most populous ethnic group of China. Some scholars have estimated that there are over 200 distinct ethnic groups that inhabit China. There are in addition small distinct ethnic groups that have been classified as part of larger [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic groups that are officially recognized]]. Some groups like the [[Hui]] of Xinjiang with the Hui of Fujian are geographically and culturally separate except for the shared belief of Islam. [[Han Chinese]] being the world's largest ethnic group has a large diversity within it, such as in [[Gansu]], the Han here may have genetic traits from the assimilated [[Tangut people|Tangut]] civilization. Although they are indigenous to [[Hainan]] island and do not speak a Chinese language, the Limgao ([[Ong Be language|Ong-Be]]) people near the capital (8% of the population) are counted as Han Chinese.

Notable unrecognized ethnic groups include:
*[[Bajia people|Bajia]] (八甲人)
*[[Bolyu language|Lai]] (萊人)
*[[Daman people|Daman]] (达曼人) in [[Gyirong Town]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Image:Fortunes of a Street Waif.jpg|thumb|275px|A young waif steals a pair of boots]]
A '''waif''' (from the [[Old French]] ''guaif'', "stray beast")&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/waif (accessed: June 02, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; is a living creature removed, by hardship, loss or other helpless circumstance, from its original surroundings.  The most common usage of the word is to designate a [[homeless]], forsaken or [[orphan]]ed child, or someone whose appearance is evocative of the same.

As such, the term is similar to a [[:wikt:ragamuffin|ragamuffin]] or [[street children|street urchin]], although the main distinction is volitional: a [[runaway youth]] might live on the streets, but would not properly be called a waif as the departure from one's home was an exercise of free will. Likewise, a person fleeing their home for purposes of safety (as in response to political oppression or natural disaster), is typically considered not a waif but a [[refugee]].

==Literature==

Orphaned children, left to fend for themselves, are common as literary protagonists, especially in [[children's literature|children]]'s and [[fantasy literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 16, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters Heathcliff in [[Emily Brontë|Emily Brontë's]] 1847 novel ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' and Jo, the crossing sweeper in [[Charles Dickens]]' 1852 novel ''[[Bleak House]]'' are waifs. Dickens, it may be noted, has been called "the Master of Waif Literature."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Bret Harte]]'s 1890 novel ''A Waif of the Plains'', set against the backdrop of the Oregon Trail in the 1850s, is another example.  The children in ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' are usually waifs, in between their unsuccessful stints in the care of various relatives. In modern adult fantasy writing, it could be argued that Kvothe of [[Patrick Rothfuss]]'s ''[[The Kingkiller Chronicle]]'' (''[[The Name of the Wind]]'' and ''[[The Wise Man's Fear]]'') ''was'' a waif, and the stories include many flashback elements – as they are of Kvothe's life told by Kvothe – to the time when he indeed was a waif.

Literary waifs are frequently depicted with a frail appearance, although such physical aspects are not inherent in the term. Such evocations may reflect the endemic malnutrition of the [[street children|street urchin]].

Chicago's [[Mercy Home for Boys and Girls]], a long-term residential home for troubled young men and women from the streets and abusive homes, has published ''The Waif's Messenger'' for more than 100 years.

A cartoon waif, an orphan boy, appeared in the 1936 ''[[Rainbow Parade]]'' cartoon ''[[A Waif's Welcome]]''.

==Nautical==
In nautical terms, a waif is any survivor of a [[shipwreck]] compelled to make land upon a foreign shore. In this sense ''waif'' is roughly synonymous with ''[[castaway]]'', although the latter term is generally associated with isolation; a waif (in the nautical sense) usually indicates a survivor of a marine disaster who has fallen into the care or custody of others. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Some seven years ago...there appeared the remarkable saga of Manjiro, the shipwrecked Japanese waif who was rescued and brought to the United States by a Yankee whaling captain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1963/5/1963_5_95.shtml AmericanHeritage.com / The Ordeal of the KANRIN MARU&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legal==

Dating from the Middle Ages, when a woman was [[proscription|proscribed]] and subjected to penalties of [[outlaw]]ry, she was said to be “waived” and called a "waif".  This waiving of the law was tantamount to outlawry since it removed all protection of the law.&lt;ref&gt;The Subordinated Sex: A History of Attitudes Toward Women (2003)  By Vern L. Bullough, Brenda K Shelton&lt;/ref&gt;  Women in this status were outside of the "law", and as with male outlaws, others could kill them on sight as if they were wild animals.

Under [[British common law]], items stolen by a thief and discarded during the thief's flight are "waifs." The monarch owns such waifs by royal prerogative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271759/QC_PC_pamphlet_101013.pdf "Queen or Prince's Consent", p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
References to waifs in music are sometimes [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]], as in the name of the Australian [[folk-rock]] band [[The Waifs]], or [[Tracy Bonham]]'s song "I'm Not a Waif".

Many other songs use the word "waif" to romanticize [[street children]] and [[runaway youth|runaways]], as in the [[Marc Almond]] song "Waifs and Strays", or the [[Steely Dan]] song "Janie Runaway", which describes the title character as being the "wonderwaif of [[Gramercy Park]]".

The song " Black and White Sunshine" by Noel Gallagher`s High Flying Birds contains the lyric " these are the glory days for the waifs and the strays ".

==Botany==
In [[botany]], a "waif" is an unusual species found in the wild that is alien and either a) is unsuccessful at reproduction without human intervention, or b) only persists a few generations and disappears.  Such a plant never gets "naturalized" in the wild.  "Waif flora" also refers to plant species which occur on oceanic islands due to chance long-distance dispersion of seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Henry F. Howe et al., "Ecology of Seed Dispersal", ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion==
In [[fashion]] and related [[popular culture]], the term "waif" is commonly used to describe a very thin person, usually a woman.

"The waif look" was used in the 1960s to describe thin, large-eyed [[Model (person)|model]]s such as [[Twiggy]],&lt;ref&gt;"She sees nudity as just part of the job", ''New York Times'', November 20, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Twiggy, in Her 'One and Only' Phase", ''New York Times'', May 10, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edie Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;"Macy's Little Shop" (display ad), ''New York Times'', October 3, 1968, page 7, and December 22, 1968, page 24&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[gamine]]" look of the 1950s, associated with actresses such as [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Leslie Caron]] and [[Jean Seberg]], was, to some extent, a precursor.

The term "waif" was seemingly ubiquitous in the 1990s, with [[heroin chic]] fashion and models such as [[Kate Moss]] and [[Jaime King]] on the runways and in advertisements. Actresses such as ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' star [[Calista Flockhart]], [[Winona Ryder]], recently the British actress [[Keira Knightley]] and singer [[Celine Dion]] have all been pinned with the term.

Although the heroin chic look has gone out of fashion,&lt;ref&gt;"Calvin Klein's new campaign casts off the old stark, dark look and dons a happy, healthy one", ''New York Times'', February 4, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In fashion, no more dirty pictures", ''New York Times'', February 8, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion cracks a smile", ''New York Times'', November 15, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; it still holds some popularity in Hollywood. For example, [[Wonderbra]] model [[Eva Herzigová]] was criticized over her waif-like figure.  ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' columnist [[Sue Carroll]] wrote:

{{quote|The supermodel, looking like a throwback to the '[[heroin chic]]' era of waif-like undernourished models, was an X-ray of her old self, skeletally thin with greasy hair, blue lips, a [[cold sore]] and sunken eyes.&lt;ref&gt;"Eva Herzigova" (Sue Carroll column), ''Daily Mirror'', February 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Westland affair''' in 1985–86 was an episode in which [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], and her [[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[Michael Heseltine]], went public over a cabinet dispute with questions raised about whether the conventions of [[cabinet government]] were being observed and about the integrity of senior politicians.

The argument was over the future of [[Westland Helicopters]], Britain's last helicopter manufacturer, which was to be the subject of a rescue bid. While the Defence Secretary, Heseltine, favoured a European solution, integrating Westland with a consortium including [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), Italian ([[Agusta]]) and French companies, the Prime Minister and the Trade and Industry Secretary, [[Leon Brittan]], while ostensibly maintaining a neutral stance, wanted to see Westland merge with [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation|Sikorsky]], an American company.

Heseltine refused to accept Thatcher's choice and claimed that Thatcher was refusing to allow a free ministerial discussion about the matter, even suggesting she had lied about cancelling a scheduled meeting. He eventually, when ordered to cease campaigning for his European consortium, resigned and walked out of a Cabinet meeting in January 1986. Brittan was then forced to resign for having (on the orders of Thatcher's aides, he admitted some years later) previously ordered the leaking to the press of a confidential legal letter critical of Heseltine, and for his lack of candour to the House of Commons about his efforts to persuade [[British Aerospace]] to withdraw from Heseltine's consortium.

Thatcher's survival as Prime Minister briefly appeared to be in question, although she rode out the crisis. The episode had been an embarrassment to the [[Second Thatcher ministry|Conservative government of Thatcher]] and undermined her reputation.{{sfn|Campbell|2003|pages=483–498}}

==April 1985==
The Westland affair originated with [[Alan Bristow]]'s bid for the company in April 1985. By June, Bristow was threatening to end his bid unless the Government assured him that there would be future orders for the company from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and that the repayment of over £40&amp;nbsp;million of launch aid for Westland's newest helicopter from the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] was waived.

Heseltine at this time was uninterested in Westland helicopters when approached by [[Norman Tebbit]], the then Trade and Industry Secretary, as plenty of American helicopters were available to meet Britain's defence requirements. He attended two meetings about the company's future in June 1985, chaired by Thatcher.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=275–6}} It was decided that Tebbit should persuade the [[Bank of England]] to co-operate with the main creditors in the hope that a recovery plan and new management would end the threat of [[receivership]].

Bristow withdrew his bid and in late June [[John Graham Cuckney, Baron Cuckney|Sir John Cuckney]] was brought in as chairman of Westland.{{sfn|Crick|1997|p=276}}

==November 1985==
Cuckney proposed that a new minority shareholder of 29.9% be introduced to Westland. No British firm was willing, but Sikorsky was interested. Cuckney proposed that Westland merge with [[United Technologies Corporation]], of which the US company [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation|Sikorsky]] was a subsidiary. Heseltine came out against this plan after realising that Westland would probably become responsible for assembling the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]], which the Ministry of Defence would then be under great pressure to buy. He preferred Westland to go into receivership so that British companies [[GEC Plessey Telecommunications|GEC]] and [[British Aerospace]] could buy the viable parts of the business.{{sfn|Crick|1997|p=276}}

In mid-October Heseltine suggested a European consortium which would include French [[Aerospatiale]], German [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]] and Italian [[Agusta]] (Sikorsky was now negotiating a strategic linkup with Italian [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]]). [[Leon Brittan]], who had replaced Tebbit as Trade and Industry Secretary in September 1985, at first urged Thatcher to consider a European option (Heseltine later claimed Brittan {{em|preferred}} this option, although Brittan denied this). The Government was officially neutral (i.e. arguing that it was a matter for Westland directors and shareholders) but by November Heseltine was lobbying hard for the European option.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=277–8}}

In late November [[Peter Levene, Baron Levene of Portsoken|Peter Levene]], Chief of Procurement at the Ministry of Defence, had a meeting at the Ministry with his French, West German and Italian counterparts (the National Armaments Directors or NADs) and the representatives of the consortium, and agreed to "buy European" for certain classes of helicopters. If Westland went ahead with Sikorsky its helicopters, under this new agreement, would be unable to be bought by the four governments. The meeting was later praised by the House of Commons Defence Select Committee. Thatcher, who only learned of the meeting through Cuckney, was displeased, as were Brittan and the Treasury, who thought the US option might be cheaper. although Thatcher and Leon Brittan kept to their official pretence of neutrality.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=277–8}}

In November 1985, Sikorsky made an offer and Westland's management were favourable.

==December 1985==
In early December Thatcher had two ''[[ad hoc]]'' meetings with Heseltine, Brittan, Tebbit, [[William Whitelaw]] (Deputy Prime Minister), [[Geoffrey Howe]] (Foreign Secretary) and [[Nigel Lawson]] (Chancellor of the Exchequer) on 5 and 6 December. Brittan argued that the NADs' opposition should be set aside, but Howe and Tebbit were not unsympathetic to Heseltine's proposed consortium, and the decision was deferred to the Cabinet Economic Affairs Committee (E(A)) on Monday 9 December 1985. Cuckney and a Westland financial adviser were invited to attend the E(A) meeting. Cuckney said that it was the management's view that the Sikorsky option was the best one. A majority of the E(A) meeting agreed to dismiss the NADs' opposition. Thatcher, who complained that three hours had been spent discussing a company with a market capitalisation of only £30m (a tiny amount in government terms), allowed Heseltine until 4&amp;nbsp;pm on Friday 13 December to submit a viable proposal for a European deal. He did (with British Aerospace and GEC now part of his consortium), but Westland's directors rejected it and chose Sikorsky. Heseltine had expected that there would be a second meeting of E(A) to discuss his consortium, but no such meeting was called; Thatcher later claimed that the Monday meeting had agreed to leave the decision to Westland to take, but it later emerged that Ridley and Lord Young {{em|had}} placed such a meeting in their diaries and had been told by Number Ten that it had been cancelled. Heseltine threatened resignation for the first time.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=278–80}}

At Cabinet on Thursday 12 December Heseltine had an angry exchange with Thatcher about the allegedly cancelled meeting (Thatcher claimed that no such meeting had ever been scheduled). Westland was not on the Cabinet agenda that day and Thatcher refused to permit a discussion on the matter, arguing that Cabinet could not do so without the necessary papers. Heseltine asked for his dissent to be minuted, and this was not done, although [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]] [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Robert Armstrong]] claimed that this had been an error and added it himself. On Monday 16 December Brittan told the House of Commons that the decision was up to Westland; on Wednesday 18 December Heseltine won the backing of the Commons Defence Committee for the European Consortium's latest bid. On Thursday 19 December the matter was discussed at Cabinet for ten minutes: Cabinet approved leaving the decision to Westland and Heseltine was ordered to cease campaigning for the European option.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=280–2}}

Over Christmas, Thatcher discussed with close colleagues the option of sacking Heseltine, as Brittan had urged her to do ([[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Chief Whip]] [[John Wakeham]] cautioned against), but—as she later admitted in her memoirs{{sfn|Thatcher|1993|p=436}}—she shrank from doing so as he was too popular and weighty a political figure. Thatcher and ministerial colleagues spent two and a half hours writing three successive drafts of a letter threatening Heseltine with the sack, but did not send it as her press adviser [[Bernard Ingham]] advised that Heseltine might use it an excuse to resign.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=283–5}}

==January 1986: leaks==
By now the political row was being discussed in the media, partly because of the lack of other news in December. Cuckney wrote to Thatcher, at her behest, asking for reassurance that the Sikorsky deal would not damage Westland's business prospects in Europe. Heseltine was not satisfied with Thatcher's draft reply when he saw it and consulted Sir [[Patrick Mayhew]] ([[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] and acting [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] as Sir [[Michael Havers, Baron Havers|Michael Havers]] was ill) on the grounds that the government might be legally liable for any incorrect advice. Heseltine supplied extra material about the risk of losing European business, which Thatcher did not include in her reply to Cuckney.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=282–3}} Thatcher replied to Cuckney to the effect that the British Government would continue to support Westland in gaining orders in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106297|title=Letter to Sir John Cuckney (Westland) |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=2 January 1986 |accessdate=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January Heseltine then wrote to David Horne of [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Merchant Bank]], who was advising the European consortium (in reply to planted questions from Horne which had been dictated to him over the phone by one of Heseltine's staff), giving him the advice which Thatcher had declined to include in her letter to Cuckney. Contradicting Thatcher's reassurances to Cuckney, Heseltine claimed that the Sikorsky deal would be "incompatible with participation" in European helicopter projects. Heseltine's letter was leaked to ''[[The Times]]''. This was a blatant challenge to Thatcher's authority as Heseltine had not consulted Downing Street, the Department of Trade and Industry or Mayhew before writing to Horne.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=282–3}}

Heseltine's letter to Horne, on Thatcher's request, was referred to the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]], [[Patrick Mayhew]]. Mayhew sent a reply to Heseltine, noting "material inaccuracies" in Heseltine's letter, and asking Heseltine to write to Horne again, correcting them. Mayhew's letter of rebuke to Heseltine—marked "Confidential"—reached Heseltine at lunchtime on Monday 6 January and was immediately and selectively leaked to the [[Press Association]] by [[Colette Bowe]], chief information officer at the Department of Trade and Industry, at Brittan's request. There was controversy over whose orders Colette Bowe was following. The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]], Sir [[Michael Havers]], took a stern view of leaks, especially of confidential legal advice, and threatened to resign if an official inquiry was not set up to look into it. Thatcher agreed to do this.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=283–5}}

==January 1986: Heseltine resigns==
Cabinet met on the morning of Thursday 9 January, with Thatcher already having agreed her position with close colleagues at Chequers that weekend, and arranged that Scottish Secretary [[George Younger, 4th Viscount Younger of Leckie|George Younger]] should take over as Defence Secretary if Heseltine resigned. Westland was first on the agenda, and Heseltine and Brittan were permitted to put their cases. Heseltine had won the moral high ground over the leaking saga, but Lawson recorded that he seemed obsessive at Cabinet and attracted little sympathy. Thatcher then reiterated her position, which had already been endorsed by the Cabinet, that Westland's future was a matter for Westland to decide, and announced that as this was a time of business negotiations all answers to questions about Westland must be cleared through the Cabinet Office. Heseltine agreed. However, in response to a question by [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]] she then confirmed that this also applied to statements which had {{em|already}} been made. Heseltine argued that he should be allowed to reaffirm statements he had already made but Thatcher disagreed, arguing that [[Cabinet collective responsibility]] should be observed. Heseltine protested that there had been no collective responsibility, gathered up his papers and left.{{sfn|Thatcher|1993|page=432}}{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=285–8}} Although eyewitness accounts differ as to the exact details, [[Peter Jenkins (journalist)|Peter Jenkins]] claims that Heseltine lost his cool and proclaimed "I can no longer be a member of this Cabinet". Heseltine then walked out of [[Downing Street]] and announced his resignation to the assembled media.{{sfn|Jenkins|1989|page=192}}

Thatcher then adjourned the Cabinet for a brief break. George Younger was then offered and accepted the office of [[Secretary of State for Defence]], which Heseltine had just relinquished. The Prime Minister's office then requested [[Malcolm Rifkind]] to take up Younger's previous job, [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], which he accepted. Cabinet then resumed.

At 4&amp;nbsp;pm that day at the Ministry of Defence (rather than waiting to make a statement to the House of Commons when it resumed four days later) Heseltine delivered a 3,000 word, 22 minute resignation statement detailing his grievances. He blamed Thatcher's intransigence, saying his views were ignored. He may well have prepared this earlier, although his private secretary Richard Mottram says not. To Thatcher's fury Defence officials had helped him throughout the crisis and in preparing this document.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=288–9}} Thatcher sent a letter to Heseltine, as is customary on these occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106298 |title=Letter to Michael Heseltine MP (resignation) |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=9 January 1986 |accessdate=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brittan resigns; Thatcher survives==
On 13 January, Thatcher held a meeting with Whitelaw, Brittan, Younger and [[John Wakeham]] to decide what should then happen. The conclusion was that Brittan, rather than the Prime Minister, should reply to Heseltine's statement on that day.

In his resignation statement in the House of Commons Heseltine accused Brittan of pressuring Sir [[Raymond Lygo]], CEO of British Aerospace, to withdraw from the European Consortium. In response to questions in the House from Heseltine Brittan denied that he had received a letter from Lygo, but later had to admit that he had received a letter from Sir Austin Pearce, Chairman of British Aerospace; he had not disclosed it, he claimed, because it was marked ''Private and Strictly Confidential''. He was forced to return to the House a few hours later to apologise.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=293–4}}

On 15 January there was a debate on Westland in the Commons in which Thatcher replied to [[Neil Kinnock]], the leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Thatcher listed all the ministerial, committee and Cabinet meetings on Westland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106305 |title=HC S: [Westland plc] |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=15 January 1986 |accessdate=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heseltine then made a speech criticising the way collective responsibility had been damaged over Westland.

Sir [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Robert Armstrong]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], held an inquiry into the leaking of Mayhew's letter and reported his findings to the Prime Minister on 21 January. Armstrong concluded that Brittan had told Bowe to leak Mayhew's letter through a telephone conversation to [[Roger Mogg]], Brittan's private secretary. Thatcher is said to have asked Brittan four times: "Leon, why didn't you tell me."{{sfn|Jenkins|1989|page=199}} Havers, who demanded the inquiry, later claimed: "Unless the PM is the most marvellous actress I've ever seen in my life she was as shocked as anybody that in fact it was on Leon Brittan's instructions."{{sfn|Campbell|2003|page=491}} At the time Brittan claimed he had misunderstood Thatcher's wishes but later (on the television programme ''The Thatcher Factor'' on 7 April 1989) admitted that he had acted on the "express" instructions of [[Charles Powell, Baron Powell of Bayswater|Charles Powell]] and Bernard Ingham, Thatcher's two senior advisers.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=283–5}} On 23 January, Thatcher had to make a speech to the Commons on Armstrong's inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106314 |title=HC Stmnt: [Westland plc] |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=23 January 1986 |accessdate=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brittan was being heavily criticised because of the fallout from the leak of the Mayhew letter and because of his lack of candour about the letter from British Aerospace.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=293–4}} A meeting of the [[1922 Committee]], Conservative back-benchers, demanded Brittan's resignation. On 24 January therefore Brittan resigned because "it has become clear to me that I no longer command the full confidence of my colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106316 |title=Letter to Leon Brittan MP (resignation) |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=24 January 1986 |accessdate=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January, Labour set down an adjournment motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=106318 |title=HC S: [Westland plc] |publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date=27 January 1986 |accessdate=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitelaw, Howe, Wakeham, [[John Biffen]] and [[Douglas Hurd]] helped Thatcher draft her speech for this occasion. [[Ronald Millar]], one of the Prime Minister's friends, was asked to help revise the speech and Thatcher remarked to him that she might not be Prime Minister by six o'clock that evening if things went badly.{{sfn|Millar|1993|page=310}}

[[Neil Kinnock]], the leader of the Opposition, was generally thought to have made a poor opening speech. [[Alan Clark]] recorded in his diary: "For a few seconds Kinnock had her cornered&amp;nbsp;... But then he had an attack of wind, gave her time to recover."{{sfn|Clark|2003|page=135}}{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=293–4}} Heseltine was frustrated at Kinnock's failure to exploit the moment and claimed that Thatcher's statement brought "the politics of the matter to an end" and that he would support the Government in the lobby.{{sfn|Campbell|2003|page=496}}

Sikorsky then bought Westland, aided by mysterious prior purchases by mystery buyers, suspected by Cuckney and others, although without clear proof, of being an illegal [[Concert party (business)|concert party]].{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=294–5}}

==Motivations of the actors==
Westland damaged Thatcher's reputation for credibility and made her look anti-European for the first time. It has been suggested that Thatcher's keenness on American control of Westland may have been linked to the [[Al-Yamamah arms deal]], or that the US might have wanted Westland to sell Black Hawk helicopters to Saudi Arabia in circumvention of Congressional rules which prevented US arms sales to that country at the time.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=267, 294–5}}

Leon Brittan's behaviour was thought in part to have been motivated by resentment at his demotion from Home Secretary to Trade and Industry Secretary in September 1985. However, he also thought Heseltine's mooted European consortium to be monopolistic and anti-competitive.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=277–8}}

Apart from his clash of personalities with Thatcher, it was thought that Heseltine, concerned at having to take responsibility for Defence cuts which had been put back until 1986, and worried that Thatcher was unlikely to promote him further, was looking for an excuse to resign. Resigning would put him in good stead to be elected party leader after, as seemed likely at the time, the Conservatives lost the next election due by summer 1988.{{sfn|Crick|1997|pp=289–92}}

Heseltine retired to the back benches and spent nearly five years conducting an undeclared campaign for the party leadership. Although the Thatcher government was re-elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]], he eventually [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|challenged her]] in November 1990, polling well enough to hasten her resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1990: Thatcher fails to win party mandate |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/20/newsid_4318000/4318718.stm |publisher=BBC News |work=On This Day |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
