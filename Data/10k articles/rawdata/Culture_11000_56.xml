'''Adamantium''' is a fictional metal [[alloy]] appearing in American comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. It is best known as the substance bonded to the character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s skeleton and claws. Adamantium was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artists [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] and [[Syd Shores]] in Marvel Comics' ''[[The Avengers (comic)|Avengers]]'' #66 (July 1969), which presents the substance as part of the character [[Ultron]]'s outer shell.&lt;ref name="Back38"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|pages= 23–30|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stories where it appears, the defining quality of adamantium is its practical indestructibility.

==Etymology==

The word is a Latin [[neologism]] (real Latin: ''adamans'', ''adamantem'' [accusative]), based on Greek αδάμας 'Indomitable', &lt;α- + δαμνάω 'conquest', probably from a Semitic root), compare English noun and adjective ''[[adamant]]'' (and the derived adjective ''adamantine'') with the neo-Latin suffix "[[-ium]]." The adjective has long been used to refer to the property of impregnable, diamondlike hardness, or to describe a very firm/resolute position (e.g. ''He adamantly refused to leave''). The noun ''adamant'' has long been used to designate any impenetrably or unyieldingly hard substance and, formerly, a legendary stone/rock or mineral of impenetrable hardness and with many other properties, often identified with [[diamond]] or [[lodestone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0007420#m_en_gb0007420 "adamant - definition of adamant"]. Oxforddictionaries.com.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adamant'' and the literary form ''adamantine'' occur in works such as ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Great Books of the Western World Vol. 4 pg 40&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Aeneid]]'', ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and the film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (as "adamantine steel"), all of which predate the use of ''adamantium'' in Marvel's comics.

==History and properties==
According to the comic books, the components of the alloy are kept in separate batches—typically in blocks of resin—before molding. Adamantium is prepared by melting the blocks together, mixing the components while the resin evaporates. The alloy must then be cast within eight minutes. Marvel Comics' adamantium has an extremely stable molecular structure that prevents it from being further molded even if the temperature is high enough to keep it in its liquefied form. In its solid form, it is described as a dark, shiny gray like high-grade steel or [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' (vol. 1) #201–202 (November–December 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible to destroy or fracture in this state, and when molded to a sharp edge, it can penetrate most lesser materials with minimal force.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #139 (November 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marvel Comics character Wolverine discovers an adamantium-laced skull in the character [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s laboratory and says it seems to have been there for [[aeon|eons]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: The Jungle Adventure'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a key component==
Adamantium appears in various Marvel Comics publications and licensed products, where it is found in:
* [[Ultron]]'s outer shell&lt;ref name="Back38"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|pages= 23–30|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s skeleton and claws&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #98 (April 1976) (w)[[Chris Claremont]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[X-23]]'s claws&lt;ref name="X-23: Target X"&gt;''X-23: Target X''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Russian (comics)|Russian]]'s body, following his resurrection by General Kreigkopf&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Stuart Moore|story = Dirty Work|title = The Punisher|volume = 6|issue = #4|date = October 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Ultimate Marvel==
In the Marvel Comics [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel imprint]], adamantium is highly durable and can shield a person's mind from [[telepath]]ic probing or attacks. It is a component of the claws and skeleton of [[Ultimate Wolverine]] and of the [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Lady Deathstrike|Ultimate Lady Deathstrike]] character. This version of adamantium is not unbreakable. In ''Ultimates'' #5, the Hulk breaks a needle made of adamantium. In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #11 (December 2001), an adamantium cage is damaged by a bomb. In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #12 (January 2002), one of [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]'s four adamantium claws is broken.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' #12 (January 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aramis''' is a village and [[archaeological site]] in north-eastern [[Ethiopia]], where remains of ''[[Australopithecus]]'' and ''[[Ardipithecus]]'' (''Ardipithecus ramidus'') have been found. The village is located in [[Administrative Zone 5 (Afar)|Administrative Zone 5]] of the [[Afar Region]], which is part of the Afar Sultanate of Dawe, with a latitude and longitude of {{coord|10|30|N|40|30|E}}, and is part of the (Daale Faage Woreda), Carri Rasuk, Xaale Faagê Daqaara.

The [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] did not mention this village in their 2005 population report.

Archeologists include the find site near the village as part of the [[Middle Awash]] region. [[Taphonomy|Taphonological]] and [[palynology|palynological]] studies have uncovered evidence of a rich fossil flora and fauna including many ''[[Canthium]]'' seeds, a genus found mainly in African woodlands and forests.  Additionally, fossil medium-sized [[colobine|colobine monkeys]] and [[kuda]]s suggest that pre-historic Aramis may have been wet, closed, and wooded, whereas today the Middle Awash is one of the dryest, hottest, and uninhabitable regions of the world.

In 1992 and 1993 a team led by Tim White found in total 17 specimens of hominid fossils at Aramis. These fossils were dated at 4.4 million years, 500,000 years earlier than the oldest ''afarensis'' fossils found in the eastern Middle Awash. This discovery was published on the front page of ''New York Times'', and later a new genus and species of hominids was proposed, ''Ardipithecus ramidus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/A/ORTAN.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (pdf), The Nordic Africa Institute website (last accessed 5 May 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Bart to the Future'''" is the seventeenth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|eleventh season]] of the American [[Animated cartoon|animated]] television [[sitcom]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 19, 2000. In the episode, after their picnic in the park is cut short due to a mosquito infestation, [[Simpson family|the Simpsons]] stop by at an [[Indian casino]]. There, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is prevented from entering because of his age. He manages to sneak in but is caught by the guards and sent to the casino manager's office. The Native American manager shows Bart a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of his future as a washed-up, wannabe rock musician living with [[Ralph Wiggum]], while [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] has become the [[President of the United States]] and tries to get the country out of financial trouble. "Bart to the Future" was the second episode of ''The Simpsons'' to be set in the future, following "[[Lisa's Wedding]]."

The episode was directed by [[Michael Marcantel]] and written by [[Dan Greaney]], who wanted to explore what Bart's life would end up like. Several designs were made by the animators for future Bart, but Greaney did not think they matched the personality of the character and had to give clearer instructions on how he wanted him to look. Reception of "Bart to the Future" by critics has been generally mixed to negative. In 2003, it was named the worst episode of the series by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writers who felt the "looking-into-the-future premise" was carried out better in "Lisa's Wedding."&lt;ref name=EW/&gt; Around 8.77 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD along with the rest of the episodes of the eleventh season. The episode attracted renewed attention in the events leading up to the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], because of a reference to the [[presidency of Donald Trump]].

==Plot==
[[Simpson family|The Simpsons]] drive to the park for a picnic but discover that it has been overrun by mosquitoes. While heading home, the family finds an [[Native American gaming|Indian casino]]. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is turned away because of his age but is able to sneak in by hiding in [[ventriloquist]] [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Arthur Crandall and Gabbo|Arthur Crandall]]'s dummy case. During Crandall's performance at the casino, Bart bursts out of the case and gets caught by casino guards. He is sent to the casino manager's office, where the Native American manager shows him a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of how his future will turn out if he does not change his ways. Thirty years into the future, Bart is a 40-year-old beer-drinking [[slacker]] trying to launch his music career after dropping out of the [[DeVry Institute]], and has resorted to mooching off his parents and their neighbor [[Ned Flanders]]. The only gig Bart can get is at a beach bar owned by [[Nelson Muntz]], and even then, Bart is only paid in popcorn shrimp. Bart lives with [[Ralph Wiggum]] in a beach cottage by the shore, from which Bart finds out that he has been evicted after his disastrous concert at Nelson's bar. Meanwhile, 38-year-old Lisa is the first [[heterosexual|straight]] female [[President of the United States]].

Bart disrupts one of Lisa's addresses to the nation to promote his music career, which leads Lisa to be branded unpopular when Bart sings to the public on live television that Lisa will be imposing a tax to get the country out of debt. Lisa later meets with the leaders of America's creditor nations, who demand that America pay them back. Bart steps in and uses his skills at stalling [[debt collector]]s to save the day, pleasing Lisa who had previously been mad at her brother. As a thank-you, Bart asks Lisa to "legalize [[cannabis|it]]", and Lisa says she will. Meanwhile, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] has heard about gold buried by [[Abraham Lincoln]] on the grounds of the [[White House]] and starts a search for it. When he finally locates the "gold", it is in fact a chest with a scroll in it that Lincoln had written on explaining that his "gold" is "in the heart of every freedom-loving American." Homer does not appreciate the metaphor and angrily curses Lincoln. After the vision is over, Bart promises that he will change. Lisa finds Bart and tells him that the family has been kicked out of the casino after Homer pushed a waitress and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] lost $20,000. Bart tells Lisa about his vision of the future where he has a rock band and a moped, while downplaying Lisa's future presidency as "some government job."

==Production==
"Bart to the Future" was written by [[Dan Greaney]] and directed by [[Michael Marcantel]] as part of the eleventh season of ''The Simpsons'' ([[1999–2000 United States network television schedule|1999–2000]]).&lt;ref name=Alberti&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberti|first=John|title=[[Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture]]|year=2004|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-2849-1|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|title=Simpsons – Bart to the Future|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/simpsons/show/bart-to-the-future/episode/2303|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Club]]|date=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more future-set episodes have been released since "Bart to the Future", the first being [[Future-Drama]] (season 16, 2005), second being "[[Holidays of Future Passed]]" (season 23, 2011) and third being "[[Days of Future Future]]" (season 25, 2014).&lt;ref name=Childs/&gt; Greaney's inspiration for "Bart to the Future" came from "Lisa's Wedding".&lt;ref name="Greaney"/&gt; He and ''The Simpsons'' writer [[Matt Selman]] were sitting in Greaney's office one day, trying to come up with new episode stories, when they received the idea of making a companion piece to that episode.&lt;ref name="Selman"&gt;Selman, Matt (2008). Audio commentary for "Bart to the Future", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Greaney wanted to write an episode set in the future that focused on Bart instead of Lisa. He thought it would be interesting to explore how the future works out for "a guy like Bart, who doesn't pay attention to school work and is all about being cool."&lt;ref name="Greaney"/&gt;

Selman commented in an audio commentary for "Bart to the Future" that "the thing that really got the [''Simpsons''] writers excited about the episode was this very specific version of future Bart."&lt;ref name="Selman"/&gt; Greaney identified this version as "the guy who blames everyone else and tells everyone else that they used to be cool, that it's everyone else's fault that his life hasn't gone the way he wants it to go."&lt;ref name="Greaney"/&gt; ''The Simpsons'' [[showrunner]] [[Mike Scully]] also noted that future Bart is the kind of person who is "always waiting for some big sort of cash payoff that he feels he's owed whether it be an insurance settlement, an inheritance, or something that's gonna come sooner or later."&lt;ref name="Scully"/&gt; Greaney said that everyone in the writing room recognized these traits from people they knew and therefore everyone contributed to the episode by suggesting lines for Bart to say and things for him to do.&lt;ref name="Greaney"/&gt;

[[File:Bart to the Future.png|thumb|320px|From left to right: [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] in the future. The original designs of future Bart were different compared to the one that is used in the episode and seen here.]]
According to Greaney, the animators originally designed future Bart as "cool and fun" and made several designs where he was "slim, attractive, and hip."&lt;ref name="Greaney"/&gt; Greaney did not think any of these designs went along with the personality he and the other the writers had assigned to future Bart, so he told the animators to draw the character with belly fat, a ponytail, sags under his eyes, and one earring.&lt;ref name="Greaney"/&gt; Scully said on the audio commentary that he thought the design of Bart looked "great", though he added that it was "slightly disturbing" to see the older versions of Homer and Marge in the episode, and joked that it is "a little bit sad to watch cartoon characters age."&lt;ref name="Scully"/&gt;

Greaney needed a [[setpiece]] for the episode that enabled him to get into a vision of the characters in the future, and ''The Simpsons'' writer [[George Meyer]] came up with the idea of the Indian casino.&lt;ref name="Greaney"&gt;Greaney, Dan (2008). Audio commentary for "Bart to the Future", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; When Homer and Bart first enter the casino, Homer tells Bart that "Although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the Indian." He proceeds to greet everyone in the casino by saying "Hi-how-are-you?" in the rhythm of a stereotypical Native American chant. This joke was pitched by [[Tom Gammill]], and there was a debate among the staff of the show about whether or not to include it in the episode as Native Americans could find it offensive. However, according to Scully, [[Dan Castellaneta]] (who voices Homer) "did [the joke] so funny when we were at the [[table-read]] so we decided to put it in and risk offending."&lt;ref name="Scully"&gt;Scully, Mike (2008). Audio commentary for "Bart to the Future", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff members Mike Scully, Dan Greaney, Matt Selman, and George Meyer participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set.&lt;ref name="dvdtalk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35268/simpsons-the-complete-eleventh-season-the/ |title=The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2011-10-02|last=Jane |first=Ian |publisher=[[DVD Talk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bart to the Future" has received mixed to negative reviews from critics compared to "Lisa's Wedding" which met with positive response. Nancy Basile of [[About.com]] listed it as one of the episodes she felt "shined in season eleven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Nancy|title='The Simpsons' Season Eleven|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/episodeguides/a/simpseas11rev.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; While reviewing the eleventh season of ''The Simpsons'', DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on "Bart to the Future", writing: "This kind of fantasy episode can be hit or miss, and that trend holds true here. However, more of 'Future' succeeds than flops. Though a few gags bomb, most of them prove pretty good. At no point does this become a classic, but it amuses much of the time."&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt; Hayden Childs of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote in 2011 that the episode "was not so good, although better than many of the real stinkers yet to come at that point. Still, it utterly failed to rise to the challenge of 'Lisa’s Wedding.'"&lt;ref name="Childs"/&gt;

In a 2003 article, writers of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' listed "Bart to the Future" as the worst ''Simpsons'' episode of all time. They elaborated that "Choosing the lamest ''Simpsons'' episode is like picking the crowning installment of ''[[Shasta McNasty]]'' — it's all relative. So while 'Bart to the Future' was likely better than anything else on TV the week it first aired, even [[Girly Edition|Mojo the monkey]] could've banged out a more inventive script [...] Plus, the whole looking-into-the-future premise is merely reliving past glory, carried out far more successfully in 1995's 'Lisa's Wedding.'"&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{cite news | title =The Family Dynamic | newspaper = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_5,00.html| accessdate=2011-10-21|date=2003-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2003, [[Ben Rayner]] of ''[[Toronto Star]]'' referred to "Bart to the Future" as "a lame 2000 outing" and noted that ''Entertainment Weekly'' "rightly dubbed [it] the 'worst episode ever'".&lt;ref name=Rayner&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Ben Rayner|last=Rayner|first=Ben|title=Still a riot at 300, er 302?

Killing off Maude was a sin compounded by the Bart to the Future episode [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Randall|first=King|title=dvd with Randall Kin|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/winnipeg-free-press/2008-10-09/page-50/|accessdate=2012-08-11|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=2008-10-09|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2006 book ''Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality'', Jonathan Gray analyzed the many advertisement parodies featured in ''The Simpsons''. He commented on "Bart to the Future", writing: "As if ads in children's toys or in churches are not enough, in 'Bart to the Future,' an episode in which an Indian shaman at a casino treats Bart to a vision of his future, even his vision is interrupted when future-Bart says, 'I guess I am an embarrassment,' and a ghost responds, 'You sure are. But, hey, there's an embarrassment ''of riches'' at the Caesar's Pow-Wow Indian Casino. You can bet on it!' Here [...] ''The Simpsons'' uses parody with great effect, not only to illustrate how annoyingly and disrespectfully ads infringe on any territory, but also to mock their logic and rhetoric."&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite book|title=Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality|last=Gray|first=Jonathan|year=2006|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jc3Bz9uHTbkC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Bart+to+the+Future%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BWqkTuBCg_fhBMuS8c8E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bart%20to%20the%20Future%22&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-415-36202-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battlestar Galactica''''' is an American [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] created by [[Glen A. Larson]]. The franchise began with the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original television series]] in 1978 and was followed by a short-run sequel series (''[[Galactica 1980]]''), a line of book adaptations, original novels, comic books, a board game, and video games. A re-imagined version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' aired as a [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|two-part, three-hour miniseries]] developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[David Eick]] in 2003. That miniseries led to a [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|weekly television series]], which aired until 2009. A prequel series, ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', aired in 2010.

All ''Battlestar Galactica'' productions share the premise that in a distant part of the universe, a human civilization has extended to a group of planets known as the [[Twelve Colonies]], to which they have migrated from their ancestral homeworld of [[Kobol]]. The Twelve Colonies have been engaged in a lengthy war with a cybernetic race known as the [[Cylon (1978)|Cylons]], whose goal is the extermination of the human race. The Cylons offer peace to the humans, which proves to be a ruse. With the aid of a human named [[Baltar (Battlestar Galactica)|Baltar]], the Cylons carry out a massive attack on the Twelve Colonies and on the Colonial Fleet of starships that protect them. These attacks devastate the Colonial Fleet, lay waste to the Colonies, and virtually destroy their populations. Scattered survivors flee into outer space aboard a ragtag array of available spaceships. Of the entire Colonial battle fleet, only the [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], a gigantic battleship and spacecraft carrier, appears to have survived the Cylon attack. Under the leadership of [[Commander Adama (disambiguation)|Commander Adama]], the ''Galactica'' and the pilots of "[[Colonial Viper|Viper fighters]]" lead a fugitive fleet of survivors in search of the fabled thirteenth colony known as [[Earth in fiction#Battlestar Galactica|Earth]].

==Original series==

===''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978)===
{{Main|Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)}}
[[Glen A. Larson]], the creator and [[executive producer]] of ''Battlestar Galactica'', claimed he had conceived of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' premise, which he called ''Adam's Ark'', during the late 1960s. As James E. Ford detailed in “''Battlestar Galactica'' and Mormon Theology,” a paper read at the Joint Conference of the American Culture and Popular Culture Associations on 17 April 1980 (and published as “Theology in Prime Time Science Fiction: ''Battlestar Galactica'' and Mormon Doctrine,” ''Journal of Popular Culture'' #17 [1983]: 83–87), the series incorporated many themes from [[Mormons|Mormon]] theology, such as marriage for "time and eternity", a "council of twelve," and a planet called [[Kobol]], as Larson was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1979/08/news-of-the-church/lds-scene "LDS Scene,"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]],'' August 1979, p. 80. In 1979, Larson received an award from the Associated Latter-day Media Artists.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mormon Expression, Episode 135: Battlestar Galactica and Mormon Theology [http://mormonexpression.com/2011/05/17/135-battlestar-galactica-and-mormon-theology/]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unable to find financial backing for his [[TV series]] for a number of years. ''Battlestar Galactica'' was finally produced in the wake of the success of the 1977 film [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']]. The original Cylons of Battlestar Galactica, robotic antagonists bent on destroying all humankind, owe much to [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|berserker]] stories, including Saberhagen's fictional race The Builders whose "sliding single red eye" became the signature design element for the Cylons.

Larson had envisioned ''Battlestar Galactica'' as a series of [[television film|made-for-TV movies]] (a three-hour [[television pilot|pilot program]] and two two-hour episodes) for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). A shortened version of the three-hour pilot, ''[[Saga of a Star World]]'', was screened in Canadian theaters (before the TV series was [[broadcasting|telecast]]) and in American, European and Australian theaters later on. Instead of two additional TV movies, ABC decided to commission a weekly TV series of one-hour episodes.

In 1979 at the sixth annual [[People's Choice Awards]], the TV series won in the category of "Best New TV Drama Series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |title=People's Choice Awards Past Winners: 1979 |publisher=pcavote.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2009  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102023849/http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first episode of the TV series (the long pilot TV movie) was broadcast on September 17, 1978. However, about 30 minutes before the end, that broadcast was interrupted by the announcement of the signing of the Egyptian–Israeli [[Camp David Accords]]. After the interruption (which was nearly an hour in length), the episode picked back up where it left off.

During the eight months after the pilot's first broadcast, 17 original episodes of the series were made (five of them two-part shows), equivalent to a standard 24-episode TV season. Citing declining ratings and cost overruns, ABC canceled ''Battlestar Galactica'' in April 1979. Its final episode "[[The Hand of God (1978 Battlestar Galactica)|The Hand of God]]" was telecast on April 29, 1979.

===''Galactica 1980''===
{{Main|Galactica 1980}}

During the autumn of 1979, ABC executives met with ''Battlestar Galactica''{{'}}s creator [[Glen A. Larson]] to consider restarting the series. A suitable concept was needed to draw viewers, and it was decided that the arrival of the Colonial Fleet at present-day Earth would be the storyline. A new [[TV movie]] called  ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' was produced. Again, it was decided this new version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' would be made into a weekly TV series. Despite the early success of the premiere, this program failed to achieve the popularity of the original series, and it was canceled after just ten episodes.

In this 1980 sequel series, the Colonial fleet finds the Earth, and then it covertly protects it from the Cylons. This series was a quick failure due to its low budget (e.g., recycling footage from the 1974 [[Universal Studios]] movie [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] during a [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] attack sequence), widely panned writing, and ill-chosen time slot (Sunday evenings, a time generally reserved for family-oriented programming and, more specifically, also for the ''[[60 Minutes]]'' newsmagazine program). The TV series also had to adhere to strict content restrictions such as limiting the number of acts of violence and being required to shoehorn educational content into the script and dialogue.

To cut costs, the show was set mostly on the contemporary Earth, to the great dismay of fans. Another factor for fan apathy was the nearly complete recasting of the original series: [[Lorne Greene]] reprised his role as Adama (working unpaid),{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Herb Jefferson, Jr.]] played "Colonel" Boomer in about half of the episodes (with little screentime), and [[Dirk Benedict]] as Starbuck for one episode (the abrupt final episode, though his character was to have also appeared in the unfilmed episode "Wheel of Fire", which was a semi-sequel to "The Return of Starbuck"). [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] (Apollo in the original series) was sent a script for ''Galactica 1980'', but he turned it down since he was not sure what his part in the series would be now that all the characters had changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galactica.tv/battlestar-galactica-1978---interviews/richard-hatch-galactica.tv-interview.html |title=Richard Hatch GALACTICA.TV interview |author=Mike Egnor |publisher=www.galactica.tv |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[television syndication|TV syndication]] packages for ''Battlestar Galactica'' incorporate the episodes of this series.

===Cinema releases===
Besides a re-edited version of the [[Saga of a Star World|pilot]], released in Canada, Europe, parts of Latin America, and, following the broadcast of the series, in the U.S., two other ''Battlestar Galactica'' feature films were released in cinemas. ''Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack'' and ''Conquest of the Earth'' were made up of various episodes of the original series and ''Galactica 1980'' respectively. (See [[List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes#Theatrical releases|List of ''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978 TV series) and ''Galactica 1980'' episodes § Theatrical releases]])

==Attempted revivals==
The original series maintained a [[cult television|cult]] fandom, which has supported efforts by Glen A. Larson, Richard Hatch, and [[Bryan Singer]] (independently of one another) to revive the premise.

Richard Hatch produced a demonstration video in 1998–99 which featured several actors from the original series combined with state-of-the-art special effects. This video, titled ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming]]'', was screened at some [[science fiction convention]]s, but it did not lead to a new series.

In 1999, the [[film producer|producer]] of [[Wing Commander (film)|''Wing Commander'']], Todd Moyer, and the producer of the original TV series, Glen Larson, announced plans to produce a [[motion picture]] based on the TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=3247 |title = Galactica Reborn (Todd Moyer talks to Glen about the new movie, Richard Hatch press release, etc.!!!)|author=Glen Oliver|publisher= Ain't it cool news |date=March 16, 1999|accessdate= June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue117/news.html |title=Science Fiction News of the Week |publisher=Scifi |date= | accessdate =February 25, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430050608/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue117/news.html | archivedate = April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.battlestargalactica.com/outside_docs/bg_outdoc0016.htm |title=Battlestar Atlantis – The Glen Larson/Todd Moyer partnership |publisher=Battlestar Galactica |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304025525/http://www.battlestargalactica.com/outside_docs/bg_outdoc0016.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have featured [[Battlestar Pegasus|Battlestar ''Pegasus'']].

In 2000, the director and an executive producer of the [[X-Men (film)|''X-Men'']] movie, Bryan Singer and [[Tom DeSanto]], began developing a ''Battlestar Galactica'' [[TV miniseries]]  under the auspices of [[Studios USA]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox TV network]]. A continuation of the original series but set 25 years later, Singer and DeSanto's version included several members of the original cast reprising their original roles and the introduction of newer characters. It was intended to be telecast as a [[television pilot#Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] in May 2002, and pre-production commenced and sets had even been partially constructed with a view to filming starting in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=8230 | title = A New Battlestar Galactica Series Is Coming!|author=El Cosmico|publisher= Ain't it cool news |date= February 22, 2001 | accessdate = June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, production delays caused by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] meant that Bryan Singer had to drop out, due to his commitment to direct the [[X2 (film)|''X-Men 2'']] movie. This caused the executives of Fox TV to lose interest in this project.

==Reimagined series==

===''The Miniseries''===
{{Main|Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)}}
Despite attempts to revive the series over the years, none came to fruition until it was [[reboot (continuity)|reimagined]] in 2003 by [[Universal Television]] as ''[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', a three-hour [[miniseries]]. Commissioned by the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]], screenwriter [[Ronald D. Moore]] and producer [[David Eick]] were the creative forces behind it. [[Academy Award]]-nominated actor [[Edward James Olmos]] was cast in the role of [[William Adama|Commander Adama]], while two-time Academy Award nominee [[Mary McDonnell]] was cast as [[Laura Roslin|President Laura Roslin]].

The new TV series was co-funded by the UK's [[BSKYB|Sky Television]], and premiered in the United Kingdom on the [[Sky1]] satellite channel in October 2004. The series was then broadcast in North America on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in January 2005. Continuing where the 2003 mini-series left off, the main cast all returned to reprise their roles. Several new characters were introduced, and [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]], who played Captain Apollo in the 1970s ''Battlestar Galactica'' TV series, also appeared in several episodes as [[Tom Zarek]], a former political terrorist who later becomes part of the new Colonial government.

An edited version of the pilot [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|miniseries]] was aired on [[NBC]] on January 9, 2005, five days before the Sci-Fi series premiere. NBC also aired three selected first-season episodes to promote the show in advance of the second-season premiere in July 2005. The series ran for four seasons between 2004 and 2009. The second season was split into two halves screened several months apart. Due to production delays caused by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|2007–2008 Writers Guild strike]], the fourth season was also split into two parts, with a seven-month hiatus in between.

The series has won widespread critical acclaim among many mainstream non-SF-genre publications. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1141640,00.html|title=Best of 2005: Television|date=December 16, 2005|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New York Newsday]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/ny-fftv4561321dec25,0,795582.story ''New York Newsday Dec. 25, 2005'']   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050424/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/ny-fftv4561321dec25%2C0%2C795582.story |date=January 22, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; named it the best show on television in 2005.

===''Razor''===
{{Main|Battlestar Galactica: Razor}}

''Battlestar Galactica: Razor'' is a 2007 [[television movie]] produced and broadcast in the gap between Seasons 3 and 4 of the re-imagined series. ''Razor'' is also the first two episodes of Season 4 though it chronicles events on [[Battlestar Pegasus|Battlestar ''Pegasus'']] in two time periods, both of which are "in the past" with respect to the Season 4 continuity. The "present day" framing scenes are set during Lee Adama's command of the ''Pegasus'' in the latter half of Season 2, while "flashback" scenes depict [[Helena Cain]]'s command in the period between the Cylon attack (shown in the 2003 mini-series) and the reunion with the ''Galactica'' in the second season. It aired in the United States and Canada on November 24, 2007 and in the UK and Ireland on December 18, 2007. An expanded version of the movie was released on DVD on December 4, 2007.

===Webisodes===
{{Main|Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance|Battlestar Galactica: Razor Flashbacks|Battlestar Galactica: The Face of the Enemy}}

The first set of [[webisode]]s were a series of shorts produced in 2006 to promote the third season of the re-imagined show. Made as an "optional extra" to Season 3, the webisodes filled in some of the events between the second and third seasons and featured some of the main cast, though did not reveal what would happen in the beginning of Season 3, nor was viewing them essential to follow the story of the third season. Each of the ten webisodes was approximately three minutes long, and they were released twice a week leading up to the U.S. Season 3 premiere in 2006.

The ''Razor Flashbacks'' were a series of seven webisodes produced in 2007, set some 40 years earlier during William Adama's fighter pilot days during the later stages of the [[First Cylon War]]. They were released on the Internet as "webisodes" leading up to ''Razor'''s release. They are now available on the DVD and Blu-Ray releases of ''Battlestar Galactica: Razor'', and some are inserted into both the broadcast and extended cuts of the movie on DVD and Blu-Ray. The installments that did not make the final cut include 1, 2, and the latter half of 7.

In May 2008, a set of 10 webisodes were announced to be in the works which were released during the seven-month hiatus between episodes 10 and 11 of Season 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/battlestar-galactica-2003/show/23557/episode.html?season=All&amp;tag=list_header;paginator;All/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913073009/http://www.tv.com/battlestar-galactica-2003/show/23557/episode.html?season=All&amp;tag=list_header;paginator;All/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-09-13|title=Battlestar Galactica|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''The Face of the Enemy'', the web series premiered on December 12, 2008 on SciFi.com. Again, viewing of the webisodes was optional prior to the second half of Season 4.

===''The Plan''===
{{Main|Battlestar Galactica: The Plan}}

In August 2008, the Sci Fi Channel announced the production of a two-hour TV movie which was planned to air after the final episode of the series in 2009.

===''Caprica''===
{{Main|Caprica (TV series)}}

''Caprica'' is a [[prequel]] television series to the re-imagined ''Battlestar Galactica''. It premiered on Syfy (formerly Sci-Fi) on January 22, 2010, and was described as "television's first science fiction [[family saga]]". It was a two-hour [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilots|back door pilot]] for a possible weekly television series, but on December 2, 2008, Syfy gave the go-ahead to expand the project into a full, 20-episode series. ''Caprica'' is set on the [[Caprica (planet)|titular planet]], 58 years before the events of ''Battlestar Galactica''. The show revolves around two families, the Adamas and the Graystones, and the creation of the Cylons.

The pilot was directed by [[Jeffrey Reiner]] and starred [[Eric Stoltz]], [[Esai Morales]], [[Paula Malcomson]], [[Alessandra Torresani]], and [[Polly Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20090205/LA6740805022009-1.html|title=The Highly Anticipated Feature-Length Prequel to the Series Phenomenon, 'Battlestar Galactica' Premiering Exclusively on DVD and Digital Download, Caprica|publisher=Universal Studios Home Entertainment|date=April 21, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209101632/http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20090205/LA6740805022009-1.html|archivedate=February 9, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was released on DVD on April 21, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capricadvd.com/|title=Caprica DVD Premiere Announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series was broadcast in January 2010.

On October 27, 2010, Syfy canceled ''Caprica'' due to low ratings.

The entire series was released on DVD in 2011.

===''Blood &amp; Chrome''===
{{Main|Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome}}

''Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome'' was to be a spin-off series from the re-imagined ''Battlestar Galactica'' series.&lt;ref name=greenlit&gt;[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/10/22/syfy-greenlights-battlestar-galactica-blood-chrome/69283 Syfy Greenlights "Battlestar Galactica: Blood &amp; Chrome"], ''TV By the Numbers'', October 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Syfy approached show runner Ronald D. Moore to produce another spin-off set in the reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'' universe, which was to begin as a two-hour pilot focused on William "Husker" Adama (portrayed by [[Luke Pasqualino]]) during the First Cylon War (as was glimpsed in ''Razor'' and the corresponding webisodes).

Syfy decided against moving forward with the ''Blood and Chrome'' TV series, but on November 5, 2012 it was announced that a 10-part webseries would begin on November 9, 2012 and be released over four weeks via [[Machinima.com]].

==Comic books==
{{Main|Battlestar Galactica (comics)}}

A series of comic book publishers have adapted ''Battlestar Galactica'' since its inception.

[[Marvel Comics]] published a 23-issue comic book series based upon the show between 1978 and 1981. Walt Simonson, who later wrote and drew ''Thor'' and had a long stint on Marvel's ''Star Wars'' comic, was the artist for the series at its conclusion. Other comics have since been published by [[Maximum Press]], Grandreams, ''[[Look-in]]'' magazine, Realm Press, and [[Dynamite Comics]]. Of all these series, only those by Marvel, Grandreams, and ''Look-In'' completed their storylines and brought the story to a conclusion. All the other series were cancelled at various points during their run, with no resolutions.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Grandreams and ''Look-In'' comic strips take place early in the series. The other comic series based on the 1978 series have been set after the final episode of the series and ignored ''[[Galactica 1980]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Maximum Press series began with the discovery of a completely unpopulated Earth some fifteen years after the TV show. The look and the feel of the comics was changed considerably from the series, to give the stories a "more nineties" feel.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Realm Press series picked up immediately after the original series' final episode, in an attempt to present what they called "Season Two" of the original show.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[Dynamite Entertainment]] was the last company to publish comic books featuring both the classic and reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'' series. They also released a 4-issue ''Galactica 1980'' comic miniseries written by [[Marc Guggenheim]]. The limited miniseries was a re-imagining of the original series but at the end featured a second, smaller ''Battlestar'' (replacing the original which was destroyed) also named ''Galactica'' but strongly resembling the ship seen in the reimagined Sci-Fi Channel series.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Books==
Both the original and the reimagined series have had books published about the series, academically oriented analysis, novelizations, and new works based on the characters.

===Original series books===
These ''Battlestar Galactica'' softcover novelisations were written by [[Glen A. Larson]] with the authors listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM08001.html|title=Guide to the TV Tie-in Book Collection, 1945–1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were critically disparaged, but proved popular, with the first novel selling over a million copies within its first year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K9P1T0doSpkC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22doc+savage%22+%22million+copies%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WSPGvjK82A&amp;sig=fiyoIBn5u45n3Xitu65gYfCNugA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjiLSCq-_TAhUI92MKHf28DfMQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22doc%20savage%22%20%22million%20copies%22&amp;f=false Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Book Review] Feb. 1979 issue&lt;/ref&gt; The first ten novels adapt the episode of the same title except as indicated. All novels except ''Battlestar Galactica 14: Surrender the Galactica!'' (ACE publishing) were originally published by Berkley, and have been republished, recently, by I Books, which called them ''Battlestar Galactica Classic'' to differentiate it from the reimagined series. The episodic novels featured expanded scenes, excerpts from "The Adama Journals," more background on the characters, and the expansion of the ragtag fleet to almost 22,000 ships as opposed to the 220 in the TV series. A new book series written by series star [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] starting in the 1990s continued the original story based on his attempt to revive the series, and ignored the events of ''[[Galactica 1980]].'' His series picked up several years after the TV series ended, and featured Apollo in command of the ''Galactica'' after the death of Adama, a grown-up Boxey, who was now a Viper pilot, and the rediscovery of Commander Cain and the battlestar ''Pegasus,'' who had started a new colony and was preparing to restart the war with the Cylons.

The original series inspired a ''Battlestar Galactica'' board game. The game is set during a training mission, where two to four players maneuver pieces representing Colonial Vipers to capture a damaged [[Cylon Raider]]. Play includes using terrain elements and a number of special-ability cards to the players' advantage.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 1978, [[Mattel Electronics]] released a handheld electronic [[LED]] game based on the series.

In 1979, [[FASA]] released a tabletop counter piece game for ''Battlestar Galactica'' based on the fighter combat, which included the ''Galactica'' and a Cylon Basestar to be launched from, attack with and be attacked/defended. The counters for the Vipers and the Raiders included three model versions MKI/MKII/MKIII, not just the MKII Viper and Raider MKI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathaniel Dragon dragon76n |url=http://www.dragonshobbies.com/games/pageb.html |title=B Games |publisher=DragonsHobbies.com |date= |accessdate=March 12, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090129233419/http://dragonshobbies.com/games/pageb.html| archivedate= January 29, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WizKids|Wiz Kids, Inc.]] (a collectible game manufacturer) produced the ''[[Battlestar Galactica Collectable Card Game]]'' based on the 2003 mini-series and 2004 TV show. The premier set of this game was released in May 2006. After the release of one expansion set, Wizkids announced the game's cancellation on March 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizkidsgames.com/battlestar/article.asp?a=41315 Battlestar Galactica Collectible Card Game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510040956/http://www.wizkidsgames.com/battlestar/article.asp?a=41315 |date=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fantasy Flight Games]] produced ''[[Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game]]'', based on the 2003 re-imagined series. It is a semi-cooperative game of strategy for 3–6 players with some players being Cylon agents, either aware at start of the game or become aware later, as [[Sleeper agent]]s. Each of the 10 playable character has its own abilities and weaknesses, and they must all work together in order for humanity to survive, as well as attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threaten to tear the fleet apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111|title=Battlestar Galactica – Board Game – BoardGameGeek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, a "''Pegasus'' expansion" to the board game was announced, adding seven new characters and extra gameboards representing ''Battlestar Pegasus'' and ''New Caprica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=596|title=Evolution and Rebellion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further expansion, ''Exodus'' was released in December 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1865|title=The Exodus is Nigh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Daybreak'', the final expansion, was released in Summer of 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="947">'''Chukjibeop''' (축지법) is a [[Korean-language]] term translated as 'distance-shrinking magic' and refers a hypothetical method of contracting physical distance. It is similar to supernatural speed or [[teleportation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.korean-pavilion.or.kr/15pavilion/introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The concept of 'Chukjibeop' is common to East Asian mythology. The equivalent Chinese term is [[Qinggong]] while the Japanese word is [[Shukuchi]]. A related Korean term is 'Bihaengsul' meaning a supernatural power to levitate, fly and travel across time and space.

The term appears in the title of a popular [[North Korea]]n song called 'General uses Chukjibeop' about [[Kim-jong il]]. As part of the [[North Korean cult of personality]] the leaders of North Korea have been credited with this ability.

[[Entomology|Entomologists]] widely prefer the names '''ladybird beetles''' or '''lady beetles''' as these [[insect]]s are not classified as [[Hemiptera|true bugs]].&lt;ref&gt;White, R.E. 1983. A field guide to the beetles of North America. Peterson Field Guide Series #29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of coccinellid species are generally considered useful insects, because many species prey on herbivorous [[homoptera]]ns such as [[aphid]]s or [[scale insect]]s, which are agricultural pests.  Many coccinellids lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies in order to ensure their larvae have an immediate food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/ladybug/?source=A-to-Z|title=Ladybugs, Ladybug Pictures, Ladybug Facts – National Geographic|first=National Geographic|last=Society|publisher=|accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most prominent are of the subfamily [[Epilachninae]] (which includes the [[Mexican bean beetle]]), which are herbivorous themselves. Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase explosively in years when their natural enemies, such as [[parasitoid]] wasps that attack their eggs, are few. In such situations, they can do major crop damage. They occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries.

==Etymology==
The name ''coccinellids'' is derived from the Latin word ''coccineus'' meaning "scarlet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Brown, L.|year=2007|edition=6|volume=1|pages=441}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "ladybird" originated in Britain where the insects became known as "Our Lady's bird" or the Lady beetle.&lt;ref name="ladybird-survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladybird-survey.org/lots_about.aspx|title=Why are ladybirds so-called?|last=Anonymous|work=UK Ladybird survey|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/questions/yq/ladybug.html|title=Marian Roots of the Name|last=Samaha|first=John M.|work=Our Lady's Bug|publisher=International Marian Research Institute|accessdate=15 October 2010|location=Dayton, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] (Our Lady) was often depicted wearing a red cloak in early paintings, and the spots of the seven-spot ladybird (the most common in Europe) were said to symbolise her [[Seven Joys of the Virgin|seven joys]] and [[Our Lady of Sorrows|seven sorrows]].&lt;ref name="ladybird-survey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Helen E.|last2=Brown et al|first2=Peter M.J.|title=Ladybirds|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Pelagic publishing|isbn=9781907807077|pages=142|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the name was adapted to "ladybug". Common names in some other European languages have the same association, for example, the German name ''Marienkäfer'' translates to Marybeetle.&lt;ref name="Florida"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/beneficial/lady_beetles.htm|title=common name: ladybirds, ladybird beetles, lady beetles, ladybugs (of Florida)|last=Anonymous|work=Featured creatures|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Coccinellids are often conspicuously coloured yellow, orange, or red with small black spots on their [[elytra|wing covers]], with black legs, heads and [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. There is, however, great variation in these colour patterns. For example, a minority of species, such as ''[[Vibidia duodecimguttata]]'', a twelve-spotted species, have whitish spots on a brown background. Coccinellids are found worldwide, with over 6,000 species described.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Allen &amp; Tudor Humphries (2000). ''Are You A Ladybug?'', Kingfisher, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.zin.ru/animalia/coleoptera/addpages/Andrey_Ukrainsky_Library/References_files/Seago11-proof2.pdf|title = Phylogeny, classification and evolution of ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) based on simultaneous analysis of molecular and morphological data|last = Seago|first = Ainsley E.|date = 15 March 2011|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2011.03.015|pmid = 21426943|access-date = 14 February 2016|last2 = Giorgi|first2 = Jose Adriano|last3 = Li|last4 = Slipinski|first3 = Jiahui|first4 = Adam|volume=60|pages=137–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Clitostethus arcuatus cycle.jpg|thumb|right|''Clitostethus arcuatus'' larva, pupa and adults]]

Most coccinellids have round to elliptical, dome-shaped bodies with six short legs. Depending on the species, they can have spots, stripes, or no markings at all. Seven-spotted coccinellids are red or orange with three spots on each side and one in the middle; they have a black head with white patches on each side.

As well as the usual yellow and deep red colourings, many coccinellid species are mostly, or entirely, black, dark grey, gray, or brown, and may be difficult for non-entomologists to recognise as coccinellids at all. Conversely, non-entomologists might easily mistake many other small beetles for coccinellids. For example, the [[tortoise beetle]]s, like the ladybird beetles, look similar because they are shaped so that they can cling to a flat surface so closely that ants and many other enemies cannot grip them.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Non-entomologists are prone to misidentify a wide variety of beetle species in other families as "ladybirds", i.e. coccinellids. Beetles are particularly prone to such misidentification if they are spotted in red, orange or yellow and black. Examples include the much larger [[Scarabaeidae|scarabaeid]] [[grapevine beetles]] and spotted species of the [[Chrysomelidae]], [[Melyridae]] and others. Conversely, laymen may fail to identify unmarked species of Coccinellidae as "ladybirds". Other beetles that have a defensive hemispherical shape, like that of the Coccinellidae (for example the [[Tortoise beetle|Cassidinae]]), also are often taken for ladybirds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

A common myth, totally unfounded, is that the number of spots on the insect's back indicates its age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything-ladybug.com/ladybug-spots.html |title=Everything Ladybug! The source for Ladybug Stuff! |publisher=Everything-ladybug.com |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladybird-survey.org/lots_about.aspx|title=Ladybird spotters|last=Anonymous|work=UK Ladybird survey|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the underlying pattern and colouration are determined by the species and genetics of the beetle, and develop as the insect matures. In some species its appearance is fixed by the time it emerges from its [[pupa]], though in most it may take some days for the colour of the adult beetle to mature and stabilise. Generally, the mature colour tends to be fuller and darker than the colour of the [[Wiktionary:callow|callow]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

''[[Paraplectana tsushimensis]]'' is an Asian spider that mimics ladybirds.

[[File:Coccinellidae (Ladybug) Anatomy.svg|thumb|Basic anatomy of a ladybird]]

Coccinellids are best known as [[predator]]s of [[Sternorrhyncha]] such as [[aphids]] and [[scale insects]], but the range of prey species that various Coccinellidae may attack is much wider. A genus of small black ladybirds, ''Stethorus'', presents one example of predation on non-Sternorrhyncha; they specialise in mites as prey, notably ''[[Tetranychus]]'' spider mites. ''Stethorus'' species accordingly are important in certain examples of [[Biological pest control|biological control]].&lt;ref name="HHEE"&gt;Hodek, Ivo; Honek, A. ; van Emden, Helmut F. Ecology and Behaviour of the Ladybird Beetles. Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell 2012. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-8422-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are natural predators of a range of serious pests, such as the [[European corn borer]], a moth that costs US agriculture industry more than $1 billion annually in crop losses and population control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/field/e_corn_borer.htm |title=European corn borer - Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner)|website=entnemdept.ufl.edu|access-date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ent.iastate.edu/pest/cornborer/insect |title=The European Corn Borer |website=www.ent.iastate.edu |access-date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various larger species of Coccinellidae attack caterpillars and other beetle larvae.&lt;ref name="HHEE" /&gt; Several genera feed on various insects or their eggs; for example, ''[[Coleomegilla]]'' species are significant predators of the eggs and larvae of moths such as species of ''[[Spodoptera]]'' and the [[Plutellidae]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger, Caroline. Mechanisms of Prey Selection in the Ladybeetle ''Coleomegilla maculata''. Thesis. Department of Natural Resource Sciences. Macdonald campus of McGill University Montréal. Canada 1999 {{ISBN|0-612-50249-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larvae and eggs of ladybirds, either their own or of other species, can also be an important [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalistic]] food resource when alternative prey are scarce. As a family, the Coccinellidae used to be regarded as purely carnivorous,&lt;ref name="JohnSmart"&gt;{{cite book | last = Smart | first = John | title = British Museum (Natural History) Instructions for Collectors NO. 4A. Insects | publisher = Trustees of the British Museum | location = London | year = 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are now known to be far more omnivorous than previously thought, both as a family and in individual species; examination of gut contents of apparently specialist predators commonly yield residues of pollen and other plant materials. Besides the prey they favour, most predatory coccinellids include other items in their diets, including honeydew, pollen, plant sap, nectar, and various fungi. The significance of such nonprey items in their diets is still under investigation and discussion.&lt;ref name="ACGG"&gt;Almeida, Lúcia M. ; Corrêa, Geovan H. Giorgi, José A. ; Grossi, Paschoal C. New record of predatory ladybird beetle (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) feeding on extrafloral nectaries. Revista Brasileira de Entomologia 55(3): 447–450, setembro, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the generalist aphid and scale predators and incidental substances of botanical origin, many Coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types. This makes some of them particularly valuable as agents in biological control programmes. Determination of specialisation need not be a trivial matter, though; for example the larva of the Vedalia ladybird ''[[Rodolia cardinalis]]'' is a specialist predator on a few species of [[Monophlebidae]], in particular ''[[Icerya purchasi]]'', which is the most notorious of the cottony cushion scale species. However, the adult ''R. cardinalis'' can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, D. P. A. and R. G. Van Driesche. 2000. Evaluating host specificity of agents for biological control of arthropods: rationale, methodology and interpretation, pp. 69-83. In Van Driesche, R. G., T. A. Heard, A. S. McClay, and R. Reardon (eds.). Proceedings of Session: Host Specificity Testing of Exotic Arthropod Biological Control Agents: The Biological Basis for Improvement in Safety. Xth International Symposium on Biological Control of Weeds. 4–14 July 1999. Bozeman, Montana. U.S.D.A. Forest Service Bulletin FHTET-99-1, Morgantown, West Virginia, U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain species of coccinellids are thought to lay extra infertile eggs with the fertile eggs, apparently to provide a backup food source for the larvae when they hatch. The ratio of infertile to fertile eggs increases with scarcity of food at the time of egg laying. Such a strategy amounts to the production of [[trophic egg]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. Perry &amp; B. Roitberg |year=2005 |title=Ladybird mothers mitigate offspring starvation risk by laying trophic eggs |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=58 |pages=578–586 |doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0947-1 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species in the subfamily [[Epilachninae]] are [[herbivore]]s, and can be very destructive [[agricultural pest]]s (e.g., the [[Mexican bean beetle]]). Again, in the subfamily Coccinellinae, members of the tribe Halyziini and the genus ''Tythaspis'' are [[Fungivore|mycophagous]].
[[File:Colorado ladybugs.jpg|thumb|upright|Aggregating ladybirds in Colorado Springs, Colorado]]
While predatory species are often used as [[biological control]] agents, introduced species of coccinellids are not necessarily benign. Species such as ''[[Harmonia axyridis]]'' or ''[[Coccinella septempunctata]]'' in North America outcompete and displace native coccinellids and become pests themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treknature.com/gallery/photo268028.htm|title=TrekNature – LADY BEETLES Photo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main predators of coccinellids are usually birds, but they are also the prey of frogs, wasps, spiders, and dragonflies. The bright colours of many coccinellids discourage some potential predators from making a meal of them. This phenomenon, called [[aposematism]], works because predators learn by experience to associate certain prey [[phenotype]]s with a bad taste. A further defence, known as "[[reflex bleeding]]", exists in which an alkaloid toxin is exuded through the joints of the exoskeleton, triggered by mechanical stimulation (such as by predator attack) in both larval and adult beetles, deterring feeding.

Coccinellids in temperate regions enter [[diapause]] during the winter, so they often are among the first insects to appear in the spring. Some species (e.g., ''[[Hippodamia convergens]]'') gather into groups and move to higher elevations, such as a mountain, to enter diapause.

Most coccinellids [[Overwintering|overwinter]] as adults, aggregating on the south sides of large objects such as trees or houses during the winter months, dispersing in response to increasing day length in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Honek, Z. Martinkova &amp; S. Pekar |year=2007 |title=Aggregation characteristics of three species of Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) at hibernation sites |journal=[[European Journal of Entomology]] |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=51–56 |url=http://www.icbugs.ca/eje_104_1_051_Honek.pdf |doi=10.14411/eje.2007.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predatory coccinellids are usually found on plants which harbour their prey. They lay their eggs near their prey, to increase the likelihood the larvae will find the prey easily. In ''Harmonia axyridis'', eggs hatch in three to four days from clutches numbering from a few to several dozen. Depending on resource availability, the larvae pass through four [[instar]]s over 10–14 days, after which [[pupa]]tion occurs. After a [[teneral]] period of several days, the adults become reproductively active and are able to reproduce again later, although they may become reproductively quiescent if [[Pupa#Emergence|eclosing]] late in the season. Total life span is one to two years on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/life-span-ladybug-12100736.html|title=What Is the Life Span of a Ladybug?|website=Sciencing|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population shift in Great Britain and Ireland===
The atlas ''Ladybirds (Coccinellidae) of Britain and Ireland'' published in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy |first=Helen|author2=Peter Brown |author3=Robert Frost |author4=Remy Poland |title=Ladybirds (Coccinellidae) of Britain and Ireland|publisher=The Field Studies Council|date=15 June 2011|page=204|isbn=978-1-906698-20-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed a decline of more than 20% in native species due to environmental changes and competition from foreign invaders. The distribution maps, compiled over a 20-year period with help from thousands of volunteers, showed a decline in the numbers of the common 10-spot and 14-spot ladybirds and a number of other species, including the 11-spot, 22-spot, cream-spot, water and [[Coccinella hieroglyphica|hieroglyphic ladybirds]], ''Coccidula rufa, Rhyzobius litura'' and ''Nephus redtenbacheri''. Conversely, increases were seen in the numbers of harlequin, orange, pine, and 24-spot ladybirds, as well as ''Rhyzobius chrysomeloides''. The kidney spot ladybird was recorded in Scotland for the first time in recent years, and the 13-spot was found to have recolonised [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], and the [[New Forest]]. The most commonly recorded species was the 7-spot, closely followed by the Asian harlequin&amp;nbsp;— an invader that arrived from continental Europe in 2003 after being introduced to control pests. An 'explosion' in the number of orange ladybirds, which feed on mildew, is thought to have been due to the warmer, damper conditions that now prevail in parts of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spot check finds Britain's native ladybirds struggling to compete with alien invaders|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=15 June 2011|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Newspapers ltd.|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/15/british-ladybird-species-struggling|page=3|accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to humans==
===Infestations===
[[File:Ladybugs wide angle.JPG|thumb|Coccinellids covering a branch]]

In the United States, coccinellids usually begin to appear indoors in the autumn when they leave their summer feeding sites in fields, forests, and yards and search out places to spend the winter. Typically, when temperatures warm to the mid-60s F (around 18&amp;nbsp;°C) in the late afternoon, following a period of cooler weather, they will swarm onto or into buildings illuminated by the sun. Swarms of coccinellids fly to buildings in September through November depending on location and weather conditions. Homes or other buildings near fields or woods are particularly prone to infestation.&lt;ref&gt;University of Kentucky-College of Agriculture Cooperative Extension Service&lt;/ref&gt;

After an abnormally long period of hot, dry weather in the [[Summer of 1976 (Europe)|summer of 1976 in the UK]], a marked increase in the aphid population was followed by a "plague" of ladybirds, with many reports of people being bitten as the supply of aphids dwindled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2001/7/5/166513.html |title=Phew, what a scorcher! |last=Anonymous |date=5 July 2001 |publisher=[[The Northern Echo]] |accessdate=8 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704094802/http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2001/7/5/166513.html |archivedate=4 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/may/17/water.ethicalliving|title=The great drought|first=Martin|last=Wainwright|date=17 May 2006|publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=8 April 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of coccinellids in grape harvests can cause [[ladybird taint]] in wines produced from the grapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2012/02/ladybird-contamination-on-the-rise/|title=Ladybird contamination on the rise|last=Easton|first=Sally|date=2 February 2012|work=The Drinks Business|publisher=Union Press Ltd.|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an invasive species===
''[[Harmonia axyridis]]'' (the harlequin ladybird) is an example of how an animal might be partly welcome and partly harmful. It was introduced into North America from Asia in 1916 to control aphids, but is now the most common species, outcompeting many of the native species.&lt;ref name="BBC news"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/3715120.stm|title='Deadly ladybird' sighted in UK|last=Anonymous|date=5 October 2004|publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since spread to much of western Europe, reaching the UK in 2004.&lt;ref name="BBC news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harlequin-survey.org/|title=The Harlequin Ladybird has landed!|last=Anonymous|work=The Harlequin ladybird survey|accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become something of a domestic and agricultural pest in some regions, and gives cause for ecological concern. It has similarly arrived in parts of Africa, where it has proved variously unwelcome, perhaps most prominently in vine-related crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://invasives.org.za/news-previews/item/1239-harlequin-ladybird-citizen-science-project-launched|title=Invasive Species South Africa - Protecting Biodiversity from Invasion - Harlequin ladybird citizen science project|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ladybirds have long been of interest to children. They had many regional names (now mostly disused) in English, such as variations on Bishop-Barnaby ([[Norfolk dialect|Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk dialect]])&amp;nbsp;– Barnabee, Burnabee, the [[Edmund Bonner|Bishop-that-burneth]], and bishy bishy barnabee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/the-tories-in-bournemouth-teachers-promised-support-as-shephard-calls-truce-1442798.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Nicholas | last=Timmins | title=The Tories in Bournemouth: Teachers promised support as Shephard calls truce | date=14 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Moor|title=Suffolk Words and Phrases: Or, An Attempt to Collect the Lingual Localisms of that County|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6BMLAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|year=1823|publisher=J. Loder|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology is unclear, but it may be from St. Barnabas' feast in June, when the insect appears, or a corruption of "Bishop-that-burneth", from the fiery [[elytra]] of the beetles.&lt;ref&gt;Lewie C. Roache (1960) Ladybug, Ladybug: What's in a Name? The Coleopterists Bulletin 14(1):21-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ladybird was immortalised in the popular children's [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Ladybird Ladybird]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home&lt;br /&gt;
Your house is on fire and your children are gone&lt;br /&gt;
All except one, and that's Little Anne&lt;br /&gt;
For she has crept under the [[Bed warmer|warming pan]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This poem has its counterpart in German as ''Marienwürmchen,'' collected in ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'', and set to music by [[Robert Schumann]] as Op. 79, No. 13, and a [[Poland|Polish]] [[nursery rhyme]], "Little Ladybirds' Anthem", of which a part ("fly to the sky, little ladybird, bring me a piece of bread") became a saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ppmalomice.szkolnastrona.pl/index.php?p=m&amp;idg=zt,50,90|title=szkolnastrona – Przedszkole Publiczne im.

Many cultures consider ladybirds lucky and have nursery rhymes or local names for the insects that reflect this. For instance, the Turkish name for the insect is ''uğur böceği'', literally meaning "good luck bug". In many countries, including Russia, Turkey, and Italy, the sight of a coccinellid is either a call to make a wish or a sign that a wish will soon be granted.

In Christian areas, they are often associated with the [[Virgin Mary]] and the name that the insect bears in the various languages of [[Europe]] corresponds to this. Although historically many European languages referenced [[Freyja]], the [[fertility]] [[goddess]] of [[Norse mythology]], in the names, the Virgin Mary has now largely supplanted her, so that, for example, ''freyjuhœna'' ([[Old Norse]]) and ''Frouehenge'' have been changed into ''marihøne'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]) and ''Marienkäfer'' ([[German language|German]]), which corresponds with [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]]'s bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Notes and Queries]] |volume=9 |date=29 December 1849 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13521/13521-h/13521-h.htm#page132 |title=Bishop Barnaby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the insect is referred to as belonging directly to God ([[Irish language|Irish]] ''bóín Dé'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''boża krówka'', [[Russian language|Russian]] божья коровка (''bozhya korovka''), all meaning "God's [little] cow").&lt;ref name="DEX Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=7083 |title=dexonline |publisher= |df=dmy }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is called ''lieveheersbeestje'', meaning "little animal of our Good Lord". In both [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], it is called "[[Moshe Rabbenu]]'s (i.e. Moses's) little cow" or "little horse", apparently an adaptation from Slavic languages. Occasionally, it is called "little [[Messiah]]".&lt;ref name="wex"&gt;''Born to Kvetch'', [[Michael Wex]], St. Martin's Press, New York, 2005, {{ISBN|0-312-30741-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coming Out Simulator 2014''''' is an [[interactive fiction]] [[video game]] made by Canadian developer Nicky Case. The [[semi-autobiographical]] game was released on 1 July 2014 as a submission for the Nar8 Game Jam.&lt;ref name="Nar8 Jam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nar8 Jam - itch.io|url=http://itch.io/jam/nar8-jam|website=itch.io |accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/07/11/games-for-lgbt-audience-are-finally-hitting-the-market/|publisher=''[[VentureBeat]]''|title=Games for LGBT audience are finally hitting the market|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by real-life events, ''Coming Out Simulator 2014'' is intended to help [[LGBT]] youth to understand their sexuality. The game teaches what happens in conversations about coming out. According to Case's writing in the game itself, there are "no right answers."&lt;ref name="VentureBeat" /&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Coming Out Simulator - start.jpg|thumb|right|Case talking to the player at the beginning of the game.]]
The player is initially introduced into the game by the creator himself, and is made aware that they will play the role of a younger Case and be faced with decisions and events that may or may not have happened in his own life. The player must choose a selection of responses to say in conversation with other characters, in a user interface deliberately stylized to look like a [[instant messaging application]]. The characters in ''Coming Out Simulator'' respond to the choices of the player.

Kotaku reported that Case presented the game as a crossover between ''[[The Walking Dead (video game series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and [[text messaging]], and Case himself concurs with this description.&lt;ref name="LeJacq 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/a-video-game-that-really-gets-what-it-means-to-come-out-1604809982|title=A Video Game That Really Gets What It Means To Come Out|publisher=''[[Kotaku]]''|last=LeJacq|first=Yannick|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes fifteen to twenty minutes to complete.&lt;ref name="LeJacq 2014" /&gt;

==Plot==
The player meets Nicky Case, the author of this game, in a Starbucks coding. Case introduces himself and explains that the game he is working on, while it is based on their life experiences, is "100% lies", and will be 100% even if the dialogue were 100% true. The game flashes back to a night during dinner in 2010. The player controls the dialogue, selecting from one of three options, knowing that every word they say will be remembered; they can either choose to aggressively pursue their coming out to homophobic parents, lie to keep their relationship secret, or "gradually hint at it" (i.e. Nicky's bisexuality). Depending on the player's choice of dialogue several alterations to the ending may occur: e.g. Nicky's mother forces him to change schools, his father grounds him for apparently trivial remarks, and/or Nicky gets punched in the face. In all versions, the player has no control over Nicky's fate as his mother finds out about his relationship with a boyfriend and sets up a female tutor for him, ostensibly to help Nicky study but more importantly in an attempt to [[Gay conversion therapy|change his sexuality]]; his relationship ends three day later.
Back in the present, Nicky outlines three different possible aftermaths to the story: the lie, in which he runs away to the North Pole and finds acceptance among a new family of LGBT animals; the half-truth, in which Nicky finds that the tutor is also bisexual and befriends her, sharing their experiences as "bisexual sluts"; and the truth, which is that Case had moved to the more LGBT-friendly [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to pursue his game-developing career, distancing himself from his homophobic parents. Case remarks that in all three scenarios  [[It Gets Better Project|"It Gets Better™"]], and that in the end "he won." Nicky's new lover then arrives to pick him up and carry him off the scene as the game ends.

==Development==
Nicky Case cites [[Anna Anthropy]]'s ''[[Dys4ia]]'', a short Flash game about gender transition, as a source of inspiration for this game.&lt;ref name="Complex 2014" /&gt; ''Coming Out Simulator'' was created in two weeks for the Nar8 Game Jam.&lt;ref name="Nar8 Jam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Complex 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Indie Game Developer Nicky Case Discusses "Coming Out Simulator" and the LGBTQ Community's Relationship With Gaming|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/07/indie-game-developer-nicky-case-discusses-coming-out-simulator-lgbtq-gaming-and-the-walking-dead|website=Complex|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=22 July 2014|first=Gus|last=Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in the game are inspired by the author's own experience of coming out four years before the game's release.&lt;ref name="Complex 2014" /&gt; Case wanted to revisit this dark period of his life and tried to express a similar story with deep feelings in a video game.&lt;ref name="LeJacq 2014" /&gt; The game is created to be played on web browsers, using [[JavaScript]] and [[CSS]]; graphics were prepared using [[Adobe Flash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/236273/Road_to_the_IGF_Coming_Out_Simulator_2014.php|publisher=''[[Gamasutra]]''|title=Road to the IGF: Coming Out Simulator 2014|last=Nutt|first=Christian|date=11 February 2015|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game and its [[source code]] have been made [[public domain software]] by its developer with the [[Unlicense]].

==Reception==
[[Metro Weekly]] describes the game as "a thoughtful, sometimes funny, often heartfelt exploration of one man's own struggle to be himself" and praises its programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marr|first1=Rhuaridh|title=You need to play "Coming Out Simulator 2014"|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2014/07/you-need-to-play-coming-out-simulator-2014/|website=www.metroweekly.com|publisher=Metro Weekly|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Discourse of renewal''' is a theory in [[crisis communication]] that seeks to establish and emphasize "learning from the crisis, ethical communication, communication that is prospective in nature, and effective organizational rhetoric.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855491795|title=Effective crisis communication : moving from crisis to opportunity|last=1969-|first=Ulmer, Robert R.,|others=Sellnow, Timothy L. (Timothy Lester), 1960-, Seeger, Matthew W. (Matthew Wayne), 1957-|isbn=9781452257518|edition=Third|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=855491795}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a prospective approach, Lippett established the organizational renewal theory that would lead organizations “to higher stages progressively and to preclude a decline toward a lower stage”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7734089|title=Organization renewal : a holistic approach to organization development|last=L.|first=Lippitt, Gordon|date=1982|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=9780136418450|edition=2nd|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|oclc=7734089}}&lt;/ref&gt; of organizational recovery. With the application of discourse of renewal practices, organizations and communities “can consider developing a crisis plan and, more important, build their crisis communication skills over time”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Components of Renewal Discourse ==
Multiple stages exist within the discourse of renewal framework. Each of these different stages contain core components that provide an expectation for what an organization should achieve within each stage and provides suggestions for how the organization should progress through each stage. The four significant stages for the discourse of renewal framework are: organizational learning, ethical communication, a prospective rather than retrospective vision, and sound organizational rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191697380|title=Handbook of risk and crisis communication|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Heath, Robert L. (Robert Lawrence), 1941-, O'Hair, Dan.|isbn=9780805857788|location=New York|oclc=191697380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning ===
Organizational learning requires the organization as a whole to take account of a crisis situation and consider what caused the crisis to occur and consider how it should have been handled. Crises often make the weak parts of an organization or an organization’s response plans visible. This visibility allows these vulnerabilities to be examined and remedied in order to prevent similar failures from occurring in future crisis situations

=== Ethical communication ===
When responding to a crisis, organizations need to be honest, moral, and ethical in addressing the public and stakeholders regarding the status of the crisis and the information they know regarding its causes and consequences. If an organization engaged in unethical behavior prior to a crisis, “those lapses are eventually revealed during and after the crisis”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828737001|title=Theorizing crisis communication|last=1960-|first=Sellnow, Timothy L. (Timothy Lester),|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Seeger, Matthew W. (Matthew Wayne), 1957-|isbn=9780470659304|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=828737001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an unethical organization attempts to re-emerge after a crisis, full recovery of the organization becomes difficult because of the unethical acts committed previously.

=== Prospective versus retrospective vision ===
In order for an organization to recover, actions taken by the organization throughout the recovery process must be forward-looking and address the faults the organization faced. With consideration to the type of crisis, “issues of responsibility, harm, victimage, and blame may be subordinate to a more optimistic discourse that emphasizes moving beyond the crisis, focusing on strong value positions, responsibility to stakeholders, and growth as a result of the crisis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ulmer|first=Robert R.|last2=Sellnow|first2=Timothy L.|title=Crisis management and the discourse of renewal: understanding the potential for positive outcomes of crisis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0363811102001650|journal=Public Relations Review|volume=28|issue=4|pages=361–365|doi=10.1016/s0363-8111(02)00165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Movement to post-crisis and recovery stages suggests “organizations committed to renewal direct their messages toward the ultimate goal of rebuilding the organization so that it is more resilient to crisis, cleanly focuses on values of social responsibility, and more attentive to stakeholder needs”.

=== Effective organizational rhetoric ===
Organizations in crisis must communicate with the public and with stakeholders who are affected by that crisis. By interacting with these groups positively and expressing messages with a prospective outlook, organizational leaders can express confidence regarding the organization’s ability to overcome the crisis. In order for this confidence to be received by these audiences, organizational leaders must “frame the crisis in a way that inspires, empowers, and motivates”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the public and stakeholders regarding the future of the organization. The language and information presented by organizational leaders possesses the ability to comfort impacted stakeholders when messages are delivered positively; however, negative deliveries can instill concern in the public and stakeholders. A lack of confidence from the public and stakeholders due to the information they received can drastically impact the outcome of an organization’s renewal efforts as well as the relationship the organization has with future stakeholders in the post-crisis stage.

== Purpose ==
The discourse of renewal framework directs organizations to consider how to plan for a crisis and negotiate a crisis when they experience one. A major challenge organizations face when planning for a crisis or when they are attempting to manage a crisis situation is the image they convey throughout the recovery and the overall implications of a crisis. It is important that an organization seizes the opportunity to  situate the minds of the public and of stakeholders regarding what the crisis means for that organization. A prospective outlook and a plan for direct, honest, and informative communication and recovery allows organizations to establish a positive reputation when responding to a crisis. By engaging in positive discourse and acknowledging the problems they are facing, to the public and the stakeholders, an organization can plan for how to proceed in the post-crisis stage.

'''EF Education First''' (abbreviated as '''EF''') is an international education company that specializes in language training, educational travel, academic degree programs, and cultural exchange. The company was founded in 1965 by [[Bertil Hult]] in the [[Sweden|Swedish]] university town of [[Lund]]. The company is privately held by the Hult family.

As of 2017, EF had approximately 46,000 employees in 116 countries.&lt;ref name=Globe2017&gt;{{cite news|title=

== History ==
Bertil Hult dropped out of college to launch EF in 1965.  He had earlier dropped out of junior high and gone to work for a ship broker in London, where he learned English by immersion; he had been unable to learn it in school due to dyslexia.  The company started selling French language course to Swedish students seeking to study in France, but he thought English was a bigger market so started offering services throughout Europe.  In 1972 a friend convinced him to open a school in Japan, just when English-language keyboards were introduced there, and the company experienced explosive growth. The company expanded to the US in 1983, first establishing headquarters in California, then in Boston in 1988.&lt;ref name=Globe2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Education First aims to bridge barriers with exchange|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/02/03/founder-bertil-hult-sees-education-first-breaking-down-global-barriers/KK6hpFwDqvocR73w0Xf9jO/story.html|work=The Boston Globe|date=February 3, 2014|first=Katie|last= Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hult never took outside investment, growing the business with revenue.&lt;ref name=Globe2013/&gt;  By 2014 EF had approximately 37,000 employees in 55 countries.&lt;ref name=Globe2014&gt;{{cite news|title=

"'''Game of Tones'''" is the twenty-third episode of the [[Futurama (season 7)|seventh season]] of the animated sitcom ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] on August 14, 2013. The episode was written by Michael Rowe and directed by Edmund Fong. The Planet Express crew enter Fry's dreams and find themselves back in the year 1999 in search of a mysterious alien song.

The title is a spoof of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', while the episode as a whole makes many references to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[Inception]]'', and the plot contains many similarities to ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''.

==Plot==
Earth is slowly approached by a mysterious alien ship that repeatedly broadcasts four loud musical tones, which can be heard by everyone on the planet. At first, the music is merely an annoyance, but as the ship draws nearer, the booming tones begin to cause structural damage, and will eventually grow so loud that the vibrations will literally shake the planet apart. No one has any idea what the ship is trying to communicate; only Fry seems to recognize the alien melody, but his memory of hearing it is so vague that he cannot place it.

Seeing that it is crucial for Fry to recover his memory of the melody, Farnsworth scans Fry's brain, finding that Fry's memory of the music originates from December 31, 1999, the night he was cryogenically frozen. While the alien ship is still two weeks away from Earth, Farnsworth connects Fry to one of his machines and sedates him, transporting Fry in a kind of dream state to the world of his memories of that day. The crew are able to view Fry's experience on a TV monitor, and even communicate with Fry with microphones. After exploring his neighborhood and retracing his steps for a very short time, he accidentally wakes up, only to find that he has been asleep for almost two weeks. The alien ship is now so close that major earthquakes occur every time the tones are played.

After complaining that he doesn't want to go back, remembering what a bad day it had been for him, mentioning in particular "hanging out with my crazy family", Fry returns to the dream state. As he arrives at the family home, he laments, "There's not one thing about this place that I missed." Just then Seymour runs up to greet Fry. As Fry muses on his feelings for Seymour, he thinks about his family, and realizes that perhaps he does miss them after all. In spite of Farnsworth's protests, Fry re-engages with his family, savoring the experience. He realizes that he needs closure, especially with his mother, but his fellow crewmembers begin to arrive in his dream, interrupting. Eventually they drag him out of the house, insisting that he continue his mission. Making a final effort to escape them, he runs back inside, but his people are gone; a quirk of this dream state has eliminated them.

Bitter and defeated, Fry leads the crew through the rest of his day, even up to his last two minutes at Applied Cryogenics, still with no satisfaction. Fry takes his place in front of the cryogenic tube, leaning back in his chair as the countdown to the New Year begins. In the final seconds as he falls back into the tube, he at last hears the four notes, followed by two additional, higher-pitched notes that he had not recalled until now. Armed with this new information, Nixon leads the crew to a landing facility built to receive the alien craft. When it arrives and blasts out the four notes, Fry uses a keyboard to respond with the final two. The ship lands, and from it emerges Digby, Nibbler's personal chauffeur.

Digby explains that on December 31, 1999, he had conducted Nibbler to Earth on his mission to ensure that Fry entered the cryo-tube. Accompanying Nibbler, Digby used a key fob, coincidentally at the very instant that Fry fell in, to remotely lock the spaceship. The fob, after all, was the source of the musical tones, the two additional notes being the acknowledgement from the ship. Mission accomplished, Digby and Nibbler became severely drunk at a local pub. Heading home, having forgotten where they had parked their ship, a drunken Digby dropped the fob, with keys attached, down a storm drain. Forced to take a cab back to their base on Vergon 6, Digby had later retrieved a spare set of keys, and has been traveling from one planet to another, broadcasting the security signal in an attempt to locate the "company car". Fry leads them to the roof of the Applied Cryogenics building, where the Nibblonian ship still rests, ransacked, with a dead battery. With Bender's help, Digby flies away. Nibbler thanks Fry, vowing to somehow repay him. Fry thinks of his mother and laments that they cannot give him what he really wants.

That night, while asleep, Fry has a dream about his mother, and once more expresses his desire to speak with her. When a television sportscaster announces the results of the [[2000 Rose Bowl]], Fry is confused; since that game took place after he was frozen, it should be impossible for him to know the results. Nibbler appears, and reveals that this is not actually Fry's dream; it is one of his mother's, and is the gift that Nibbler spoke of. Fry asks if it is really her, and she replies that it is, telling him that she has dreamed of him often since his disappearance. When she asks him what he would like to talk about, he wordlessly embraces her with tears in his eyes. Back in the 21st century, Fry's mother dreams of her son with a smile on her face.

'''Greece in the Roman era''' describes the period of [[Greek history]] when it was dominated by the [[Roman republic]], the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (collectively, the Roman era). It saw its beginnings with the Roman victory over the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthians]], at the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)]]. The definitive occupation of the Greek world by Rome was with the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, when the future emperor [[Augustus]] defeated [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Greek Ptolemaic]] queen [[Cleopatra VII]] and [[Mark Antony]], the next year taking over [[Alexandria]], the last great center of [[Hellenistic Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/260307/Hellenistic-Age Hellenistic Age.] [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 2013. Retrieved 27 May 2013. [https://www.webcitation.org/6GvcO95wv?url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/260307/Hellenistic-Age Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; It continued with the adoption of the city of [[Byzantium]] by the Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] as the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] (as Nova Roma, later [[Constantinople]]) in AD 330. After this date, the Eastern Empire became largely Greek speaking.

==Early Roman history==
The [[Greek peninsula]] first came under [[Roman Republic|Roman]] rule in 146 BC after the Battle of Corinth when [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] became a [[Roman province]], while southern  Greece came under the surveillance of Macedonia's prefect. However, some Greek [[polis|poleis]] managed to maintain partial independence and avoid taxation. The [[king of Pergamon|Kingdom of Pergamon]] was in principle added to this territory in 133 BC when King [[Attalus III]] left his territories to the Roman people in his will.&lt;ref&gt;Livy: Periochae 58&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Romans were slow in securing their claim and [[Eumenes III|Aristonicus]] led a revolt with the help of [[Blossius]]. This was put down in 129 BC, when Pergamon was divided among Rome, [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], and [[Cappadocia]].


[[File:RomanConquests - Greece.png|thumb|This map shows how Rome conquered Greece.]]

[[Athens]] and other Greek cities revolted in 88 BC, and the uprising was crushed by the Roman general [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]]. The Roman civil wars devastated the land even further, until [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] organized the peninsula as the province of [[Achaea (province)|Achaea]] in 27 BC.

Greece, initially economically devastated, began to rise economically after the wars. The Greek cities of Asia Minor recovered more quickly at first than the cities on the Greek peninsula, which were heavily damaged by the forces of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]]. The Romans invested heavily however, and rebuilt these cities. Corinth became the capital of the new province of Achaea, while Athens prospered as a center of philosophy and learning.

==Early Empire==

Life in Greece continued under the Roman Empire much the same as it had previously. Roman culture was highly influenced by the Greeks; as [[Horace]] said, ''Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit'' ("Captive Greece captured her rude conqueror") &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Horace|title=Horace - Wikiquote|website=en.wikiquote.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The epics of [[Homer]] inspired the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Virgil]], and authors such as [[Seneca the younger]] wrote using Greek styles. While some Roman nobles regarded the Greeks as backwards and petty, many others embraced [[Greek literature]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. The Greek language became a favorite of the educated and elite in Rome, such as [[Scipio Africanus]], who tended to study [[philosophy]] and regard Greek culture and science as an example to be followed.

Similarly, most Roman emperors maintained an admiration for things Greek in nature. The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]] visited Greece in AD 66, and performed at the [[Ancient Olympic Games]], despite the rules against non-Greek participation. He was honored with a victory in every contest, and in the following year he proclaimed the freedom of the Greeks at the [[Isthmian Games]] in Corinth, just as [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Flamininus]] had over 200 years previously. [[Hadrian]] was also particularly fond of the Greeks; before he became emperor he served as an [[eponymous archon]] of Athens. He also built his [[Arch of Hadrian (Athens)|Arch of Hadrian]] there.

Many temples and public buildings were built in Greece by emperors and wealthy Roman nobility, especially in Athens. [[Julius Caesar]] began construction of the [[Roman Agora|Roman agora]] in Athens, which was finished by [[Augustus]]. The main gate, [[Gate of Athena Archegetis]], was dedicated to the patron goddess of Athens, [[Athena]]. The [[Odeon of Agrippa|Agrippeia]] was built in the center of the newly built [[Roman Agora]] by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]. The [[Tower of the Winds]] was built by [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]] in 50 BC, although it may predate the entire Roman section of Athens. The emperor [[Hadrian]] was a [[Philhellenism|philhellene]] and an ardent admirer of Greece and, seeing himself as an heir to [[Pericles]], made many contributions to Athens. He built the [[Library of Hadrian]] in the city, as well as completing construction of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]], some 638 years after its construction was started by Athenian tyrants, but ended due to the belief that building on such a scale was [[hubris]]tic. The Athenians built the [[Arch of Hadrian (Athens)|Arch of Hadrian]] to honor Emperor Hadrian. The side of the arch facing the Athenian agora and the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] had an inscription stating "This is Athens, the ancient city of [[Theseus]]." The side facing the Roman agora and the new city had an inscription stating "This is the city of Hadrian, and not of Theseus." Adrianou (Hadrian Street) exists to this day, leading from the arch to the Roman agora.

The [[Pax Romana]] was the longest period of peace in Greek history, and Greece became a major crossroads of maritime trade between Rome and the Greek speaking eastern half of the empire. The [[Koine Greek|Greek language]] served as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the [[East]] and in [[Italy]], and many Greek intellectuals such as [[Galen]] would perform most of their work in [[Rome]].

During this time, Greece and much of the rest of the Roman east came under the influence of [[Early Christianity]]. The apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] [[Tarsus (city)|of Tarsus]] preached in [[Philippi]], Corinth and Athens, and Greece soon became one of the most highly Christianized areas of the empire.

==Later Roman Empire==
During the second and third centuries, Greece was divided into provinces including [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus]] and [[Thracia|Thrace]]. During the reign of [[Diocletian]] in the late 3rd century, [[Moesia]] was organized as a [[Roman diocese|diocese]], and was ruled by [[Galerius]]. Under Constantine (who professed Christianity) Greece was part of the [[Prefecture|prefectures]] of Macedonia and Thrace. [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] divided the prefecture of Macedonia into the provinces of [[Crete|Creta]], Achaea, [[Thessaly|Thessalia]], [[Epirus Vetus]], [[Epirus Nova]], and Macedonia. The [[Aegean islands]] formed the province of [[Insulae (Roman province)|Insulae]] in the [[Diocese of Asia]].

Greece faced invasions from the [[Heruli]], [[Goths]], and [[Vandals]] during the reign of Romulus Augustulus. [[Stilicho]], who pretented he was a regent for [[Arcadius]], evacuated Thessaly when the [[Visigoths]] invaded in the late 4th century. Arcadius' chief advisor [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius]] allowed [[Alaric I|Alaric]] to enter Greece, and he looted Athens, Corinth and the [[Peloponnese]]. Stilicho eventually drove him out around 397 and Alaric was made [[magister militum]] in [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]]. Eventually, Alaric and the Goths migrated to Italy, sacked Rome in 410, and built the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], which lasted until 711 with the advent of the [[Arabs]].

Greece remained part of the relatively unified eastern half of the empire, which eventually became the center of the remaining Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]]. Contrary to outdated visions of [[Late Antiquity]], the Greek peninsula was most likely one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman Empire. Older scenarios of poverty, depopulation, barbarian destruction and civil decay have been revised in light of recent archaeological discoveries.&lt;ref name=corinth&gt;Rothaus, p. 10. "The question of the continuity of civic institutions and the nature of the ''polis'' in the late antique and early Byzantine world have become a vexed question, for a variety of reasons. Students of this subject continue to contend with scholars of earlier periods who adhere to a much-outdated vision of late antiquity as a decadent decline into impoverished fragmentation. The cities of late-antique Greece displayed a marked degree of continuity. Scenarios of barbarian destruction, civic decay, and manorialization simply do not fit. In fact, the city as an institution appears to have prospered in Greece during this period. It was not until the end of the 6th century (and maybe not even then) that the dissolution of the city became a problem in Greece. If the early sixth century ''Syndekmos'' of Hierokles is taken at face value, late-antique Greece was highly urbanized and contained approximately eighty cities. This extreme prosperity is born out by recent archaeological surveys in the Aegean. For late-antique Greece, a paradigm of prosperity and transformation is more accurate and useful than a paradigm of decline and fall."&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the [[polis]], as an institution, appears to have remained prosperous until at least the sixth century. Contemporary texts such as Hierokles' ''Syndekmos'' affirm that Late antiquity Greece was highly urbanised and contained approximately 80 cities.&lt;ref name=corinth/&gt; This view of extreme prosperity is widely accepted today, and it is assumed between the 4th and 7th centuries AD, Greece may have been one of the most economically active regions in the eastern [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=corinth/&gt;

'''Green Beer Day''' ('''GBD''') is a day-long [[party]], where celebrants drink beer dyed green with artificial coloring or natural processes. The tradition started at [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]], and was first celebrated in 1952.&lt;ref name="trivia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamistudent.net/amusement/are-you-smarter-than-a-leprechaun-gbd-trivia-1.1175772|title=Are you smarter than a leprechaun?

==University and City of Oxford response==

'''''Joe Palooka''''' is an American [[comic strip]] about a heavyweight [[boxing]] champion, created by cartoonist [[Ham Fisher]] in 1921.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1077124/1/index.htm], ''Sports Illustrated'' {{dead|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strip debuted in 1930&lt;ref name=SI /&gt; and was carried at its peak by 900 newspapers.

The strip was adapted to a short-lived 15-minute [[CBS]] radio series, 12 feature-length films (chiefly from [[Monogram Pictures]]), nine [[Vitaphone]] [[short film|film shorts]], a 1954 [[television syndication|syndicated]] television series (''The Joe Palooka Story''), [[comic book]]s and merchandise, including a 1940s [[board game]], a 1947 New Haven Clock &amp; Watch Company wristwatch, a 1948 metal lunchbox featuring depictions of Joe, Humphrey and Little Max, and a 1946 [[Wheaties]] cereal box cut-out mask. In 1980, a mountain in [[Pennsylvania]] was named for the character.

== Publication history ==
In his home town of [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], Fisher devised the character in 1921 after he met a boxer, [[Pete Latzo]], outside a [[Billiard room|poolroom]]. As Fisher explained in an article in ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'':
{{blockquote|Here, made to order, was the comic strip character I had been looking for—a big, good-natured prize fighter who didn't like to fight; a defender of little guys; a gentle knight. I ran back to the office, drew a set of strips and rushed to the newspaper syndicates.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} }}

Many rejections followed before Fisher's strip was finally syndicated by the [[McNaught Syndicate]] after Fisher, while employed as a McNaught salesman, sold it to over 20 newspapers. It debuted April 19, 1930, and by 1948, it was ranked as one of the five most popular newspaper comic strips.

After Fisher committed suicide in 1955, his assistant Moe Leff drew the strip for four years. [[Lank Leonard]] recommended [[Tony DiPreta]], who stepped in to illustrate [[Morris Weiss]]' scripts. DiPreta stayed with the strip for 25 years until it ended its run November 24, 1984, when it had dropped to only 182 newspapers. DiPreta then moved on to draw ''[[Rex Morgan, M.D.]]''.

==Characters and story==
Fisher originally changed the appearance of Palooka to fit each reigning real-life champ – until the coming of African-American [[Joe Louis]] in the 1930s, at which time the image of the cowlicked blond Palooka remained unchanged. Though his adventures were mostly low-key, he was pumped up by a supporting cast led by girlfriend Ann Howe, boxing manager Knobby Walsh, his mute orphan sidekick Little Max, Smokey, his black valet and later sparring partner&lt;ref name=SI /&gt; and lovable giant Humphrey Pennyworth, a smiling [[blacksmith]] who wielded a 100-pound (45&amp;nbsp;kg) [[War hammer|maul]]. Like [[Ozark Ike]] McBatt in baseball, ''Joe Palooka'' was intended to exemplify the sports hero in an age when uprightness of character was supposed to matter most. The character was part of an effort among top newspaper cartoonists to sell [[World War II]]-era [[Series E bond]]s to the public as a wartime financing initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/ ''Presarvin’ Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man'', "Hogan's Alley," 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Joepalooka1949.jpg|thumb|center|620px|Joe Palooka plays golf with [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]] in a 1949 ''Joe Palooka'' strip by Ham Fisher and Moe Leff.]]

The strip garnered much publicity when cheese heiress Ann Howe and Joe were married on June 24, 1949. The engraved invitations for the event, sent to a select list of celebrities, read: "Mr. Ham Fisher requests the honour of your presence at the marriage of Ann Howe to Mr. Joe Palooka on the afternoon of June 24th in your favorite newspaper." Fisher received formal acceptances from Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]], General [[Omar Bradley]] and Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]]. At the time, the strip was carried in 665 American newspapers and 125 foreign papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800462-1,00.html "Mr. and Mrs. Palooka," ''Time'', June 27, 1949.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Found in print as early as 1923, the word ''palooka'' was widely used to mean a lout or an inept fighter. Of uncertain origins, the word may originally have derived from the ethnic slur ''[[polack]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Comic books ==
[[File:Joe3palooka42.jpg|right|thumb|''Joe Palooka'' #3 (1942)]]
Over decades, ''Joe Palooka'' appeared in comic books from several comic book publishers. Early comic books offered strip reprints, but eventually the character was seen in original comic book stories. Secondary characters Little Max and Humphrey Pennyworth each had their own [[Harvey Comics]] series.

[[Joe  Antonacci]] owns the trademark to and has recreated Joe Palooka. A brand new comic book version of the character created by Antonacci and his creative team was published by [[IDW Publishing]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbr.com/idw-publishing-brings-joe-palooka-back-to-comic-book-ring/ IDW Publishing brings Joe Palooka back to comic-book ring]&lt;/ref&gt; Palooka is reborn as an [[Mixed martial arts]] (MMA) fighter. Antonacci's team has also created a sister series of MMA-themed comic books entitled ''Legion of Combat''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fightnetwork.com/news/11956:introducing-full-length-mma-comic-book-joe-palooka/ Introducing Full-Length MMA Comic Book 'Joe Palooka' - The Fight Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio series==
On radio ''Joe Palooka'' was broadcast on [[CBS]] from April 12 to August 18, 1932. With [[Teddy Bergman]] in the title role,&lt;ref name=rs&gt;DeLong, Thomas A. (1996). ''Radio Stars: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary of 953 Performers, 1920 through 1960''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2834-2}}. P. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; the 15-minute series was heard on Tuesdays and Thursdays, sponsored by Heinz Rice Flakes. Elmira Roessler, Elsie Hitz and [[Mary Jane Higby]] played Ann Howe. Knobby Walsh was portrayed by [[Frank Readick]] and Hal Lansing. Others in the cast: [[Karl Swenson]] and Norman Gottschalk. The announcer was [[Harry von Zell]].

==Films and television==
Joe Palooka made his movie debut in ''[[Palooka (film)|Palooka]]'' (1934) with [[Stuart Erwin]] in the title role, [[Jimmy Durante]] as Knobby, [[Lupe Velez]] as Nina Madero, and [[Marjorie Rambeau]] as Mayme Palooka. Now in the public domain, the film can be seen online. ''Palooka'' was followed by a series of nine two-reel [[Vitaphone]] shorts (1936–37) starring Robert Norton as Joe and [[Shemp Howard]] as Knobby.

He returned to feature-length films in 1946, when [[Monogram Pictures]] launched a series of 11 low-budget films starring [[Joe Kirkwood, Jr.]] as Joe, [[Leon Errol]] as Knobby and [[Elyse Knox]] as Ann Howe. The first in the series was ''[[Joe Palooka, Champ]]'' (1946); the series ended 1951, with ''Joe Palooka in Triple Cross''.

''The Joe Palooka Story'', popularly known simply as ''Joe Palooka'', was a 1954 syndicated television series starring Kirkwood and featuring former boxing champion [[Maxie Rosenbloom]] as Humphrey Pennyworth.

==Cultural legacy==
South of [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]] on the way to the town of [[Mountain Top, Pennsylvania]] is Joe Palooka Mountain, named in the early 1980s by the Mayor of Wilkes-Barre.  A granite monument with the likeness of Joe Palooka is located at the base of the mountain at the intersection of PA 309 and PA 437 between Wilkes-Barre and the town of Mountain Top.

In September 1948, a limestone Joe Palooka statue (in a flowing cape) was erected on a hill overlooking Route 37 in Indiana. In 1984, the nine-foot high, ten-ton statue and its base were moved and rededicated to the Town Hall in [[Oolitic, Indiana]].

In ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (novel)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'', [[Ken Kesey]] skewers one of his characters with this paragraph: "'[[Tsk tsk|Tsk, tsk]],' said Brother Walker. And, as he had learned the comment from ''Joe Palooka'', it came out 'tisk tisk', the way he assumed it was pronounced."{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Lyrics of [[Popeye]]'s theme "I'm Popeye The Sailor Man", composed by [[Sammy Lerner]] in 1933 for [[Fleischer Studios]]' first [[Popeye the Sailor (1933 cartoon)|Popeye the Sailor cartoon]]: "I'm Popeye the sailor man / I'm one tough Gazookus / which hates all Palookas".

In ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954) Marlon Brando's character, Terry Malloy, references Palooka, in the phrase "a one-way ticket to Palookaville".{{cn|date=October 2016}}

In the 1977 film ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'', after having been drawn into a fight and taken a beating, character Cledus "Snowman" Snow ([[Jerry Reed]]) tells his friend Bo "Bandit" Darville ([[Burt Reynolds]]) over the [[CB radio]], "Look, you ain't gonna believe this, but I just did my imitation of Joe Palooka."

In the 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', character Vincent Vega ([[John Travolta]]) disparages the character of boxer Butch Coolidge ([[Bruce Willis]]) for taking a dive saying, "I ain't your friend, palooka."

'''Journalism culture''' is described as a "shared occupational ideology among newsworkers".&lt;ref&gt;Deuze, M. (2005). What is journalism? Professional identity and ideology of journalists reconsidered. Journalism, 6, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[journalism]] culture spans the cultural diversity of [[Journalism ethics and standards|journalistic values]], practices and [[Medium (communication)|media products]] or similar media artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007). Deconstructing journalism culture: Towards a universal theory. ''[[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]]'', 17, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; Research into the concept of journalism culture sometimes suggests an all-encompassing consensus among journalists "toward a common understanding and cultural identity of journalism."&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is scientific debate about the notion of a shared, worldwide journalism culture, whether such a common construct exists and can be found empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007), 17, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[Communication sciences|communication science]] studies were conducted for finding a hypothetic common Western journalism culture, a common European journalism culture, or even a common global journalism ideology. (cf. historical overview) Research into journalism cultures is especially helpful in analyzing assumed influences of [[globalization]], indicated by world-spanning major [[Corporate media|media corporations]], on individual media cultures and its worldwide standard-setting potency.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, G. (2006). Inter-Media Agenda Setting and Global News Coverage. Journalism Studies, 7 (2), pp. 323-333. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14616700500533643&lt;/ref&gt; In scientific literature, journalism culture is also called "journalistic culture", "news culture", "newspaper cultures" or "culture of news production".

== Types of cultures ==

A worldwide study on journalism culture conducted by Thomas Hanitzsch et al. between 2007 and 2011 encompassing 21 countries found that journalistic functions like detachment, non-involvement, providing political information and monitoring the [[government]] are perceived as essential journalistic virtues ''worldwide''.&lt;ref&gt;Worlds of Journalism, Pilot Study. http://www.worldsofjournalism.org/pilot.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The four types of journalism cultures found in the ''Worlds of Journalism'' study through worldwide surveys of over 2100 active journalists regarding the "central areas of [journalistic] disagreement"&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2011a). Populist disseminators, detached watchdogs, critical change agents and opportunist facilitators: Professional milieus, the journalistic field and autonomy in 18 countries.  ''International Communication Gazette'', 73(6), p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;  (journalistic interventionism, distance to ruling powers, and their market orientation) are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Journalistic milieu !! Specifics of journalism culture
|-
| '''Populist&amp;nbsp;disseminator''' || Has a strong orientation towards the audience. Tendency to provide the audience with "interesting" information. Not very critical of government or elites. Yet does not intend to take on an active and participatory role in reporting. Example countries: Spain, [[Romania]], Israel.
|-
| '''[[Watchdog journalism#Detached Watchdog|Detached watchdog]]''' || Interest in providing the audience with political information. Relative high regard to their position as detached observer of events. See themselves as watchdogs of elites (skeptical and critical attitude). Less interventionist than their counterparts in other milieus. Opposed to the idea of supporting official policies. Least likely to advocate for social change, influence public opinion and set the political agenda. Most ‘prototypical’ milieu of western journalist. Example countries: Germany, Austria, United States, Switzerland, Australia.
|-
| '''Critical change agent''' || Driven by interventionist intentions. Critical towards government and business elites. Emphasis on advocating social change, influencing public opinion or setting political agenda. Eager to motivate audiences to participate in civic activity (elections) and political discussion, yet strongly opposed to providing public support for official government policy. Does not support opportunist approach to journalism. Example countries: Turkey, Egypt. In parts [[Bulgaria]], Mexico and [[Indonesia]].
|-
| '''Opportunist&amp;nbsp;facilitator''' || Journalists do not perceive themselves as detached observers, are constructive partners of the government. They are most likely to support official policies and convey a positive image of political and business leadership and pay least regard to the political information function or the mobilization potentials of journalism. At close distance to political powers. No watchdogs of government or elites. Found in developing, transitional and authoritarian contexts. Country examples: Russia, [[Chile]], China, [[Uganda]].

=== Western journalism culture ===

Compared to Southern, Eastern or less democratic countries like China and Russia, additional virtues like impartiality, the reliability and factualness of information and adherence to universal ethical principles are perceived to be of great importance for Western journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Worlds of Journalism, Pilot Study.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the study found Western journalists to be less supportive of any ''active'' promotion of particular values, ideas or social change.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T., Hanusch, F. &amp; Mellado, C. (2010). Mapping Journalism Cultures Across Nations: A comparative study of 18 countries. ''Journalism Studies'', 12(3), 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western journalism culture is classified by a dominance of [[watchdog journalism]] with a tendency of more South-Western democracies like Spain additionally harboring a strong journalistic culture of "populist disseminator".&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2011a), p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tendencies in developing and emerging nations ===

Especially in the 1990s "US government and media initiatives"&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. D. (2001), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; have worked to establish a US-modeled "objective" press model in emerging democracies in South America and Eastern Europe. This move assumed "US-style journalism [to be] a natural and inevitable world model",&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. D. (2001), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; yet current studies regarding journalism culture in Eastern European countries do not see a natural adoption of Western journalism standards. Instead, the establishment of a less objective and more entertainment- and audience-oriented journalistic culture driven by the countries themselves (e.g. "populist disseminator" journalism in [[Bulgaria]]) can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2011a), p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;

Within-country level journalism research in developing or emerging countries is described as lacking.&lt;ref&gt;De Beer, A. (2008): South African Journalism Research. Challenging Paradigmatic Schisms and Finding a Foothold in Era of Globalization. In: Löffelholz, M. &amp; Weaver, D. (2008). ''Global Journalism Research. Theories, Methods, Findings, Future''. Cambridge: Blackwell., pp. 185-196.&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be explained with under-financed or non-existent research institutes within the respective countries or the neglect of certain research topics. Arnold S. de Beer, journalism researcher at [[Stellenbosch University]], South Africa, is criticizing [[South Africa]]n journalism research of the 90s and early 2000s as both too focused on areas like "public relations, marketing or other forms of corporate communication"&lt;ref&gt;De Beer, A. (2008), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the side of the critical researchers, as having a too strong interest in journalism research of post-[[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]] specifics. This overpopulation with specific-interest studies created a deficit in South African conclusions about their own journalism culture.

== Research ==
Research of journalism culture is a sub-theme of journalism research, a tradition rooted in both classical sociological approaches (e.g. [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Robert E. Park]], [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[Niklas Luhmann]]) and [[Outline of the humanities#History of the humanities|Humanities]] of the early 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, D. &amp; Löffelholz, M. (2008). Global Journalism Research: Summing up and Looking Ahead. In: Löffelholz, M. &amp; Weaver, D. (2008). ''Global Journalism Research. Theories, Methods, Findings, Future''. Cambridge: Blackwell, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; and is located in the broader area of [[Media studies|media science]] and communication science. Journalism studies take into account many levels of analysis including individual, organizational, societal and cultural aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, D. &amp; Löffelholz, M. (2008), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study design and methods ===

Study design for journalism culture research provides challenges for appropriate [[Scientific method|methodological]] [[operationalization]]. Its complexity arises due to journalistic professionalism being a multi-leveled concept consisting of various journalistic values, tenets, and practices, which different journalism cultures balance in their own unique ways.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. D. (2001). Understanding the Global Journalist: a hierarchy-of-influences approach. ''Journalism Studies'', 2(2), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in journalism culture can be conducted within one nation, mostly led by journalism researchers originating from the country itself,&lt;ref&gt;For examples of within-country research in Germany, U.S., UK, South Africa, China and Mexico see Löffelholz, M. &amp; Weaver, D. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; or in a comparative manner cross-nationally conducted with the help of international teams of researchers. Comparative journalism research is fore-mostly conducted cross-nationally, with "nation" being an important level of analysis, resulting in comparative studies on country-by-country basis.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. D. (2001), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from [[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics|comparative media system research]], comparative journalism culture research uses the nation as "object, context, unit of analysis, or as component of a larger system".&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. D. (2001), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Melvin (Ed.) (1989). ''Cross-national Research in Sociology'', Newbury Park, California: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Used methods in journalism culture research are surveys and interviews, content analysis, observation or a combination thereof.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Quandt, Kolmer, Weaver in: Weaver, D. &amp; Löffelholz, M. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levels of analysis ===
Using the [[:File:Mediated corss-border communication - dimensions of analysis.png|dimensions of analysis system]] suggested by Brüggeman and Wessler, media research can be conducted using three dimensions of analysis:&lt;ref&gt;Wessler, H., &amp; Brüggeman, M. (2012) (in press). Transnationale Kommunikation. Eine Einführung. Wiesbaden: Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften.&lt;/ref&gt; (1) Research perspectives, (2) research levels and (3) objects of analysis. Practically applying this system on journalism culture research shows:
# The use of "'''comparison'''" as prevalent research '''perspective'''
# The use of  "'''state/society'''" (nation) as dominant '''level of analysis'''
# The use of '''various''' and often combined '''objects of analysis'''

The combination of various objects of analysis, such as "'''media structures'''", "'''content production'''" and "'''media contents'''" is explained in the complex nature of the "culture" aspect in journalism culture. As communication researcher Hanitzsch puts it: "One can generally speak of culture as a set of ideas (values, attitudes, and beliefs), practices (of cultural production), and artifacts (cultural products, texts)."&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007), p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical overview of research ===
Notable comparative research can be found in Weaver's 1998 ''The Global Journalist'', Sigal's 1973 ''Reporters and Officials: The Organization and Politics of Newsmaking'' comparing reporting practices in the United States and Great Britain, the journalism-focused parts of Hallin and Mancini's 2004 ''[[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics]]'' and Hanitzsch’ 2011 ''Worlds of Journalism'' Project. Rosten's 1937 ''Washington Correspondents'' is considered the first study to describe journalists’ work lives.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. D. (2001), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent comparative research into journalism and journalism culture also include works by Deuze,&lt;ref&gt;Deuze, Mark (2002). National News Cultures: A Comparison of Dutch, German, British, Australian and US Journalists. ''Journalism Quarterly'' 78(1), pp. 134-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Donsbach&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, W. &amp; Patterson, T. E. (2004). Political News Journalists: Partisanship, Professionalism, and Political Roles in Five Countries. In: Frank Esser, Barbara Pfetsch, (ed.): ''Comparing Political Communication. Theories, Cases, and Challenges''. Cambridge, 251-70.&lt;/ref&gt; and Splichal &amp; Sparks.&lt;ref&gt;Splichal, S. &amp; Sparks, C. (1994). ''Journalists for the 21st century. Tendencies of professionalization among first-year students in 22 countries''. Norwood, New Jersey: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical and practical research has found many journalism cultures and ideologies discussed in communication science literature. Among them are journalism cultures and genres such as [[watchdog journalism]], [[civic journalism]], popular journalism or [[advocacy journalism]] characterized by its strong use of [[journalistic interventionism]].&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive list of journalism cultures see the table in: Hanitzsch, T. (2007), p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of research ===

Many, especially emerging nations, criticize the form of applying a US- or Western-centric view of journalistic culture onto under- or developing nations&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. D. (2001), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; as a form of cultural imperialism neglecting specific cultural backgrounds or [[Cleavage (politics)|social cleavages]].
Additionally, journalism research is often criticized as employing a too traditional view of "journalism".&lt;ref&gt;Heinonen, A. &amp; Luostarinen, H. (2008). Reconsidering "Journalism" for Journalism Research. In: Löffelholz, M. &amp; Weaver, D. (2008). ''Global Journalism Research. Theories, Methods, Findings, Future''. Cambridge: Blackwell, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, D. &amp; Löffelholz, M. (2008), p. 292f.&lt;/ref&gt; Most journalism studies still focus on established and institutionalized journalism in newspaper, television or radio. Journalism researchers are struggling with comparative methods of conceptualizing emerging and new media,&lt;ref&gt;Heinonen, A. &amp; Luostarinen, H. (2008), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; like journalism in weblogs, podcasts or other versions of citizens’ journalism.
Beside these specific points of criticism there is a general methodological problem defining the concept of "culture".&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007), p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; The term culture is often used unsystematically and can lead to problems of congruent comparison of journalism culture studies.

== Influences on cultures ==

=== Influences on European journalism cultures ===
The Adequate Information Management in Europe (AIM) Project, a multinational European social science project conducting several studies on journalism structures and processes of daily reporting about the European Union between 2004 and 2007, found that impulses for European professional journalism are not found in an explicit interest in European topics or special knowledge concerning European matters, as assumed.&lt;ref&gt;AIM Research Consortium (Ed.), Reporting and Managing European News: final report of the Project ''Adequate Information Management in Europe'' 2004 -2007, Bochum and Freiburg: Projekt Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, they are determined by "day to day operations and subsequent media performance"[13], structural on-site factors, or "on-the-job and trial-and-error"&lt;ref&gt;Kopper, G. (2007). Research and the Meta-Level of Practice: implications for training, online communicating and defining rules of European journalism, in: AIM Research Consortium (Ed.), Reporting and Managing European News: final report of the Project ''Adequate Information Management in Europe'' 2004 -2007, Bochum and Freiburg: Projekt Verlag, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; practices. Furthermore, reporting about Europe is determined by national views and national and individual journalistic practices and thus lacking coherence and proper context.&lt;ref&gt;Kopper, G. (2007), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The AIM study concludes that these daily deficiencies, neglects and misapprehensions lead to myopic reporting about European matters.&lt;ref&gt;Kopper, G. (2007), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of a common European culture on reporting about European matters thus cannot be supported.

=== Influences of professional hierarchies ===
Shoemaker's and Reese's 1996 volume ''Mediating the Message: Theories of Influences on Mass Media'' established a theoretical framework for analyzing levels of influences that shape media contents. The levels range from micro to macro, going from individual, over routines, organizational level, extra-media level, to ideological level.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (1996). ''Mediating the Message: Theories of Influences on Mass Media Content'', 2nd edn, White Plains, New York: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach was used by Hanitzsch in his extensive cross-national journalism culture study ''Worlds of Journalism''. The model used by Hanitzsch allows for influences on journalists’ reporting decisions on a super-level (globalization, diffusion and interdependence), a macro-level of societies or nations (political, economic, legal, social and cultural contexts as well as media system), a meso-level (editorial organization, the media organization and the medium as such) and the micro-level as the journalist as an individual (journalists' backgrounds and individual characteristics).&lt;ref&gt;''Worlds of Journalism'', Pilot Study. Conceptualization: journalism culture and influences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results from the study among 2100 professional journalists found that "organizational, professional and procedural influences are perceived to be more powerful limits to the journalists' work than political and economic influences".&lt;ref&gt;''Worlds of Journalism'', Pilot Study.&lt;/ref&gt; This produces the meso-level of professional hierarchy, aka the editorial organization and medium's organization, as the most influential factor of journalistic conduct and thus the biggest influencer of the professional part of journalism culture.

=== Influence of new technologies on journalism cultures ===
The European AIM study found a growing openness, especially among younger generations of professional journalists, towards news methods and ways of communication and production. A growing tendency of not relying exclusively on institutionalized information systems can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Kopper, G. (2007), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Further technological development within the world of the [[Internet]] points to a trend of  increased usage of "non-institutionalized, non-governmental, non-administrative and clearly transnational information"&lt;ref&gt;Kopper, G. (2007), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; during reporting and research work.

Besides Western journalists adopting [[new media]] as a means of reporting, a surge in new technology usage can especially be seen in authoritarian or developing nation contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Scotton, J. (2010). The Impact of New Media. In: Scotton, J. &amp; Hachten, W. (ed.). ''New Media for a New China''. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephi, B. (2010). ''Journalism Education in Countries With Limited Media Freedom''. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased governmental controlling of journalists’ media access [[freedom of expression]] can lead to the need of finding new and less controlled ways of expression. One of the best studied examples of suppressed journalists’ resourcefulness can be found in research of Chinese journalists and their use of [[blog]]s, cellphones&lt;ref&gt;Scotton, J. (2010), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microblogging in China|microblogging]], shaping the Chinese reporting culture.

== Global convergence theory ==
International journalism research has produced evidence in support of the view that the ongoing trend of globalization is accompanied with a convergence in journalistic orientations and practices and thus journalism culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C., &amp; Mancini, P. (2004). "Americanization, Globalization, and Secularization: Understanding the Convergence of Media Systems and Political Communication". In F. Esser &amp; B. Pfetsch (ed.), ''Comparing Political Communication. Theories, Cases, and Challenges''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 25–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional ethics of objectivity and impartiality dominate many newsrooms worldwide, and many similarities in editorial procedures, professional routines, and socialization processes in countries as ''diverse'' as Brazil, Germany, [[Indonesia]], [[Tanzania]], and the United States can be found.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T., Mellado, C. (2011b). What Shapes the News around the World? How Journalists in Eighteen Countries Perceive Influences on Their Work. ''[[The International Journal of Press/Politics]]'', 16, pp. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Juan de Dios Filiberto National Orchestra of Argentine Music''' (''Orquesta Nacional de Música Argentina Juan de Dios Filiberto'') is the national [[pops orchestra]] of [[Argentina]].

==Overview==
The orchestra was established by the [[Buenos Aires]] government as the Municipal Popular Orchestra of Folk Art in 1939. The original ensemble of 14 musicians had been organized as the ''Orquesta Porteña'' in 1932 by [[tango music|tango]] composer [[Juan de Dios Filiberto]], who had earned renown for his 1926 composition, ''[[w:es:Caminito (canción)|Caminito]]''.&lt;ref name=c&gt;[http://www.cultura.gov.ar/direcciones/?info=organismo&amp;id=6&amp;idd=1 Orquesta Nacional de Música Argentina "Juan de Dios Filiberto"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516204239/http://www.cultura.gov.ar/direcciones/?info=organismo&amp;id=6&amp;idd=1 |date=2010-05-16 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Juan Perón]] reinaugurated the group as the National Popular Music Orchestra in 1948, increasing the ensemble to 40 members; Filiberto remained its Music Director until his retirement in 1959.&lt;ref name=portal&gt;[http://www.elportaldeltango.com/english/especial/filiberto.htm El Portal del Tango: Juan de Dios Filiberto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217141926/http://www.elportaldeltango.com/english/especial/filiberto.htm |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan de Dios Filiberto died in 1964; ten years after his death and in his honor, the Juan de Dios Filiberto National Orchestra of Argentine Music was created with its venue in the [[Cervantes Theatre (Buenos Aires)|Cervantes Theatre]]. Maintained by the National Culture Secretariat, its 40 musicians are each music instructors in their respective instruments.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; Part of the National Arts Commission's annual events calendar since 2004, the orchestra's conductors have included maestros José Rosa, Osvaldo Requena, [[Osvaldo Piro]], and since 2000, [[Atilio Stampone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todotango.com/spanish/creadores/jdfiliberto.asp Todo Tango: Juan de Dios Filiberto]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4007">[[File:Karte Niger - Nationalsprachen.png|thumb|Distribution map of the national languages of Niger]]
Niger has 11 official languages, with French being the official language and Hausa the most spoken language. Depending on how they are counted, [[Niger]] has between 8 and 20 indigenous languages. The discrepancy comes from the fact that several are closely related, and can be grouped together or considered apart.

== Official Languages ==
[[French language|French]], inherited from the colonial period, is the [[official language]]. It is spoken mainly as a second language by people who have received an education (20% of Nigeriens are literate in French, and even 47% in cities, growing quickly as literacy improves&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odsef.fss.ulaval.ca/sites/odsef.fss.ulaval.ca/files/odsef_rr_alphab_niger_2015_final2.pdf, page 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;). Although educated Nigeriens still constitute a relatively small percentage of the population, the French language is the language used by the official administration (courts, government, etc.), the media and the business community. See also: [[African French]]

Niger has ten official [[national language]]s, namely [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Buduma language|Buduma]], [[Fula language|Fulfulde]], [[Gurma language|Gourmanchéma]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], [[Songhay languages|Zarma &amp; Songhai]], [[Tuareg languages|Tamasheq]], [[Tasawaq language|Tassawaq]], [[Tebu languages|Tebu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/afrique/niger-loi-2001-037-LNG.htm République du Niger, "Loi n° 2001-037 du 31 décembre 2001 fixant les modalités de promotion et de développement des langues nationales."

In [[photography]], [[filmography]] and other visual arts, '''lead room''', or sometimes '''nose room''', is the space in front, and in the direction of, moving or stationary subjects.&lt;ref name="c2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapacourse.com/DVpages/leadroom.htm |title=Lead room |publisher=mapacourse.com |access-date=2007-08-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929025752/http://www.mapacourse.com/DVpages/leadroom.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Essential Digital Video Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide to Making Videos That Make Money | author = Peter May | publisher = Rotovision | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-59253-024-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zLIAP3_kfBwC&amp;pg=PT170&amp;ots=miv2qQT3U6&amp;dq=photography+%22lead+room%22&amp;ei=RlK7RuWqIIqKoQL3ttXvBQ&amp;sig=uYbX9__o6IwugxjNBxvzAs6dSRw }}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-composed shots leave space in the direction the subject is facing or moving.&lt;ref name="c2"/&gt; When the human eye scans a photograph for the first time it will expect to see a bit in front of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikonians.org/html/resources/guides/composition_101/composition_101_4.html|title=How to Improve Your Photography - Five Easy Composition Tricks|publisher=Tom Boné|access-date=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, moving objects such as cars require lead room.&lt;ref name="c1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videomaker.com/article/9231/|title=Framing Good Shots| work=Videomaker Magazine| access-date=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; If extra space is allowed in front of a moving car, the viewer can see that it has someplace to go; without this visual padding, the car's progress will seem impeded.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt;

{{refimprove|date=April 2016}}

This is a list of songs inspired by insects.

[[Insects in music]] are known from everything from [[classical music]] and [[opera]] to [[ragtime]] and [[pop music|pop]].

[[Rimsky-Korsakov]] imitates the quick buzzing vibrato of the [[bumblebee]] in his famous "[[The Flight of the Bumblebee]]". Popular songs with an insect theme include "glow-worm", "Poor Butterfly", "La Cucaracha", "The Boll Weevil", and "The Blue-Tailed Fly". Operas like [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Madam Butterfly]]'' and Rousel's ''Le Festin de L’Araignée'' similarly reference arthropods.&lt;ref name=Hogue&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hogue |first1= Charles |title= Cultural Entomology |journal= Annual Review of Entomology |date= 1987 |volume=32 |url= http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html |accessdate=4 April 2016 |publisher=Insects.org |doi= 10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop groups named after insects include [[Buddy Holly and the Crickets]], [[The Beatles]], [[Adam and the Ants]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insects in Music, Art and Poetry|url=http://horticulture.oregonstate.edu/system/files/u1473/ent300-8.ppt.|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs named after or inspired by the sounds of insects are listed below.

; [[wikt:Bible thumper|Bible thumper]] (also "[[wikt:Bible basher|Bible basher]]"; mainly US): Someone perceived as aggressively imposing their [[Christian beliefs]] upon others. The term derives from preachers thumping their hands down on the [[Bible]], or thumping the Bible itself, to emphasize a point during a [[sermon]]. The term's target domain is broad and can often extend to anyone engaged in a public show of religion, fundamentalist or not. The term is most commonly used in English-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Robert E.|title=Ronald Reagan's Presidency: The Impact of an Alcoholic Parent|journal=Political Psychology|date=1 October 2008 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=737–765 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00662.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archbishop warned that “based on a relativistic understanding of the Christian faith and a conditional adherence to the Church, some Catholics seek to construct a Christianity and, consequently, a Church to their own liking, unilateral and outside the identity and mission that Jesus Christ has fundamentally given us.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manila shawl''' is an [[Embroidery|embroidered]] [[silk]] shawl associated with the [[Port of Manila]] in the Philippines and [[Andalusia|Andalusian]] culture in Spain. 

==History==
The [[Manila galleon|Manila Galleon trade]] was started in 1565 by [[Andrés de Urdaneta]], who discovered the route from Manila to Mexico. This route passed the northern Pacific, bypassing Japan and skirted the California coast down to Acapulco in Mexico. The Spanish king allowed the Filipinos to trade with the Chinese in Canton ([[Guangzhou]]). They brought silks, ivory, furniture, porcelain, lacquerware, and spices from Canton to Manila and the Chinese merchants were paid for these goods with silver coins from Mexico. Then, once or twice a year, the galleon went to Acapulco through the route discovered by Urdaneta. The merchandise then traveled overland from Acapulco to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]]. At Veracruz, the merchandise was put on ships that traveled in convoy to [[Seville|Seville, Spain]], accompanying other ships that were bringing gold and silver from the Americas to Spain. Spanish warships accompanied the galleons to Seville to protect them from pirates. Later in 1718, the port used in Spain was changed to [[Cádiz|Cadiz]] from Seville, since a sandbar blocked the port of Seville and ships could not reach Seville. The Manila Galleon trade stopped in 1815, when the Mexican War of Independence took place.

One of the items that came from Canton to Manila was the silk shawl. It was a square piece of cloth with plenty of embroidery. The shawl was folded in half like a triangle and worn over the shoulders of women. This shawl became known as the manton de Manila, although it was not made in Manila, but was made in Canton. The Philippines never had a silk industry. The manton de Manila soon became very popular in Seville, Andalusia, and in Latin America.

The embroidered figures first had many themes, including designs of frogs, Chinese people and scenes, and birds and flowers. The embroidery soon changed to themes that were popular with women of Seville and designs of frogs disappeared. The women of Seville also asked that deep fringes be added to the borders of the shawls, so that when one wore the shawl, there would be movement of the fringes, which would call attention to the wearer.

During part of the 19th century, romanticism took over and Parisian fashions dictated that the shoulders of women should be left uncovered. Spanish women copied the fashion and they found that the manton de Manila was a very good thing to wear with these dresses, as the shawl provided some warmth to the bare shoulders. The manton was also used to decorate grand pianos in houses, as can be seen in the recently reopened [[Museum of Romanticism (Madrid)|Museo del Romanticismo]] in Madrid. Beside pianos, the manton was also used to decorate sofas in elegant houses. Many Spanish houses today still use the manton to decorate pianos and sofas.

Today, the manton de Manila is still very popular in Andalusia for festive occasions. Women use the shawls for dressing up and going to parties. During the [[Fiesta de las Cruces|Festival of the Crosses of May]] in Cordoba, balconies are dressed up with the manton that add a bright look to the plazas. During the [[Seville Fair|April Fair]] in Seville, most of the women in [[Traje de flamenca|Gypsy dress (flamenco dress)]] use the manton as an accessory. The manton is also used by female flamenco dancers during their dance, as it is a great dance enhancer and adds drama when the flamenco dancer twirls it around her body and in the air. [[Sara Baras]] and [[María Pagés|Maria Pages]] are two of the most best flamenco dancers in Spain and they are experts in twirling their manton during the dance. Famous Spanish singers who sing the copla, a traditional form of song, also are dressed in the manton. One of the most popular singers of this genre is [[Isabel Pantoja]], and she has a great variety of beautiful mantons.

Many of the cheaper mantons are imported from China, and they may range in price from 20 to 300 euros, depending on the amount of embroidery used. The cheaper ones are made of polyester, and the more expensive ones are made of silk. The best mantons found in Spain today are made of silk and are made in Seville, and they are priced from 300 to 2000 euros. One can see the most beautiful mantons by walking along Calle Sierpes, one of the principal pedestrian streets in Seville. One can also see beautiful dresses made from the manton. The manton de Manila is an integral part of Spanish culture today.

A '''matrifocal''' family structure is one where mothers head families and fathers play a less important role in the home and in bringing up children.

==Definition==

The concept of the matrifocal family was introduced to the study of Caribbean societies by Raymond Smith in 1956. He linked the emergence of matrifocal families with how households are formed in the region: "The household group tends to be matri-focal in the sense that a woman in the status of 'mother' is usually the de facto leader of the group, and conversely the husband-father, although de jure head of the household group (if present), is usually marginal to the complex of internal relationships of the group. By 'marginal' we mean that he associates relatively infrequently with the other members of the group, and is on the fringe of the effective ties which bind the group together".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1956|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith emphasises that a matrifocal family is not simply woman-centred, but rather mother-centred; women in their role as mothers become key to organising the family group; men tend to be marginal to this organisation and to the household (though they may have a more central role in other networks). Where matrifocal families are common, marriage is less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later work, Smith tends to emphasise the household less, and to see matrifocality more in terms of how the family network forms with mothers as key nodes in the network. Throughout, Smith argues that matrifocal kinship should be seen as a subsystem in a larger stratified society and its cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1956|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; He increasingly emphasises how the Afro-Caribbean matrifocal family is best understood within of a class-race hierarchy where marriage is connected to perceived status and prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A family or domestic group is matrifocal when it is centred on a woman and her children. In this case the father(s) of these children are intermittently present in the life of the group and occupy a secondary place. The children's mother is not necessarily the wife of one of the children's fathers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Godelier|2011|p=568}} (Glossary, entry ''matrifocal'')&lt;/ref&gt; In general, according to Laura Hobson Herlihy citing P. Mohammed, women have "high status" if they are "the main wage earners", they "control&amp;nbsp;... the household economy", and males tend to be absent.&lt;ref&gt;Three quotations: {{harvp|Mohammed|1986}}, cited in {{harvp|Herlihy|2007|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men's absences are often of long durations.&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p137"&gt;{{harvp|Herlihy|2007|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of R.&amp;nbsp;T. Smith's contemporary critics, M.&amp;nbsp;G. Smith, notes that while households may appear matrifocal taken by themselves, the ''linkages between'' households may be patrifocal. That is, a man in his role as father may be providing (particularly economic) support to a mother in one or more households whether he lives in that household or not. Both for men and for women having children with more than one partner is a common feature of this kind of system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative terms for 'matrifocal' or 'matrifocality' include ''matricentric'', ''matripotestal'', and ''women-centered kinship networks''.&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p134"&gt;{{harvp|Herlihy|2007|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matrifocal is distinguished from the [[Matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], the [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]], [[matrilateral]] and [[matriarchy]] (the last because matrifocality does not imply that women have power in the larger community).

According to anthropologist [[Maurice Godelier]], matrifocality is "typical of Afro-Caribbean groups" and some African-American communities.&lt;ref name="MetamorphosesKin-p457n31"&gt;{{harvp|Godelier|2011|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include families in which a father has a wife and one or more mistresses; in a few cases, a mother may have more than one lover.&lt;ref name="MetamorphosesKin-p457n31" /&gt;  Matrifocality was also found, according to Rasmussen per Herlihy, among the [[Tuareg people]] in northern Africa;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rasmussen|1996}}, cited in {{harvp|Herlihy|2007|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to Herlihy citing other authors, in some [[Mediterranean Sea#Geography|Mediterranean]] communities;&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p137" /&gt; and, according to Herlihy quoting Scott, in urban [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scott|1995}}, cited in {{harvp|Herlihy|2007|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their study of family life in Bethnal Green, London, during the 1950s, Young and Wilmott found both [[matrifocal]] and [[matrilineal]] elements at work: mothers were a focus for distributing economic resources through the family network; they were also active in passing down the rights to tenancies in matrilineal succession to their daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Young and Wilmot|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herlihy found matrifocality among the [[Miskito people|Miskitu people]], in the village of Kuri, on the Caribbean coast of northeastern [[Honduras]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Herlihy|2007|pp=133–134 &amp; ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herlihy, the "main power"&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p134" /&gt; of Kuri women lies "in their ability to craft everyday social identities and kinship relations&amp;nbsp;.... Their power lies beyond the scope of the Honduran state, which recognizes male surnames and males as legitimate heads of households."&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p134" /&gt; Herlihy found in Kuri a trend toward matriliny&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p141"&gt;{{harvp|Herlihy|2007|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a correlation with matrilineality,&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p145"&gt;{{harvp|Herlihy|2007|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while some patriarchal norms also existed.&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p145" /&gt; Herlihy found that the "women knew more than most men about village histories, genealogies, and local folklore"&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p141" /&gt; and that "men typically did not know local kinship relations, the proper terms of reference, or reciprocity obligations in their wife's family"&lt;ref name="MiskitoCoast-p141" /&gt; and concluded that Miskitu women "increasingly assume responsibility for the social reproduction of identities and ultimately for preserving worldwide cultural and linguistic diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Herlihy|2007|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nair]] community in Kerala and the [[Bunt (community)|Bunt]] community in Tulunadu in South India are prime examples of matrifocality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} This can be attributed to the fact that if males were largely warriors by profession, a community was bound to lose male members at youth, leading to a situation where the females assumed the role of running the family.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}.

==History==

In the 14th century, in [[Jiangnan]], South China, under Mongol rule by the [[Yuan dynasty]], Kong Qi kept a diary of his view of some families as practicing gynarchy, not defined as it is in major dictionaries&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, [4th] ed. 1993, {{ISBN|0-19-861271-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged''. G. &amp; C. Merriam (Merriam-Webster), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language''. Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 3d ed. 1992, {{ISBN|0-395-44895-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary''. New York: Random House, 2d ed. 2001, {{ISBN|0-375-42566-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but defined by Paul J. Smith as "the creation of short-term family structures dominated by women"&lt;ref name="FearGynarchyAgeChaos-JESHO-p45-n134"&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1998|p=45}} and see pp. 1 (abstract), 2–3, 46, 63, 65, 69–70, 72–73 &amp; 81&lt;/ref&gt; and not as matrilineal or matriarchal.&lt;ref name="FearGynarchyAgeChaos-JESHO-p45-n134" /&gt; The gynarchy possibly could be passed down through generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1998|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul J. Smith, it was to this kind of gynarchy that "Kong ascribed...the general collapse of society"&lt;ref name="FearGynarchyAgeChaos-JESHO-p45-n134" /&gt; and Kong believed that men in Jiangnan tended to "forfeit...authority to women".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smith|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matrifocality arose, Godelier said, in some [[Afro-Caribbean]] and [[African American]] cultures as a consequence of [[slavery|enslavement]] of thousands.&lt;ref name="MetamorphosesKin-p457n31" /&gt; Slaves were forbidden to marry and their children belonged to the slavemasters.&lt;ref name="MetamorphosesKin-p457n31" /&gt; Women in slave families "often" sought impregnation by White masters so the children would have lighter [[discrimination based on skin color|skin color]] and be more successful in life,&lt;ref name="MetamorphosesKin-p457n31" /&gt; lessening the role of Black husbands. Some societies, particularly Western European, allow women to enter the paid labor force or receive government aid and thus be able to afford to raise children alone&lt;ref name="MetamorphosesKin-p457n31" /&gt; while some other societies "oppose&amp;nbsp;... [women] living on their own."&lt;ref name="MetamorphosesKin-p457n31" /&gt;

In feminist belief (more common in the 1970s than in the 1990s–2000s and criticized within feminism and within archaeology, anthropology, and theology as lacking a scholarly basis), there was a "matrifocal (if not matriarchal) Golden Age" before [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Rountree|2001|pp=5–9 &amp; ''passim'' &amp; quotation at p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years''''' is a [[literary hoax]] by [[Misha Defonseca]], first published in 1997. The book was fraudulently published as a [[memoir]] telling the supposed true story of how the author survived [[the Holocaust]] as a young [[Jewish]] girl, wandering Europe searching for her deported parents. The book sold well in several countries and was made into a movie, '''''Survivre avec les loups''''' (''Surviving with the Wolves''), named after the claim that Misha was adopted by a pack of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] during her journey who protected her.

However, in February 2008, Defonseca publicly admitted what many had already suspected, that her book was false. Her real name was Monique de Wael; while her parents were in fact taken away by the Nazis, they were not Jews but [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] members of the [[Belgian Resistance]], and she did not leave her home during the war, as the book claims. In a statement released through her lawyers to the [[Brussels]] newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'', de Wael attempted to defend the hoax, claiming that the story of "Misha" "is not actual reality, but was my reality, my way of surviving" and that there were moments when she "found it difficult to differentiate between what was real and what was part of my imagination."&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lesoir.be/channels/cinema/exclusif-2008-02-28-580849.shtml|title=Defonseca's statement to ''Le Soir''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203827/http://www.lesoir.be/channels/cinema/exclusif-2008-02-28-580849.shtml|archivedate=2008-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The real author, Monique de Wael==
{{Main|Misha Defonseca}}
It is difficult to be sure of de Wael's true history, since it was obscured for so long behind the falsehood she told. However, at least a fragmentary version can be put together from documentation turned up by researchers and from de Wael's own admissions.

Monique de Wael was born in 1937 in [[Etterbeek]], [[Belgium]], to Robert De Wael and Josephine Donvil. Sources differ as to her birthdate: May 12 (according to a [[baptism]]al record)&lt;ref name="Eskin"&gt;Eskin, Blake. "[http://www.slate.com/id/2185493/pagenum/all/#page_start Crying Wolf: Why did it take so long for a far-fetched Holocaust memoir to be debunked?]", Slate.com, February 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; or September 2 (according to records from the school Monique attended in the year 1943–44.)&lt;ref name="Vrai dossier"&gt;"[http://www.lesoir.be/channels/cinema/cinema-ses-parents-etaient-2008-02-23-579622.shtml Le vrai dossier de 'Misha'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228004201/http://www.lesoir.be/channels/cinema/cinema-ses-parents-etaient-2008-02-23-579622.shtml |date=2008-02-28 }}" (French)&lt;/ref&gt; Her family was [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], and her parents were members of the [[Belgian resistance]], which led to them being arrested by the Nazis on September 23, 1941.&lt;ref name="Vrai dossier" /&gt; Nazi records indicate that Robert de Wael was executed on May 3 or 4 of 1944, and Donvil died sometime between February 1 and December 31 of 1945.&lt;ref name="Vrai dossier" /&gt;

According to de Wael's February 2008 statement, her guardianship went first to her grandfather Ernest de Wael, and then to her uncle Maurice de Wael. De Wael says that with the exception of her grandfather, those who took her in treated her badly, including calling her "the traitor's daughter" because her father was suspected of having given information under [[torture]] in St. Gilles prison.&lt;ref name="Eskin" /&gt; She remained with her uncle's family, and did not go off in search of her missing parents as "Misha" did, but according to her statement, this time with her uncle's family was when she began to "feel Jewish" and to fantasize about going off with the wolves.&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

==The book==
By the late 1980s, de Wael was living in [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]] under the name ''Misha Defonseca''. She was telling people the fictional story of Misha as a recollection of her own life, and presented it to the congregation of a [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], [[synagogue]] on [[Holocaust Memorial Day]] as her own experience of the Holocaust.

The character of Misha is eight when her parents are taken away (unlike de Wael, who was four). Before their deportation, her parents place her with a Roman Catholic family, who give her the pseudonym ''Monique de Wael'' (the author's real name). When this family treats her cruelly, Misha goes off in search of her parents, walking through Europe and living by stealing food, clothing and shoes.

At a time when she faces starvation in a forest, she is adopted by wolves, becoming a [[feral child]]. Protected by the pack, she survives by eating [[offal]] and worms.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;"[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/947275.html Holocaust: A children's version]". [[Haaretz]], 2008-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, she treks over {{convert|1,900|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} through Europe, from Belgium to the [[Ukraine]], through the [[Balkans]] and Germany and Poland (where she sneaks in and out of the Warsaw Ghetto), to Italy by boat and back to Belgium through France. Before the war is over, the character has taken human life to survive, stabbing to death with a pocket knife a rapist Nazi soldier who attacks her.&lt;ref name="Incredible"&gt;"[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2001/10/31/incredible_journey/?page=full Incredible Journey]". Boston Globe, 2001-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jane Daniel, the owner of a small publishing company, Mt. Ivy Press, heard of Misha's dramatic and supposedly true story, she signed Defonseca to write a memoir of her experiences, with [[Vera Lee]], a friend of Daniel's, as co-writer. The book was published in April 1997, and sold only around 5,000 copies in the United States, but was optioned for a film by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Disney declined to make the film, however, in part because of legal difficulties:&lt;ref name="Incredible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Den of lies"&gt;"[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/03/01/den_of_lies/?page=full Den of lies]". [[Boston Globe]], 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; by 1998, Defonseca and Lee had brought a lawsuit against Daniel, alleging that she had failed to market the book properly in the U.S. and had failed to give the co-authors their proper share of overseas royalties. In 2001 a jury awarded Defonseca and Lee over $10 million. A judge's decision later tripled the amount Daniel was required to pay to over $32 million, with $22.5 million to go to Defonseca and $11 million to Lee. The rights to the book were also awarded to Defonseca.&lt;ref name="Den of lies" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2008/02/29/writer_says_holocaust_memoir_not_true/ Writer Says Holocaust 'Memoir' Not True], February 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Defonseca's contract with Daniel and Mt. Ivy Press did not include the European print and film rights, which were sold separately. The book became a bestseller in France, selling more than 30,000 copies, and Defonseca toured France to promote it; in Italy the book sold even better, surpassing 37,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Incredible" /&gt; French film rights were sold to French, Jewish filmmaker [[Véra Belmont]] and the resulting movie, ''Survivre avec des loups'', opened in Belgium in late 2007.

==Exposure==
Doubts about the truthfulness of the book surfaced even before the book was published. At least two people who were asked by the publisher to contribute [[blurb|blurbs]] for the book instead warned the publisher that the story was not true.&lt;ref name="Eskin" /&gt; One of them, [[Lawrence L. Langer]] (a 1991 winner of the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Criticism, for his book ''Holocaust Testimonies: The Ruins of Memory'') consulted Holocaust scholar [[Raul Hilberg]], who also thought the story impossible.&lt;ref name="Incredible" /&gt; A third, [[Bette Greene]], asked for her blurb to be removed because she found the book unbelievable.&lt;ref name="Life in Pieces"&gt;Eskin, Blake. ''A Life in Pieces: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin Wilkomirski'', New York and London: Norton, 2002, {{ISBN|0-393-04871-3}}. pp. 197-8&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1996, questions of authenticity were being aired publicly, for instance by [[Henryk M. Broder]] in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'': "Falsehood or not a falsehood, that is the question here. Aside from {{interpolation|the existence of a compass allegedly used by Misha}} no objective proof exists. And all witnesses who could confirm Misha's story are either dead or disappeared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broder|first1=Henryk|title=Verliebt in eine tote Kobra|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-9133130.html?name=Verliebt+in+eine+tote+Kobra|work=Der Spiegel|date=December 12, 1996|language=German|quote=''Fälschung oder nicht Fälschung, das ist hier die Frage. Bis auf den 'Kompaß' liegt kein sachlicher Beweis vor. Und alle Zeugen, die Mishas Geschichte bestätigen könnten, sind entweder tot oder verschwunden.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even Defonseca's co-author Lee had doubts, leading her to consult [[Facing History and Ourselves]], a nonprofit educational organization which helps to guide how the Holocaust is studied in schools. According to Lee, when the organization's representative told her that the story she was describing was impossible, she tried to bring her concerns to Daniel, only to be rebuffed.&lt;ref name="Incredible" /&gt; When she was told that Defonseca had burned diaries from her teens in which she had written down her story, because the French version of her book had told her story so completely, Lee was surprised because she had never been told of the existence of these diaries, much less been given access to them to assist in writing the book.&lt;ref name="Incredible" /&gt; Nevertheless, Lee would profess surprise in 2008 when Defonseca confessed that she was not Jewish and the story was fictional, saying that no research she did had led her to think the story was anything but true.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/02/29/writer_says_holocaust_memoir_not_true/ Writer admits Holocaust book is not true]", Boston Globe, February 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the publisher of the book, Daniel had made many public statements which addressed the issue of whether Defonseca's memoir was truthful. One of these public statements came in 1999, and was prompted by the public controversy that occurred when [[Binjamin Wilkomirski]]'s alleged Holocaust memoir ''Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood 1939–1948'' was shown to be a fraud. Daniel wrote "Is Misha's story fact or invention? Without hard evidence one way or the other, questions will always remain ... It is left to the reader to decide."&lt;ref name="Life in Pieces" /&gt; Later, after the first jury award, Daniel would say "I have no idea whether {{interpolation|Misha's story}} is true or not. My experience is that all Holocaust stories are far-fetched. All survivor stories are miracles."&lt;ref name="Incredible" /&gt; By 2007, however, Daniel was trying to actively debunk the story of Misha in hopes that it would provide a way to challenge the judgement against her.&lt;ref name="Den of lies" /&gt; In August 2007, Daniel began a [[blog]] titled "Best-Seller", telling the story of how the book came to be published, and attracted attention from [[Sharon Sergeant]], a genealogist. Using clues from the various versions of the manuscript, including the "pseudonym" of ''Monique de Wael'', Sergeant turned up documents from de Wael's life, such as a baptismal record and a school register showing de Wael enrolled in elementary school in 1943 when Misha was supposed to be wandering through Europe. After Daniel published these documents on the blog in late February 2008, the Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' took up the controversy, unearthing and publishing more detail on de Wael's parents.&lt;ref name="lesoir"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink=Marc Metdepenningen | last=Metdepenningen | first=Marc | title=Le vrai dossier de " Misha " | language=French | publisher=''Le Soir'' | date=2008-02-23 | url=http://www.lesoir.be/channels/cinema/cinema-ses-parents-etaient-2008-02-23-579622.shtml | accessdate=2008-03-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228004201/http://www.lesoir.be/channels/cinema/cinema-ses-parents-etaient-2008-02-23-579622.shtml | archivedate=2008-02-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week, Defonseca had acknowledged that ''Monique de Wael'' was her real name and that the life of Misha was a fantasy.&lt;ref name="Eskin" /&gt;

'''Mugo wa Kibiru''' or '''Chege (Cege) wa Kibiru''' was a Kenyan [[sage (philosophy)|sage]] from the Gikuyu tribe (Kikuyu, in Swahili) who lived in the 18th and early 19th centuries. His name "Mugo" means "a healer". Mugo wa Kibiru was born in Kariara, [[Murang'a]], near Thika, but his exact dates of birth and death are unknown.
 
There are various anecdotes regarding Chege wa Kibiru in [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] folklore, but his claim to fame arose as a result of his accurate prophecies regarding the advent of the Caucasian (white man) on African soil long before [[British missionaries]] set their feet in Kenya. Chege's prophecies were that there would come a race of people whose skin complexion would resemble a small pale coloured frog that lives in water (kiengere) and one would be able to see their blood flowing under their skins just like the frog. And these pale strangers would have clothing that resembles butterflies (ciĩuhuruta) in their colourful aspect. And that these pale strangers would carry magical sticks that would produce fire (guns firing bullets), and it will be foolish for our warriors to confront them with their spears. Chege also prophesied that there would be a cultural erosion of tribal customs where Kikuyu youth would adopt the ways of the Caucasians. The Caucasians would also carry fire in their pockets (matchboxes). Cooked food previously never sold in Kikuyu custom, would be sold on roadsides and markets all over the country. The plains where the Maasai graze their cattle would be farmed. Chege prophesied the coming of the [[Uganda Railway]] line that would stretch from one body of water [[Indian Ocean]] in the east to another in the west [[Lake Victoria]] and described an iron snake that would have many "legs" like an earthworm (train), travelling on this railway line, eating the Caucasians and vomiting them when it stopped (train journey with passengers). According to the prophecy, the iron snake would have a bushy head bellowing smoke. Chege predicted with astonishing accuracy that there would be a famine in Kikuyuland that would exterminate much of the tribe right before the arrival of these pale coloured strangers or foreigners.

==The Sacred Tree==

Chege foretold that the Kikuyus and other tribes would be colonised by the Caucasians but that the colonisation would end after many years (68 years) with the result that the Caucasians would leave Kenya. Chege predicted that a [[giant fig tree]] 15 feet in diameter located in [[Thika]], 26 miles north of [[Nairobi]], would wither and die by the day Kenya gained independence. Chege's prophecies had proved so accurate that the fig tree was regarded as sacred by the Kikuyus; even the British administrators/colonialists took the prophecy very seriously that they tended to and reinforced the fig tree with a mound of earth, and then built an iron ring around it to prevent it from falling. These measures were bound to fail. Shortly before Kenya gained independence from the British, the fig tree was struck by lightning and began to wither rapidly. On 12 December 1963 when Kenya officially became an independent state, the tree had decayed and died thereby fulfilling Chege wa Kibiru's prophecy over a century earlier.

== Literature ==

''' Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, 1965. ''The River Between'' '''
 
Chege wa Kibiru appears as a secondary character in "The River Between" as Waiyaki's fore-father:
 
"Had not Mugo Kibiru the great seer, in whose line Chege and his son run, talked about the coming of the white man? Mugo told people that 'You could not cut butterflies with a panga (machete or cutlass).... you could not spear them until you learnt their ways of movement, trap and fight back'"- page 20 - &lt;ref&gt;''The River Between'', Heinemann, 1965, 1989 (London); {{ISBN|0-435-90548-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Ngûgî wa Thiong'o, 1967. ''A Grain of Wheat'' '''
 
Mugo wa Kibiru is mentioned in this literary classic.
 
"It's (Mau Mau movement) origins can, so the people say, be traced to the day the whiteman came to the country, clutching the book of God in both hands, a magic witness that the whiteman was a messenger from the Lord. His tongue was coated with sugar: his humility was touching. For a time, people ignored the voice of the Gikuyu seer who once said: there shall come a people with clothes like the butterflies"- page 10 - ''A Grain of Wheat'', Heineman, 1967, 1986, 2002 Heinemann (London); {{ISBN|978-1-101-58485-9}}.
 
"Waiyaki and other warrior-leaders took arms. The iron snake spoken of by Mugo wa Kibiro was quickly wriggling towards Nairobi for a thorough exploitation of the hinterland"- page 12 - ''A Grain of Wheat'', 1967, 1986, 2002, Heinemann (London); {{ISBN|978-1-101-58485-9}}.
 
'''Mugia, D., 1979.  ''Ũrathi wa Cege wa Kibiru '''''

== Controversy ==
Some scholars cast doubt on these prophecies, claiming that Chege wa Kĩbirũ must have heard about Caucasians and trains from Kikuyu traders who might have travelled to the coast for trade purposes. And it would certainly have been easy to know about guns, clothing, trains and railways from the Arabs and Caucasians with stories from Kikuyu traders reaching the hinterland from the coastal region where many Arabs and Caucasians carried out their trade. The question would then be; how did Chege know that the Uganda Railway would stretch from one body of water to another many years before the railway was laid out? Chege was long dead before the beginning of the railway construction in 1901. Furthermore, what about Chege's accurate prophecies regarding the falling of the giant fig tree signifying end of colonial rule, the great famine in the late 19th century, and the subsequent cultural erosion of African values and customs? Leakey says that trade contacts existed between Arabs and the Kikuyu for a while, and it is possible that these contacts existed only in certain parts of the Kikuyu nation and not everywhere. Boyes in his accounts testifies that he was the first white man that some Kikuyus in a particular region, saw, and that he was an object of great curiosity. Boyes states that he enjoyed demonstrating his "white powers" by shooting a hole through a soft barked tree with a rifle {Mutaarani, ''A Kikuyu Reader for Std. IV'', 1953, Consolata Catholic Mission Press (Nyeri); Muriuki Godfrey, ''A History of Kikuyu, 1500-1900'', 1974, University of Oxford University Press (London); Father Cagnolo, "The Agikuyu", 1933, Consolata Catholic Mission (Nyeri)}.

'''"No purchase, no pay"''' (or '''"no prey, no pay"''') was a phrase used by [[pirates]] and [[privateers]], of the 17th century in particular, to describe the conditions under which participants were expected to join expeditions or raids. The phrase describes a remuneration arrangement similar to a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dgne1L6IV8sC ''The Sea Rover's Practice: Pirate Tactics and Techniques, 1630-1730''] by Benerson Little ([[Potomac Books]], 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

The term "purchase" in the phrase is used to mean success against piratical targets from whom [[Treasure|booty]] might be successfully extracted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G4DXv4pNi8UC ''Daily Life of Pirates''] by David Marley ([[ABC-CLIO]], 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of the phrase was that if the expedition did not succeed in extracting booty from the target, those participating in the expedition would receive no reward.&lt;ref name=marley&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bU6ML_VnXTwC ''Pirates of the Americas, Volume 1''] by David Marley ([[ABC-CLIO]], 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of an unsuccessful raid, participants might receive nothing at all. But in the event that a raid was successful, loot was often shared equitably and democratically with clear ratios based on seniority and length of service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pYg8AAAAIAAJ ''No man knows my grave: Sir Henry Morgan, Captain William Kidd, Captain Woodes Rogers in the great age of privateers and pirates, 1665-1715''] by Alexander Porter Winston ([[Houghton Mifflin]], 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

The phrase was used extensively to describe arrangements for pirates working on the [[Spanish Main]] in particular. The concept is said to have encouraged increased risk-taking as pirates made a calculated decision to attack more valuable targets with a better [[Risk–return spectrum|risk-reward ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OQj17APXUUUC ''Jolly Roger: The Story of the Great Age of Piracy''] by Patrick Pringle ([[Courier Dover Publications]], 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hender Molesworth, 1st Baronet|Hender Molesworth]], [[List of Governors of Jamaica|Governor of Jamaica]], is known to have issued privateer and even pirate-hunting contracts with strict "no purchase, no pay" clauses.&lt;ref name=marley/&gt;

'''''Persian Letters''''' ({{lang-fr|Lettres persanes}}) is a literary work, written in 1721, by [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu]], recounting the experiences of two [[Persia]]n noblemen, Usbek and Rica, who are traveling through [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1051588x/f5.image.r=| title =  Lettres persanes | access-date= 13 June 2016 | year = 1721| publisher = P.

Brunel | place=Amsterdam| volume = II |via= Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
In 1711 Usbek leaves his [[seraglio]] in [[Isfahan]] to take the long journey to France, accompanied by his young friend Rica. He leaves behind five wives (Zashi, Zéphis, Fatmé, Zélis, and Roxane) in the care of a number of black [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]], one of whom is the head or first eunuch. During the trip and their long stay in [[Paris]] (1712–1720), they comment, in letters exchanged with friends and [[mullah]]s, on numerous aspects of Western, Christian society, particularly French politics and [[Moors]], ending with a biting satire of the System of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]. Over time, various disorders surface back in the seraglio, and, beginning in 1717 (Letter 139 [147]), the situation there rapidly unravels. Usbek orders his head eunuch to crack down, but his message does not arrive in time, and a revolt brings about the death of his wives, including the vengeful suicide of his favorite, Roxane, and, it appears, most of the eunuchs.

The Chronology breaks down as follows:

*Letters 1–21 [1–23]: The journey from Isfahan to France, which lasts almost 14 months (from 19 March 1711 to 4 May 1712).
*Letters 22 [24]–89 [92]: Paris in the reign of [[Louis XIV]], 3 years in all (from May 1712 to September 1715).
*Letters 90 [93]–137 [143] or [supplementary Letter 8 =145]: the Regency of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d’Orléans]], covering five years (from September 1715 to November 1720).
*Letters 138 [146]– 150 [161]: the collapse of the seraglio in Isfahan, approximately 3 years (1717–1720).

The first edition of the novel, which consists of 150 letters, appeared in May 1721 under the rubric Cologne: [[Pierre Marteau]], a front for the Amsterdam publisher Jacques Desbordes whose business is now run by his widow, Susanne de Caux.{{clarify|date=November 2014}} Called edition A, this is the text utilized in the recent critical edition of ''Lettres persanes'' for the complete works of Montesquieu published by the Voltaire Foundation in 2004. A second edition (B) by the same publisher later in the same year, for which there is so far no entirely satisfactory explanation, curiously included three new letters but omitted thirteen of the original ones. All subsequent editions in the author’s lifetime (i.e., until 1755) derive from A or B. A new edition in 1758, prepared by Montesquieu’s son, included eight new letters – bringing the total to 161 – and a short piece by the author entitled "Quelques réflexions sur les ''Lettres persanes''." This latter edition has been used for all subsequent editions until the ''Œuvres complètes'' of 2004, which reverts to the original edition but includes the added letters marked as "supplementary" and, in parentheses, the numbering scheme of 1758.

==An epistolary novel==
[[File:Persianische Briefe.jpg|thumb|An early illustration depicting Usbek and Rica]]
Montesquieu never referred to ''Lettres persanes'' (Persian Letters) as a [[novel]] until "Quelques remarques sur les ''Lettres persanes''," which begins: "Nothing about the ''Lettres persanes'' was more ingratiating than to find in it unexpectedly a sort of novel. There is a visible beginning, development, and ending […]." Initially, for most of its first readers as well as for its author, it was not considered primarily a novel, and even less an "[[epistolary novel]]" (as it is often classified now), which was not at that time a constituted genre. Indeed, it has little in common with the sole model at the time, Guilleragues’s ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun|Lettres portugaises]]'' of 1669. A collection of "letters" in 1721 would more likely evoke the recent tradition of essentially polemical and political periodicals, such as ''Lettres historiques'' (1692–1728), the Jesuits’ famous ''Lettres édifiantes et curieuses'' (1703–1776), not to mention [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer|Mme Dunoyer’s]] ''Lettres historiques et galantes'' (1707–1717) which, in the form of a correspondence between two women, provide a chronicle of the end of the reign of Louis XIV and the beginning of the Regency. The ''Lettres persanes'' thus helped confirm the vogue of a format that was already established. But it is in its numerous imitations – such as ''Lettres juives'' (1738) and ''Lettres chinoises'' (1739) of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d’Argens]], ''Lettres d’une Turque à Paris, écrites à sa sœur'' (1730) by Poullain de Saint-Foix (published several times in conjunction with ''Lettres persanes''), and perhaps especially [[Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny|Françoise de Graffigny]]’s ''Lettres d’une Péruvienne'' (1747) – not to mention the letter-novels of [[Samuel Richardson|Richardson]] – which, between 1721 and 1754, had in effect transformed ''Lettres persanes'' into an "epistolary novel." Whence this remark in Montesquieu’s ''Mes Pensées'': "My ''Lettres persanes'' taught people to write letter-novels" (no. 1621).

The [[Epistolary novel|epistolary structure]] is quite flexible: nineteen correspondents in all, with at least twenty-two different recipients. Usbek and Rica by far dominate with sixty-six letters for the former and forty-seven for the latter (of the final 161). Ibben, who functions more as addressee than correspondent, writes only two letters but receives forty-two. Likewise, an unnamed person (designated only as ***) – if always the same – receives eighteen letters and writes none at all. There is even one complete anomaly, a letter from Hagi Ibbi to Ben Josué (Letter 37 [39]), neither of whom is mentioned elsewhere in the novel.

The letters are apparently all dated in accordance with a [[lunar calendar]] which, as [[Robert Shackleton]] showed in 1954, in fact corresponds to our own, by simple substitution of Muslim names, as follows: Zilcadé (January), Zilhagé (February), Maharram (March), Saphar (April), Rebiab I (May), Rebiab II (June), Gemmadi I (July), Gemmadi II (August), Rhegeb (September), Chahban (October), Rhamazan (November), Chalval (December).

==Social commentary==

In Paris, the Persians express themselves on a wide variety of subjects, from governmental institutions to salon caricatures. The difference of temperament of the two friends is notable, Usbek being more experienced and asking many questions, Rica less implicated and more free, and more attracted by Parisian life. Both retain Montesquieu's rich satirical tone, as in Rica's ''Lettre 72'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Je me trouvai l’autre jour dans une compagnie où je vis un homme bien content de lui. Dans un quart d’heure, il décida trois questions de morale, quatre problèmes historiques, et cinq points de physique : Je n’ai jamais vu un décisionnaire si universel ; son esprit ne fut jamais suspendu par le moindre doute. On laissa les sciences ; on parla des nouvelles du temps : il décida sur les nouvelles du temps. Je voulus l’attraper, et je dis en moi-même : Il faut que je me mette dans mon fort ; je vais me réfugier dans mon pays. Je lui parlai de la Perse ; mais, à peine lui eus-je dit quatre mots, qu’il me donna deux démentis, fondés sur l’autorité de messieurs Tavernier et Chardin. Ah ! bon Dieu ! dis-je en moi-même, quel homme est-ce là ? Il connoîtra tout à l’heure les rues d’Ispahan mieux que moi ! Mon parti fut bientôt pris : je me tus, je le laissai parler, et il décide encore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Lettres_persanes/Lettre_72 Lettre 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I found myself recently in a company where I met am man very well satisfied with himself. In a quarter of an hour, he decided three questions in morals, four historical problems, and five points in physics. I have never seen so universal a decider; his mind was not once troubled with the least doubt. We left science, and talked of the current news: he decided upon the current news. I wished to catch him, so I said to myself, “I must get to my strong point; I will betake me to my own country.” I spoke to him of Persia; but hardly had I opened my mouth, when he contradicted me twice, basing his objections upon the authority of Tavernier and Chardin. “Ah! Good heavens!” said I to myself, “what kind of man is this? He will know next all the streets in Ispahan better than I do!” I soon knew what part to play-to be silent, and let him talk; and he is still laying down the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Persian_Letters/Letter_72 Letter 72], trans. [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this takes place in the declining years of the aged king, much of what he has accomplished is still admired in a Paris where the Invalides is being completed and cafés and theatre proliferate. We observe the function of parliaments, tribunals, religious bodies ([[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Jesuits]], etc.), public places and their publics (the [[Tuileries]], the [[Palais Royal]]), state foundations (the hospital of the Quinze-Vingts [300] for the blind, the [[Les Invalides|Invalides]] for those wounded in war). They describe a thriving culture, where even the presence of two Persians quickly becomes a popular phenomenon, thanks to the proliferation of prints (letter 28 [30]). The café&amp;nbsp;– where debates take place (letter 34 [36])&amp;nbsp;– has become established as a public institution, as were already the theatre and opera. There are still people foolish enough to search at their own expense for the [[philosopher's stone]]; the newsmonger and the periodical press are beginning to play a role in everyday life. Everything from institutions (the [[University of Paris|university]], the [[Académie française|Academy]], Sciences, the Bull ''[[Unigenitus]]'') via groups (fashion, dandies, coquettes) to individuals (the opera singer, the old warrior, the rake, and so forth) comes to the eye of the reader.

Usbek for his part is troubled by religious contrasts. Though it never occurs to him to cease being a [[Muslim]], and while he still wonders at some aspects of Christianity (the [[Trinity]], [[Communion rite|communion]]), he writes to austere authorities to inquire, for example, why some foods are considered to be unclean (letters 15–17 [16–18]). He also assimilates the two religions and even all religions with respect to their social utility.

Certain sequences of letters by a single author develop more fully a particular subject, such as letters 11–14 from Usbek to Mirza on the Troglodytes, letters 109–118 (113–122) from Usbek to Rhedi on [[demography]], letters 128–132 (134–138) from Rica on his visit to the library at Saint-Victor. They sketch analyses that will later be developed in [[The Spirit of the Laws|''L’Esprit des lois'']] for many subjects such as the types of powers, the influence of climate and the critique of colonization.

==The dénouement==

While Usbek appreciates the freer relations among men and women in the West, he remains, as master of a seraglio, a prisoner of his past. His wives play the role of languorous and lonely lovers, he the role of master and lover, with no true communication and without revealing much about their true selves. Usbek’s language with them is as constrained as theirs with him. Knowing, moreover, from the outset that he is not assured of a return to Persia, Usbek is also already disabused about their attitude (letters 6 and 19 [20]). The seraglio is a hothouse from which he increasingly distances himself, trusting his wives no more than his eunuchs (Letter 6).

Everything cascades in the final letters (139–150 [147–161]), thanks to a sudden analepse of more than three years with respect to the preceding letters. From letter 69 (71) to letter 139 (147) – chronologically from 1714 to 1720 – not a single letter from Usbek relates to the seraglio, which is unmentioned in any guise from letter 94 to 143 (and even in the edition of 1758 from supplementary letter 8 (97) to 145. Moreover, all the letters from 126 (132) to 137 (148) are from Rica, which means that for about fifteen months (from 4 August 1719 to 22 October 1720) Usbek is completely silent. Although he has in the meantime received letters, the reader does not learn of them until the final series, which is more developed after the addition of supplementary letters 9–11 (157, 158, 160) of 1758. Although Usbek has learned as early as October 1714 that "the seraglio is in disorder" (letter 63 [65]). As the spirit of rebellion advances, he decides to act, but too late; with delays in the transmission of letters and the loss of some, the situation is beyond remedy.

A dejected Usbek is apparently resigned to the necessity of returning, with little hope, to Persia; on 4 October 1719 he laments: "I shall deliver my head to my enemies" (147 [155]). He nevertheless does not do so: late in 1720 he is still in Paris, for letters 134–137 (140–145), which contain the whole history of Law’s "System," are in fact posterior to Roxane’s last missive (dated 8 May 1720), which he must already have received – the usual time for delivery being about five months – when he writes the latest in date of his own (supplementary letter 8 and letter 138 [145 and 146]), in October and November 1720.

==Sources==

Montesquieu’s "sources" are legion, since they doubtless extend to readings and conversations which are modified en route. The impact of [[Jean Chardin]]’s ''Voyages en Perse'', to which he owes most of his information about Persia – which is far from superficial – must of course be recognized; he owned the two-volume edition of 1687 and purchased the extended edition in ten volumes in 1720. To a lesser degree, he drew on the ''Voyages'' of [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] and [[Paul Rycaut]], not to mention many other works which his vast library afforded him. Everything having to do with contemporary France or Paris, on the other hand, comes from his own experience, and from conversations of anecdotes related to him.

Various aspects of the book are doubtless indebted to particular models, of which the most important is Giovanni Paolo Marana’s ''L’Espion dans les cours des princes chrétiens'' (''[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]''), widely known at the time, even though Montesquieu’s characters obviously are Persians and not Turks. While the great popularity of [[Antoine Galland]]’s ''Mille et Une Nuits'' (''[[The Arabian Nights]]'') contributes, as do the Bible and the Qu’ran, to the general ambiance of oriental subjects, in fact it has almost nothing in common with the ''Lettres persanes''.

==Critical history==

The ''Lettres persanes'' was an immediate success and often imitated, but it has been diversely interpreted over time. Until the middle of the twentieth century, it was its "spirit" of the Regency which was largely admired, as well as the caricature in the classical tradition of [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]. No one had the notion of attaching it to the novelistic genre. The Persian side of the novel tended to be considered as a fanciful decor, the true interest of the work lying in its factitious "oriental" impressions of French society, along with political and religious satire and critique.

In the 1950s began a new era of studies based on better texts and renewed perspectives. Particularly important were the extensively annotated edition by Paul Vernière and the research of [[Robert Shackleton]] on Muslim chronology; also studies by Roger Laufer, Pauline Kra and Roger Mercier, which put new focus on the work’s unity and integrated the seraglio into its overall meaning. Others who have followed have looked into the ramifications of epistolary form, the structure and meaning of the seraglio, Usbek’s contradictions. Beginning about 1970 it is religion (Kra) and especially politics (Ehrard, Goulemot, Benrekassa) which predominate in studies on ''Lettres persanes'', with a progressive return to the role of the seraglio with all its women and eunuchs (Delon, Grosrichard, Singerman, Spector) or the cultural cleavage of Orient and Occident.

The American philosopher [[Marshall Berman]] devotes several chapters in his book ''The Politics of Authenticity'' (1970) to the radical humanism of the Persian Letters.

===The Jewish Letters===
{{main article|Jewish Letters}}
The Jewish Letters of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d'Argens]] were published in 1738, composed in a total of 180 letters that originally spanned 30 volumes. Although they are certainly an imitation of the Persian Letters, they are not considered plagiarism due to the distinction of content between the two works. Although he titled himself as the work's "translator", he is most ascribed as the work's author.

'''''Postsingular''''' is a 2007 science-fiction novel written by the American writer [[Rudy Rucker]]. It focuses upon a cast of San Franciscans and their relationship with emerging uses of [[nanotechnology]]. It was the first of his works to be licensed under a [[Creative Commons license]] and released to the public on the Internet.

A sequel, ''Hylozoic'', was released in 2009, but was not released under a free license.

==Summary==
{{plot|date=October 2017}}
The novel is divided into four parts. Most of the events in the story take place in a future version of [[San Francisco]].

===Part 1===
The first part begins on a New Year's Day, in which a young, 17-year-old Jeff Luty and his friend Carlos Tucay are about to light bottle rockets on [[Stinson Beach, California|Stinson Beach]]. The two boys, who are interested in the young but growing nanotechnology industry, dream about establishing Lu-Tuc Space Tech, and have inserted nanorobots into the rockets. After a passing dog had urinated on the rocket, the rockets are lit again. However, the rocket eventually misfires, and a [[launch lug]] is sent flying into Carlos' right eye, killing him.

The first part fast forwards several years later, in which Jeff is the CEO of Nantel, the leading nanotechnology company in the world. One of the leading employees of the company is engineer Ond Lutter, who works on a project to create "nants". However, when Jeff, who is still distraught over Carlos' death, comes to blows with Ond over the creation of a virtual earth with the nants. The US government buys the nants, and the president, Dick Dibbs, announces that the earth will be eaten by the nants and converted into a virtual version of the Earth, or "vEarth". Ond and his family, however, do not agree. Ond builds an antenna to resist the advance of the nants until the house is the last of the holdouts to persist on physical earth. Ond's 9-year-old son Chu, however, is an [[autistic savant]] and is able to jump into the wall of nants that has grown in the Lutter house, Chu immediately jumps back out and the nants begin to retreat. By the next day, the nants have mostly reversed all their advances until they return to the moon and are shot out of existence by a Chinese satellite.

After the reversal and destruction of the nants, Dibbs is arrested by the government and executed for his role in the "vEarth" conspiracy (classified as "treason"). Luty is now a wanted fugitive and goes into hiding; Lutter, who is rehired Nantel, now renamed as ExaExa Labs, however, is inspired by nanorobotics to create a new type of nanorobot, which becomes known as the "orphids". When he tells a gathering of his and Craigor's families in San Francisco Bay, however, Nektar becomes angry against Ond and argues against Ond over the nants, for fear of a repeat of the events. Ond seizes the jar and smashes the glass open, releasing the orphids to rapidly self-replicate. Within hours, the orphids, which are heavily connected to the Internet, spread to most of the West Coast, and Ond is wanted by the [[San Francisco Police Department]]. The orphids also provide displays for [[augmented reality]], ridding society of the need for AR contact lenses (or "webeyes"), throat microphones and other AR utilities.

The city has a hard time adapting to the orphids and the sensorally immersive version of the Internet, or "orphidnet", presented by the orphids. The advanced properties of the orphidnet allow for opportunities not possible with prior computing technologies, such as advanced [[teleconferencing]], [[telepathy]] remote sex between physically separated partners. However, this leaves little room for [[privacy]], as the orphids barely allow for any living thing to be non-connected to the orphidnet, meaning that Ond is the subject of a mob which seeks to lynch him for "Orphid Night".

Nektar separates from Ond and becomes intimate with a cook at a nearby restaurant, leaving Ond to take care of Chu; furthermore, Ond and Chu discover the existence of a higher-intelligence dimension which somewhat mirrors earth. One of the rulers of the so-called "Hibrane" version of San Francisco, Gladax, tries to remove the means of "Lobrane" access to the Hibrane in order to keep Lobraners out, going so far as to penetrate Chu's mind. The pursuit of Ond and Chu by both Gladax and the anti-nant/orphid mob ultimately send the two teleporting from the Merz Boat to the Hibrane version of San Francisco, where everything is slower and larger.

===Part 2===
Years later, San Francisco has become reliant upon the orphidnet, and the story focuses upon a group of teenage residents, known as "kiqqies", who are homeless but depend upon [[dumpster-diving]] and a particular portion of the orphidnet known as "the Big Pig". The Pig is seen as an addiction to those whose minds are clear, as it allows for its partakers to rapidly glean information for so long as one is accessing it.

Jayjay, Thuy, Sonic and Kitty eventually meet Nektar, who has become head chef at a popular restaurant and the lead personality of a reality series, ''Founders'', which is broadcast to viewers over the orphidnet. Nektar was being psychologically tortured and blackmailed by orphidnet "beetles" for criticizing presidential candidate Dick Too Dibbs (and refusing to run Dibbs' ads), the cousin of the disgraced former president, and the four visit her home to clear the beetles. After eating with the other cast members - Craigor and Jil - and leaving Nektar's home, the kiqqies happen upon the body of a former high-scoring quantum gamer who became addicted to the Big Pig and starved to death, motivating the kiqqies to visit the Natural Mind center to calm their minds away from the Big Pig.

The four visit the Natural Mind offices in the [[San Francisco Armory]] and are invited to visit the office of the center's director, Andrew Topping, who offers to hire Sonic and Thuy for their skills (Sonic is a quantum gamer, and Thuy writes "metanovels"). When the four suspect Topping's relationship with Jeff Luty and reject the offer, Topping seizes Thuy and attempts to throw her into the grating. The four fight Topping, and when Sonic wrestles Topping for Topping's gun, JayJay rushes Topping, pushing Topping and (accidentally) Sonic bloodlessly through the grating. The remaining three - Thuy, JayJay and Kittie, run from the Natural Mind building.

===Part 3===
Two months after the Natural Mind incident, Thuy is recovering from her addiction to the Big Pig and focuses more on developing her semi-autobiographical metanovel, ''Wheenk''. When she begins to present a portion of her metanovel for a small audience, the event is disrupted by an attack shoon. Thuy runs out across the street and is rescued by JayJay, who demonstrates his recent mastering of teleportation through the orphidnet to bring them to the ''Merz Boat'' of Jil and Craigor. Due to Craigor's chronic infidelity, Jil has become addicted to sudocoke and has an erratic behavior. When the boat is attacked by attack shoons which are suspected of originating from Jeff Luty, the four defend the boat, only to find out from one of the shoons how Sonic had been blackmailed by Luty to create attack shoons for Luty's use against his enemies, including Thuy. Teleporting from the boat, JayJay and Thuy stop at Nektar's house before being chased by another attack shoon.

The two teleport to [[Easter Island]], where they rest, gather weapons and gain information from Azaroth and other Hibraners. The two also find out about a massacre organized by Luty at his ExaExa compound to stall law enforcement, his plan to re-release the nants into the world for a Vearth 2.0, and the Big Pig's intentions toward the nants. The two teleport back to the Merz Boat to pick up Craigor and Jil, but not before curing Jil of nanomachines which were laced inside the sudocoke that she snorted up. The four teleport to the ExaExa compound in the middle of a gunfight, fighting armed guards and rescuing Sonic before Sonic, Thuy and Jil are captured by Luty's agents, including Topping. Luty asserts his plans to release the nants from his "ark" but unsuccessfully demands that Thuy contact Ond, who is still in the Hibrane. Before Topping makes good on Luty's threat to kill Sonic before her eyes, Gladax appears and kills the agents. Sonic runs through the nearby grating and blows up much of the machinery with a grenade, presumptively killing himself in the process. Luty escapes through what is left of the grating. Before they teleport from the compound, Jil breaks up with Craigor and ends their marriage.

Now with the ark in tow, Thuy and JayJay return to Easter Island to think of a way to destroy the nants. However, the Big Pig returns demanding that the ark be opened. After torture, JayJay agrees to open the box, only to find it booby-trapped with nant goo which consumes much of his body before Thuy's eyes. The pain of seeing the incident results in Thuy finishing her metanovel and finding the means to teleport on her own to the Hibrane. However, the Big Pig assures Thuy that not only is her boyfriend not dead, but that Thuy could save him and potentially stop the destruction of Earth by the nants if she returns to the Lobrane with Ond and Chu by midnight. Desperate, Thuy teleports to the Hibrane.

===Part 4===
Thuy teleports, through a zone which has monsters known as "subbies", to the Hibrane's version of Easter Island. This dimension's world and its inhabitants, like Gladax and Azaroth, are gigantic and slow in movement compared to Lobrane inhabitants like Thuy. Gladax returns and tries to capture Thuy, but she escapes and, with Azaroth's remote help, teleports to Hibrane San Francisco. The two then run in disguise to Gladax's home, where Ond and Chu are imprisoned by Gladax in order to avert the potential nant invasion from the Lobrane to the Hibrane. Ond tells Thuy that if he can bring back to the Lobrane the ability of tagging infinite, semantic memory and telepathy to every object by unrolling the eighth dimension (embedded in a harp owned by Gladax), it would negate the need for nants to reconvert the Lobrane Earth to vEarth. The group set up a plan and proceed to action, in which Ond gives up Thuy to Gladax and the group teleports to Gladax's room where the harp is located. When Gladax leaves her in a net while stepping outside to berate her gardeners (with Azaroth distracting her), Thuy breaks free of the net, takes the harp and teleports with Ond and Chu. However, the group drops the harp in the waters of the Planck frontier (or "Subdee" in Hibraner lingo), and Thuy leaves the group to return to the Lobrane while she seeks to rescue the harp, only to end up captured by subbies. 

Meanwhile, Jayjay remains on Earth in a coma, being used by the Big Pig to run an entire simulated lifetime of 60 years in his head in six hours. In the simulated reality, Jayjay waits for Thuy to return, but the nants are released by the Big Pig and convert the Earth into Vearth, in which Jayjay becomes a physicist and learns many of the same concepts which have been learned in real life by Ond and Chu. Going through two marriages, Jayjay experiences the pressures of life in Vearth and the limitations of dependence upon computational resources. Jayjay experiences his death at the simulated age of eighty-six, waiting for Thuy. Meanwhile, Thuy fights her way out of the grasp of subbies who plan to eat her, and their leader is a beetle-like subbie possessing the skin of Luty, who was eaten by the subbies when he fell into the Subdee. She escapes with the harp, and returns to Jayjay on Lobrane Easter Island, only for the Big Pig to open the ark of the nants. The two teleport to Nektar's house in San Francisco, where Jayjay tries to play the "Lost Chord" which will unroll the eighth dimension while the nants amass and threaten to eat the world again. Thuy and Jayjay go into a room to have sex, and Jayjay rediscovers the Lost Chord from his experience in the simulation, and he plays it, unrolling the eighth dimension and ending the nant invasion. The unrolling results in the creation of new beings called "silps" which copy the data and knowledge from both nants and orphids and then destroying both. The silps constitute themselves as a planetary oversoul known as Gaia, and the Big Pig redesigns herself as an interface for Gaia. 

The main characters' lives change after the unrolling: Jil divorces Craigor and marries Ond, Nektar becomes romantically linked to Kittie, Chu manages to heal his autism, and Jayjay and Thuy become engaged.

==History==
Portions of the book were previously published in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' magazine and ''Year's Best SF 12'' in 2006.

==Reception==
The science fiction author and activist [[Cory Doctorow]] reviewed the book for ''[[Boing Boing]]'', summarizing it as "pure Rucker: a dope-addled exploration of the way-out fringes of string theory and the quantum universe that distorts the possible into the most improbable contortions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://boingboing.net/2007/10/01/rudy-ruckers-postsin.html|title = Rudy Rucker's Postsingular: Wheenk!|author = Cory Doctorow|publisher = |work=Boing Boing|date = October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rated it as "one of the most fun, strangest, most thought-provoking sf novels I've read, and it's fantastic to have it show up on the net, ready to be copied and shared." He praised the decision to release the material under a Creative Commons license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://boingboing.net/2007/11/02/ruckers-postsingular.html|title = Rucker's Postsingular is a free, CC download!|author = Cory Doctorow|publisher = |work=Boing Boing|date =November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Booklist]]'' stated that "While Rucker’s improbable scenarios sometimes cross the line into pure silliness, his devoted fans and dazzled newcomers to him will revel in his willingness to push technological extrapolation to its soaring limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kurzweilai.net/postsingular|title = Postsingular|work=www.kurzweilai.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;". ''io9's'' Charlie Jane Anders stated that it "actually pulls off the ambitious multilayered story it sets out to tell," but described the novel as being full of "bizarre idea-spikes" such as the hibrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://io9.com/361680/postsingular-is-rudy-ruckers-wildest-ride-yet|title = Postsingular Is Rudy Rucker’s Wildest Ride Yet|author = Charlie Jane Anders|publisher = |website=io9|date = February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RAT Parties''' were a series of large dance parties held in [[Sydney, Australia]] during the 1980s and early 1990s.  The Powerhouse Museum said that they "formed a key element of an emerging subculture"&lt;ref name=Powerhouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Recreational Arts Team (RAT) parties archive, 1984 - 1989| url=http://from.ph/319660  |author=[[Powerhouse Museum]] | publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Australia |accessdate=9 August 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RhZkcRAY|archivedate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was fashion-aware, gay-friendly, appreciated dance music and open, outrageous celebration. Along with the rise of the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]], the success of '''RAT Parties''' marked a groundswell of acceptance of Sydney's [[LGBT|gay &amp; lesbian community]].  RAT parties are credited with introducing the visual performance art of [[VJing]] to Australia.&lt;ref name="vjing"/&gt;

==RAT Team==
Forty '''Rat Parties''' were organised by the Recreational Arts Team between 1983 and 1992. The core of the team was Jac Vidgen, Billy Yip and Reno Dal. Jac Vidgen was a gregarious organiser who became the promoter and business leader. Billy Yip was a creative artist who created the themes and design concepts which characterized the parties, and his cleverly co-ordinated posters, fliers and ads became noticed around Sydney. Reno Dal was the team's original technical designer and producer involved from 1983 until 1986. Mark Taylor was the technical producer for the peak period 1986-1990, Wayne Gait-Smith was a technical designer. Tim and Mic Gruchy were the video designers from 1987-1992. As a young fashion student and a close friend of Vidgen, [[Akira Isogawa]] contributed to many of the lavish costumes that now survive in a well catalogued retrospective of the RAT era kept at Sydney's [[Powerhouse Museum]].&lt;ref name=Powerhouse/&gt;

Vidgen was working as a waiter, holding extravagant parties for his friends in houses he shared until Dal, who had supplied the lighting for one of those parties, suggested they cover the costs by charging people. Vidgen and his boyfriend Yip agreed, and they set about organizing the first RAT party.&lt;ref name=Olding_2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olding|first1=Rachel|title=Where the wild things were|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&amp;docID=SMH091128SR1VM7C15BJ |accessdate=8 August 2014 |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2009-11-28|ISSN=0312-6315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth of the concept==
Vidgen threw his first public party (entitled "RAT Rock Wreck") for 200-250 guests in inner-city Surry Hills on 2 October 1983.&lt;ref name=Maynard_2010&gt;{{cite podcast |last=Maynard |authorlink=Maynard (broadcaster) | url=http://www.maynard.com.au/maynards_malaise/80s-exhibition-powerhouse.html | title = 80s Exhibition Powerhouse | website = Planet Maynard | date = 20 February 2010 | time = 3:00 | accessdate = 9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent parties each had a special name, usually conceived by Billy Yip, incorporating the word 'rat' in its title. The next official RAT party, titled 'RATsurrect' and advertised through word-of-mouth, was held at the [[Bondi Pavilion]] on 22 April 1984. The early parties, particularly 'RATizm' at the [[Paddington Town Hall]] April 1985 attracted an inner-city party crowd of heterosexual bohemians as well as gay men and drag queens. RAT parties typically had audio-visual presentations, bizarre props, party drugs, innovative lighting, underground cabaret groups, the best DJs in town and unusual live performances. The later large Sydney Showground events would feature amusements and rides, break out/chill out areas and a selection of food and beverage alternatives.&lt;ref name=Olding_2009/&gt;

In 1987 Vidgen registered Recreational Arts Team Pty Ltd as a company.&lt;ref name=Portus_1987&gt;{{cite news|last1=Portus|first1=Martin|title=Rat-rapping|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1987-09-17|location=Metro|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events became larger, and were no longer exclusive eastern suburbs affairs where it was necessary to know the right people to obtain a ticket. The parties became famous for their spectacular entertainment and celebrity guests. Massive New Year's Eve parties were held for four consecutive years filing the [[Hordern Pavilion]] and Royal Hall of Industries at Sydney's Showground where up to 15,000 partygoers could be accommodated. 'A Ratty New Year', was the first held on New Year's Eve 1988 the event was broadcast live on JJJ and featured a 4am live performance by [[Grace Jones]]. Jones was due on stage much closer to midnight but refused to perform until Vidgen could provide a paper-trail of evidence that the performance fee had been transferred into her US account.&lt;ref name=Maynard_2010/&gt;{{rp|at=2:00}} New Year's Eve 1989 headlined [[Adeva]] at the same venue.

Magazines and newspapers regularly featured RAT Parties in their social pages - fashions worn by partygoers and performers were captured by a number of high-profile photographers, among them Robert Rosen, Tom Stack,John Webber, Sonny Vandevelde and most notably William Yang.&lt;ref name=Powerhouse/&gt; 
The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] summed up the events by saying "Parties became an art form in Sydney's Oxford street. Jack Vidgen's private house parties grew into the notorious RAT parties. Events that set the tone and style of Australian dance music culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Way to the Top, episode 6: Gathering of the Tribes 1984-2000|url=http://www.abc.net.au/longway/episode_6/|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=9 August 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RhaWIfCy|archivedate=9 August 2014|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media responses to the novelty of these events was mixed.  At one time the [[Sydney Morning Herald|Herald]] said that "RAT parties are a concept that has obviously worked",&lt;ref name=Stapleton_1988&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stapleton|first1=John|title=When rats come out to play|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=1988-03-31|location=Metro|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another article in the same newspaper described them as "resolutely and profoundly superficial" with "unapologetic selfishness ... and shabby glitter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malouf|first1=David|title=A 'learning' experience|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&amp;docID=news891227_0057_3531|accessdate=9 August 2014|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=Fairfax Media|date=1989-12-27|location=News and Features|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RAT events gradually became a part of mainstream Sydney culture; the parties were praised for their record of non-violence&lt;ref name=Stapleton_1988/&gt; and the RAT team was sponsored by the New South Wales Government to produce the "young people's event" for their 1987 Carnivale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevenson|first1=Lesley|title=RAT parties trap fun-lovers - and even shy mice|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=Fairfax Media|date=1987-09-16|location=Eastern Herald|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the party on New Year's Eve 1986, some RAT parties were brought under the organization umbrella of the [[Festival of Sydney]], produced in partnership with ABC Radio's [[Triple J|JJJ]], which broadcast the events live featuring well-known radio personalities including Andy Glittre and [[Maynard (broadcaster)|Maynard F# Crabbes]].&lt;ref name=Powerhouse/&gt;

Although the budgets had grown from $5,000 to $400,000, costs and expectations also skyrocketed. Business was risky, profits were slim, and money made on one party was frequently lost on the next one.

==DJs and copycats==
The RAT parties and Sydney Gay Mardi Gras Party and Sleazeball were forerunners of the dance parties and raves of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the early 1980s pub rock in Sydney was still the mainstream, and dance music was a relatively underground phenomenon, with venues such as Stranded and later Patchs in Sydney pioneering dance parties in established venues. Dance party enthusiasts left the pub scene behind, preferring recorded electronic music provided by pioneering DJs like Tim Ritchie, [[Robert Racic]], Stephen Allkins, Bill Morley, Pee Wee Ferris, Scott Pullen, Andy Glitre and [[Mark Alsop]].

Spearheaded by these DJs, dance music took off in Sydney during the 1980s. Promoters behind events by FUN, Sweatbox, Bacchanalia and the standard setting twice yearly public parties produced by the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]], booked inner city warehouses and tired old venues and transformed them into vibrant, packed palaces. By the end of the 1980s parties flourished all around the country, with promoters booking a constant flow of influential overseas DJs such as [[Paul Oakenfold]]. While established rock venues suffered from lack of attendance, dance parties were frequently sold out.

By the end of the 1980s it seemed that a massive dance party was being held every weekend at an accessible Sydney venue and competition was fierce.&lt;ref name=Olding_2009/&gt; The RAT team pulled back to focus their efforts on a single New Year's event each year that would be likely to generate a  return. But their profound impact on Sydney's bacchanalian awakening had already been made.&lt;ref name=Portus_1987/&gt;

==Cultural impact and legacy==
The RAT parties altered Sydney's night life, starting a craze for giant dance parties that lasted into the 1990s. They provided a diverse range of entertainment based on visual and aural stimulation, provided a creative outlet for talented people and set the tone and style of Australian dance music culture. RAT parties are credited with introducing the visual performance art of [[VJing]] to Australia.&lt;ref name="vjing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tomas|first1=Juan-Carlo|title=Mix masters|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=2002-11-23|location=Computers|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Powerhouse Museum|Sydney Powerhouse Museum]] hosted an exhibition to "revive memories of Sydney's notorious RAT parties".&lt;ref name=Olding_2009/&gt; Vidgen donated many of the articles on display there,&lt;ref name=Maynard_2010/&gt; and he described in an interview how the creative freedom and interactions from the RAT days built the careers of a number of people in various creative fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Short interview with Jac Vidgen by The Powerhouse Museum 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SznGgF2Rkc4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=280|caption=An example of rehearsal letters}}A '''rehearsal letter''' is a boldface letter of the [[alphabet]] in an [[orchestra]]l [[Sheet music|score]], and its corresponding parts, that provides the [[conducting|conductor]], who typically leads rehearsals, with a convenient spot to begin at places other than the start of movements or pieces. Rehearsal letters are most often used in scores of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] and onwards, beginning with [[Louis Spohr]]. 

==Terminology==
They may also be generically called '''rehearsal marks'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usermanuals.finalemusic.com/FinaleMac/Content/Finale/Rehearsal_letters.htm|title=Rehearsal marks|website=usermanuals.finalemusic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://musescore.org/en/handbook/rehearsal-marks|title=Rehearsal marks {{!}} MuseScore|website=musescore.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''rehearsal figures''',&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar&lt;/ref&gt; or, when numbers are used instead of letters, '''rehearsal numbers'''.

== Purpose ==

In the course of rehearsing a symphony or piece, it is often necessary for the conductor to stop and go back to some point in the middle, in order to master the more difficult passages or sections, or to resolve a challenge that the ensemble is having. Many scores and parts have [[bar (music)|bar]] numbers, every five or ten bars, or at the beginning of each page or line. But as pieces and individual movements of works became longer (extending to several hundred bars) as the Romantic era progressed, bar numbers became less practical in rehearsal.

[[Image:RehLetterXamp_fromFullScore.png|300px|thumb|right|From a page in the full score of [[Christoph Graupner]]'s Symphony in D major, Nagel 75. If the conductor wants to resume rehearsal from the second measure shown here, he could either say "measure 21" or "letter A".]]

For example, a conductor can tell their musicians to resume at bar 387, so that the musicians have to find the nearest bar number in their parts (e.g. 385 or 390) and count back or forward a couple of measures. Even if the number 387 is written at the appropriate bar, it might not particularly stand out. But if there is, for example, a big, bold letter M in the score and parts, it is much easier for the conductor to just say "begin at letter M". Even if the conductor were to say "one bar before letter M", that would still be more convenient than saying "bar 386". Alternatively the conductor could first say "before M..." and allow the players time to find M and then say "one bar".&lt;ref&gt;J. V. Horn ''The Community Orchestra'' Greenwood Press, 1979 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In the score of a full orchestra, rehearsal letters are typically placed over the [[flute]]s' (or [[piccolo]]'s) staff, and duplicated above the first [[violin]]s' staff. For concert bands, rehearsal letters are placed over the piccolo's staff (or flutes'), and over the [[trumpet]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Nicholl &amp; Richard Grudzinski, ''Music Notation: Preparing Scores and Parts'', ed. Jonathan Feist. Boston: Berklee Press (2007): 46. "Rehearsal marks appear above the top staff in most scores. In large scores, rehearsal marks can also appear in a second place, usually in the middle of the system or above each choir."&lt;/ref&gt; Rehearsal letters should appear in every part, but the conductor or librarian should check this and also make sure that they agree with the conductor's score; if they do not, the letters from the parts should be copied to the conductor's score.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, 1979, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; For typical pieces or movements of the Romantic era marked [[allegro (music)|allegro]], the letters A to Z can be used up, though the letters I, J or O (or all) may be skipped.

Placement and frequency of the letters do not follow a hard-and-fast rule. Generally they are inserted at places where there is a musically significant change, for example a new theme, or a change in dynamic or instrumentation or the start of a new section – just those places where a conductor might want to restart in rehearsal. In addition, having the letters coincide with musical signposts can help players who are counting rests confirm they are still in the right place, which would not be possible if the marks were placed at numerically regular intervals.

The letter A is almost always used for a point close to the beginning, but not for the very beginning itself because it is much easier to say "from the beginning". Likewise, rehearsal letters are not necessary at changes in [[tempo]], [[key signature]] or [[time signature]], as the name of the new tempo or signature can serve the same purpose. For example, in some editions of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], letter A of the Finale does not occur until bar 140, when the relatively late entry of the first violins with the "[[Ode to Joy]]" theme might not stand out enough to the other players to be a convenient point of reference, whereas the reminiscences of the previous movements' themes are more easily referenced by their tempo markings.

[[Image:RehLetterXamp_fromBassoonPart.png|700px|thumb|center|From the bassoon part of [[Christoph Graupner]]'s Symphony in D major, Nagel 75. If the conductor says to resume playing from measure 21, the bassoonist has to count from measure 18, or count backwards from measure 23. But if the conductor says to resume from letter A, the bassoonist needs only find the letter A in his or her part.]]

A rehearsal letter usually breaks a [[multimeasure rest]] in a part (except in cases where a given instrument does not play at all in a given movement of the work). Because rehearsal letters are sometimes independent of edition and in some cases even version, they are also useful for telling applicants for positions in the orchestra what passages they need to play at the [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]. They are also useful for easy reference in scholarly essays about orchestral works. However, rehearsal letters are altogether absent from some editions of some pieces that have them in other editions, such as the older editions of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Meistersinger]]'' prelude.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehearsal letters are less useful in unaccompanied instrumental music such as the solo [[piano]] repertoire (although they may be used in duets), since the instrumentalist has no need to communicate to a fellow player where to resume playing. Songs also tend not to use them, because it is more useful to refer to the [[lyrics]] (except in pieces where the lyrics are highly repetitive, or those with long lyric-less sections).

== Usage in the late 19th century to 21st century ==

In some cases, A to Z might not be enough. After Z, Aa may be used, followed by Bb, and so on until Zz (though Ii, Jj and/or Oo might also be skipped). The Wilhelm Hansen edition of [[Jean Sibelius]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Symphony No. 7 in C major]] presents one unusual case: the letters A to Z (including both I and J) are used up with just three more pages left in the score. For the final flute and bassoon solo, the editors use [[Ö]] (the final letter of the [[Finnish alphabet]]) as a rehearsal letter.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{Image frame|content=&lt;score&gt;  \relative c'' {

}
&lt;/score&gt;|width=280|caption=Boxed rehearsal numbers}}But in the case of some composers, such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], twice through the alphabet might still not be enough. For this reason, some editors prefer rehearsal numbers to rehearsal letters. Mahler's and Shostakovich's scores use rehearsal numbers rather than letters. These are typically in [[boldface]] and enclosed in a box, or less commonly, a circle. Confusingly, however, some editions enclose bar numbers in boxes, though usually not in bold. In the Schirmer edition of [[Roy Harris]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Harris)|Symphony No. 3]] (in one movement), the rehearsal numbers are enclosed in circles, and they occur every ten measures, actually being the bar number divided by 10. That rehearsal numbers "are easily confused with measure numbers" is a reason sometimes given in favor of rehearsal letters.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Stone. ''Music Notation in the Twentieth Century: A Practical Guidebook'' (New York &amp; London, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1980), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of rehearsal numbers counter that even 26 letters are not enough for some scores. Whereas rehearsal letters reset to A for each movement of a multi-movement work (even for connected movements), rehearsal numbers typically run over the course of the entire work, even if the movements are not connected. For example, the rehearsal number for the last few bars of the first movement of [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|First Symphony]] is 55; the first rehearsal number of the second movement is 56. There are exceptions, however. The final outburst in the first movement of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Second Symphony]] is rehearsal number 27. Mahler actually wanted a pause of five minutes before the next movement, so the rehearsal numbers reset to 1, ending with 15. The third movement follows after a short break, but its first rehearsal number is 28.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Gustav. ''Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2 in Full Score'', Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-25473-9}} (1987) pp. 224-225, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Jazz and pop===
For jazz and pop compositions with several choruses, "many jazz composers and arrangers" use a format in which "each successive verse/chorus part of the form is assigned successive letters of the alphabet" combined with a measure number: for example, letter A for the first 8-bar phrase of the verse after the introduction, A9 for the next 8-bar phrase, A17, A25, then B, B9, B17, B25 for the chorus, etc., with the special rehearsal marking TAG for the [[tag ending]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholl &amp; Grudzinski (2007): 45&lt;/ref&gt; In jazz and pop music, the musicians frequently refer to the "A section" or the "B section" of a [[32 bar song]] during rehearsals. In pop music, the music is commonly organized into standard sections, such as an [[introduction (music)|intro]], multiple [[verse (popular music)|verse]]s and [[chorus (song)|chorus]]es (refrain), one or more [[bridge (music)|bridge]]s, a [[guitar solo]] (or other instrumental solos), and an [[outro (music)|outro]]s. As such, a [[bandleader]] who wishes to start in the middle of a song will typically specify which part of this structure the band should start on (e.g., "last four bars of the bridge, going into the guitar solo" or "last verse and go to the outro").

{{Renaissance}}

'''Renaissance humanism''' is the study of [[classical antiquity]], at first [[Italian Renaissance|in Italy]] and then spreading across [[Western Europe]] in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. The term ''humanism'' is contemporary to that period, while ''Renaissance humanism'' is a [[retronym]] used to distinguish it from later [[humanist]] developments.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''la rinascita'' (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Vite de' più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani]]'' (The Lives of the Artists, 1550, revised 1568) [[Erwin Panofsky|Panofsky, Erwin]]. ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', New York: Harper and Row, 1960.
"The term ''umanista'' was used in fifteenth-century Italian academic slang to describe a teacher or student of classical literature and the arts associated with it, including that of rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them" Nicholas Mann "The Origins of Humanism", ''Cambridge Companion to Humanism'', Jill Kraye, editor [Cambridge University Press, 1996], p. 1–2).  The term "[[Middle Ages]]" for the preceding period separating classical antiquity from its "rebirth" first appears in Latin in 1469 as ''media tempestas''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaissance humanism was a response to the [[utilitarian]] approach and what came to be depicted as the "narrow pedantry" associated with medieval [[scholasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Humanists sought to create a [[Citizenry]] able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging in the [[Civic engagement|civic life]] of their communities and persuading others to [[virtue|virtuous]] and [[prudence|prudent]] actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[history]], [[poetry]], and [[moral philosophy]].

According to one scholar of the movement,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, [[Greek language|Greek]], and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965), p. 178. See also Kristeller's ''Renaissance Thought I'', "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion 17'' (1944–45), pp. 346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a small elite, a program to revive the cultural legacy, literary legacy, and moral philosophy of classical antiquity. There were important centres of humanism in [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Genoa]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].

==Origin==
Some of the first humanists were great collectors of antique [[manuscript]]s, including [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Coluccio Salutati]], and [[Poggio Bracciolini]]. Of the four, Petrarch was dubbed the "Father of Humanism" because of his devotion or loyalty to Greek and Roman scrolls. Many worked for the [[Catholic Church]] and were in [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|holy orders]], like Petrarch, while others were [[lawyer]]s and [[chancellor]]s of Italian cities, and thus had access to book copying workshops, such as Petrarch's disciple [[Salutati]], the [[Chancellor of Florence]].

In Italy, the humanist educational program won rapid acceptance and, by the mid-15th century, many of the [[upper class]]es had received humanist educations, possibly in addition to traditional [[Scholasticism|scholasticist]] ones. Some of the highest officials of the Catholic Church were humanists with the resources to amass important libraries. Such was [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Basilios Bessarion]], a [[Religious conversion|convert]] to the Catholic Church from [[Greek Orthodoxy]], who was considered for the [[papacy]], and was one of the most learned scholars of his time. There were several 15th-century and early 16th-century humanist Popes&lt;ref&gt;They include [[Innocent VII]], [[Nicholas V]], [[Pius II]], [[Sixtus IV]], [[Alexander VI]], [[Julius II]] and [[Leo X]]. Innocent VII, patron of Leonardo Bruni, is considered the first humanist Pope. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=BLgfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=renaissance+Humanist+popes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lPjAS6DqFYO8lQeqj-ndBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=renaissance%20Humanist%20popes&amp;f=false  James Hankins, ''Plato in the Italian Renaissance'' (New York: Columbia Studies in the Classical Tradition, 1990), p. 49]; for the others, see their respective entries in Sir John Hale's ''Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; one of whom, [[Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini]] (Pope Pius II), was a prolific author and wrote a treatise on ''The Education of Boys''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', (2001) pp. 126–259. This volume (pp. 92–125) contains an essay by [[Leonardo Bruni]], entitled "The Study of Literature", on the education of girls.&lt;/ref&gt; These subjects came to be known as the humanities, and the movement which they inspired is shown as humanism.

The migration waves of [[Byzantine]] Greek scholars and émigrés in the period following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacking of Constantinople]] and the [[fall of Constantinople|end of the Byzantine Empire]] in 1453 greatly assisted the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] literature and science via their greater familiarity with ancient languages and works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/late/laterbyz/harris-ren.html Byzantines in Renaissance Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/polyglots/greeks-in-italy.html Greeks in Italy]&lt;/ref&gt; They included [[Gemistus Pletho]], [[George of Trebizond]], [[Theodorus Gaza]], and [[John Argyropoulos]].

Italian humanism spread northward to [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Low Countries]], and [[England]] with the adoption of large-scale printing after the end of the era of [[Incunable|incunabula]] (or books printed prior to 1501), and it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In France, pre-eminent humanist [[Guillaume Budé]] (1467–1540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian humanism to the study of antique [[coin]]age and to [[legal history]], composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Budé was a [[Absolute monarchy|royal absolutist]] (and not a [[republicanism|republican]] like the early Italian ''umanisti'') who was active in civic life, serving as a [[diplomat]] for [[François I]] and helping to found the [[Collège de France|Collège des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Collège de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of François I, was a [[poet]], [[novelist]], and [[religious mystic]]&lt;ref&gt;She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry. See also "Marguerite de Navarre: Religious Reformist" in Jonathan A. Reid, [http://www.brill.nl/print.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=18212   ''King's sister--queen of dissent: Marguerite of Navarre (1492-1549) and her evangelical network''] {{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (''Studies in medieval and Reformation traditions, 1573-4188''; v. 139).

==Paganism and Christianity in the Renaissance==
{{Long section|date=July 2018}}
Many humanists were churchmen, most notably Pope [[Pius II]] (Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini), [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Klemens|last=Löffler|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia|volume=VII|pages=538–542|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|year=1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See note two, above.&lt;/ref&gt; and there was often patronage of humanists by senior church figures.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 477&lt;/ref&gt;  Much humanist effort went into improving the understanding and translations of Biblical and early Christian texts, both before and after the [[Protestant Reformation]], which was greatly influenced by the work of non-Italian, Northern European figures such as [[Desiderius Erasmus]], [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], [[William Grocyn]], and Swedish Catholic Archbishop in exile [[Olaus Magnus]].

''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' describes the [[rationalism]] of ancient writings as having tremendous impact on [[Renaissance]] scholars:

{{quote|Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity—with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities—was the center of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full stature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]], Second Edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}} p.397 quotation: {{quotation|The unashamedly humanistic flavor of classical writings had a tremendous impact on Renaissance scholar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rediscovery of classical philosophy and science would eventually challenge traditional religious beliefs. In 1417, for example, [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio Bracciolini]] discovered the manuscript of [[Lucretius]], ''[[De rerum natura]]'', which had been lost for centuries and which contained an explanation of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean doctrine]], though at the time this was not commented on much by Renaissance scholars, who confined themselves to remarks about Lucretius's grammar and [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;Only in 1564 did French commentator Denys Lambin (1519–72) announce in the preface to the work that "he regarded Lucretius's Epicurean ideas as 'fanciful, absurd, and opposed to Christianity". Lambin's preface remained standard until the nineteenth century. (See Jill Kraye's essay, "Philologists and Philosophers" in the ''Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism'' [1996], p. 153.) Epicurus's unacceptable doctrine that pleasure was the highest good "ensured the unpopularity of his philosophy" (Kraye [1996] p. 154.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorenzo Valla]], however, puts a defense of epicureanism in the mouth of one of the interlocutors of one of his dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Trinkhaus regards Valla's "epicureanism" as a ploy, not seriously meant by Valla, but designed to refute Stoicism, which he regarded together with epicureanism as equally inferior to Christianity. See Trinkaus, ''In Our Image and Likeness'' Vol. 1 (University of Chicago Press, 1970), pp. 103–170&lt;/ref&gt; Valla's defense, or adaptation, of Epicureanism was later taken up  in ''The [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]]'' by [[Erasmus]], the "Prince of humanists:"

{{quote|If people who live agreeably are [[Epicureans]], none are more truly [[Epicurean]] than the righteous and godly.  And if it is names that bother us, no one better deserves the name of Epicurean than the revered founder and head of the [[Christian]] philosophy [[Christ]], for in Greek ''epikouros'' means "helper."  He alone, when the [[law of Nature]] was all but blotted out by sins, when the [[law of Moses]] incited to lists rather than cured them, when [[Satan]] ruled in the world unchallenged, brought timely aid to perishing humanity.  Completely mistaken, therefore, are those who talk in their foolish fashion about Christ's having been sad and gloomy in character and calling upon us to follow a dismal mode of life.  On the contrary, he alone shows the most enjoyable life of all and the one most full of true pleasure.&lt;ref name="Lepage2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=John L. Lepage|title=The Revival of Antique Philosophy in the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb2uw2LQjPQC&amp;pg=PA111|date=5 December 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-28181-4|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage exemplifies the way in which the humanists saw [[pagan]] [[Ancient Greek literature|classical works]], such as the philosophy of [[Epicurus]], as being in harmony with their interpretation of [[Christianity]].

[[Renaissance Neo-Platonism|Renaissance Neo-Platonists]] such as [[Marsilio Ficino]] (whose translations of Plato's works into Latin were still used into the 19th century) attempted to reconcile [[Platonism]] with Christianity, according to the suggestions of early [[Church fathers]] [[Lactantius]] and [[Saint Augustine]]. In this spirit, [[Pico della Mirandola]] attempted to construct a [[syncretism]] of all religions (he was not a humanist{{clarify|date=November 2013}} but an Aristotelian trained in Paris), but his work did not win favor with the church authorities.

Historian Steven Kreis expresses a widespread view (derived from the 19th-century Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]]), when he writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The period from the fourteenth century to the seventeenth worked in favor of the general emancipation of the individual. The city-states of northern Italy had come into contact with the diverse customs of the East, and gradually permitted expression in matters of taste and dress. The writings of Dante, and particularly the doctrines of Petrarch and humanists like Machiavelli, emphasized the virtues of intellectual freedom and individual expression. In the essays of Montaigne the individualistic view of life received perhaps the most persuasive and eloquent statement in the history of literature and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreis|first=Steven|title=Renaissance Humanism|year=2008|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/humanism.html|accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Two noteworthy trends in Renaissance humanism were [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]] and [[Hermeticism]], which through the works of figures like [[Nicholas of Kues]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Cornelius Agrippa]], [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]] sometimes came close to constituting a new religion itself. Of these two, Hermeticism has had great continuing influence in Western thought, while the former mostly dissipated as an intellectual trend, leading to movements in [[Western esotericism]] such as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[New Age]] thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Plumb, 95&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Yates thesis" of [[Frances Yates]] holds that before falling out of favour, esoteric Renaissance thought introduced several concepts that were useful for the development of scientific method, though this remains a matter of controversy.

Though humanists continued to use their scholarship in the service of the church into the middle of the sixteenth century and beyond, the sharply confrontational religious atmosphere following the [[Protestant reformation]] resulted in the [[Counter-Reformation]] that sought to silence challenges to [[Catholic theology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library &amp; Renaissance Culture: Humanism|publisher=The Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/vatican/humanism.html|date=2002-07-01|accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; with similar efforts among the [[Protestant denominations]]. However, a number of humanists joined the Reformation movement and took over leadership functions, for example, [[Philipp Melanchthon]], [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]], and [[William Tyndale]].

With the [[Counter Reformation]] initiated by the [[Council of Trent]] (1545-1563), positions hardened and a strict Catholic orthodoxy based on [[Scholasticism|Scholastic philosophy]] was imposed. Some humanists, even moderate Catholics such as Erasmus, risked being declared heretics for their perceived criticism of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|pages=1733|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=0-9602572-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of the Renaissance [[John Rigby Hale|Sir John Hale]] cautions against too direct a linkage between Renaissance humanism and modern uses of the term humanism: "Renaissance humanism must be kept free from any hint of either "humanitarianism" or "humanism" in its modern sense of rational, non-religious approach to life ... the word "humanism" will mislead ... if it is seen in opposition to a Christianity its students in the main wished to supplement, not contradict, through their patient excavation of the sources of ancient God-inspired wisdom"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dJc3cOUVIYMC&amp;q=contradict#search_anchor Hale, 171.] See also Davies, 479-480 for similar caution.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Resident Evil 5''''', known in Japan as '''''Biohazard 5''''',{{efn|{{nihongo|''Biohazard 5''|バイオハザード5|Baiohazādo 5|lead=yes}}&lt;!-- [[WP:JFN]] --&gt;}} is a [[third-person shooter]] video game developed and published by [[Capcom]] and released in 2009.  It is the seventh major installment in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series, and was announced in 2005—the same year its predecessor ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' was released. ''Resident Evil 5'' was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] consoles in March 2009 and for [[Microsoft Windows]] in September that year. The plot involves an investigation of a terrorist threat by Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) agents [[Chris Redfield]] and [[Sheva Alomar]] in Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. Redfield soon learns that he must confront his past in the form of an old enemy, [[Albert Wesker]], and his former partner, [[Jill Valentine]].

The gameplay of ''Resident Evil 5'' is similar to that of the previous installment, though it is the first in the series designed for two-player [[co-operative gameplay|cooperative gameplay]]. It has also been considered to be the first game in the main series to depart from the [[survival horror]] genre, critics saying it bore more resemblance to an [[action game]]. [[Motion capture]] was used for the [[cutscene]]s, and it was the first video game to use a [[virtual camera system]]. Several staff members from the original ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' worked on ''Resident Evil 5''.

''Resident Evil 5'' received a positive reception, despite some criticism for its control scheme. The game received some complaints of [[racism]], though an investigation by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] found the complaints were unsubstantiated. ''Resident Evil 5'' was re-released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in June 2016. As of September 2018, the original release has sold over 7.4 million units, making it Capcom's best-selling game and the best-selling game of the ''Resident Evil'' franchise. An additional 4.6 million units have been sold between a special edition of the game and releases on other platforms, bringing the total sales to 12 million units. A sequel, ''[[Resident Evil 6]]'', was released in 2012.

==Plot==
Five years after the events of ''Resident Evil 4'',  [[Chris Redfield]], now a member of the fictional Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, is dispatched to Kijuju in Africa. He and his new partner [[Sheva Alomar]] are tasked with apprehending Ricardo Irving before he can sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. When they arrive, they discover that the locals have been infected by the parasites Las Plagas (those infected are called "Majini") and the BSAA Alpha Team have been killed. Redfield and Alomar are rescued by BSAA's Delta Team, which includes Alomar's mentor [[List of Resident Evil characters#Josh Stone|Josh Stone]]. In Stone's data Redfield sees a photograph of [[Jill Valentine]], his old partner, who has been presumed dead after a confrontation with [[Albert Wesker]]. Redfield, Alomar and Delta Team close in on Irving, but he escapes with the aid of a hooded figure. Irving leaves documents that lead Redfield and Alomar to marshy oilfields. This is where Irving's deal is to occur, but they discover that the documents are a diversion. When Redfield and Alomar try to regroup with Delta Team, they find the team slaughtered by a BOW; Alomar cannot find Stone among the dead. Determined to learn if Valentine is still alive, Redfield does not report to headquarters.&lt;ref name="plot1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Segers |first=Andre |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-5-walkthrough/1100-6205799/ |title=Resident Evil 5 Walkthrough |work=[[GameSpot]] |date=2009-04-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103114321/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-5-walkthrough/1100-6205799/ |archivedate=2014-01-03 |accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing through the marsh, they find Stone injured but safe and track down Irving's boat with his help. Irving injects himself with a variant of the Las Plagas parasite and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Redfield and Alomar defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by Umbrella, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Redfield and Alomar find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former [[List of Resident Evil characters#Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella Corporation]] underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Although Redfield finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Redfield and Alomar pursue Gionne but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a mind-controlled Valentine. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Redfield and Alomar fight Valentine, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she orders Redfield to follow Wesker.&lt;ref name="plot1"/&gt;

Redfield and Alomar board the tanker and encounter Gionne, who escapes after dropping a case of syringes; Alomar keeps several. When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s at Wesker, killing him.&lt;ref name="weskerdeath"&gt;{{cite web|title=S DCC 09: Resident Evil's Wesker gone for good |url=http://ign.com/articles/2009/07/23/sdcc-09-resident-evils-wesker-gone-for-good |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508150915/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/07/23/sdcc-09-resident-evils-wesker-gone-for-good |archivedate=8 May 2016 |deadurl=no |date=23 July 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2015 |first=Hilary |last=Goldstein |work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game's final cutscene, Redfield wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Alomar and Valentine, he decides to live in a world without fear.&lt;ref name="plot1"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Resi5gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=Still from the game with Chris Redfield (back to the player) and Sheva Alomar (facing the player)|The first player controls Chris Redfield, while a second player can control Sheva Alomar. Players are controlled from an over-the-shoulder perspective.]]
''Resident Evil 5'' is a [[third-person shooter]] with an over-the-shoulder perspective.&lt;ref name=gsr/&gt; Players can use several weapons including handguns, shotguns, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and grenade launchers, as well as [[melee]] attacks. Players can make quick 180-degree turns to evade enemies.&lt;ref name="X-Play Review"/&gt; The game involves [[Boss (video gaming)|boss battles]], many of which contain [[quick time event]]s.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt;

As in its predecessor ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', players can upgrade weapons with money and treasure collected in-game and heal themselves with herbs, but cannot run and shoot at the same time.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; New features include infected enemies with guns and grenades,&lt;ref name="X-Play Review"/&gt; the ability to upgrade weapons at any time from the inventory screen without having to find a merchant, and the equipping of weapons and items in real-time during gameplay.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Each player can store nine items. Unlike the previous games, the item size is irrelevant; a herb or a grenade launcher each occupy one space, and four items may be assigned to the [[D-pad]].&lt;ref name=gsr/&gt; The game also features fewer puzzles than previous titles.&lt;ref name=real/&gt;&lt;ref name=geyser/&gt;

''Resident Evil 5'' is the first game in the ''Resident Evil'' series designed for two-player [[co-operative gameplay|cooperative gameplay]].&lt;ref name=joystiq/&gt; The first player controls Redfield, a former member of the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and current member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Alomar, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Alomar is controlled by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Alomar the primary character.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt; Two-player mode is available online or [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split-screen game in progress will make the game reload the last [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play.&lt;ref name=gsr/&gt; In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows.&lt;ref name="X-Play Review"/&gt; If one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will die if their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players.&lt;ref name=gsr/&gt; The game's story-line is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cut-scenes.&lt;ref name=real/&gt;&lt;ref name=geyser/&gt;

A version of the ''Mercenaries'' [[minigame]] which debuted in ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'' is included in ''Resident Evil 5''.&lt;ref name="shack"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919192305/http://www.shacknews.com/article/52819/resident-evil-5-to-sport |archivedate=19 September 2015 |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/52819/resident-evil-5-to-sport |title=Resident Evil 5 to Sport 2P Co-op, Cover System |last1=Faylor |first1=Chris |last2=Breckon |first2=Nick |date=22 May 2008 |work=[[Shacknews]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This minigame places the player in an enclosed environment with a time limit.

==Development==
[[File:Jun Takeuchi 2010.jpg|thumb|Producer [[Jun Takeuchi]] (pictured in 2010) supervised the game's development|alt=A portrait shot of a middle-aged Asian man with short, messy black hair, glasses and a zip-up sweatshirt]]
''Resident Evil 5'' was developed by [[Capcom]] and produced by [[Jun Takeuchi]], who directed ''[[Onimusha: Warlords]]'' and produced ''[[Lost Planet: Extreme Condition]]''. [[Keiji Inafune]], promotional producer for ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and executive producer of the [[PlayStation 2]] version of ''Resident Evil 4'', supervised the project. Production began in 2005 and at its peak, over 100 people were working on the project.{{sfn|Nicholson|2009|page=4}} In February 2007, some members of Capcom's [[Clover Studio]] began working on ''Resident Evil 5'' while others were working on ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]'', which debuted for the [[Wii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/clover-vets-helping-on-resi-5-and-inafune-wii-title |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074044/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/clover-vets-helping-on-resi-5-and-inafune-wii-title |archivedate=4 March 2016 |deadurl=no |title=Clover vets helping on Resi 5 and Inafune Wii title |last1=Bramwell |first1=Tom |date=20 February 2007 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/02/7141/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061244/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/02/7141/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 |deadurl=no |title=Capcom reincorporates ex-Clover developers; victory assured |last1=Caron |first1=Frank |date=20 February 2007 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasuhiro Anpo, who worked as a programmer on the original ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'', directed  ''Resident Evil 5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/resident-evil-5-director-interview-cooperative-horror/ |title=‘Resident Evil 5’ director discusses how to mix scares with co-op |last=Gurwin |first=Gabe |date=1 June 2016 |work=[[Digital Trends]] |access-date=31 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170331231116/http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/resident-evil-5-director-interview-cooperative-horror/ |archivedate=31 March 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of several staff members who worked on the original game to be involved in ''Resident Evil 5''{{'s}} development.&lt;ref name="GSFAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/takeuchi-talks-resident-evil-5/1100-6130166/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116092909/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/takeuchi-talks-resident-evil-5/1100-6130166/ |archivedate=16 January 2015 |deadurl=no |title=Takeuchi talks Resident Evil 5 |date=2 August 2005 |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's scenario was written by Haruo Murata and Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, based on a story idea by concept director Kenichi Ueda.&lt;ref name="credits"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Biohazard 5 |developer=Capcom Co., Ltd. |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd. |date=5 March 2009 |platform=Xbox 360, PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takeuchi announced that the game would retain the gameplay model introduced in ''Resident Evil 4'', with "thematic tastes" from both ''Resident Evil 4'' and the original ''Resident Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3142140&amp;did=1 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717014422/http://www.1up.com/previews/resident-evil-5_11 |archivedate=17 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |title=Resident Evil 5 Xbox 360 Preview |last1=Lino |first1=Masa |date=20 July 2005 |work=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While previous Resident Evil games are mainly set at night, the events of Resident Evil 5 occur almost entirely during the day. The decision for this was a combination of the game being set in Africa and advances in hardware improvements which allowed increasingly detailed graphics.{{sfn|Nicholson|2009|page=193}} On the subject of changes to Valentine and Redfield's appearance, production director Yasuhiro Anpo explained that designers tried "to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over the passage of time". Their new designs retained the character's signature colors; green for Redfield and blue for Valentine. Alomar was redesigned several times during production, though all versions tried to emphasize a combination of "feminine attraction and the strength of a fighting woman".{{sfn|Nicholson|2009|page=195}} The Majini were designed to be more violent than the "Ganado" enemies in ''Resident Evil 4''.{{sfn|Nicholson|2009|page=197}}

The decision for cooperative gameplay was made part-way through development, for a new experience in a ''Resident Evil'' game.&lt;ref name=joystiq/&gt; Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued.&lt;ref name=oneup&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/resident-evil-5_6 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150815053727/http://www.1up.com/previews/resident-evil-5_6 |archivedate=15 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |title=Resident Evil 5 Developer Interview |last=Mielke |first=James |date=11 July 2008 |work=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to retain wide-screen proportions in two-player mode was made to avoid having the first player's screen directly on top of the second, which might be distracting, and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely.

'' Resident Evil 5'' received generally favourable reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCX360"/&gt; Reviewers praised the game's visuals and content.

While still giving favorable reviews of the game, several reviewers considered it to be a departure from the survival horror genre, a decision they lamented. Chris Hudak of [[Game Revolution]] considered the game to be a "full-on action blockbuster", and Brian Crecente said that about halfway through the game it "dropp[ed] all pretense of being a survival horror title and unmask[ed] itself as an action [[shooter game|shooter]] title".&lt;ref name=gamerev/&gt;&lt;ref name=crecente&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5168661/resident-evil-5-review-a-mutation-of-fun |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150216121224/http://kotaku.com/5168661/resident-evil-5-review-a-mutation-of-fun |archivedate=16 February 2015 |deadurl=no |title=Resident Evil 5 Review: A Mutation of Fun |last1=Crecente |first1=Brian |date=3 December 2009 |work=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kristan Reed of [[Eurogamer]] said the game "morphs what was a survival horror adventure into a survival horror shooter", and believed that this attempt to appeal to action gamers would upset some of the series' fans.&lt;ref name=Eurogamer/&gt;

Aspects of the game's control scheme were viewed negatively by critics. James Mielke of [[1UP.com]] criticized several inconsistencies in the game, such as only being able to take cover from enemy fire in very specific areas. Mielke also criticized its controls, saying that aiming was too slow and noting the inability to strafe away from (or quickly jump back from) enemies. Despite the problems he found it was "still a very fun game".&lt;ref name="1UP review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3173233 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717151110/http://www.1up.com/reviews/resident-evil-5 |archivedate=17 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |title=Resident Evil 5 Review |work=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |date=12 March 2008 |last=Mielke |first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kristan Reed also had criticism of some controls, such as the speed at which 180-degree turns were performed and difficulty accessing inventory.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/resident-evil-5-review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175359/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/resident-evil-5-review |archivedate=3 March 2016 |deadurl=no |title=Eurogamer Resident Evil 5 review |last=Reed |first=Kristan |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=9 March 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Juba said that the inability to move and shoot at the same time seemed more "like a cheap and artificial way to increase difficulty than a technique to enhance tension."&lt;ref name=GameInformer/&gt; While praising some aspects of the AI control of Alomar, Ryan Geddes thought that it also had its annoyances, such as its tendency to recklessly expend ammunition and health supplies.&lt;ref name="IGN Review"/&gt;

Reception of the downloadable content was favorable. Steven Hopper of ''GameZone'' rated the "Lost in Nightmares" DLC eight out of ten, saying that despite the episode's brevity it had high replay value and the addition of new multiplayer elements made it a "worthy investment for fans of the original game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227083406/http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r39892.htm |url=http://xbox360.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r39892.htm |title=Resident Evil 5: Lost in Nightmares Review |work=GameZone |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archivedate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Claiborn of IGN rated the "Desperate Escape" DLC seven out of ten: "Despite Desperate Escape's well-crafted action sequences, I actually found myself missing the unique vibe of Lost in Nightmares. The dynamic between Jill and Josh isn't particularly thrilling, and the one-liners, banter and endearing kitsch are kept to a minimum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2010/03/09/resident-evil-5-desperate-escape-review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924093159/http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/09/resident-evil-5-desperate-escape-review |archivedate=24 September 2015 |deadurl=no |title=Resident Evil 5: Desperate Escape Review |last=Claiborn |first=Samuel |date=9 March 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of racism===
''Resident Evil 5''{{'}}s 2007 E3 trailer was criticized for depicting a [[white people|white]] protagonist killing [[black people|black]] enemies in a small African village.

In ''Eurogamer''{{'s}} February 2009 preview of ''Resident Evil 5'', Dan Whitehead expressed concern about controversy the game might generate: "It plays so blatantly into the old clichés of the dangerous '[[wikt:Dark Continent|dark continent]]' and the primitive lust of its inhabitants that you'd swear the game was written in the 1920s". Whitehead said that these issues became more "outrageous and outdated" as the game progressed and that the addition of the "light-skinned" Alomar just made the overall issue worse.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan |last=Whitehead |title=Resident Evil 5 |date=5 February 2009 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/resident-evil-5-hands-on-chapter1to3 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203100351/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/resident-evil-5-hands-on-chapter1to3 |archivedate=3 December 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillary Golstein from IGN believed that the game was not deliberately racist, and though he did not personally find it offensive, he felt that others would due to the subjective nature of offensiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/10/editorial-is-resident-evil-5-racist |title=Editorial: Is Resident evil 5 Racist? |last=Goldstein |first=Hillary |date=10 February 2009 |work=[[IGN]] |access-date=31 March 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170331001936/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/10/editorial-is-resident-evil-5-racist |archivedate=31 March 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Hudak dismissed any allegations of racism as "stupid".&lt;ref name=gamerev/&gt; Karen Dyer, who is of Jamaican descent, also dismissed the claims. She said that in over a year of working on the game's development she never encountered anything racially insensitive, and would not have continued working there if she had.&lt;ref name=dyer/&gt;

Wesley Yin-Poole of ''VideoGamer.com'' said that despite the controversy the game was attracting due to alleged racism, no expert opinion had been sought. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in [[social anthropology]] at the [[University of Kent]], whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations "silly", saying that the game had an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an "inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black."&lt;ref name="kent"&gt;{{cite web|first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |title=EXCLUSIVE: Expert delivers verdict on Resi 5 racism row |date=6 March 2009 |work=VideoGamer.com |url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/resident_evil_5/news/exclusive_expert_delivers_verdict_on_resi_5_racism_row.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207011531/https://www.videogamer.com/news/exclusive-expert-delivers-verdict-on-resi-5-racism-row |archivedate=7 December 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed "black men" dragging off a screaming white woman;&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt; according to Yin-Poole, the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was "not obviously black".&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; The scene was submitted to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] for evaluation. BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said, "There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [and he] is not black either.

Academic journals and conferences, however, have continued to comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from ''[[Games and Culture]]'' said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies.&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Brock |first1=André |title=‘‘When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong’’: Resident Evil 5, Racial Representation, and Gamers |journal=[[Games and Culture]] |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=429–452 |date=September 2011 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1555412011402676 |doi=10.1177/1555412011402676 |issn=1555-4120 |df=dmy-all |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[Digital Games Research Association]] in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been intended by Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.&lt;ref name=geyser&gt;{{cite web |last1=Geyser |first1=Hanli |last2=Tshabalala |first2=Pippa |date=2011 |title=Return to Darkness: Representations of Africa in Resident Evil 5 |url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/11312.58174.pdf |work=[[Digital Games Research Association]] |access-date=16 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20171016002914/http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/11312.58174.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference'' in 2015, Harrer and Pichlmair considered ''Resident Evil 5'' to be "yet another moment in the history of commodity racism, which from the late 19th century onwards allowed popular depictions of racial stereotypes to enter the most intimate spaces of European homes." The authors state that Africa is presented from a Western gaze; "what is presented as 'authentic' blackness conforms to the projected fantasy of predominantly white gaming audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harrer |first1=Sibene |last2=Martine |first2=Pichlmair |year=2015 |title=Black Skin White Guns - Becoming Colonizer in Resident Evil 5 |url=https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/80594879/HarrerPichlmair_PCG15.pdf |work=The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference |access-date=October 21, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20171021232510/https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/80594879/HarrerPichlmair_PCG15.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Paul Martin from ''Games and Culture'' said that the theme of the game could be described as "dark continent", stating that it drew on imagery of European colonialism and depictions of "Blackness" reminiscent of 19th-century European theories on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Paul |year=2016 |title=Race, Colonial History and National Identity: Resident Evil 5 as a Japanese Game |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1555412016631648?journalCode=gaca |journal=[[Games and Culture]] |issn=1555-4120 |doi=10.1177/1555412016631648 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Russell smokingkid.jpg|thumb|Scratchboard illustration for WigWag Magazine by Bill Russell]]

Sometimes referred to as '''scraperboard''' (especially in Great Britain), but usually called '''scratchboard''' in North America and Australia, is a form of direct engraving where the artist scratches off dark ink to reveal a white or colored layer beneath.  Scratchboard refers to both a fine-art medium, and an illustrative technique using sharp knives and tools for engraving into a thin layer of white [[Kaolinite|China clay]] that is coated with dark, often black India ink. There is also foil paper covered with black ink that, when scratched, exposes the shiny surface beneath. Scratchboard can be used to yield highly detailed, precise and evenly textured artwork.  Works can be left black and white, or colored.

==History==
Modern scraperboard originated in the 19th century in Britain and France. As printing methods developed, scraperboard became a popular medium for reproduction because it replaced wood, metal and linoleum engraving. It allowed for a fine line appearance that could be photographically reduced for reproduction without losing quality. It was most effective and expeditious for use in single-color book and [[newspaper printing]]. From the 1930s to 1950s, it was one of the preferred techniques for medical, scientific and product [[illustration]]. During that time period, [[Virgil Finlay]] made very detailed illustrations, often combining scraperboard methods with traditional pen &amp; ink techniques, and producing highly detailed artworks.  In more recent years, it has made a comeback as an appealing medium for editorial illustrators of magazines, ads, [[graphic novels]], and one of a kind pieces of fine art displayed in galleries and museums internationally.

== Technique ==
Unlike many drawing media, where the artist adds in the mid-tones and shadows, with scratchboard the artist is working by adding in the highlights. The artist can use a variety of tools to scratch away the black ink from the board and reveal more or less of the white clay that is underneath (see materials list below for tools). After black ink has been removed as desired the work may be considered complete, or subsequently be colored with [[watercolor]]s, [[airbrush]], [[ink]], [[color pencil]] or [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]]. Transparent media are generally used to color scratchboard, as they fill in the white scratches without affecting the black ink left on the board. After an area has been colored it can be scratched again, revealing more of the white clay. Sometimes the artist will color and scratch several times to create subtle shading or color variations. This technique can yield a graphic image that can be very detailed. Artists that begin with a white clay-coated board will add their own ink to the surface, and then scratch away the ink in the same manner as described above. After completion, the artwork may be varnished to protect it against damage.

[[File:Lee Sunflower and silver.jpg|thumb|Sunflower and Silver by Diana Lee]] [[File:Lee Sunflower and silver detail.jpg|thumb|A detail of Sunflower and Silver to show scratching technique.]]

==Materials and tools==
Scratchboard itself comes either with a paper (cardboard) backing, or a hardboard support. While the cardboard does have its uses, as it can be easily cut into size, the hardboard is much superior, giving greater stability to the work, being able to be corrected more often.  It is more durable and easier to scratch into for cleaner, crisper details and lines. Several tools have been created specifically for scratchboard; however any sharp implement will do though a range of blades of different thicknesses allows the removal of more or less of the ink at will (see variety of tools listed below).  Isopropyl Alcohol on a cotton swab or cotton ball, sandpaper and non-oily, fine, steel wool are also useful for removing large areas, and creating texture.  Coloring scratchboard, black or white boards, can be done with many media applied with paint brush, air brush, and even cotton balls.  Special scratchboard colored inks can be added to the white areas and then scratched again for additional highlights and volume for added dimension. While some artists choose to make their own scratchboards, most artists work on commercially available materials.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Some of the tools professional scratchboard artists use for scratching through the ink include xacto blades, scalpel blades, tattoo needles, tips made by speedball (scratchboard tips #112 and 113), tips made by scratch-art brand, small fiberglass brushes, wire brushes, sandpaper, steel wool, parallel-line tool, ink erasers, and more! Various techniques such as [[hatching]] or [[stippling]] can be used to detail the image. The 14" X 18" scratchboard Sunflower And Silver by Diana Lee is an example of black scratchboard colored with transparent ink. An extreme close up lets the detail of the scratching be more easily seen.

== Artists ==
Notable contemporary illustrators who have worked in the scratchboard medium include [[David Klein (American artist)|David Klein]], [[Michael McCurdy]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/dec/21/the-12-cartoons-of-christmas-by-quentin-blake-judith-kerr-posy-simmonds-and-more#img-5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgil Finlay]], [[John Schoenherr]], [[Gary Houston]],Peter Kuper and [[Scott McKowen]].

In 2011, the International Society of Scratchboard Artists (ISSA) was launched to help promote scratchboard art as a fine art medium, as well as to help educate the public about the medium. The organization holds at least one annual exhibition dedicated exclusively to scratchboard art in a gallery or museum each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scratchboardsociety.com/&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=May 2018}}

A '''sewing table''' or '''work table''' is a [[Table (furniture)|table]] or [[desk]] used for [[sewing]]. Generally it has large amounts of space and a full set of [[sewing tools]].  Nearby there will be a chair and a waste bin.  A common attachment is a [[dropleaf]] to give expanded space. Other attachments can be a cloth bag for storing sewing materials, drawers, or shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NMSU: Designing a Hobby Center|url = http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_g/g-412/welcome.html|website = aces.nmsu.edu|access-date = 22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The sewing table originated in [[England]] around 1770 and was adopted in post-[[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] America. Prior to the use of the sewing table, women kept needlework in a basket or bag. It was designed to provide a surface and storage for a gentlewoman’s needlework or other leisure actives, including basket-weaving, crochet, macramé and painting as it was customary for women to gather and take up work around the table. The majority of tables created in the U.S. during this time were of [[Sheraton style|Sheraton]] or [[Empire style|Empire]] style and constructed of [[mahogany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-15823843/the-sewing-table|title = The Sewing Table|last = Rosenkrantz|first = Linda|date = October 1994|journal = American Heritage|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Your Guide to Buying an Antique Sewing Table|url = http://www.ebay.com/gds/Your-Guide-to-Buying-an-Antique-Sewing-Table-/10000000177317458/g.html|website = eBay|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1800s, [[sewing machine]]s were developed and the sewing table was altered to accommodate a machine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Singer cabinet works was established in 1868 as a contractor constructing the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Company’s]] sewing tables in [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Indiana]]. The plant was designed initially for sewing table distribution in the Western United States. In 1891, the plant expanded covering 60 acres and 20 acres of lumber yards with a factory railroad. The new plant handled all Singer operations with tables being shipped to the Eastern U.S. as well as Europe, South America, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The History Museum  » Singer Sewing Machine Company|url = http://historymuseumsb.org/singer-sewing-machine-company/|website = historymuseumsb.org|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Super-Turtle''' (or '''Super Turtle''') is a fictional character from [[DC Comics]], created by [[Henry Boltinoff]]; he's depicted as a [[bipedal]] [[anthropomorphic]] [[turtle]] wearing a [[cape]] like [[Superman]]'s. His emblem, which is on his cape, is a letter T in a shield.

==Publication history==
Created to be a lighthearted parody of Superman, Super-Turtle appeared mostly in one-page comic stories in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] comic books, starting in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #304 (January 1963).

An accepted part of DC Comics history, Super-Turtle tends to show up once in a while in one form or another; e.g., a Super-Turtle figure hangs from the ceiling of the Planet Krypton restaurant in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', and he had a [[cameo appearance]] in the one-shot ''[[Superman and Batman: World's Funnest]]''. Two one-page Super-Turtle stories were created for and appeared in the 2000 ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics Title)|Silver Age]]'' series.

His most recent comic book appearance was in issue #3 of the 2008 miniseries ''[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]'', in which he plays a role like the one [[Superboy-Prime]] played in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''; after living in limbo with [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]] and company, Super-Turtle (who now calls himself Clark Kent) starts destroying anyone he considers to be a phony Super-Turtle, including [[Bat-Mite]] and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Connor Kent]].

Super-Turtle makes a cameo in the final issue of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' as [[Batmite]] is upset of the comic's cancelation and states several missed crossover opportunities including Super-Turtle.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The All New Brave and The Bold'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

Super-Turtle has since appeared in ''Sleepy Time Crime'' from Capstone Publishing's DC Super-Pets line of children books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleepy Time Crime|url=http://www.capstonepub.com/product/9781404864856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
On the planet Galapagon (a parody of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] and the [[Galápagos Islands]]), the scientist Shh-Ell (a parody of [[Jor-El]]) of an advanced race of turtles realized that their planet was doomed, and convinced the Science Council that they should build 1,000 spaceships to evacuate it. Slow by nature, the turtles only managed to build one spaceship, in which Shh-Ell's infant son, Tur-Tel (Kal-El), was sent to Earth. Found by a kindly homespun farming couple, the turtle grew up and gained super-powers, becoming '''Super-Turtle''', the '''Reptile of Steel'''.

Super-Turtle's enemies and allies include parodies of Superman's (such as Brainy-[[yak]], who is a parody of [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] and [[Lex Luthor]]) and, in curious circumstances, Superman himself.

==Powers and abilities==
Super-Turtle has the same powers as Superman: Flight, invulnerability, superhuman speed and strength, vision powers, et cetera.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3409">[[File:Star Wars The Force Awakens Kylo Ren.jpg|thumb|[[Kylo Ren]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015): [[The Force]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe is attributed to [[Mutualism (biology)|symbiotic]] microscopic lifeforms.]]

[[Mutualism (biology)|Symbiosis (mutualism)]] appears in fiction, especially [[science fiction]], as a plot device. It is distinguished from [[parasitism in fiction]], a similar theme, by the mutual benefit to the organisms involved, whereas the [[parasite]] inflicts harm on its host.&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |title=Parasitism and Symbiosis |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/parasitism_and_symbiosis |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=25 July 2018 |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
{{further|Parasitism in fiction|Human possession in science fiction}}

Relationships between species in early [[science fiction]] were often [[parasitism in fiction|imaginatively parasitic]], with the [[parasite]]s draining the [[Élan vital|vital energy]] of their human hosts and taking over their minds, as in [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1895 ''[[The Parasite]]''.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], science fiction moved towards more mutualistic relationships, as in [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]]'s 1970 ''By Furies Possessed''; [[Brian Stableford]] argues that White was consciously opposing the [[xenophobia]] of [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1951 ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'' which involved a parasitic relationship close to [[demonic possession]], with a more positive attitude towards aliens.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; Stableford notes, however, that [[Octavia Butler]]'s 1984 ''[[Clay's Ark]]'' and other of her works such as ''[[Fledgling (novel)|Fledgling]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez-Taylor |first1=Joy |title=Fledgling, Symbiosis, and the Nature/Culture Divide |journal=Science Fiction Studies |date=November 2017 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=486-505 |doi=10.5621/sciefictstud.44.3.0486}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dan Simmons]]'s 1989 ''Hyperion'' take an ambivalent position, in which the aliens may confer powers such as ''Hyperion'''s ability to regenerate continually—but at a price, in its case an incremental loss of intelligence at each regeneration.&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt;

[[The Force]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe is described by the fictional seer [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] as "an energy field created by all living things". In ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'', [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, inside all living cells, allow characters with enough of these symbionts in their cells to feel and use the Force.&lt;ref name="BrooksEpisodeI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace |last=Brooks |first=Terry |authorlink=Terry Brooks |date=1999 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Douglas Adams]]'s humorous 1978 ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Babel fish (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Babel fish]] lives in its human host's ear, feeding on the energy of its host's brain waves, in return translating any language to the host's benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: Fit the First'' BBC Radio 4 program, broadcast 8 March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveys==

Discovery of the Hermonian temples in rural [[village]]s began in the 19th century, with surveys by [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] and [[Sir Charles Warren]].&lt;ref name="Robinson1856"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Robinson|title=Biblical researches in Palestine and the adjacent regions: a journal of travels in the years 1838 and 1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9y3QCMvh48C&amp;pg=PA433|accessdate=17 September 2012|year=1856|publisher=J.

Taylor provided a pictorial guide in the late 1960s with more recent information coming from Shim'on Dar in 1993 and [[epigraphic]] surveys in 2002 and 2003.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide.

The [[Seleucid]]s occupied the area after 200 BCE, shortly after which the [[Ituraean]]s developed a principality in the area until the fall of [[Chalcis]] when the territory passed to the [[Herodian]] kings [[Agrippa I]] and [[Agrippa II]]. After the end of the first century CE the territory became jointly controlled by the cities of [[Damascus]], [[Sidon]] and [[Paneas]]. It is thought that the area was inhabited continuously until the third century CE. Precise dating of the structures is currently not possible. Krencker and Zscheitzschmann suggested they were mostly constructed between 150 and 300 CE and [[epigraphic]] evidence has been found to support this for several temples. Construction techniques have been seen to differ from those used in shrines of the [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Achaemenid]] and Hellenistic periods such as [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Tell Anafa]] and [[Kharayeb]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt; Recent studies have highlighted differences in construction style of the Hermonian temples from Hellenistic architecture at [[Khirbet Massakeb]],&lt;ref&gt;Kalos, M., Un sanctuaire d'epoque hellenistique en Syrie du sud: Khirbet Massakeb. Topoi, 9/2, pp. 777-794, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khirbet Zemel]]&lt;ref&gt;Hartal, M., "Khirbet Zemel: Northern Golan: an Iturean Settlement" in Zvi Gal (ed.), ''Eretz Zafon: Studies in Galilean Archaeology'', pp. 75-117, Jerusalem:IAA, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and other sites in the [[Hauran]] and [[Jawlan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://151.12.58.75/archeologia/bao_document/articoli/1_KROPP.pdf Kropp, Andreas., Limits of Hellenisation: Pre-Roman basalt temples in the Hauran, Bollettino di Archaeologia On Line, Special Volume for the International congress of classical archaeology meetings between cultures in the ancient mediterranean, Rome, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the sites may have been built on previous layers of architecture, the current temples are predominantly considered to be of Roman construction and were largely abandoned after the fourth century CE during the [[Byzantine]] era.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt; Recent studies have highlighted differences in construction style of the Hermonian temples from Hellenistic architecture at [[Khirbet Massakeb]],&lt;ref&gt;Kalos, M., Un sanctuaire d'epoque hellenistique en Syrie du sud: Khirbet Massakeb.

Although the sites may have been built on previous layers of architecture, the current temples are predominantly considered to be of Roman construction and were largely abandoned after the fourth century AD during the [[Byzantine]] era.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

The temples were often connected with ancient occupational sites. Olivier Callot and Pierre-Louis Gatier argued that several of the temple sites might have been mistaken for monumental [[tomb]]s as Roman [[mausoleum]]s such as [[Saidnaya]] have been found in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Callot, Olivier, and Pierre-Louis Gatier. "Le reseau des sanctuaires en Syrie du Nord." Topoi 9, pp. 665-688, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor held the view that the religious architecture was the responsibility of "the hand of a single master builder" but was not able to answer the question of why so many shrines should be concentrated in the area.&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; [[Henry Seyrig]], when reviewing Krencker and Zscheitzmann's "Romische Tempel in Syrien" highlighted that ''"the clue to an important social and economic change that would deserve to be one day the focus of a study"''. There is still a deplorable lack of a comprehensive study into the [[history]], [[archaeology]],  [[architecture]] of these buildings and ancient sites, or the religious life of the people who used them.&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

==Summit site of Qasr Antar==

Recently have been additionally discovered in 2003 the [[Qasr Chbib]] complex, made of two small Roman temples situated just a few hundred meters from the summit of Mount Hermon. There is a sacred building made of hewn blocks of stone on the summit of Mount Hermon. Known as Qasr Antar, it was the highest temple of the ancient world, sitting at {{convert|2814|m|ft}} above sea level. It was documented by [[Sir Charles Warren]] in 1869. Warren described the temple as a rectangular building, sitting on an oval, stone plateau without roof. He removed a [[limestone]] [[stele]] from the northwest of the oval, broke it into two pieces and carried it down the mountain and back to the [[British Museum]], where it currently resides. An inscription on the stele was translated by George Nickelsburg to read ''"According to the command of the greatest a(nd) Holy God, those who take an oath (proceed) from here."'' Nickelsburg connected the inscription with oath taken by the [[angel]]s under [[Semjaza]] who took an [[oath]] together, bound by a [[curse]] in order to take [[wives]] in the [[Book of Enoch]] (1 Enoch 6:6). Hermon was said to have become known as "the mountain of oath" by [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]]. The name of [[God]] was supposed to be a Hellenized version of [[Baʿal]] or [[Hadad]] and Nickelsburg connected it with the place name of [[Baal-Hermon]] (Lord of Hermon) and the deity given by [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as ''"The Great Holy One"''.&lt;ref&gt;Nickelsburg, 1 Enoch 1. A Commentary on the Book of 1 Enoch, 1–36; 81–108, Minneapolis: Fortress, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] recognized the religious importance of Hermon in his work ''"Onomasticon"'', saying ''"Until today, the mount in front of Panias and Lebanon is known as Hermon and it is respected by nations as a sanctuary"''. It has been related to the [[Arabic]] term ''al-haram'', which means "sacred enclosure".&lt;ref name="Myers2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=E. A. Myers|title=The Ituraeans and the Roman Near East: Reassessing the Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cRrGQ8bIAkC&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=11 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51887-1|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deities==

Apart from the supreme god of the lofty sanctuary, other gods were evidenced to have been worshipped in the area. The god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] is often connected with the headwaters of the [[Jordan river]] in the area. Inscriptions on stones used in the church of [[Heleliye]] near [[Sidon]] have referred to [[Threption]], son of [[Neikon]] offering stone [[lion]]s to [[Zeus]]. Other deities noted to have been worshipped in the area were called [[Theandrios]] and [[Leucothea]], which were likely Greek names substituted for native [[Caananite]] gods. Leucothea was the Greek goddess of the sea and she was known to have been worshipped from 60 CE at the temple devoted to her at [[Rakleh]] and also at [[Kfar Zabad]], [[Inkhil]], [[Tel Jezreel]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Segeria]] as evidenced by an inscription found at [[Ayn al-Burj]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

The [[Gods of Kiboreia]] are known from a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] inscription taken from a large temple at [[Deir El Aachayer]] on the northern slopes of [[Mount Hermon]] in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Kaizer|title=The Variety of Local Religious Life in the Near East In the Hellenistic and Roman Periods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgVD3WL0vAsC&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=18 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16735-3|pages=89–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jalabert, L., "Inscriptions grecques et latines de Syrie (deuxième série)" in Mélanges de la Faculté Orientale de Beyrouth 2, p.265-320, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/678253 |title=Places: 678253 (Kiboreia) |author=Brown, J., E.

==Sites in Lebanon==
George Taylor divided up the [[Temples of Lebanon]] into three groups, one group of [[Temples of the Beqaa Valley]] lies north of the road from [[Beirut]] to [[Damascus]]. Second, there is the group in the area south of the same road, including the [[Wadi al-Taym]] and the western flank of Mount Hermon. Third, the group in the area west of a line drawn along the ridge of Mount Lebanon. There are relatively few temples along Lebanon's coastal plain. The Temples of Mount Hermon in Taylor's second group included [[Ain Harcha]], [[Aaiha]], [[Deir El Aachayer]], [[Dekweh]], [[Yanta (village)|Yanta]], [[Hebbariye]], [[Ain Libbaya]], [[Nebi Safa]], [[Aaqbe]], [[Khirbet El-Knese]], [[Mejdal Anjar]], [[Mdoukha]] and [[Bakka, Lebanon|Bakka]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1971"/&gt; Four new sites were identified during [[epigraphic]] surveys of 2003 and 2004 at [[Ain Ata]], [[Ain Qaniya]], [[Korsei el-Debb]] and [[Qasr Chbib]] whilst possible identification was made requiring further investigation at the sites of [[Qatana]], [[Kafr Dura]], [[Qalaat al-Almond]], [[Haouch Hafoufa]] and [[Mazraat el-Faqaa]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

The recently found Qasr Chbib is a complex of two [[Roman temple]]s situated a few hundred meters from the summit of [[Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. A. Myers|title=The Ituraeans and the Roman Near East: Reassessing the Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cRrGQ8bIAkC&amp;pg=PA93|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51887-1|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the sanctuaries have northern walls that were carved out of solid bedrock of the mountain.

==Sites in Israel==
A sacred site at [[Tel Dan]] has been excavated southwest of Mount Hermon. It was shown to have had successive layers of occupation through the [[Pottery Neolithic]], [[Chalcolithic]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], Greco-Roman, [[Medieval]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/december-2011/article/archaeologists-excavate-legendary-city-of-dan Archaeologists Excavate Legendary City of Dan, Popular Archaeology, Vol. 5, December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pottery Neolithic Levels at Tel Dan. Mitekufat Haeven, Journal of the Israel Prehistoric Society 20:91-113. Bar-Yosef, O., Gopher, A., and Nadel, D. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites in Syria==
Of the Syrian Hermonian temples, the easiest to reach from [[Damascus]] are at and [[Burqush]] and [[Rakleh]].&lt;ref name="Burns2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross Burns|title=Damascus: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTs77Ft6FXQC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=20 January 2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-27105-9|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the temple in Rakleh, there is an engraved god on one wall, surrounded by a [[wreath]] and facing towards Mount Hermon.&lt;ref name="Rawson1870"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert Leighton Rawson|title=The Bible Handbook: For Sunday-schools and Bible Readers.

Two other sanctuaries that have been the subject of study by Israelis in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied]] [[Golan Heights]] are [[Qalaat Bustra]] and [[Har Senaim]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"/&gt;

{{Culture of Turkey}}
The tradition of [[folklore]]—folktales, jokes, legends, and the like—in the [[Turkish language]] is very rich, and is incorporated into everyday life and events.

==Turkish folklore==

===Nasreddin Hoca===

{{main|Nasreddin Hoca}}

Perhaps the most popular figure in the tradition is Nasreddin, (known as ''Nasreddin Hoca'', or "teacher Nasreddin", in Turkish), who is the central character of thousands of jokes. He generally appears as a person who, though seeming somewhat stupid to those who must deal with him, actually proves to have a special wisdom all his own:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''One day, Nasreddin's neighbor asked him, "Teacher, do you have any forty-year-old vinegar?"
—"Yes, I do," answered Nasreddin.—"Can I have some?" asked the neighbor. "I need some to make an ointment with."—"No, you can't have any," answered Nasreddin. "If I gave my forty-year-old vinegar to whoever wanted some, I wouldn't have had it for forty years, would I?"''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar to the Nasreddin jokes, and arising from a similar religious milieu, are the Bektashi jokes, in which the members of the [[Bektashi|Bektashi religious order]]—represented through a character simply named ''Bektaşi''—are depicted as having an unusual and unorthodox wisdom, one that often challenges the values of Islam and of society.

===Karagöz ve Hacivat===

{{main|Karagoz and Hacivat}}

Another popular element of Turkish folklore is the [[Theatre of shadows|shadow theater]] centered on the two characters of Karagöz and Hacivat, who both represent [[stock character]]s: Karagöz—who hails from a small village—is something of a country bumpkin, while Hacivat is a more sophisticated city-dweller. Popular legend has it that the two characters are actually based on two real persons who worked for [[Osman I]]—the founder of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman dynasty]]—in the construction of his palace at [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]] in the early 14th century CE. The two workers supposedly spent much of their time entertaining the other workers, and were so funny and popular that they interfered with work on the palace, and were subsequently put to death.

==Folklore from the Black Sea Region==

===Vine-breaking===
In Çarşıbaşi town, near [[Trabzon]], there is a way of testing whether a marriage is propitious: when the new bride enters the house, she is asked to break a [[vine]] into three pieces, which are then planted in the ground. If they sprout, this means the marriage will be successful.

===Cutting the shoelace===
In the Eastern Black Sea region ([[Giresun]], [[Trabzon]], [[Rize]], [[Artvin]]), it is believed that there is an invisible lace between the feet of those children who have trouble walking when they're young. A lace is tied (usually of cotton) between the feet of child and the lace is cut by the elder child of family or the first to leave the [[mosque]] after Friday prayer. It is believed that once the invisible lace has been cut, the child will walk.

===Passing beneath a Blackberry Tree===
In Turkish folklore, ([[Trabzon]] region, Akçaabat town), childless women, cows that don't get pregnant, and children wetting their beds are supposedly cured by passing under a [[blackberry]] bush known as "Avat" (West Trabzon). “Avat is believed to be a charm herb of paradise.”

===Shown to the Moon===
In [[Trabzon]] and [[Rize]] region [[folklore]] (Pontic coast of [[Anatolia]]). Desperate patients with incurable diseases are said to have been shown to the moon on a wooden shovel “If that continues I will put you on a shovel and show you to the moon”(İkizdere town. In Çarşıbaşı district of [[Trabzon]] province, weak and scrawny babies have been shown to the moon on a shovel and said:
“moon! moon! Take him!, or cure him”. In this tradition, which is a sequel to the [[paganist]] beliefs before the monotheist religions, moon cures the patient or takes his/her life. [[Moon worship]] is very common among the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], [[Svan people|Svans]] and [[Mingrel]]ians ABS 18.

===Tying someone===
In Black Sea coast of [[Turkey]]'s [[folklore]] ([[Trabzon]], [[Rize]], [[Giresun]], [[Ordu]], [[Artvin]], [[Samsun]])

'''1.''' v. To ensure a bridegroom is bewitched and impotent so as to be unable to have sexual intercourse with bride. There are several ways of being tied: A person who wants to impede this marriage, blows into a knot, knots it and puts it on the bride or uses other sorceries. However, it is also deemed a way of being tied if the bride nails, knots or locks a door with a key before the marriage. “While going to the house of the bridegroom, way is always changed and the unlooked-for ways are followed to be saved from tie sorceries that could have been buried in the way”
'''2.''' n. To tie the animals such as wolves and bears that harm the flock and named monster, and swine that damages the crop. Generally, an amulet is prepared by a [[hodja]] and buried in the places where the flock grazes or in the corner of sown field. 
'''3.''' n. To increase the amount and quality of meadow before the hay-making time, water is brought to the meadows in the plateaus in thin directions from rivers by the arcs. This process is called as to connect water.

===Tree Worship===
In [[Trabzon]] folklore, the swinging of tree branches and leaves symbolized worship. It is believed that [[oak]] trees do not [[worship]] [[God]] because their leaves do not swing as much as those of other trees.

[[Şakir Şevket]] says that [[Akçaabat]] society believed in an idol and worshipped a tree called [[platana]], and that is how the city was given this name. Although the platana ([[Platanus Orientalis]] in [[Latin]]) was a plane tree he had confused this tree with the [[Populus|poplar]].

The words of Lermioglu “today peasants love trees as their children. There were several events which people kill someone for a tree” and a story from 19th century show us that this love comes from very old days. A hunter from [[Mersin]] village cut a tree called kragen which was idol of Akcaabat society (Since 1940). Then the peasants called the police and said that the hunter cut the [[Wali|Evliya]] [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Evliya “Saint”). This event can only be explained with the “paganist” beliefs comes from “[[Caucasus|Caucasia]]”. At first the police understood that the hunter killed a man called Evliya (Saint) but later they saw that the “saint” was a tree so they let the hunter go. It was an example of [[Colchis]] culture that can be seen today which was mixed with [[Islam]] in [[Trabzon]] under the name of saint and common before one [[God]] religions that people used to believe in nature.

It is possible to see same things in [[Hemsheen]] region of [[Rize]] “the branches are praying three days before and during [[Bayram (Turkey)|bairam]], so we do not cut live branches during bairam, the branches are praying”.

===End of Winter Cemre===
Cemre are three fireballs that come from the heavens to warm earth at the end of each winter. Each cemre warms one aspect of the nature. The first cemre falls to air between February 19–20. The second cemre falls to water between February 26–27. The third cemre falls to ground between 5–6 March.

An '''uncertain plural''' occurs when a writer does not know in advance whether a word should be written in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] or [[plural]].  For [[English language|English]] nouns, this may be demonstrated by enclosing the trailing ''s'' in parentheses, such as "book(s)".

In the case of articles, "they" or "their" may be used to include a single individual, when uncertain.

'''Vortextuality''' is a concept developed in the work of Garry Whannel, an academic thinker working in the area of the cultural analysis of media sport. Whannel uses this concept in his work to analyse and account for the ways in which some news stories acquire a rapid momentum, briefly dominating the mediascape and the [[blogosphere]].

In his book, ''Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Whannel, G|year=2002|title=Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xh4THME06t0C&amp;pg=PT213|isbn=0-415-17038-9|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; he explained this term, noting:"The growth in the range of media outlets, and the vastly increased speed of circulation of information have combined to create the phenomenon of a "vortex" effect".

The vortextual effect produces a compression of the media agenda, in which other news items disappear from the agenda or have to be connected in some way to the dominant event. Developing this idea, Whannel observed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Various media constantly feed off each other and, in an era of electronic and digital information exchange, the speed at which this happens has become very rapid.  Certain super-major events come to dominate the headlines to such an extent that it becomes temporarily difficult for columnists and commentators to discuss anything else.  They are drawn in, as if by a vortex."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whannel gives the example of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] as an example of Vortextuality as this story dominated the media for days, to the extent that it removed most other items from the news agenda. Likewise, during global sporting events, such as the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] or the [[Olympic Games]], journalists and columnists with no expertise or pre-existing interest in sport comment on the event as Marshal et al. (2010) point out. Recent examples, of media vortextuality include the [[election of Barack Obama]] and the [[death of Michael Jackson]].&lt;!-- NOT PUBLISHED YET &lt;ref name=cp65&gt;Whannel, G.

In [[Norse mythology]], '''Völsung''' ({{lang-non|'''Vǫlsungr'''}}) was the son of [[Rerir]] and the eponymous ancestor of the ill-fortuned Völsung clan ({{lang|non|Vǫlsungar}}), which includes the well known Norse hero [[Sigurð]]. He was murdered by the [[Geatish king]] [[Siggeir]] and later avenged by one of his sons, [[Sigmund]], and his daughter [[Signy]], who was married to Siggeir.

Völsung's story is recorded in the [[Völsung Cycle]], a series of [[legend]]s about the clan. The earliest extant versions of the cycle were recorded in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Iceland]]; the tales of the cycle were expanded with local [[Scandinavian folklore]], including that of [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] (which appears to originally have been part of the separate tradition of the [[Ylfing]]s), and form the material of the epic poems in the [[Elder Edda]] and of {{lang|is|[[Völsunga saga]]}}, which preserves material from lost poems. Völsung is also the subject matter of the [[Middle High German]] [[epic poem]] {{lang|gmh|[[Nibelungenlied]]}} and is mentioned as {{lang|ang|Wæls}} in the [[Old English]] epic ''[[Beowulf]]''.

==Synopsis==
Völsung was the great-grandson of [[Odin]] himself, and it was Odin's consort [[Frigg]] who made sure that Völsung would be born. Völsung's parents, who were the king and queen of [[Hunaland]], could not have any children until the goddess sent them an apple of fertility carried by the giantess [[Hljod]]. Völsung's father, [[Rerir]], died shortly after this, but his wife was pregnant for six years, until she had had enough. She commanded that the child be delivered by [[caesarean section]], an operation that in those days cost the life of the mother. Völsung was a strong child and he kissed his mother before she died. 

He was immediately proclaimed king of Hunaland and when he had grown up he married the same giantess Hljod. Together they had ten sons and one daughter, including the twins [[Signy]], their daughter, and [[Sigmund]], the most courageous and beautiful of their sons.

Völsung built himself a great hall in the centre of which stood a large oak tree called the [[Barnstokkr]]. [[Siggeir]], the [[King of the Geats]], soon arrived and proposed to Signy. Both Völsung and his sons approved, but Signy was less enthusiastic.

A great wedding was held in the hall, when suddenly a stranger appeared. He was a tall old man with only one eye and could not be anyone but [[Odin]]. He went to the oak tree, took his sword and stuck it deep into the trunk. Odin told everyone that the sword was meant for the man who could pull the sword from the oak tree. Then he vanished.

Everyone at the wedding tried to pull the sword but only Sigmund succeeded, and he did so effortlessly. Siggeir, his brother-in-law, offered thrice its weight in gold for the sword, but Sigmund scornfully said no. This greatly angered Siggeir, and he swore that one day the sword would be his and he would be avenged on the Völsung family. He returned home the next day, ending the wedding feast early. Before he left he invited the Völsungs to conclude the feast with him when the winter had passed.

Three months later Völsung and his sons sailed to Siggeir's land. They were met by Signy, who warned them that Siggeir intended to ambush them. They refused to turn back, whereupon Signy cried and implored them to go home. Soon they were attacked by Siggeir's army. Völsung fell and his ten sons were taken captive. 

For the continued story, see [[Sigmund]].

==Modern retellings==
The story of Völsung and his children, from the marriage of Signy to Siggeir to Sigmund's vengeance on Siggeir, is retold in the novelette "Vengeance" by [[Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur]], which appeared in the magazine ''[[Adventure (magazine)|Adventure]]'', June 30, 1925.  Brodeur was a professor at Berkeley and became well known for his scholarship on Beowulf and other Norse sagas.

As ''Völsungakviđa en Nýja'' (''The New Lay of the Völsungs'') [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] retells the story in the Old Norse verse style of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. It was published posthumously together with a poetic retelling of the [[Nibelung|Niflung saga]] under the title, ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]''.

The Völsung tale was also the inspiration for much of [[Richard Wagner]]'s second and third operas of the [[Ring of the Nibelung|Ring cycle]]. Siegmund and his twin sister Sieglinde reconnect and fall in love in ''Die Walküre'' (The Valkyrie), and Siegmund pulls the sword from the tree. Their son Siegfried goes on to become a hero in the following opera, ''Siegfried''.

'''''Wayside''''' (also known as '''''Wayside School''''') is a Canadian [[Animation|animated]] [[sitcom]] developed by [[John Derevlany]] for [[Teletoon]] and [[Nickelodeon]]. The series centres on Todd, a [[Transfer admissions in the United States|transfer student]] who attends Wayside, an offbeat 30-story grammar school. It is loosely based on the ''[[Wayside School (book series)|Wayside School]]'' books by [[Louis Sachar]], although several elements differ between the two works.

Derevlany conceived ''Wayside'' in 2003, leading to an hour-long [[television special]] [[Pilot episode|pilot]] titled ''[[Wayside: The Movie]]'' that aired in 2005. Teletoon greenlit two seasons of ''Wayside'' consisting of thirteen half-hour episodes each, and they aired from 2007 to 2008; the series also aired briefly on [[Nickelodeon]] during this time. Reruns of the show had also aired on [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons Network]] from June 25, 2007 until it was removed from U.S. Television completely on April 5, 2010. The show aired reruns on YTV.

''Wayside'' received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its clever and off-beat humour, though some criticized its differences with the ''Wayside School'' book series. The series was nominated for a "Best TV Series for Children" at the 2008 Cartoons on the Bay award ceremony. The pilot episode and the first season are both available on DVD.

==Overview==
''Wayside'' takes place in the fictional Wayside School, an unusual [[M. C. Escher|Escher]]-esque 30-story [[grammar school]]. The school had been accidentally built "sideways", with one [[classroom]] in each of the 30 stories instead of 30 classrooms on one floor.&lt;ref name="Pilot"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Pilot |series=Wayside |credits=Derevlany, John &amp; Oliver, Lin (concept); Durante, Ricardo |network=[[Teletoon]] |airdate=2005-11-15 |season=01|number=00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the books, there are actually 29 floors in the school; the imaginary 19th floor is inhabited by the imaginary Miss Zarves. The series revolves around a new student at the school, named Todd, and his adventures adapting to life as a student at the top floor of Wayside School.

At Wayside, every floor appears to have lockers, stairs, classrooms, doors, and light fixtures. The first floor contains the principal's office;&lt;ref name="MVN"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Myron vs. Normy |series=Wayside |credits=Derevlany, John; Durante, Ricardo |network=Teletoon |airdate=2007-04-21 |season=01 |number=6A}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school campgrounds,&lt;ref name="Mrs. Gorf"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mrs. Gorf |series=Wayside |credits=Derevlany, John; Durante, Ricardo |network=Teletoon |airdate=2007-05-19 |season=01 |number=10B}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sixteenth floor contains the faculty lounge and pool;&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; the fifteenth  floor contains the cafeteria and kitchen;&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; the (technically nonexistent) nineteenth floor contains a chute blocked by wooden boards, which is rumoured to be the classroom of the legendary Ms. Zarves; and the thirtieth floor contains Mrs. Jewls' classroom.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt;

Every floor also appears to be a different colour. To add to the school's Escher-esque style, all of the features of the floors—doors, lockers, stairs, etc.—are placed in very unusual ways, as seen in the Escher artwork, ''Relativity''. All of the floors' features are either right-side up, upside-down, sideways, or suspended high above the floor, as seen with several lockers.

==Characters==
{{See also|Wayside School (book series)#Characters}}
The main characters are Todd (voiced by [[Michael Cera]] in the pilot; [[Mark Rendall]] in the series), a transfer student who attends Mrs. Jewls's class on the thirtieth floor and struggles to adapt and conform to Wayside's offbeat academic structure, but is often picked on at school and gets sent home early on the kindergarten bus for doing nothing wrong; Maurecia (Denise Oliver), a tomboy who wears roller skates and has an enormous crush on Todd; Dana (Lisa Ng), Wayside's resident overachiever who obsessively maintains the school's rules and acts as Myron's campaign manager and best friend; and Myron (Martin Villafana), an overweight and self-centred student who wishes to become class president.

The main members of the school faculty are Mrs. Jewls ([[Kathy Najimy]] in the pilot; [[Kathleen Laskey]] in the series), Todd's scatterbrained yet endearing teacher who mistakes Todd as a monkey and frequently punishes him for talking, resulting of him being sent home early on the kindergarten bus; Mr. Kidswatter (Kedar Brown), the uptight and eccentric school principal who does not like doors, as he calls them ''goozacks'', and does not care for the students, as he calls them the What-cha-ma-call-its and only refers to Todd as "334 South Fair View"; Louis ([[Sergio Di Zio]]), the relaxed, friendly yard teacher at Wayside who is the most popular person at Wayside; and Ms. Mush ([[Jayne Eastwood]]), the [[Eastern European]] head chef of the school cafeteria and nurse who is best known for her wisecracking personality and horrible cooking skills.

Supporting students in Mrs. Jewls' class include, Shari (Lisa Ng), a female student who wears a smoky purple hooded jacket, and frequently sleeps in class; Stephen ([[Terry McGurrin]]), a boy who dresses like an elf for Halloween everyday; Jenny (Denise Oliver), a female student who has fabulous blonde hair, is a stunt performer, and dresses in an Evel Knievel-esque; John (Terry McGurrin), a boy who is upside down, and comes from a family of upside down inventors and scientists; Joe (Peter Oldring), a student who has a large, orange afro; the Three Erics (Terry McGurrin, Peter Oldring, Ricky Collins), three students with similar attire that typically do activities in unison; Bebe (Denise Oliver), a female student who is a master artist; Leslie (Lisa Ng), a female student who performs tasks with her long pigtails and usually looks angry; Rondi (Denise Oliver), a rather large girl who's almost always happy; and DeeDee (Denise Oliver) who wears a purple dress and has lemon-coloured hair.

Minor members of the school faculty are Mrs. Gorf ([[Julie Lemieux]]), a substitute teacher for Mrs. Jewls who had the ability to transform her students into apples before being transformed into one herself by Maurecia; Le Chef (Peter Oldring), the former French chef in the teacher's lounge who was to be appointed cafeteria chef in place of Ms. Mush but was later evicted from the school due to his obnoxious demeanour; Mr. Blunderbuss (Dwayne Hill), the adventurous fourteenth-floor teacher who often goes on hunting safaris throughout worldwide jungles; and Miss Zarves, the nonexistent teacher on the nonexistent nineteenth floor.

He is assigned tries to Mrs. Jewls' class on the 30th floor, where he attempts to fit in with the class, usually with mixed results. However, due to his failure to cope with the school's unorthodox system of learning, Mrs. Jewls writes his name on the chalkboard and puts a check mark next to it.

The teacher threatens that he will be sent home on the kindergarten bus. The class is about to be crushed by the trash compactor that was accidentally on the 30th floor and the machine would work every time the PA comes on, Todd's outbursts start, and Mrs. Jewls writes his name under the word "discipline" and sends him home on the kindergarten bus.

Mrs. Jewls and her class play [[dodgeball]], and Principal Kidswatter tags Todd and is finally tagged. Mrs. Jewls pronounces Dana as class president. While Todd is sent home again on the kindergarten bus after he does more outbursts to Mrs. Jewls, the trash compactor is on again. Dana cries and tells Mrs. Jewls that she herself is the worst class president. Todd, however, has snuck outside Mrs. Jewls' classroom, and tells Maurecia and Mrs. Jewls and the students that he has to get them out.

Meanwhile, Todd saves them from being crushed by the trash compactor that was accidentally on the 30th floor and the machine would work every time the PA comes on. Finally, Myron has found the emergency shutoff. Back in Mrs. Jewls' class, Dana gives Todd a new desk, and Todd throws it out, thinking it would truly make him a fellow Waysider, and it does.

When Dana loses her voice and Myron takes over, the Erics take her to the nurse ("''Miss Mush"'') and things in Wayside go out of control (including Fluffy coming after Stephen, Maurecia trying to punch Todd, Jenny is wearing a basket on her head, and upside down John's two feet punching each other). Dana's voice is restored, and she confronts Myron. She ends up canceling the show, and tells the people to ignore all the advice they received, much to Myron's chagrin. After yelling at Dana, Myron loses his voice, while Todd and Maurecia and the class are listening to Dana saying what Myron will do.

==Home release==
In 2007, the pilot episode of ''Wayside'' was released and branded as ''Wayside: The Movie''. The first season excluding the pilot was released on August 29, 2008 under the title ''Wayside School: Season 1''.&lt;ref name="DVDW1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Wayside-Season-1/7905|title=Wayside&amp;nbsp;— Season 1|accessdate=2010-08-13|publisher=TV Shows on DVD.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204122522/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Wayside-Season-1/7905|archivedate=2011-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Wayside'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. David Cornelius of ''[[DVD Talk]]'' described it as "a clever, often hilarious little show that demands a larger audience", praising the series' scripts and dialogue as "delight[ed] in mixing absurd humour with fond grade school memories."&lt;ref name="dvdtalk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34492/wayside-school-season-one/|title=Wayside School&amp;nbsp;— Season One|last=Cornelius|first=David|date=2008-08-30|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Arsenau of ''[[DVD Verdict]]'' stated "The most satisfying part of ''Wayside'' is how the show feels perfectly balanced—it has enough wacky antics and bizarre events to satisfy young audiences, enough logical fallacies and defiant attitudes to amuse middle-aged kids, and enough clever and sardonic wit to please adults fortunate enough to find themselves in front of a television set while the show is playing," concluding that ''Wayside'' was "the perfect cartoon adventure for families of all ages."&lt;ref name="DVD Verdict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/waysideschoolseason1.php.php|title=Wayside School: Season One|last=Arsenau|first=Adam|date=2008-08-10|work=DVD Verdict|accessdate=2010-08-13|df=}}{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the series also drew criticism for its differences to the ''Wayside School'' books on which it was based. Alyse Wax of ''[[Blogcritics]]'' negatively compared the animated series to the books which inspired it, stating that "the series 'doesn't have the magic that the books had,' and noting that while the books provided 'wacky, silly, with odd, funny, almost-realistic-but-not-quite characters', viewers get no such character development from the animation, and expanded that while the show is shared from an adult perspective, it is not meant to be enjoyed by parents and kids" watching it together, being "geared towards younger kids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/tv-review-wayside-on-nickelodeon/page-2/|title=TV Review: Wayside on Nickelodeon|last=Wax|first=Alyse|date=July 18, 2007|work=[[Blogcritics]]|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna Weiss of ''[[Boston Globe]]'' offered that while viewers familiar with the character development in the book series will see that the animated series "understandably, dispenses with the nuance in favour of kid-friendly slapstick and goofy conceptual jokes", the children and parents who have not previously encountered the books "won't know what they're missing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2007/06/25/wayside_skips_the_nuance_but_not_the_fun/|title='Wayside' skips the nuance, but not the fun|last=Weiss|first=Joanna|date=June 25, 2007|work=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael P. Dougherty II of ''Fulve Drive-In'' gave a negative assessment of the series, describing it as "a disgrace to the novels" and believed it "totally strips away any intelligence or meaning they had." Dougherty also criticized the series' "total lack of ingenuity," and "coupled with the fact that it tainted the book series name makes this an awful, no good animated series."&lt;ref name="Fulvue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulvuedrive-in.com/review/7374/Wayside+School+Season+One+Nickelodeon+DVD+|title=Wayside School&amp;nbsp;— Season One (Nickelodeon DVD)|last=Dougherty|first=Michael P. II|work=Fulvue Drive-In|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Sachar]], creator of the original ''Wayside School'' books on which the show was based, reportedly disliked ''Wayside'', though he did like its animation style.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090602135531/http://www.freewebs.com/juliesdrawings/wayside.htm#194855611&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and nominations===
In 2008, ''Wayside'' received a nomination for "Best TV Series for Children" at the 2008 Cartoons on the Bay award ceremony.&lt;ref name="nelvana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelvana.com/company/awards.asp|title=Nelvana.com : Company : Awards Received|publisher=[[Nelvana]]|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from the books==
There are a number of notable differences between ''Wayside'' and the ''Wayside School'' books. For example, in the series, a large number of changes were made to the character of Todd; in the book series, he is not a transfer student, although two transfer students appeared the book chronology, namely Sue and Benjamin Nushmutt. However, neither Sue nor Benjamin appear in the series, and Todd instead appears to take the latter's role as "new kid".&lt;ref name="DVD Dizzy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/waysidethemovie.html|title=Wayside: The Movie DVD Review|work=DVD Dizzy|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|author=Gutierrez, Albert|date=2007-09-23|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maurecia's personality also diverges from that of the series—in the books, she is normal girl with a love for ice cream who is never mentioned nor depicted to wear roller skates and is almost always featured with her best friend Joy, who never appears in the series.&lt;ref name="DVD Dizzy"/&gt;

==Arabic dub==
Wayside was also dubbed in 2017 by [[Venus Centre]] called ''يوميات مدرسية'' (School Diary) and aired on [[Spacetoon]] from August 6, 2017 to March 31, 2018. It has several changes from the English cartoon apart from the language. It has some removed features, colored legs on girls, improper translation, name changes to most characters, an extended theme song, the tunes are off and many more changes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/HeroesVenusST/photos/a.1405015856403486.1073741828.1404975229740882/1892292344342499/?type=3 |title=ترقبوا قريباً عمل جديد على #سبيستون خلال شهر اغسطس بإذن الله وإليكم أوقات العرض. |publisher=[[Facebook]] |date=2017-07-30 |accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whitewashing''' is a casting practice in the [[cinema of the United States|film industry of the United States]] in which [[white people|white]] actors are cast in historically non-white character roles or in roles which are scripted for non-white characters. The film industry has a history of frequently casting white actors for roles about [[people of color|non-white characters]]. By downplaying the roles that such figures have had in cultural events, the practice is seen as a form of censorship analogous to the [[whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing of criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kollaboration.org/6279/last-week-tonight-asks-how-is-hollywood-whitewashing-still-a-thing/|title=Last Week Tonight asks how is Hollywood whitewashing still a thing|first=Frankie|last=Victoria|publisher=Kollaboration|date=February 24, 2016|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luisalcazarrwsenglish.weebly.com/biased-media---general-analysis-final-draft|title=Biased Media &amp;mdash; General Analysis|author=Luis Roberto Alcazar|publisher=Diversity in Cinema|date=May 12, 2015|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 20th century, white actors caricatured different races by wearing [[blackface]] or [[yellowface]], commonly exaggerating the perceived stereotypes of other races. Whitewashing can also occur by casting white characters into historical or source roles that are originally for people of color.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/breakfast-at-tiffany-hellboy-hollywood-whitewashing-a7932581.html|title=From Breakfast at Tiffany’s to Hellboy: The ongoing problem of Hollywood whitewashing|last=Tierney|first=Dolores|date=|website=Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example of whitewashing with blackface appears in DW Griffith’s ''Birth of a Nation'' (1915), where white actors painted their faces to play prominent black characters. This decision to have white actors play Black characters remains important to the timeline of whitewashing, as this film is now revered by white supremacists for its portrayal of the Klu Klux Klan against the black community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another example of early whitewashing occurred when white actor [[Warner Oland]] played the Chinese detective [[Charlie Chan]] in ''[[Charlie Chan Carries On (film)|Charlie Chan Carries On]]'' (1931) and subsequent films. Because of the lack of actors of color in the film industry, the only representation for non-white communities would be through white actors.&lt;ref name="scherker" /&gt; Films became more [[racial integration|racially integrated]] by the mid 20th-century, and blackface mostly disappeared from the film industry. The film ''[[Othello (1965 British film)|Othello]]'' (1965) was an exception, as the white actor [[Laurence Olivier]] was cast as "the Moor." He wore blackface as the title character. Other, more modern, exceptions include ''[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]'' and ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' in which blackface is played solely for comedic effect.

The practice of "yellowface" extended into the 1960s. For instance, [[Mickey Rooney]] played a Japanese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Weiler |first=A.H. |title=The Screen: Breakfast at Tiffany's: Audrey Hepburn Stars in Music Hall Comedy |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 6, 1961 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A05EED9173AE13ABC4E53DFB667838A679EDE |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; landlord in ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961).&lt;ref name="scherker" /&gt; Professor David A. Schlossman said of Asian characters in particular, "Many of the Asian roles portrayed by White actors also contributed to the pantheon of racial stereotypes in US national discourse."&lt;ref name="schlossman" /&gt;  Latino communities also faced whitewashing well into the late 1950s and 1960s, with ''West Side Story'' (1961) casting Natalie Wood as the lead Latina character.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Companion to Media and Race|last=Sim|first=Gerald|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317695820|location=New York, NY|pages=115-125|chapter=Race and the Cinematic "Machine"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Charlton Heston played a Mexican police officer in ''Touch of Evil'' (1958), where his physical appearance was altered to have curly hair and a darker complexion.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/breakfast-at-tiffany-hellboy-hollywood-whitewashing-a7932581.html|title=From Breakfast at Tiffany’s to Hellboy: The ongoing problem of Hollywood whitewashing|last=Tierney|first=Dolores|date=|website=Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guy Aoki]] said [[African American]]s "have long felt the full brunt of the 'whitewashing' of roles" and that [[Asian people|Asian]]s have experienced it as well.&lt;ref name="brook" /&gt; [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have also had their historic leaders and warriors portrayed by whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Julia|first=Boyd,|date=January 1, 2015|title=An Examination of Native Americans in Film and Rise of Native Filmmakers|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1130/an-examination-of-native-americans-in-film-and-rise-of-native-filmmakers|publisher=|volume=6|issue=1|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 21st century, minorities were still under-represented in the film industry at different stages. While historically black roles are now generally cast with black actors, the practice of whitewashing applied to other minorities.&lt;ref name="scherker" /&gt; 

The main reason that whitewashing occurred - and still occurs today - is that “whiteness” appears as a norm in cinema, where narratives do not recognize white characters as part of the race structure, but heavily emphasize non-white characters’ races in order to label them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=White Out: The Continuing Significance of Racism|last=Andersen|first=Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415935822|editor-last=Doane|editor-first=Ashley|location=New York, NY|pages=21-34|chapter=Whitewashing Race: A Critical Perspective on Whiteness|editor-last2=Bonilla-Silva|editor-first2=Eduardo}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary example of heightening other races, in contrast to white characters, is seen during the production for ''The Ridiculous Six'' (2015), where Native American actors had features darkened by makeup to “solidify” their race.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Companion to Media and Race|last=Sim|first=Gerald|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317695820|location=New York, NY|pages=115-125|chapter=Race and the Cinematic "Machine"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also happened in ''Three Godfathers'' (1948), where actor Pedro Armendáriz spoke in a Mexican accent, as well as hyperbolic gestures, to convey his Mexican race on screen.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/breakfast-at-tiffany-hellboy-hollywood-whitewashing-a7932581.html|title=From Breakfast at Tiffany’s to Hellboy: The ongoing problem of Hollywood whitewashing|last=Tierney|first=Dolores|date=|website=Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than allowing the actors of color to depict their own cultures, films resort to reinforcing negative stereotypes of non-white races to further divide the two communities.

== Role of executives ==
The [[BBC]] said in 2015, "The practice of casting white actors in non-white roles is still prevalent in Hollywood – despite widespread condemnation and protest." A report in 2013 showed that 94% of film executives were white and that non-white people were under-represented as filmmakers and actors. The BBC explored two reasons for the casting practice: [[institutional racism]] and producers believing that well-known white actors attract more audiences and maximize profits. [[Thomas Rothman]], the chairman of [[Sony Pictures]] said, "I guess there's a certain institutional force and memory that exists out there... I think the industry's improving but I certainly agree with those who say we haven't come far enough fast enough."&lt;ref name="brook" /&gt;

Jeffery Mio, author of ''Multicultural Psychology: Understanding Our Diverse Communities'', hypothesizes that the film industry, mostly white, hires people of similar backgrounds. Mio said of the rationale that only the most qualified actors are cast, "That's the argument that directors and casting directors make, but a lot of times ethnic actors will tell us that when they say we're just choosing the best actor, they mean we're choosing our friends, or people we're used to."&lt;ref name="brook" /&gt; Craig Detweiler, professor of film history at [[Pepperdine University]], said, "There are a shortage {{sic}} of African American, Asian and Latino stars.

== Whitewashing and cultural appropriation==


Cultural appropriation, is the adoption of aspects of a minority culture by individuals in a dominant culture. Considering the historic and modern colonialism and oppression that has existed on a global scale, cultural appropriation allows for the reinforcement of white dominance. This act of dominant cultures subordinating minority groups is manifested in various avenues and in modern society, one of which is film. According to a study by the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 2016, only five percent of speaking roles go to Asian-Americans, and they are only given only one percent of lead roles in film, while white actors account for 76.2 percent of lead roles. “Whitewashing is a metaphor used to explain how the achievements and cultural milestones made by people of color have historically been erased and appropriated by the white population. Since as early as the 1930s, Hollywood has made white actors portray people of color in films, such as “Charlie Chan Carries On” (1931), in which a middle-aged Asian man is portrayed by Warner Oland, a white actor, and “Cleopatra” (1963), in which Elizabeth Taylor, a white actress, played the Egyptian queen Cleopatra,” said Jesse Wang with ''The Emory Wheel.'' 

In 2017, [[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|''Ghost in the Shell'']], which is based on the S[[Seinen manga|einen Manga]] [[Ghost in the Shell (manga)|''Ghost in the Shell'']] by [[Masamune Shirow]], provoked disputes related to the topic of whitewashing. The role of [[Motoko Kusanagi]], which was intended to be played by a Japanese character, was instead appointed to a white actress, [[Scarlett Johansson]].The fact that a white person was casted as an asian was viewed and considered to be [[cultural appropriation]]. It was also deemed as offensive by many, given that white actors are often viewed as more popular and profitable in the media. Scarlett Johansson then responded by stating that her character is "identity-less.” In addition to this,  the spokesperson for [[Kodansha]] and Sam Yoshiba, the publisher of ''Ghost in the Shell'', told [[The Hollywood Reporter|''The Hollywood Reporter'']], "She has the [[cyberpunk]] feel. And we never imagined it would be a Japanese actress in the first place." Asians, and minorities in general, are highly underrepresented in film and the failure of directors and producers to address their appropriation of cultures is offensive to many.

Another aspect of the controversial topic of cultural appropriation in film is the idea that because most modern cinema is directed and produced by caucasian men, films portraying people of color are often inaccurate and told from the wrong perspective. “At a time when arguments about race, gender and authorial power have roiled the literary and art worlds, cinema has inched toward establishing what might be a set of best practices for white artists representing realities outside their immediate purview”, states Ann Hornaday from ''The Washington Post''. This idea reflects the belief that in a industry predominantly dominated by a specific race, often times, opposing cultures, religions, races, and viewpoints are left out or misrepresented.

== Anti-whitewashing campaigns ==
[[Watchdog journalism|Media watchdog groups]] have sought more authentic representations on screen, taking issue with casting decisions such as actor [[Johnny Depp]] as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (2013).&lt;ref name="brook" /&gt; With films from the United States receiving promotion in more global markets, the groups argue for roles that represent the diversity of audiences, who are seeking more authenticity. [[SAG-AFTRA]]'s David White demurred on groups' opposition to casting white actors in non-white roles, "The laws insist that one's race not be part of the qualifications for a job," but he recognized that there was a lack of diversity in roles available.&lt;ref name="brook" /&gt; Law professor John Tehranian said, "Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with race-blind casting, as long as it works both ways. But in reality, it never has; one rarely sees, for example, an African American, Latino, or Asian actor cast as a white character."&lt;ref name="tehranian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/are-asian-american-movie-stars-890755|title=Where Are the Asian-American Movie Stars?|publisher=|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of whitewashing in film have argued that those responsible for casting movies—industry executives, producers, and casting agents, for example—tend to prefer casting actors who are dominantly white.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nishime|first=LeiLani|date=2017|title=Whitewashing yellow futures in Ex Machina, Cloud Atlas, and Advantageous: gender, labor, and technology in sci-fi film|url=|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|volume=|pages=29-49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have criticized those film makers for operating under the idea that audiences are incapable of accepting stars of colors, especially Asian American stars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Critics have also said the use of yellow face, or the when white people play Asian characters, is dehumanizing to Asian Americans since when people view a white person portraying a person of color, they detach from, say, what a real Asian American’s experience may be, and instead follow the stereotypes set up by white people.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also, it is said that even when filmmakers create roles that are not targeted towards any specific race, white people are still typically cast, which is a form of whitewashing itself.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dave|first=Shilpa|date=2017|title=Racial Accents, Hollywood Casting, and Asian American Studies|url=|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=|pages=142-147|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also argued that when ethnic roles are required in film, white writers will exaggerate racial characteristics, like an accent.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Black film critics examine black people are represented in media, and even the absence of black characters in film, and intend to draw attention to how those representations contribute to the persistence of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reich|first=Elizabeth|date=2016|title=The Power of Black Film Criticism|url=|journal=Film Criticism|volume=|pages=1-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe the impact that film has had on how power is perceived through images of power set up by film.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They examine how, for example, seeing white people in power on screen affects how people view power in general.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ultimately, their message is that today’s society is still shaped by institutional racism, and whitewashing in film is one of the structures that contribute to that culture.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

So we would have loved to say to the world, 'Look, here's a hell of a woman, and she's black,' but in those days you simply couldn't do it, and not because the talent wasn't there—there were at least a half-dozen powerhouse black actresses who could have played that role.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11911">'''Wien-Film GmbH''' ("Vienna Film Limited") was a large [[Austria]]n film company, which in 1938 succeeded the [[Sascha-Film|Tobis-Sascha-Filmindustrie AG]] (Sascha Film Company) and lasted until 1985. Until 1945 the business was owned by the '''Cautio Trust Company''' (''Cautio Treuhandgesellschaft''), a subsidiary of the [[Germany|German]] ''[[Reichsfilmkammer]]'', and was responsible for almost the entire production of films in the territory of the [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]], as Austria was called at that time.

== History ==
The German [[Anschluss]] of Austria in 1938 put an end to the country's independent film production. The German-Austrian Tobis-Sascha-Filmindustrie AG, which had already been sold, under pressure, to the Cautio Trust Company, was transformed on 16 December into '''Wien-Film'''.

The new company was officially presented with a new mission statement, signed by [[Joseph Goebbels]]: "In competition with the other arts, the purpose of film is to give form to what satisfies human hearts and what makes them shudder, and by the revelation of the eternal, transports them into better worlds."&lt;ref&gt;"Wetteifernd mit den übrigen Künsten soll der Film gestalten, was Menschenherzen erfüllt und erbeben läßt, und sie durch Offenbarung des Ewigen in bessere Welten entrückt".&lt;/ref&gt; The company's expected propaganda function was thus made unmistakably clear. Jews had been forbidden to work in the Austrian film industry since 1935, as the German ''Reichsfilmkammer'' had threatened to ban the import of Austrian films unless the industry kept to German terms.

In the drama films produced by the new company Austrian themes dominated, typified by the standard Viennese light romantic comedy, the ''[[Wiener Film]]'', lavish in music, costumes and sets, &lt;!--ausstattungsträchtige--&gt;which mostly portrayed past times in rosy hues. From 1943/44, Wien-Film also made [[colour film]]s, a privilege previously restricted to the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] company. Wien-Film also produced cultural films.

Besides the production of dramas and cultural films, Wien-Film concentrated on the management of [[movie theater|cinema]]s. Across Austria, the company owned 14 cinemas in [[Vienna]], [[Berndorf, Lower Austria|Berndorf]], [[Linz]], [[Steyr]] and [[Steyrermühl]]. The Vienna cinemas were the "Scala", the "Apollo", the "Busch" and the "UFA-Ton", which were used for premieres. Wien-Film also ran the cinemas formerly owned by KIBA (''Wiener Kinobetriebsanstalt'') and UFA, under the newly established ''Ostmärkische Filmtheater Betriebsgesellschaft m.b.H.'' ("Ostmark Film Theatre Company Ltd").

The film production programme laid down by Berlin was to make films that were rooted in the soil of the Ostmark and provided distraction, in line with the government slogan ''[[Kraft durch Freude]]'' ("Strength Through Joy").

After the end of [[World War II]], Wien-Film was confiscated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as "German property". After Vienna had been divided up into [[History of Vienna#Second republic|five zones of occupation]] it became apparent that the film studios in [[Sievering]] and the main offices in Siebensterngasse came under the [[United States|American]] administration, but that the film workshops at [[Rosenhügel]] were in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet]] sector. The [[Sievering Studios|Sievering film studios]], it was believed, were to be liquidated by the Americans, in the interests of eliminating all possible competition to [[Hollywood]] productions.

At the end of 1945, the former head of Vienna film production, [[Karl Hartl]], was nominated the industry's business leader. While the Soviets, according to the provisions of the [[Potsdam Agreement]], took over all former "German" businesses as war reparations, the western occupying powers - [[Great Britain]], the [[United States]] and [[France]] - waived their rights in this regard. For the newly refounded Wien-Film, this meant that they could continue work at the studios in Sievering and [[Schloss Schönbrunn|Schönbrunn]], but had to write off the studios and workshops at Rosenhügel. These were incorporated into [[:de:USIA|USIA]], the Soviet body responsible for administering Austrian assets as war reparations, and operated from then on as ''"Wien-Film am Rosenhügel"''.

On 21 August 1945, Wien-Film and the State Department for Reconstruction (''Staatsamt für Wiederaufbau'') signed a contract for a documentary about the restoration works in Vienna.

After the [[Austrian State Treaty]] of 1955, the company passed into state ownership. Since the returns on production and the renting out of the studios were becoming less and less profitable, Wien-Film was wound up as a state company in 1985, leaving only a small holding company to maintain rights over earlier productions.

== Personnel ==
The first directors of Wien-Film were general director [[Fritz Hirt]], [[Paul Hach]] and the Viennese film director [[Karl Hartl]], who also remained chief of production right to the end. The making of cultural films was under the direction of Dr. [[Josef Lebzelter]] of the former ''Selenophon-Film'' company. Overall control of film productions – from the initial idea to the screening - was the responsibility of the ''Reichsfilmdramaturg'' and later the ''Reichsfilmintendant''.

The first board meeting took place on 16 December 1938, at which the advisers were also appointed. These were:

* Friedrich Merten, Chief Executive of [[Film-Finanz]], Berlin
* Dr. Josef Joham, board member of the [[Creditanstalt]], Vienna
* [[Willi Forst]], film director, Vienna
* [[Carl Froelich]], film director and president of the ''Reichsfilmkammer'', Berlin
* Dr. [[Karl Ott]], ''Ministerialdirektor'', Berlin
* Hermann Burmeister, ''Ministerialrat'', Berlin
* Heinrich Post, bank director, Berlin

The stars of Wien-Film until 1945 were [[Wolf Albach-Retty]], [[Elfriede Datzig]], [[Marte Harell]], [[Hans Holt]], [[Olly Holzmann]], [[Attila Hörbiger]], [[Paul Hörbiger]], [[Winnie Markus]], [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]], [[Rudolf Prack]], [[Jane Tilden]] and [[Paula Wessely]].

The directors most used by Wien-Film were [[Gustav Ucicky]], experienced in getting across [[National Socialist]] propaganda content, and [[E. W. Emo]], who between them produced a third of Wien-Film's 60 or so drama films. Not far behind them in productivity were [[Willi Forst]], who was responsible for the best productions of this period, [[Géza von Bolváry]] and [[Hans Thimig]], followed by the brothers  [[Ernst Marischka|Ernst]] and [[Hubert Marischka]], as well as [[Géza von Cziffra]], who with ''[[Der weiße Traum]]'' ("The White Dream") achieved the most commercially successful of Wien-Film's productions.

The most frequently used [[cameramen]] were [[Günther Anders (cinematographer)|Günther Anders]], [[Georg Bruckbauer]], [[Hans Schneeberger]] and [[Jaroslaw Tuzar]]. Wien-Film's principal composers were [[Anton Profes]] and [[Willy Schmidt-Gentner]]. [[Erich von Neusser]] and [[Fritz Podehl]] were producers.

== Studios ==
For premises the only two large studio complexes in Austria - the former [[Sascha-Film]] studios in [[Sievering]] and the former [[Vita-Film]] workshops at [[Rosenhügel Film Studios|Rosenhügel]] - were acquired. In addition to these, there was also the small workshop formerly belonging to [[Wiener Kunstfilm]] in the ''Bauernmarkt'' in the [[Innere Stadt]]  and another small studio in [[Schönbrunn (Vienna)|Schönbrunn]].

In the three years between 1939 and 1941 next to the Rosenhügel Studios a [[Sound film|synchronisation]] complex was built, with a large and a small synchronisation hall, [[cutting room]]s and offices.

== Film productions ==
Between 1939 and 1945, fifty films were made. There were also a number of delegated productions, which were carried out under the names of [[Forst-Film]], [[Emo-Film]], and [[Styria-Film]].
