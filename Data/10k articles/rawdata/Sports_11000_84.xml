The ban on kite flying around the festival period in [[Pakistan]] imposed due to use of dangerous, life-threatening substances in the strings, was set to be lifted to enable celebrations to take place in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;DND.com (02.01.2017) Basant to be celebrated in Lahore after security clearance: Minister [http://www.dnd.com.pk/basant-to-be-celebrated-in-lahore-after-security-clearance-minister/123321]&lt;/ref&gt; But as of 7 February 2017, the ban will continue.&lt;ref&gt;PT (07.02.2017) Punjab govt says ‘NO’ to Basant festival[http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/02/07/punjab-govt-says-no-to-basant-festival/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Nawa-i-Waqt]], a Pakistani daily opposed Basant Panchami celebrations in Pakistan, arguing that the festival celebrated [[Haqiqat Rai]]'s insult of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/editorial/16-Feb-2004/editorial-can-t-we-have-a-nice-time|title=EDITORIAL: Can't we have a nice time?|date=2004-02-16|newspaper=Daily Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Choa Chu Kang Stadium''' (also known as the '''CCK Stadium''') is part of the Choa Chu Kang Sports and Recreation complex located in [[Choa Chu Kang]], [[Singapore]].  The international competition standard, multi-sport facility supports a range of [[sports]] and community functions, and opened in the year 2001. The main grandstand has a capacity of 4,268 people.

The [[stadium]] itself is home to [[Singapore Armed Forces FC]]/[[Warriors FC]] during the [[S-league]] [[football (soccer)|football]] season. The stadium has become familiar for its elegant and soaring curved white steel roof, with supporting pylons, that covers the main grandstand.

==Facility==
The [[football (soccer)|football]] pitch itself consists of a self-watering "cell-system" turf pitch installation, supplied from Switzerland and approved by [[FIFA]] for international competition.   

Other international competition standard facilities surrounding the stadium include a 50m Olympic swimming pool, a running track and athletics facilities, and a sports hall supporting indoor sports and activities.   

The public can also access further outdoor facilities, such as [[tennis]] courts, petanque sandpits, street soccer pitches, as well as indoor facilities, including [[basketball]] and [[badminton]] courts, a [[gym]] and a [[dance]] training room. 

The [[Singapore Sports Council]] operated Sports Complex also caters to local community recreational needs, with a range of fun-oriented pools, including a wave pool, waterslide, bubble pools, children's play pools.   

A range of food outlets as of 2018, [[KFC]] and [[Pizza Hut]] previously occupied by Guiling Garden Restaurant&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hungrygowhere.com/singapore/guilin_garden_restaurant/&lt;/ref&gt; , a childcare center, a sporting goods shop, and comfortable, relaxing public spaces help make this a community friendly sports and recreation facility.

==Awards==
Identified as an exemplary community and competition sports facility in Singapore, the Choa Chu Kang Sport Complex and Stadium won a [[Singapore Institute of Architects]] Merit Award in 2002, and a CIDB Construction Excellence Award in 2003.  The design was cited in particular for its exciting entry experience, public concourse, and use of colour, and is a representative example of the work of the [[architect]] [[Alex Ford]], working through the local Singaporean practice [[Elton-Roade]].

==Transport==

==History==

===Construction===

In a news conference on July 27, 2010, [[Tavo Hellmund]] announced plans to build the track on about {{convert|890|acre|km2}} of undeveloped land in southeastern [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]]. The majority of the site had been planned to be developed into a residential [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] called "Wandering Creek".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Future F1 site revealed |url=http://www.statesman.com/business/future-f1-site-revealed-825045.html |first=Shonda |last=Novak |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |date=July 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w72dpOEj?url=http://www.statesman.com/business/future-f1-site-revealed-825045.html |archivedate=January 30, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same news conference, Hellmund also revealed that Texas billionaire [[Red McCombs]] was the project's largest investor. McCombs wished to call the site "Speed City",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Red McCombs named investor in Austin Formula One project |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/investigative/entries/2010/07/27/red_mccombs_named_investor_in.html |first=John |last=Maher |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |date=July 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w72nEmmT?url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/investigative/entries/2010/07/27/red_mccombs_named_investor_in.html |archivedate=January 30, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the owners originally anticipated selling the naming rights to various parts of the facility for $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dexheimer |first=Eric |title=How much would Austin F1 track be worth in naming rights? |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2010/08/23/how_much_would_austin_f1_track.html?cxntfid=blogs_formula_austin |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |date=August 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012145122/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2010/08/23/how_much_would_austin_f1_track.html/?cxntfid=blogs_formula_austin |archivedate=October 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2011, the track's name was announced as "Circuit of the Americas" at a press conference.&lt;ref name="COTA"/&gt;
The circuit [[homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] design was submitted to the FIA in [[Geneva]] for approval on December 17, 2010. [[HKS, Inc.]] and [[Hermann Tilke|Tilke Engineers &amp; Architects]] designed the track and Austin Commercial, a subsidiary of Austin Industries, was the [[general contractor]]. Construction began on December 31, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction begins at new US GP venue|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/88785|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|work=Autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=December 31, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was due to be complete by June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Formula 1 groundbreaking date released|url=http://www.kxan.com/dpp/sports/formula-1-groundbreaking-date-released|first=Josh|last=Hinkle|work=KXAN|date=July 19, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yo5h1HBs?url=http://www.kxan.com/dpp/sports/formula-1-groundbreaking-date-released|archivedate=May 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[Circuit of the Americas#Breach of contract and reinstatement|stop-work order]] in December 2011, the completion date was revised to August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/97091 |title=Austin F1 track set for August completion | work=Autosport | date=January 19, 2012 |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tasks were building the [[silt]] fences, taking [[core sample]]s, and shredding existing vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work starts on Austin track |url=http://supersport.com/motorsport/formula1/news/101231/Work_starts_on_Austin_track |work=SuperSport.com |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w7PUzSw2?url=http://supersport.com/motorsport/formula1/news/101231/Work_starts_on_Austin_track |archivedate=January 30, 2011 |date=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2011, a $900,000 check was posted with Travis County that permitted [[Land grading|grading]] to begin. The money was to be used to restore the land if the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) declined to allow the project to move forward because part of the site lies in a [[floodplain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dexheimer |first=Eric |title=F1 to start moving dirt soon |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2011/01/24/f1_can_soon_start_moving_dirt.html?cxntfid=blogs_formula_austin |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |date=January 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012145148/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2011/01/24/f1_can_soon_start_moving_dirt.html/?cxntfid=blogs_formula_austin |archivedate=October 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA issued a letter on June 28, 2011, stating the project meets its floodplain management criteria.

In January 2012, Travis County announced that Elroy Road—one of the two primary public access roads to the circuit—would receive an upgrade to handle the volume of incoming traffic, but not before the running of the 2012 race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elroy Road to be widened, but not before first F1 race|url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/elroy-road-to-be-widened-but-not-before-2091924.html|first=Ben|last=Wear|work=Austin-American Statesman|date=January 9, 2012|accessdate=January 11, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113114437/http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/elroy-road-to-be-widened-but-not-before-2091924.html|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement, the unstable clay soils under the road surface had caused Elroy Road to gradually buckle and shift, necessitating the upgrade.

On June 13, 2012, [[Charlie Whiting]]—the FIA-appointed Race Director for Formula One—declared himself satisfied with the circuit's construction, scheduling a final pre-race inspection of the circuit for September 25, sixty days before the first race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlie Whiting happy with Circuit de the Americas' progress|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/100332|work=Autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=June 13, 2012|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the circuit later passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Adam|title=Whiting Says COTA Ready For Formula One|url=http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-charlie-whiting-says-cota-ready-for-formula-one|work=SPEED Channel|publisher=Fox Sports|date=September 26, 2012|accessdate=September 26, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927054757/http://formula-one.speedtv.com/article/f1-charlie-whiting-says-cota-ready-for-formula-one|archivedate=September 27, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Plaza, Observation Structure, Tower Amphitheater, and Main Grandstand were designed by Austin-based architectural firm Miró Rivera Architects.

===City endorsement and lawsuit===
In order for the race to take place, the [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] city council was asked to be the sponsoring municipality for the event. Through being a sponsor, the city could apply for money from a state fund, the Major Events Trust Fund (METF), designed to attract major sporting events to [[Texas]] that would be used to pay the Formula One race sanctioning fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Austin council delays vote on whether to endorse F1|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-council-delays-vote-on-whether-to-endorse-1559215.html|first=Marty|last=Toohey|work=Statesman.com|publisher=American Statesman|date=June 23, 2011|accessdate=June 25, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628000227/http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austin-council-delays-vote-on-whether-to-endorse-1559215.html|archivedate=June 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This matter was complicated by opponents of the project who filed a lawsuit against [[Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts|state comptroller]] [[Susan Combs]], claiming that she had promised the funding to the circuit without having been legally authorized to do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A lawsuit in America... how predictable|url=http://joesaward.wordpress.com/2011/06/23/a-lawsuit-in-america-how-predictable/|first=Joe|last=Saward|work=Joe Saward blogs about the world of F1|publisher=Joe Saward|date=June 23, 2011|accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though promoters have responded stating that all necessary guidelines had been followed. On July 1, 2011, a state district court judge declined to enter a temporary restraining order against Combs preventing payments from the METF; nonetheless, Texas Comptroller Combs reconsidered and chose not to make the July 31 advance payment to FOMC/Bernard Ecclestone as previously agreed for the first year's sanctioning fee. The attorney for the project's opponents has stated that he is unsure if they will continue pursuing the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2011/07/01/judge_rules_against_formula_on.html |title=Judge Rules against Formula One subsidy opponents |first=Eric |last=Dexheimer |publisher=Austin-American Statesman |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705002231/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2011/07/01/judge_rules_against_formula_on.html |archivedate=July 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the Austin city council agreed to allow the circuit to apply to the Texas Major Events Trust Fund but withheld its full endorsement requiring the circuit to pay the financial match normally borne by the local government sponsor.  As a part of the endorsement, the sport will pay $15,000 in [[carbon offset]]s and $5 million to establish an on-site research project into [[environmentally friendly]] technologies.

===Breach of contract and reinstatement===
In November 2011, [[Bernie Ecclestone]] expressed what he called "minor" doubt over the future of the United States Grand Prix in Austin after "disagreements inside the [management] company".&lt;ref name="Bernie doubts"&gt;{{cite news|title=Formula 1 chiefs to discuss 2012 calendar amid concerns over some races|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/95834|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues were later confirmed when construction of the circuit came to a halt because of a dispute between the circuit owners, promoter Full Throttle Productions, and Formula One Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2011/11/15/circuit-americas-halts-construction-contract-dispute/ |title=Circuit of the Americas halts construction in contract dispute |publisher=F1 Fanatic |date=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoter Tavo Hellmund admitted that his company had been in breach of its contract with Formula One Management since May 2011. The situation further escalated when state comptroller Susan Combs described the planned [[Grand Prix of America]] as a threat to the race in Texas, and said that the first $25 million payment from the state sports fund would only be made available after the first Grand Prix at the circuit, despite having previously promised to make the funds available in time for the inaugural event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2011/11/texas-finance-chief-confirms-new-jersey-race-threatens-austin-event/ |title=Texas finance chief confirms New Jersey race threatens Austin event James Allen on F1 – The official James Allen website on F1 |publisher=Jamesallenonf1.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernie Ecclestone later issued an ultimatum to the owners and organizers: find a solution before the December 7 meeting of the [[FIA]] [[World Motorsport Council]] or else risk being removed from the 2012 calendar. Ecclestone emphasized that if the Circuit of the Americas were removed from the calendar, it would not be added again at a later date.

On December 7, 2011, the World Motorsport Council released the final calendar for the 2012 season, with the Circuit of the Americas retaining its November 18 date. Further details revealed that the race investors, McCombs and Epstein, had reached a new arrangement with Ecclestone, with work on the circuit scheduled to resume immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustingrandprix.com/news/tag/bobby-epstein#.T0KyJvVEWg4 |title=News |publisher=The Austin Grand Prix |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the arrangement, organizers paid the sanctioning fee for the 2012 race one year in advance as a show of good faith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/formula1/story/2011-12-07/grand-prix-in-texas-approved-by-formula-one/51722488/1 "Formula One to return to U.S. at U.S. Grand Prix in Texas" ''USA Today''.] Retrieved December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the circuit's reinstatement, there were no reports supporting Tavo Hellmund's continued involvement under the new contract. On March 4, 2012, ''[[The Austin American-Statesman]]'' reported that Hellmund had launched legal proceedings against investors Bobby Epstein and Red McCombs, with Hellmund claiming that he was still a part of the management company and had not been paid since September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=F1 promoter sues other race investors|url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/f1-promoter-sues-other-race-investors-2215199.html|first=John|last=Maher|work=The Austin Statesman|date=March 3, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307015759/http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/f1-promoter-sues-other-race-investors-2215199.html|archivedate=March 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further details emerged, reporting that Hellmund was in the process of attempting to acquire Epstein's interest in the company, describing the condition of the circuit as of March 4 as "teetering".&lt;ref name="Tavo A.sport"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tavo Hellmund in legal dispute with Austin Grand Prix|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/97834|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|work=Autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=March 4, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein responded to the lawsuit by stating that Hellmund had been found to have been in breach of contract by Formula One Management.&lt;ref name="Tavo A.sport"/&gt;

===Dispute over planned MotoGP race===
In April 2011, plans were unveiled by [[Tavo Hellmund]] of Full Throttle Productions and [[Kevin Schwantz]] of 3fourTexas for the circuit to host a round of the [[2013 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2013]] [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP World Championship]], with the race to be known as the [[Texas motorcycle Grand Prix|Texas Grand Prix]].&lt;ref name="COTA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2011/Texas+GP+announced+for+2013|work=motogp.com|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]|date=April 12, 2011|accessdate=September 15, 2012|title=Texas lands MotoGP from 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race was the brainchild of Schwantz, the circuit co-designer, who would serve as event promoter with his company, 3fourTexas. However, following the settlement of the lawsuit between [[Tavo Hellmund]] and [[Bobby Epstein]], Schwantz announced that he would be suing Steve Sexton. Schwantz claimed that upon the resolution of the dispute between Hellmund and Epstein, Sexton moved to negotiate directly with [[MotoGP]]'s commercial rights holder, [[Dorna Sports]], ignoring what he claimed was an existing contract between Dorna and 3fourTexas to hold the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former MotoGP champ sues over rights to events|url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/former-motogp-champ-sues-over-rights-to-events-2453207.html|first=John|last=Maher|work=Austin-American Statesman|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912125645/http://www.statesman.com/sports/former-motogp-champ-sues-over-rights-to-events-2453207.html|archivedate=September 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circuit representatives denied that there was ever a contract between Schwantz and the Circuit of the Americas, and that his dispute was with Dorna Sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Circuit of the Americas claims Schwantz lawsuit baseless|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2012/09/08/circuit_of_the_americas_claims.html|first=John|last=Maher|work=Austin-American Statesman|date=September 8, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911002147/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2012/09/08/circuit_of_the_americas_claims.html|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorna later claimed that although a contract for the race between Dorna and Schwantz had existed, the contract had been terminated in July 2012 as they believed Schwantz had failed to acquire the necessary rights from the circuit to hold the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MotoGP rights holder Dorna says it terminated contract with Schwantz in July|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2012/09/12/motogp_rights_holder_dorna_say.html|work=Austin-American Statesman|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208213748/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2012/09/12/motogp_rights_holder_dorna_say.html/|archivedate=December 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwantz then accused Sexton and the Circuit of the Americas of "undermining" him, deliberately blocking his attempts to establish a race in order to have the contract terminated and allowing them to negotiate a more-favourable arrangement with Dorna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schwantz fires back at COTA, Dorna|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2012/09/13/schwantz_fires_back_at_cota_do.html?cxntfid=blogs_formula_austin|first=John|last=Maher|work=Austin-American Statesman|date=September 13, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210213534/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2012/09/13/schwantz_fires_back_at_cota_do.html/?cxntfid=blogs_formula_austin|archivedate=December 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Dorna Sports announced that they had come to agreeable terms with organisers of the Texas motorcycle Grand Prix, including the race on the [[2013 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2013 calendar]] as the [[Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas]], but made no mention of the dispute with Schwantz or any outcome of it.&lt;ref name="MotoGP in"/&gt;

Prior of the [[2014 Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas]], the circuit announced that COTA and Schwantz had amicably settled their legal differences and reached an agreement to collaborate to promote motorcycling racing, with Schwantz taking the role as official ambassador for COTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevin Schwantz joins Circuit of The Americas™ as motorcycle racing ambassador|url=http://circuitoftheamericas.com/media-center/article/kevin-schwantz-joins-circuit-of-the-americas-as-motorcycle-racing-ambassado|work=Circuit Of the Americas|date=March 27, 2014|accessdate=May 5, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506044549/http://circuitoftheamericas.com/media-center/article/kevin-schwantz-joins-circuit-of-the-americas-as-motorcycle-racing-ambassado|archivedate=May 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevin Schwantz, COTA reach settlement ahead of MotoGP event|url=http://www.crash.net/motogp/news/201537/1/kevin-schwantz-cota-reach-settlement.html|work=Crash.net|date=March 28, 2014|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==

===Racetrack===
In an episode of [[Speed (TV channel)|Speed TV]]'s ''[[WindTunnel with Dave Despain|Wind Tunnel]]'' program broadcast on August 22, 2010, Tavo Hellmund revealed that the circuit would be 3.4 miles (5.5&amp;nbsp;km) long and would be made up of twenty turns with an elevation change of 133 feet (41 m). The final plan of the circuit was released on September 1, 2010, showing a design inspired by the European tradition of sculpting the circuit to the contours of the land. The design draws from several European Formula One circuits, including a recreation of [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone's]] Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel sequence, [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim's]] arena bends, and a replica of [[Istanbul Park|Istanbul's]] Turn Eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Austin circuit layout revealed|publisher=[[Formula One Administration]]|work=formula1.com|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2010/9/11198.html|date=September 1, 2010|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other corners were loosely inspired by the Senna 'S' at [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] and the [[Red Bull Ring#Original track|Österreichring's]] Sebring-Auspuffkurve.&lt;ref name="Tavo &amp; Kevin"/&gt; A feature of the circuit is a deliberate widening of corners, to encourage drivers to follow multiple racing lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=ESPN F1|publisher=ESPN Emea Ltd.|url=http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/story/52061.html|title=F1 Texan style|first=Mark|last=Sutton|date=June 20, 2011|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar feature was used at the [[Buddh International Circuit]] in [[India]], where the circuit widens on the approach to certain corners.

The circuit was one of only a handful on the Formula One 2012 calendar to be run counter-clockwise, the others being [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Marina Bay]], the [[Korea International Circuit]], [[Yas Marina Circuit|Yas Marina]], and [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace|Interlagos]]. Because of this, the circuit contains more left-hand turns than right-hand ones, placing greater physical demands on the drivers whose bodies, particularly their necks, are more adapted to the lateral [[g-forces]] of clockwise circuits.

From the start line, the drivers climb a gradient of over 11% to the first corner—the highest point of the circuit—with the apex of the corner positioned on the crest of the hill. They descend the hill to navigate a series of fast sweepers modeled on Silverstone's Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel complex and through a blind corner at Turn 10, taking them to the far end of the circuit and a hairpin at Turn 11. The drivers then follow a {{convert|0.62|mi|km|adj=on}} straight back towards the pit and paddock area before entering the final sector of the lap and weaving through a series of corners modeled on Hockenheim's stadium section. This is followed by a downhill, multi-apex corner with limited run-off before the final two corners of the circuit, a pair of left-hand bends that return the drivers to the main straight.

====Reception====
The reception from drivers ahead of the [[2012 United States Grand Prix|inaugural race]] was highly positive. [[Fernando Alonso]] and [[Lewis Hamilton]] both praised the circuit, suggesting that it would be considerably more difficult to learn than other recent additions to the Formula One calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=F1 drivers have positive first impression of COTA|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2012/11/16/drivers-positive-impression-cota/|first=Keith|last=Collantine|work=F1 Fanatic|publisher=Keith Collantine|date=November 16, 2012|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jenson Button]] described the first sector as "spectacular", but remarked that he felt that starting second would be better than starting first as the placement of pole position put it on a steeper incline than the rest of the grid.&lt;ref name="JB KOB"&gt;{{cite news|title=United States GP: Jenson Button says Austin perfect showcase for F1|first1=Jonathan|last1=Noble|first2=Pablo|last2=Elizale|work=Autosport.com|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kamui Kobayashi]], on the other hand, was less complimentary, claiming that he did not feel intimidated by the steep climb to the first corner as it was no different from Eau Rouge at the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps]], and accusing the media of hyping it up without precedent.&lt;ref name="JB KOB"/&gt; [[Mark Webber]] was also unimpressed, stating that while he enjoyed driving the first sector of the circuit, the second and third sectors were similar to other circuits on the calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drivers praise COTA but race prospects aren’t good|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2012/11/17/2012-united-states-grand-prix-friday-practice-analysis/|first=Keith|last=Collantine|work=F1 Fanatic|publisher=Keith Collantine|date=November 17, 2012|accessdate=November 17, 2012|quote=But fellow Australian Mark Webber was not quite as fulsome in praise, pointing out that after the first sector it became much like any other modern circuit: “It’s a pretty good track, it’s quick, especially the first sector which is quite full on, although sectors two and three are more traditional and similar to other tracks.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Plaza===
Bordered by the track on three sides, the Grand Plaza is a {{convert|20|acre|km2}} space designed by Miró Rivera Architects of Austin, Texas that includes a large reflecting pool, lawn, and varying landscape zones. A promenade along the north side of the Grand Plaza hosts concessions, retail, restroom facilities, and entrances to spectator seating. From the southeast end of the Grand Plaza, two pedestrian bridges cross over turns 16 and 3 to provide access for visitors to other areas of the circuit complex.&lt;ref name="eyesin.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Formula 1 Facilities Look Fast and Fresh|url=http://www.eyesin.com/architecture/2012/formula-1-facilities-looks-fast-and-fresh/|accessdate=November 19, 2012|newspaper=EYES IN Architecture|date=November 17, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122190117/http://www.eyesin.com/architecture/2012/formula-1-facilities-looks-fast-and-fresh/|archivedate=January 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation Tower===
Circuit of the Americas features a {{convert|251|ft|m}} [[observation tower]] designed by Miró Rivera Architects and built by Patriot Erectors as a [[landmark]] for the venue. The structure of the tower consists of an elevator hoist-way surrounded by a [[double helix staircase]] of 419 stairs, both of which lead to an observation platform {{convert|230|ft|m}} above ground level. The platform provides a 360-degree panorama of the circuit, as well as views to downtown Austin, Texas. The observation platform, which is accessible to the public for an admission fee, can accommodate up to 70 visitors and features glass railings and a partial glass floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scarlet cascade for observation tower|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=21298|accessdate=November 19, 2012|newspaper=World Architecture News|date=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a "veil" consisting of 18 bright red steel tubes runs nearly the full height of the tower, acting as a canopy for both the observation platform and the stage below. The design of the observation tower was inspired by the visual imagery of sports cars and movement, and the red color was selected to mimic the streaks of lights trailing racecars at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Fred A.|title=A Towering Landmark for Formula One Track|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/a-towering-landmark-for-formula-one-track/|accessdate=November 19, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times "Wheels" Blog|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austin360 Amphitheater===
{{see also|List of Austin360 Amphitheater performers}}
On July 23, 2012, COTA announced a booking agreement with [[Live Nation (events promoter)|Live Nation]] to book major concerts at an open air [[amphitheater]] to be built at the base of the observation tower. Designed by Miró Rivera Architects, the venue opened in April 2013 with a concert by [[Kenny Chesney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doolittle|first=Dave|title=Live Nation to book national touring concerts at circuit amphitheater|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2012/07/23/live_nation_to_book_national_t.html|accessdate=September 6, 2012|newspaper=Austin-American Statesman|date=July 23, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727175804/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/racing/entries/2012/07/23/live_nation_to_book_national_t.html|archivedate=July 27, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The amphitheater accommodates up to 14,000 people with 5,240 permanent reserved seats. Another 1,700 seats can be configured on the stage-front floor or there is standing room for 2,300. The remaining general admission spots are on a sloping grass area behind the reserved seats. The venue was originally going to be called Tower Amphitheater, but in March 2013, was renamed to Austin360 Amphitheater, with [[naming rights]] sold to the entertainment/events website associated with the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Austin360 Amphitheater at racetrack set to be Austin area’s largest outdoor venue|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/entertainment/austin360-amphitheater-at-f1-racetrack-set-to-be-a/nWh82/|publisher=Austin-American Statesman|accessdate=March 6, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main Grandstand===
The primary permanent seating at Circuit of the Americas is located within the Main Grandstand, designed by Miró Rivera Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maher|first=John|title=Austin firm pushes to finish F1 track work|url=http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/austin-firm-pushes-to-finish-f1-track-work-2099095.html|accessdate=September 6, 2012|newspaper=Austin-American Statesman|date=January 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615134733/http://www.statesman.com/sports/formula1/austin-firm-pushes-to-finish-f1-track-work-2099095.html|archivedate=June 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above-ground construction on the grandstand began in March 2012, and the "topping out" occurred in June 2012 with completion in time for the inaugural United States Grand Prix.

The Main Grandstand is {{convert|65|ft|m}} tall, and has a total capacity of approximately 9,000 spectators. The seating is divided into three levels: lower level (capacity ~5400, including Loge Boxes), club level (capacity ~2900), and suite level (capacity ~750). The majority of seating is covered by a tensile fabric canopy. The primary structure is {{convert|500|ft|m}} long, while the lower risers extend an additional 500 feet. The grandstand also contains concessions, restrooms, offices, and two lounge spaces located at the second and third levels. The Velocity Lounge on the second level is approximately {{convert|7100|sqft|m2}}, and contains a 36-screen video wall and the acrylic painting "Velocity" by Dallas-based artist Christopher Martin measuring {{convert|120|ft|m}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Kendall|title=Dallas artist Christopher Martin adds epic accent to Austin’s Circuit of the Americas|url=http://dallas.culturemap.com/newsdetail/arts-dallas-artist-christopher-martin-velocity-austin-circuit-of-the-americas/|accessdate=November 19, 2012|newspaper=CultureMap Dallas|date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Main Grandstand and the concessions buildings in the Grand Plaza were conceived as a modular system consisting of several components that can be arranged according to need. The concessions, with banners and deep canopies, can be expanded with restrooms, permanent seating or suites. Inherent to this “kit-of-parts” construction system is flexibility allowing the site to grow and change.&lt;ref name="eyesin.com"/&gt;

===Soccer stadium===
In August 2017, a new [[soccer-specific stadium]] was announced to be built between the Amphitheater and the Grand Plaza. A professional soccer team known as [[Austin Bold FC]] will start playing in the [[USL Championship]] in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/news_article/show/821487?referrer_id=2333971 |title=USL Announces Return to Austin in 2019 |accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mystatesman.com/sports/soccer/austin-pro-soccer-franchise-will-roll-2019-000-seat-cota-venue/yYB4EAQ56lWkGc4L9i9izI/ |title=Austin pro soccer franchise will roll in 2019 in 5,000-seat COTA venue |accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future races=== 
On September 4th of 2018, IndyCar announced that it has reached a multi-year agreement to add the Circuit Of The Americas to its calendar replacing [[ISM Raceway]], finalizing the IndyCar Series calendar. COTA will debut on the IndyCar Series schedule on Sunday, March 24. It will serve as the second race of the 2019 campaign. The addition of COTA at the end of March fills the large gap between the first and second races that has existed that past couple of years. Often it seemed as if the some of the momentum built by the series at the season-opener in St. Petersburg was lost by the time Indy cars got back on track a month later. Now with COTA in the fold for late-March, there will only be one off week between the season-opener at the second race of the season. This will be the first time since 2014 that 2 tracks in Texas will be on the IndyCar series calendar.

'''Cut-resistant gloves''' are those designed to protect the wearer's hands from cuts while working with sharp tools.  They can be divided into metal mesh gloves, cut-and-sewn, and seamless knitted gloves.

Metal mesh gloves are a form of [[Mail_(armour)#Modern_uses|chainmail]], and are made of rings of stainless steel. They are typically used in food applications.

Cut-and-sewn gloves can be made by a cut-resistant material or by conventional materials with full or palm lining of cut-resistant materials. The materials are cut to shape and sewn into a glove.

Seamless knitted gloves are knitted in one piece by a flat knitting machine. The cut protection is provided by high performance materials such as [[Para aramid]] ([[Twaron]], [[Kevlar]]), HPPE (High Performance Poly Ethylene, [[Dyneema]], [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#Fiber applications|Spectra]]), special [[Polyvinyl acetate|PVA]] yarns (SupraBlock) or steelfibre and [[fibreglass]] yarns. Thick gloves are usually knitted on a 10gauge machine while thinner and more flexible styles are knitted on a 13gauge machine. The gloves are usually coated with solid or foamed [[Latex]], [[Nitrile]] or [[Polyurethane]].

==Cut Resistance ==
Cut resistance has many dimensions such as force, direction, sharpness of the blade, length of the cut and flexibility of object. Different products should be evaluated in relation to the expected type of cut risk and environment that they are expected to face. It should be noted that the cut resistance in the standards described below as well as resistance to scissors cut has no or limited correlation.{{clarify |reason= correlation to what? |date = September 2011}}

==Standards ==
The cut resistance is evaluated by the EN388:2003 or the ISO 13997 standard. The EN388 use a circular rotating blade of 40mm diameter that rotates against the direction of movement. The blade is moving back and forth over a small distance of about 50mm with load of 5N. The numbers of cut cycles are recorded and compared to a cotton control fabric. The cut resistance is rated between "0" and "5" depending on the average number of cycles prior to break-through failure: "0" means 0 to 1.2 cycles;  "1" means &gt;1.2 to 2.5 cycles;  "2" means &gt;2.5 to 5.0 cycles;  "3" means &gt;5.0 to 10.0 cycles;  "4" means &gt;10.0 to 20.0 cycles; and "5" means &gt;20.0 cycles.

The EN388 is expected to be updated in 2016 or 2017, the most significant change is an introduction of the ISO 13997 concept. The new EN 388:2016(?) will incorporate a letter A-F to indicate the cut resistance of A&lt;2N, B&lt;5N, C&lt;10N, D&lt;15N, E&lt;22N and F&lt;30N. This is more in line with the new American standard of ANSI 105-15 that is using a system of A1-A9 with interval closely resembling to the proposed EN 388:2016(?)but adding 3 higher levels of A7&gt;4000g, A8&gt;5000g and A9&gt;6000g.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4981">The '''Decamentathlon''' is a multi disciplined games event that was created as part of the first [[Mind Sports Olympiad]]. It was founded to try to find the best games all-rounder in the world and hence possibly the best games player. It was given a prize fund of [[pound sterling|£]]10,000 for the inaugural competition, that equalled
that of the highest funded event at the first MSO sponsored by [[Skandia]].&lt;ref name="mso1"&gt;"Mind Sports Olympiad Supplements", ''[[The Times]]'', July–August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the other events were spread over multiple playing sessions whereas the Decamentathlon was held over just a single session. This event was initially hailed as the MSO flagship event. Although, the Mind Sports Olympiad's other new event the [[Mind Sports Organisation#Pentamind|Pentamind]]  has since become regarded as the more significant event despite not having a fixed format.

== Format ==
The Mind Sports Olympiad was described as [[Olympic Games|the Olympics]] of the mind.&lt;ref name="mso1"/&gt; The Decamentathlon and Pentamind were an attempt to replicate the ideas of the [[decathlon]] and [[pentathlon]] from [[Track and field athletics|athletics]].
Unlike the Pentamind which has a free format allowing competitors to use different events to each other, the Decamentathlon has a fixed format. The Decamentathlon comprises
a 4 hour test which is split into 10 events (see below). Each event was either a reduced version of the full event when played in competition or a written paper. Each event carries a maximum score
of 100 points so the maximum possible score is 1000 points.
The complexity of setting the event and marking it  has meant that the only place to have held a Decamentathlon is the Mind Sports Olympiad where the annual world championship is held.

The Decamentathlon was originally divided into ten tests in the following events:&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;David Ward, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/22/davidward "Cerebral athletes play mind games"], ''[[The Guardian]]'',  22 August 2005, Retrieved on 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Contract bridge|bridge]], [[chess]], [[creative thinking]], [[draughts|draughts 8x8 / checkers]],  [[Go (game)|go]], [[intelligence]], [[Mastermind (board game)|mastermind]], [[memory skill]]s, [[mental calculation]]s, [[Reversi|othello]].

The memory section was initially run in a fixed format where competitors have to memorise a single [[deck of cards]] and a list of 48 random words (previously the second part was memorisation of a 96 digit number).
From 2008 the Decamentathlon world championships was held using a [[backgammon]] test in the place of bridge.

For 2011 the memory section was switched again, the random words section being replaced by a random 50 digit number to be memorised. The [[Reversi|othello]] and [[backgammon]] sections were also removed in favour of a [[Sudoku]] test and a Word puzzles test.

== Controversy ==

There has been controversy over the claim that the event had an inherent English language bias. This was especially on the sections of creative thinking and intelligence. This view is reinforced by there only having been one non-native English speaker to have won the World Championships, Gert Schnider from Austria. Although, the fact that three of the winners of the Decamentathlon have won the Pentamind in years other than when they won the Decamentathlon implies that this bias might be small.
There have also been issues of marking errors and the official answers not being accurate. This has resulted in medals being changed after they have been presented.

== Champions ==
The World Championships have taken place as part of the MSO since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;''Article about Decamentathlon'', http://www.boardability.com/game.php?id=decamentathlon, Retrieved on 13 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{tone|date=November 2012}}
The documentary describes the ascension of West Indies cricket from being a team largely composed of highly talented, entertaining, "Calypso Cricketers" to a determined unit that dominated world cricket for nearly twenty years.

It begins with an introduction to the [[West Indies Cricket Team]]. Using interviews with West Indian cricketing greats, and other people closely associated with West Indies cricket; the idea of culturally and politically different [[Caribbean]] nations playing under the common banner of the West Indies is described.

The history of cricket in the West Indies is briefly described, such as the appointment of [[Sir Frank Worrell]] as the first black man to [[Captain (sports)|captain]] the West Indies Cricket Team, and the emergence of such cricketing greats as [[Everton Weekes]], [[Learie Constantine]], and [[Sir Garfield Sobers]]. However talented these individual cricketers were, they were unable to fetch results, resulting in the West Indies being perceived as "Calypso Cricketers"; people who were entertaining, but would ultimately lose.

The early 1970s saw the emergence of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of [[Calypso music|Calypso]], and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the [[cricket field]]. That man was [[Clive Lloyd]]. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1975–76|1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia]].

Australians [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Jeff Thomson]] destroyed the West Indies with their [[fast bowling]]. Frequent [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]s and intimidatory tactics led to the spirit of the team being shattered and the tour ended with Australia winning the six-match [[test cricket|test series]] 5-1. At the end of the series, Clive Lloyd realizes that in order to win, it would be necessary for him to also cultivate [[fast bowlers]] as devastating as Lillee and Thomson.

When the [[Indian Cricket Team]] toured the West Indies in 1976, Clive Lloyd tested his new plan of attack, relentlessly getting his fast bowlers such as [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]], [[Michael Holding]], and [[Colin Croft]] to bowl short-pitched or [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]s to Indian batsman. While playing at [[Kingston, Jamaica]] the Indian team declared on a second-innings lead of 12, after the management decided that they would rather not risk sending their bowlers such as [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] to face the fearsome fast bowling.

Convinced of the effectiveness of pace bowling as an instrument to success, Clive Lloyd's team departed to their [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1976|Tour of England in 1976]]. England Captain [[Tony Greig]]'s infamous [[Tony Greig#"I intend to make them grovel"|"grovel" comment]] is shown in its entirety, and the effect it had on galvanising the team is described. After some highly aggressive fast bowling against the English batsmen, West Indian fast bowling is seen as being dangerous to the game. However, the West Indians feel that if the Australians could do it, so could they. [[Viv Richards]] is shown as dominating the Test series as a [[batsman]], where he scored 829 [[run (cricket)|runs]] in four [[test cricket|tests]] with two [[Double century|double-centuries]]. Viv Richards' refusal to be intimidated by fast bowling is also seen as the ideal way for a batsman to deal with West Indian bowling.

The documentary then describes the struggle with their board for better pay, and how [[Kerry Packer]] eventually enticed the team to participate in [[World Series Cricket]] in 1977. [[World Series Cricket]] turns out to be a fore-runner of changes in cricket that only became permanent in the 1990s; such as coloured kits, day/night matches, and a greater emphasis on professionalism in play. The West Indian team emerges from the tournament fitter, stronger, and with a more professional outlook to the game.

The 1982 [[South African rebel tours#West Indian tours, 1982–83 and 1983–84|Rebel Tour]] to [[Apartheid]]-ruled [[South Africa]] is described. [[Colin Croft]] chooses to go, earning him a life ban from the [[West Indies Cricket Board]]. The main target of the regime, however, is international superstar [[Viv Richards]]. Richards states that he was offered "a [[blank cheque]]", but decided to not go as it would validate the state-sponsored racism pursued by the South African Government at the time.

It ends with a description of the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1984|West Indies' tour to England in 1984]]. With the emergence of fast bowling greats such as [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]] to take the place of Croft, the West Indies becomes unstoppable. After [[Gordon Greenidge]]'s innings of 214 not out at [[Lord's]], the West Indians become an unstoppable force; defeating England 5-0 in the five-test series. In a turn on the regular term "[[Whitewash (sport)#Cricket|Whitewash]]" to describe such a win, the series was instead dubbed [[Blackwash]].

The documentary ends with a description of how the West Indians earned the respect, admiration, and love of cricket fans and even opposing teams from across the world. As the end credits roll, [[Michael Holding]] describes how between February, 1980 to March, 1995; the West Indies Cricket Team did not lose a single Test series. (it was preceded by the  controversial [[West Indian cricket team in New Zealand in 1979–80|West Indies tour of New Zealand in 1979–80]])

The '''International Braille Chess Association''' ('''IBCA''') is organization for [[Blindness|blind]] and [[visually impaired]] [[chess]] players. The IBCA is a [[FIDE]]-affiliated chess organization as well as a part of the [[International Blind Sports Federation]]. The International Braille Chess Association originated informally in 1951 with the organization of the first international correspondence chess tournament for blind players, by [[Reginald Walter Bonham]]; the tournament included 20 players representing 10 countries. It first organized an over-the-board tournament in 1958, with representatives from seven countries. Today, it has grown to encompass over 50 member nations around the world.&lt;ref name="ibcahist"&gt;[http://www.schachkomet.de/ibcabuch.htm History of the IBCA] Retrieved January 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The IBCA hosts two major competitions: the [[Blind Chess Olympiad]] and the [[Blind World Chess Championship]].

==Rule modifications==
Although most of the rules in blind chess are consistent with [[Rules of chess|normal chess]], there are a few modifications to the equipment to aid blind and visually impaired players:&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;
[https://www.ibca-info.org/rules-of-chess.php Rules of Chess] Retrieved September 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.ibca-info.org/how-visually-impaired-play-chess.asp How the Visually Impaired Play Chess] Retrieved September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyeway.org/?q=chess Chess - Eyeway.org] Retrieved September 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
# Either player may demand the use of two boards, the sighted player using a normal board, the visually handicapped player using a board that is specially constructed as follows: 
# All the black squares are raised about 3–4&amp;nbsp;mm above the white squares on the [[chessboard]]. By feeling the squares, the player is able to determine whether the square is a black or a white one.
# Each of the squares on the board has a hole in the center so that the [[chess piece]]s can be fixed in these holes.
# Each of the pieces has a downward projection (nail) at the base, which fits into the hole in the squares on the board, thereby fixing the piece securely on the board.
# All the black pieces have a pin fixed on their heads helping the player distinguish between a white and a black piece.

After making every move, each player is required to announce their move aloud to their opponent. Instead of writing the moves on a [[Score sheet (chess)|chess score sheet]], the visually impaired player writes the moves in [[Braille]] or records the moves on a [[tape recorder]].&lt;ref name="rules"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5295">A '''kick''' in a running race is the ability of some athletes to [[Sprint running|sprint]] at the end of an endurance oriented race.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hillrunner.com/jim2/id205.html&lt;/ref&gt;  For those who possess the ability to kick, it is a strategic weapon.  For those with the liability not to possess a kick, they must seek [[Pacing strategies in track and field|different strategies]] to anticipate and diminish their opponent's kicking power, usually by a long extended surge to break away or exhaust their opponent well ahead of the finish of the race.  Similar to a [[Sprinter (cycling)|Sprinter]] in cycling, a kicker has a finite distance they know they are able to sprint, making their strategy to be in the ideal position at that distance to be able to utilize that speed.  Sprinting too early could lead an athlete to tie up, a form of [[rigor mortis]] before reaching the finish line.  Thus team tactics might also intentionally or not, box a kicker, meaning to position other competitors to their outside, to disrupt their positioning and timing.  Of course, as the finish is nearing and all athletes are straining, this becomes more difficult to accomplish deliberately.

In modern history, most championship races turn strategic.  Very rarely will an athlete risk going out on their own to attempt to [[Breakaway (cycling)|breakaway]], therefore leaving the race result to the best timed kick.  While the drafting effects of pack running are not as accentuated as they are in a cycling [[Peloton]], the psychological teamwork of a unified group rarely rewards the breakaway athlete.  Some notable exceptions include [[Almaz Ayana]], who not known for her sprint speed, broke away to take [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's 10,000 metres|2016 Olympic 10,000 metres]] in world record time.  A week later, the same [[Vivian Cheruiyot]] she had vanquished in the 10,000m, did not let her breakaway in the [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's 5000 metres|5000]].  [[Ruth Jebet]] also burned off her opponent's kick in the [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's 3000 metres steeplechase|steeplechase]].

In the [[800 metres]], some athletes develop the reputation for being a kicker because of their apparent speed at the end of the race, when in reality the ran even splits.  Most of that speed is relative to the exhaustion as their opponents slow.  [[Dave Wottle]], [[James Robinson (runner)|James Robinson]], [[Yuriy Borzakovskiy]], [[Nick Symmonds]] and [[Amel Tuka]] would take the beginning of the race out slowly, re-gaining contact with the rest of the field near the last 200 metres.  At the elite men's level, that even pace would be about 26 seconds per 200 meters; a 52 second first lap, as compared with the leaders close to or under 50 seconds.  World record holder [[David Rudisha]] burned off the kickers during his world record [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's 800 metres|2012 Gold medal]].  When he won the [[2015 World Championships in Athletics – Men's 800 metres|2015 World Championships]], he blew away even paced kickers like Tuka with a remarkably fast final 24.34 200 metre true kick of his own.

Generally most long kickers or extended kickers would accelerate in the penultimate lap or shortly after the bell indicating the last lap has begun.  A speed kicker would behave more like an anchor runner in a 4x400 relay, positioning themselves on the shoulder of their opponent and using their burst of speed as late as the final straightaway.

[[Mo Farah]] developed a reputation as a strategic runner.  His finishing kick was not so much a burst of speed, but his extended ability to repeatedly accelerate just enough to discourage anybody from passing him during an intense final lap or so of his races.  His [[Nike Oregon Project]] teammate [[Matthew Centrowitz Jr.]] employed a similar form of holding the lead to win his [[Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's 1500 metres|2016 gold medal in the 1500]].

Because of the advantage of having the tool of a kick in a competitor's arsenal, the techniques to train to kick are a common discussion among runners and coaches.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.verywellfit.com/how-to-finish-strong-in-running-races-2910928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=5048842&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://running.competitor.com/2014/10/training/ask-mario-improve-kick_115237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.realbuzz.com/articles-interests/running/article/how-to-perfect-the-finishing-kick-or-sprint-finish-in-a-race/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://runners-resource.com/how-to-develop-a-kick/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20799128/a-lethal-kick/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''King Baudouin Stadium''' ({{lang-fr|Stade Roi Baudouin}}, {{lang-nl|Koning Boudewijnstadion}}) is a sports ground in north-west [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. It was inaugurated on 23 August 1930. [[Leopold III of Belgium|Crown Prince Leopold]] attended the opening ceremony.  Located in the Heysel section of the [[City of Brussels|Brussels municipality]], it was built to embellish the Heysel plateau in view of the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|1935 Brussels International Exposition]].  The stadium hosted 70,000 at the time.  A wooden track for cycling races was later added around the pitch.

==History==
The original name was '''Jubilee Stadium''' ({{lang-fr|Stade du Centenaire}}, {{lang-nl|Jubelstadion}}) because it was inaugurated days after Belgium's 100th anniversary, with an [[Belgium national football team results – unofficial matches|unofficial Belgium-Netherlands football match]]. In 1946 the stadium was renamed '''Heysel Stadium''' (French: ''Stade du Heysel'', Dutch:  ''Heizelstadion''). It hosted [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] finals in 1958, 1966, 1974, and 1985 and [[Cup Winners' Cup]] finals in 1964, 1976 and 1980. The highest attendance at a European game was over 66,000 in 1958.

Despite its status as Belgium's [[national stadium]], Heysel was not well maintained. By the time of the [[1985 European Cup Final]], it was in a very poor state. For example, the outer wall had been made of [[cinder block]], and fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in it to get in. The abject stadium conditions, along with poor crowd control procedures and football hooliganism are widely considered to have contributed to the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]], which resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators before the match.&lt;ref name="times3"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,762-1554603,00.html |title=Our day of shame | work=The Times |accessdate=24 May 2006 | location=London | first=Tony | last=Evans | date=5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the disaster, the ground was only used for athletics ([[track and field]]) and it still hosts the [[Memorial Van Damme]] every year.

===Modernisation===
In 1995, a decade after the disaster, the ground was rebuilt at a cost of [[Belgian franc|BEF]] 1,500 million (around €37/$50 million in 1995), and at this time renamed [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] Stadium, after the Belgian monarch who had died two years previously.  All that remains of the old stadium is a renovated gateway near the main entrance.  The new structure combined the football ground with a running track and facilities for field events.

It was re-opened on 23 August 1995 as the home of the [[Belgium national football team]]  and is the largest stadium in Belgium; it can seat 50,093 spectators. The remodeled stadium hosted the [[1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|1996 European Cup Winners Cup final]], as well as the opening game for [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].

On 26 May 2006, the [[Belgian Football Association]] decided not to use the King Baudouin Stadium anymore for the national team home matches and for the [[Belgian Cup|Cup]] final, because the gates of stand one were too narrow and the stadium was deemed unsafe. The next match of the national team was thus held at the [[Constant Vanden Stock Stadium]]. The city of [[Brussels]] complained that contrary to these claims the stadium was safe, and this complaint was upheld in court. On 6 October 2006, the [[Belgian Football Association]] met with representatives of the city of Brussels and they agreed to renew the contract and extend it to 30 June 2008. Since 15 November 2006, the Belgian national football team has used the King Baudouin Stadium.

===Rugby Union===

On 25 August 2007, [[Belgium national rugby union team|Belgium]] played [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in [[rugby union]] as part of Argentina's [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] preparations. Argentina defeated Belgium 36-8.

The stadium was scheduled to witness a rugby union milestone on 19 December 2009, when the [[Paris]]ian club [[Stade Français]] planned to take their [[2009–10 Heineken Cup pool stage|Heineken Cup]] home match against [[Pro14|Irish]] club [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] to the stadium in a match that had sold more than 30,000 tickets. However, heavy snowfall in Brussels on the intended matchday forced the cancellation of what would have been the first [[Heineken Cup]] match held in Belgium; the fixture was instead played the following day in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/12_12929.php |title=Stade Français Paris v Ulster Rugby |publisher=European Rugby Cup |date=20 December 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417190314/http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/12_12929.php |archivedate=17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium had another shot at hosting a Heineken Cup match in 2012. On 20 October 2012, English club [[Saracens FC|Saracens]] took their [[2012–13 Heineken Cup pool stage|Heineken Cup]] pool match against [[Racing Métro 92]] to Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/heineken-cup-2012-13/rugby/story/167597.html|title=Sarries take Heineken Cup to Brussels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other events===
On 8 July 2010 the stadium played host to the [[Best of Belgium]] gala which featured a tennis match originally scheduled to be between [[Justine Henin]] and [[Kim Clijsters]]. Unfortunately Henin had to pull out and [[Serena Williams]] replaced her as the match was played in front of the largest crowd ever for a single match, beating the attendance set at the [[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)|Battle of the Sexes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=tennis&amp;id=5117444|title=Clijsters to play Henin at 40,000-capacity stadium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U2]] performed at the stadium three times: the first one was on 10 June 2005 during their [[Vertigo Tour]], in front of a sold out crowd of 60,299 people. The second and the third were on 22 and 23 September 2010 during their [[U2 360° Tour]], in front of a total sold out crowd of 144,338 people. The performance of "Mercy" from the first 2010 show was recorded for the group's live EP ''[[Wide Awake in Europe]]''. The performance of "[[I Will Follow]]" from the same show was recorded for the group's live album ''[[From the Ground Up: Edge's Picks from U2360°]]''.

[[The Rolling Stones]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mylène Farmer]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Beyoncé]], [[One Direction]], [[Johnny Hallyday]] and [[Coldplay]] have also played concerts at the stadium.

==Heysel Stadium Silver Coin==
[[File:2005 Belgium 10 euro Derby front.JPG|160px|right|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)#2005 coinage|75 years of Heysel Stadium commemorative coin]]]]
To celebrate the 75th anniversary of the stadium the Belgian state released a commemorative coin: the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Belgium)#2005 coinage|10 euro 75 years of Heysel Stadium commemorative coin]].  The obverse depicts an image of a footballer with the stadium in the background. The flags of Belgium and the Netherlands can be seen on top of the stadium as well as the year that the stadium was built.

'''Marsaxlokk Ground''' is a [[association football|football]] pitch in [[Marsaxlokk]], a traditional [[fishing village]] located in the south-eastern part of [[Malta]]. The ground is used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of [[Marsaxlokk F.C.|Marsaxlokk Football Club]]. [[Marsaxlokk FC]] uses this ground for training and practice matches.

[[Marsaxlokk F.C.|Marsaxlokk]] would play their European games at the ground, but the club play their league matches at the [[Ta' Qali National Stadium]], since most of the [[Maltese Premier League]] matches are played there, and also because the ground has a very low capacity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3737">'''Mike Beacom''' is a professional and [[college football]] writer, and the president and chairman of the [[Fantasy Sports Writers Association]] (FSWA).

== Pro and college football writer ==
Beacom writes a regular retro column for Pro Football Weekly and has contributed to [[Sports Illustrated|SI.com]]’s fantasy football section since 2006. He has also covered [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] football for a number of national outlets, including Lindy’s, Athlon and CSTV (now [[CBS Sports Network|CBS Sports]]).

== Football history ==
Much of Beacom’s work has been focused on historical themes. In 2006, Beacom researched all of the past [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] winners and offered alternative choices for each game based on insight he received from leading NFL experts. The article was recognized as one of the year’s best articles by the [[Pro Football Writers Association|Pro Football Writers of America]]. Two years later Beacom wrote a piece for SI.com picking the winners of the Heisman races from 1900 to 1934 (the 35 years before the trophy was established) based on research he had conducted.

== Fantasy Sports Writers Association (FSWA) ==
Beacom was asked to serve as the group’s chairman when it was created in 2004. On January 1, 2008, he assumed the duties of president, and during his term he has helped to launch the FSWA Hall of Fame, which recognizes those writers, editors and publishers who have made a lasting impact on the fantasy sports industry. Wrote ESPN’s Matthew Berry in 2010 of the honor, “Very humbling for me. Thrilled, honored, touched and many other emotions raced through me.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/ffl/story?page=tmr100914|title=The Talented Mr. Roto: Week 2 pickups|date=2010-09-15|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author ==
Beacom has penned several books, including “The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Football,” which was released by [[Alpha Books]] in 2010.

== Personal ==
Beacom resides with his family in [[central Wisconsin]] where he serves as an associate lecturer of journalism at a nearby university. He is a graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]] where he was a Communication major and awards an annual scholarship to students who excel in internships or employment.

== Awards and recognition ==

[[File:Ordine Olimpico.jpg|thumb|Olympic Order and its relative badge, produced by [[GDE Bertoni|GDE Bertoni Milano]], Collection Fabio Ferrari]]
The '''Olympic Order''' is the highest award of the Olympic Movement and is awarded for particularly distinguished contributions to the Olympic Movement, i.e. recognition of efforts worthy of merit in the cause of sport.  It was established in May 1975 by the [[International Olympic Committee]] as a successor to the ''Olympic Certificate''. The Olympic Order originally had three grades ([[Gold medal|gold]], [[Silver medal|silver]] and [[Bronze medal|bronze]]). In 1984, at the  87th IOC Session in [[Sarajevo]] ([[Yugoslavia]]), it was decided that in future there would be no distinction between the silver and bronze order. The gold order would continue to be awarded in exceptional circumstances. Traditionally, the [[IOC]] bestows the Olympic Order upon the chief national organiser(s) at the closing ceremony of each respective [[Olympic Games]].

The insignia of the Olympic Order is in the form of a ''collar'' (or [[chain]]), in Gold, Silver or Bronze according to grade; the front of the chain depicts the five rings of the [[Olympic Movement]], flanked on either side by ''kotinos'' emblem ([[olive wreath]]).  A lapel badge, in the form of the five rings in Gold, Silver and Bronze according to grade, is presented to recipients to wear as appropriate.
 
[[Nadia Comăneci]] is the only athlete to be awarded the Olympic Order twice (1984, 2004). She is also the youngest recipient of Olympic Order since 1984 when she was only 23 years old at the time of award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5212">The '''Parramatta Eels salary cap breach''' was a major breach of the [[National Rugby League]]'s strictly enforced [[salary cap]] by the [[Parramatta Eels]] rugby league club over a period of four years. The discovery of these breaches in 2016 by the NRL resulted in it stripping the Eels of the twelve competition points the club has accrued so far in the [[2016 NRL season]]. In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its [[2016 NRL Auckland Nines]] title revoked.&lt;ref name="salary-cap-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrl.com/eels-breaches-must-stop-today-greenberg/tabid/10874/newsid/95541/default.aspx|title=Eels breaches must stop today: Greenberg|publisher=NRL.com|first=Martin|last=Gabor|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrl.com/greenberg-addressed-shattered-eels-players/tabid/10874/newsid/95548/default.aspx|title=Greenberg addressed 'shattered' Eels players|publisher=NRL.com|first=Martin|last=Gabor|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The investigation==
Prior to the start of the 2016 NRL season, the [[Parramatta Eels]] faced the prospect with starting the season on -4 points due to salary cap indiscretions in 2015, however the NRL was satisfied with governance changes at the Eels and no points were deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theage.com.au/rugby-league/parramatta-eels/parramatta-eels-avoid-fourpoint-nrl-penalty-over-governance-issues-20160302-gn8m48.html | title=Parramatta Eels avoid four-point NRL penalty over governance issues | publisher=theage.com.au | date=2 March 2016 | accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was revealed in March that third-party payments had been made by several companies to several players, which is strictly prohibited in the NRL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-03/eels-salary-cap-investigation-findings-set-to-be-handed-down/7378204?section=sport|title=Parramatta Eels salary cap investigation findings to be handed down by the NRL|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 2016, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg announced that the club would be docked the twelve competition points they have accrued so far this season, as well as fined $1 million and stripped of the [[2016 NRL Auckland Nines]] title it won in February.&lt;ref name="salary-cap-1"/&gt; In addition, the NRL also announced that the Eels would not be able to accrue any further competition points until they fall under the salary cap, which they were reported to be $500,000 over as of 3 May 2016.&lt;ref name="Brunsdon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/parramatta-eels-players-will-not-be-forced-out-amid-cap-drama-promises-rlpa/news-story/68acdc2430cbadea91dcfdff230d238d|title=Parramatta Eels players will not be forced out amid cap drama, promises RLPA|publisher=Fox Sports Australia|first=Simon|last=Brunsdon|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five officials, including chairman Steve Sharp, deputy chairman Tom Issa, director Peter Serrao, chief executive John Boulous and football manager Daniel Anderson, were also sacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-03/parramatta-eels-docked-12-nrl-points-salary-cap-breach/7377704|title=Parramatta Eels docked 12 competition points by the NRL for salary cap breaches|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July, after over 2 months of club officials contesting the preliminary penalties, Parramatta were handed their punishment with the addition of their for/against points tally accumulated from rounds 1-9 being deducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parramatta final determination|url=http://www.nrl.com/parramatta-final-determination/tabid/10874/newsid/98979/default.aspx|website=NRL.com|date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main point of interest in this episode was the manner of the punishment when compared to the [[Melbourne Storm salary cap breach]] in 2010, while the Melbourne Storm were not allowed to play for points for the whole season the Parramatta Eels were permitted to play for points as soon as they fell back in line with the cap.&lt;ref name="Brunsdon"/&gt; It was acknowledged that this change was made due to the demoralising nature of the Storm punishment and having to witness a team running out week after week with nothing to play for.

==Suspects==

{{Empty section|date=September 2018}}

==Reaction==

The aftermath ended with Parramatta hooker Nathan Peats being squeezed out of the club, so the club would be just under the salary cap and start playing for competition points for the remainder of the season. Though this did very little for the troubled club finishing the NRL season 13th on the ladder winning only six of their last 14 matches.

The '''Pavilhão da Luz Nº 2''' is the second [[indoor arena|arena]] of Portuguese multi-sport club [[S.L. Benfica]]. It has a capacity of 1,800 seats and it is mainly used by the [[S.L. Benfica (handball)|handball]] and [[S.L. Benfica (volleyball)|volleyball]] departments of the club.

Its construction ran at the same time as the adjacent arena, [[Pavilhão da Luz Nº 1]], but it was finished just a couple weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A catedral das modalidades|trans-title=The cathedral of sports|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/a-catedral-das-modalidades.html|accessdate=21 March 2016|work=Record|date=28 February 2004|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the old Pavilhão da Luz was at full capacity with five sports, Benfica planned the new [[Estádio da Luz]] with two indoor arenas; the smaller one only hosting two departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seara Cardoso abre «caixinha» da nova Luz|trans-title=Seara Cardoso opens "little box" of the new Luz|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/benfica/detalhe/seara-cardoso-abre-caixinha-da-nova-luz.html|accessdate=21 March 2016|work=Record.pt|date=4 December 2002|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its differences from the main arena are its roof and its two side stands, who sit fewer people.

The '''Estadio Romelio Martínez''', or '''Romelio Martínez Stadium''', is a sports stadium located at 72 street and 46 Avenue in the [[Colombia]]n city of [[Barranquilla]]. It has a capacity of 20,000 spectators.

Until the construction of the [[Estadio Metropolitano Roberto Meléndez]] in 1986, the Romelio Martínez had been the city's primary stadium. It is currently the home of the [[Barranquilla F.C.]] soccer team, which plays in the [[Categoría Primera B|Colombian second division]].

== History ==
The project was conceived on 1932, because that year the [[National Games of Colombia]] were to be made in Barranquilla and was built in the ground that occupied the "Estadio Juana de Arco". The stadium was finished on 1934 with the name of "Estadio Municipal" (Municipal Stadium). The initial capacity of the stadium was of 10,000 spectators. Has a wooden structure that support the deck of the grandstand and the architectural stadium's style is [[Art Deco]].

The Romelio Martínez Stadium hosted the [[1946 Central American and Caribbean Games|V Central American and Caribbean Games]] in 1946.

Since the born of the [[Categoría Primera A|professional football]] in Barranquilla on 1948, had the need of enlarge the capacity of the stadium because sometimes many fans of the [[Junior de Barranquilla|local team]] of the city exceeded the total capacity, forcing to make long lines in the entry since the first hours of the day.

'''Russian boxing''' ([[Russian language|Russian]] - Кулачный бой ''Kulachniy Boy'' "fist fighting, pugilism") is the traditional  [[bare-knuckle boxing]] of [[Russia]].

==History==
The earliest accounts concerning the sport date to the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Fist Fighting''. "Летописцы наши говорят об ней, еще в начале XIII в. [Our sources talked about it already at the 13th century.]"&lt;/ref&gt;
Supposedly,{{By whom|date=June 2011}} fist fighting was practiced even prior to the  [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']],  at celebrations dedicated to [[Perun]].{{Dubious|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref name="Севостьянов В.М., Бурцев Г.А., Пшеницын А.В."&gt;{{cite book|last=Sevostyanov |first=V.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Metropolite Kiril, in 1274, created another one of many personally-instituted rules, declaring expulsion from Christianity for any of those who fist-fight and do not sing a prayer or hymn at the burial of someone who died during a fist fight.{{Verify credibility|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref name="Русская цивилизация"&gt;{{cite web|author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |url=http://www.rustrana.ru/article.php?nid=3006 |title=The Russian Civilization |trans-title=|format= |work=К истории кулачных боёв |publisher= |accessdate=28 August 2008 |description= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519055902/http://www.rustrana.ru/article.php?nid=3006 |archivedate=May 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government itself never supported, but also never opposed fist fighting.&lt;ref name="Русская цивилизация" /&gt;

Russian [[boyar]]s used the sport as mass entertainment, and acquired the best fighters for competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Sakharov, Ivan P., ''Сказания русского народа'', p. 129. "Было время, когда русские бояре, собравшись повеселиться, свозили из разных городов бойцов для потешения. [There was a time when Russian boyars when came together to have fun, brought from different cities fighters for fun.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The fights most often took place in holiday times and in crowded places. In winter it took place on ice. First the young children fought, then every pair was more grown up than the previous, ending with the last and most notable fist fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }} "лишь постепенно вводились в дело все более сильные отряды.

[The fights usually took place at holidays and in rural areas, and in winter most often on ice. First the boys were let in, and then more and more grown ups. The best fighters were kept for the end.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In two orders released in 1684 and 1686 fist fighting was forbidden, but the sport continued to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Robert Nisbet| last = Bain|title = The Pupils of Peter the Great: A History of the Russian Court and Empire from 1697 to 1740|publisher = A.

"Указами 1684 года ноября 2, 1686 года марта 19 и другими, строго воспрещались кулачные бои... Было время, что старики, воспламеняя умы молодых людей, несбыточными рассказами об удальстве бойцов, пробуждали в них страсть к кулачному бою." (With orders released in 1684, and 1686, Fist fights were forbidden... The old people, with their stories about the sport encouraged the young people to continue with it)&lt;/ref&gt;

All regions had their heroes at the sport, but the region with the most famous ones historically is [[Tula, Russia|Tula]].&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Fist Fighting''. "Тульские бойцы и ныне славятся, но каждое место имело своих удальцов."

"Лучшими бойцами один на один считались тульские [The best fighters in one-on-one were considered Tula's fighters.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1751, a mass fist fight took place on a street in [[Saint Petersburg]], which came to the attention of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]]. After that the Empress forbade the organization of fist fights on the territory of [[Moscow]] and Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name="Русская цивилизация" /&gt;

During the reign of [[Catherine the Great]], the popularity of fist fighting was growing again,&lt;ref name="Интернет-портал «Легендарный Физтех», «Физтех-центр»" /&gt; and it is said that Count [[Orlov (family)|Orlov]] was a good fist fighter himself and even invited notable fist fighters to compare powers.&lt;ref name="Интернет-портал «Легендарный Физтех», «Физтех-центр»" /&gt;

In 1832, [[Nicholas I of Russia]] completely forbade fist fights as "harmful fun".&lt;ref name="Русская цивилизация" /&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1941 the most important then [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] specialist in [[Boxing]], K.V. Gradopolov, wrote a book about the right way to fight with fists. In that book, he offered a new exercise, called "group boxing", and he mentioned it was an [[ancient Rus]]sian sport (what he was talking about, was the "Stenka na Stenku" version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }} "1941 году ведущий советский специалист по боксу К. В. Градополов рассказывал в своей книге о методах обучения воинов кулачному прикладному искусству. Предлагалось там такое необычное упражнение, как «групповой бокс». Автор прямо указывал, что «прообразом группового бокса (организованного и ограниченного определенными правилами) является русский самобытный народный спорт «стенка на стенку». (In 1941 the leading Soviet specialist in boxing K.V. Gradopolov told in his box about methods to teach soldiers how to fight with fists. He there offered a new exercise, 'group boxing'. He said there that the prototype of the 'group boxing' was the Russian folk sport "Wall on Wall"] {{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117155052/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules and types==
Every region in [[Russia]] incorporated different rules unlike the sport of boxing. In some places they fought with bare arms, while in other they stretched the sleeves over the fists. There were cases where participants would cheat by putting iron under their sleeves.&lt;ref&gt;Sakharov, Ivan P., ''Сказания русского народа'', p. 129. "Часто случалось, что хитрые и слабые бойцы закладывали в рукавицы бабки-чугунки для поражения противников. [Often it occurred, that weak fighters inserted iron into their sleeves]"&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of Russian fist fighting: the first is the singles type, a one-on-one fight; the second type is a team fight also known as "wall on wall". The third one, "catch drop", was the least practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Sakharov, Ivan P., ''Сказания русского народа'', p. 129. "Кулачные бои совершались разными видами. Более всех почитался: бой один на один, за ним—стена на стену, а менее всех сцеплялка-свалка. [There were different types of fist fighting. The most famous was a one-on-one, after that the wall on wall, and the least famous was the catch-drop."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }} "Кулачный бой практиковался у нас в трех формах: один на один («сам на сам»), стенка на стенку и «сцеплялка–свалка». [Fist fighting was practiced in three ways. One-on-one, wall on wall, and catch-drop."] {{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117155052/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several versions of the singles fight. One version was like modern boxing, where one fighter hits the other wherever he wants or can. The other version is when the fighters take turns hitting each other. Escaping from a punch, answering it not on turn, and moving aside were not allowed; all that could be done was to use the hands to try to protect one's own body.&lt;ref&gt;Labzyuk, Sergei, "Историческая справка: кулачный бой". "Также существовал кулачный бой 'удар на удар' или 'раз за раз', когда противники наносили удары по очереди. Уклоняться от удара, отвечать на него, переступать ногами запрещалось, можно было лишь прикрыть руками наиболее уязвимые места. [There was also a fist fighting type 'hit on hit' or 'one for one', when the opponents gave punches on turn. Evading a punch, answering it not on turn, moving one's legs was not allowed. All could be done was to use the hands to try to protect the more painful areas]"&lt;/ref&gt; Victory could come in few cases: when one of the fighters falls, till first blood, or till one of the fighters gives up.&lt;ref&gt;Labzyuk, Sergei, "Историческая справка: кулачный бой". "Бились по различным правилам: - до сбивания на землю ударом (до трех сбиваний) - до первой крови - до сдачи противника и признания своего поражения. Также существовал кулачный бой 'удар на удар' или 'раз за раз', когда противники наносили удары по очереди. Уклоняться от удара, отвечать на него, переступать ногами запрещалось, можно было лишь прикрыть руками наиболее уязвимые места. [There were different types of rules. 1. Till one falls. 2. Till first blood. 3. Till one gives up.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The "wall-on-wall" fight (with anywhere from dozen to several hundreds participants) was performed strictly by rules and could go on for hours. Both "walls" had a chief fighter, who served as a tactician and a commanding officer. "Walls" themselves were tight straight formations 3-4 ranks deep. Repeated attacks were performed, aiming to push the opposing "wall" out of the game area. Basic tactics were used, such as breaching using heavy fighters (who were usually held in reserve), encircling, false retreat and others; but as a rule, tight wall formation never broke. Tactics also included battle planning. The "wall-on-wall" fights, while performed for entertainment, were in fact close to military training. For example, notable ethnographer V. Gilyarovsky recalled that during his voluntary service in an infantry regiment soldiers often staged wall-on-wall fistfights with factory workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm Кулачный бой на Руси ''Спортивная жизнь'' magazine, No. 7 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117155052/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |date=January 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous phrase in [[Russian language|Russian]], "Do not hit a man when he's down", has roots in that sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }} "Одно из правил кулачного боя стало даже пословицей, символизирующей русское благородство в бою: «Лежачего не бьют».

==Fist fighting in Russian popular culture==
[[File:Vasnetsov Kulachni boi.jpg|thumb|150px|"Fistfight" (''Kulachniy Boy''), a painting by  [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]

As for centuries fist fighting was so popular and was such a part of Russian folk life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }} "Широчайшей географией кулачных боев, их повсеместным распространением объяснялось то, что кроме русских в них со временем стали принимать участие и представители иных национальностей, обитавших в России: древняя чудь, татары, мордовцы. И многие другие." (The wide territory the fist fight was practiced on brought the sport to other nations like the Tatars, Mordvins, and many others) {{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it occurred frequently in [[Russian literature]] and [[Russian art|art]].

The most famous portrayal of a Russian fistfight is in [[Mikhail Lermontov]]'s poem, The Song of the Merchant Kalashnikov. There, the fistfight tales place as a form of honor [[duel]] between an [[oprichnik]] (government police agent) and a merchant. It is notable that, according to Lermontov, both characters use combat gloves ('rukavitsy' — reinforced mittens). Though it may be an example of poetic license, the poem states that the first connected blow by Kalashnikov bent a large bronze cross hanging from his opponent's neck, and the second fractured the opponent's temple,  killing him. The fight also features in the [[opera]] ''[[The Merchant Kalashnikov (opera)|The Merchant Kalashnikov]]'' by [[Anton Rubinstein]] (1880).

In the 19th century [[Sergei Aksakov]] watched famous fist fights in the Kaban frozen lake in [[Kazan]], and later wrote about them in his "Story about student life". Some decades later, at the same lake, the young future opera-singer [[Feodor Chaliapin]] took part in a similar fight: "From one side came we, the [[Russians]] of [[Kazan]], from the other side the [[Tatars]]. We fought hard without feeling sorry for ourselves, but never broke the historic rules of not to hit one that is already down, not to kick, and not to keep iron up one's sleeves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }} "Еще в 1806 году С. Т. Аксаков наблюдал знаменитые кулачные бои в Казани, на льду озера Кабан, и впоследствии описал их в своем «Рассказе о студенческой жизни». А через восемь десятилетий в тех же боях азартно дрался великий русский артист Ф. И. Шаляпин. Уже увенчанный мировой славой, он делился дорогими его сердцу воспоминаниями: «Сходились с одной стороны мы, казанская Русь, с другой - добродушные татары. Дрались отчаянно, не щадя ни себя, ни противников. Но и в горячке яростной битвы никогда не нарушали установленных искони правил: лежачего не бить, присевшего на корточки - тоже, ногами не драться, тяжести в рукавицы не прятать»." {{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117155052/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the young  Chaliapin was attacked in a fight over a girl, but thanks to knowing fist fighting he won. He wrote: "He jumped to beat me, and even though I was afraid of the police, learning fist fighting at the frozen lakes of [[Kazan]] helped me, and he humiliatingly lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }} "Однажды, когда Федор уже начал взрослеть, навыки кулачного боя выручили его в критической ситуации. Его несчастный соперник в любви - городовой - попытался было поколотить начинающего хориста, но тот вовсе не забыл, как хаживал в стенке на озере Кабан, и крепко проучил блюстителя порядка. «Он бросился бить меня. Но хотя я очень боялся полиции, однако опыт казанских кулачных боев послужил мне на пользу, и городовой был посрамлен»." {{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117155052/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian poet [[Sergei Yesenin]] in his autobiography notes "About myself" told that his grandfather taught him fist fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }}  "«Дедушка иногда сам поддразнивал на кулачку и часто говорил бабке: «Ты у меня, дура, его не трожь, он так крепче будет!». Так написал сам поэт в автобиографических заметках «О себе»." (Sometimes my grandfather teased me to fist fight and told my grandmother: "You, my stupid, don't touch him. That way he'll be tougher". That's what the poet himself wrote in the autobiographic notes "About Myself") {{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117155052/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=January 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the heroes in the book "Thief" by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] novelist [[Leonid Leonov]] said: "In childhood, it happened, only in fist fights I found real friends... And was never wrong! Because only in a fight the whole human nature comes out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012307/http://www.infosport.ru/Press/SZR/0798/topic1.htm |archivedate=2008-08-22 |df= }} "Один из героев его романа «Вор» говорит: «В мальчишестве, бывало, только на кулашнике и подберешь себе приятеля...

[[Image:Shocking Duel.jpg|thumb|right|Game in progress]]
'''Shocking Duel''' is a [[game]] of [[pain]] [[endurance]] in which each [[Player (game)|player]] grips one of a pair of connected handles which deliver [[electric shock]]s of increasing intensity.  The loser is the first player to release their handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shocking Duel: Bring On The Pain|url=http://www.ohgizmo.com/2007/03/19/shocking-duel-bring-on-the-pain/|date=March 19, 2007|author=Evan Ackerman|publisher=Oh Gizmo!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i4u.com/article8261.html|title=Shocking Duel Game Brings the Pain|date=19 March 2007|author=Shane McGlaun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=The Oak Ridger|author=Betsy Abernathy|date=October 12, 2006|title=Games that are (really) shocking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Pau Waelder studied similar games which delivered electric shocks to the opponent through a variety of interfaces; games such as ''[[PainStation]]'', ''Legshocker'', ''Tekken Torture'' and ''Tazer Tag''.  They were generally found to be popular or even addictive.  He wrote, "What many players find in these games of pain is what many people in Western society are looking for in more or less sublimated forms: an engaging experience that involves both body and mind, a way to release aggressiveness in a harmless manner, a social intercourse, a chance to demonstrate one's self-efficacy before others, a different form of competition. ... pain is present here not just as a punishment, but especially as a threat. It is the threat of experiencing pain that puts the player in a state of alert, and being in this state is felt to be exciting and fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Games of Pain |author=Pau Waelder Laso |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |volume=40 |number=3 |year=2007 |pages=239–242 |jstor=20206411 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |doi=10.1162/leon.2007.40.3.238|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1137676/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
The manufacturer's [[safety]] warning advises that the game may interfere with [[pacemaker]]s and other electronic health equipment and that it should not be played by sufferers from [[epilepsy]] or [[heart disease|heart conditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Warning|publisher=Paladone Products Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spread eagle''' is one of the [[moves in the field]] in the sport of [[figure skating]], in which a skater glides on both feet, the toes turned out to the sides, heels facing each other. It can be performed on either the inside or outside edges. It is commonly used as an entrance to jumps, adding to the difficulty level of that jump under the [[ISU Judging System|Code of Points]]. It is most commonly used an entrance to an [[axel jump]].

'''The Palace of Auburn Hills''', commonly referred to as '''The Palace''', is a defunct multi-purpose arena located in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. It was the home of the [[Detroit Pistons]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[Detroit Shock]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA), the [[Detroit Vipers]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|International Hockey League]], the [[Detroit Safari]] of the [[Continental Indoor Soccer League]], and the [[Detroit Fury]] of the [[Arena Football League (1987-2008)|Arena Football League]].

The Palace was one of eight basketball arenas owned by their respective NBA franchises.

==Etymology==
By the time it closed as an NBA venue, the Palace was one of only two [[List of National Basketball Association arenas|arenas]] which had not sold its naming rights to a corporate sponsor. The other was [[Madison Square Garden]]. 

The Pistons court was previously named the "William Davidson Court", in honor of the late owner, prior to the home opener on October 28, 2009; however, Davidson's signature, along with the retired numbers, were removed from the hardwood when [[Tom Gores]] took over ownership of the Palace, and were re-retired instead atop the Palace rafters as replacement banners.
==History==
[[File:Palace of Auburn Hills.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Palace of Auburn Hills during a Detroit Pistons basketball game in January 2006.]]
===Background===
From 1957 to 1978, the Pistons competed in Detroit's [[Detroit Olympia|Olympia Stadium]], [[Calihan Hall|Memorial Building]], and [[Cobo Center#Cobo Arena|Cobo Arena]]. In 1978, owner [[Bill Davidson (businessman)|Bill Davidson]] elected not to share the new [[Joe Louis Arena]] with the [[Detroit Red Wings]], and instead chose to relocate the team to the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], a venue constructed for [[American football|football]], where they remained for the next decade.&lt;ref name="Freep"/&gt; While the Silverdome could accommodate massive crowds, it offered substandard sight lines for basketball viewing. In late 1985, a group led by Davidson decided to build a new arena in Auburn Hills. Groundbreaking for the arena took place in June 1986.&lt;ref name="SBD"/&gt; Using entirely private funding, The Palace cost a relatively low price of $90 million.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freep"/&gt; The Davidson family held a controlling interest in the arena until [[Tom Gores]] bought it as part of his purchase of the Pistons in 2011.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;
===Construction===
Then-Pistons owner William Davidson and two developers privately financed the $90 million construction of The Palace, and did not require public funds.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

The Palace was built with 180 [[luxury box|luxury suites]], considered an exorbitant number when it opened, but it has consistently managed to lease virtually all of them. In December 2005, the Palace added five underground luxury suites, each containing {{convert|450|sqft|m2}} of space and renting for $450,000 per year. Eight more luxury suites, also located below arena level, were opened in February 2006. They range in size from {{convert|800|to|1200|sqft|m2}} and rent for $350,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2005/02/20050228/Facilities/Pistons-Spend-Big-To-Land-The-Big-Spenders.aspx?hl=Pistons%20spend%20big%20to%20land%20the%20big%20spenders&amp;sc=0| title=Pistons spend big to land the big spenders| first=John| last=Lombardo| work=Sports Business Journal| date=February 28, 2005| accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural design of the Palace, including its multiple tiers of luxury suites, has been used as the basis for many other professional sports arenas in North America since its construction, including the [[Canadian Tire Centre]] in [[Ottawa]], also designed by Rossetti Associates.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2889956&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=NBAHeadlines| title=Last of its kind: Charlotte Coliseum to be demolished Sunday| publisher=[[ESPN]]| agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Basketball===
The Palace opened in 1988.&lt;ref name="SBD"/&gt; When one of The Palace's basketball occupants won a championship, the number on its address changed. Its current address is 6 Championship Drive, reflecting the Pistons' three NBA titles and the Detroit Shock's three WNBA titles (the Detroit Vipers' 1997 [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|Turner Cup]] championship has not been officially recognized in the arena's address; the address also remained unchanged despite the Shock's move to [[Tulsa Shock|Tulsa, Oklahoma]] in 2010; they moved to [[Dallas, Texas]] in 2016, and are now known as the [[Dallas Wings]]). The original address was 3777 Lapeer Road.

The Palace was widely considered to be the first of the modern-style NBA arenas, and its large number of luxury suites was a major reason for the building boom of new NBA arenas in the 1990s. Although the Palace became one of the oldest arenas in the NBA, its foresighted design contained the amenities that most NBA teams have sought in new arenas built since that time. By contrast, of the other NBA venues that opened in 1988-89, [[Amway Arena]], [[Charlotte Coliseum]], and [[Miami Arena]] have been demolished, while the [[Bradley Center]] and [[Sleep Train Arena]] have been replaced, with the former scheduled to be demolished starting in September 2018. All of these arenas were rendered obsolete by the lack of luxury suites and [[club seating]], lucrative revenue-generating features that made pro sports teams financially successful in order to remain competitive long-term, and also being located in suburban rather than downtown areas (the Palace, however, remained one of the successful suburban arenas).&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://palaceofauburnhills.stadiumhotelnetwork.com/information.html| title=Auburn Hills Information| publisher=Stadium Hotel Network| accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=IG&amp;p_theme=ig&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Nothin'%20But%20Profit:%20Winning%20no%20longer%20key%20to%20new%20NBA%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(Nothin'%20But%20Profit:%20Winning%20no%20longer%20key%20to%20new%20NBA)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |title=Nothin' But Profit: Winning no longer key to new NBA |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date=May 15, 2006| accessdate=February 22, 2017| subscription=yes| first1=Mike| last1=Lewis| first2=Phuong| last2=Cat Le}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nonetheless, Palace Sports &amp; Entertainment (PS&amp;E) had spent $117.5 million in upgrades and renovations to keep the arena updated.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt; A new high definition [[JumboTron]] monitor, new LED video monitors, and more than {{convert|950|ft|m}} of ribbon display technology from [[Daktronics]] was installed in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=scoreboard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/pistons/news/ledboards.html |title=PISTONS: The Palace of Auburn Hills Installs Light Emitting Diode Boards in Arena| publisher=NBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Malice at the Palace====
{{main|Pacers–Pistons brawl}}
On November 19, 2004, a fight broke–out between members of the NBA's Detroit Pistons and [[Indiana Pacers]].  As the on-court fight died down, a fan threw a cup of [[Diet Coke]] at Pacers forward [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]], who then rushed into the crowd, sparking a melee between players and spectators. The fight resulted in the suspension of nine players, criminal charges against five players, and criminal charges against five spectators.  The offending fans were banned from attending games at The Palace. In the aftermath of the fight, the NBA decided to increase the security presence between players and spectators. The fact that the fight took place at The Palace of Auburn Hills led to it becoming colloquially referred to as "Malice at the Palace" and "Basketbrawl".

The Palace was also the site of  a brawl between the WNBA's [[Sparks–Shock brawl|Shock and Sparks]] on July 21, 2008.

===Notable concerts===

The show also featured [[Peter Frampton]], [[Alto Reed]], [[Paul Shaffer]], and the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]].

The Palace was the site of an attempt on the life of [[Led Zeppelin]] guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], while he was on tour, with former band mate [[Robert Plant]], during their [[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded|No Quarter]] Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-04-05/entertainment/17973065_1_jimmy-page-willie-nelson-drug-charges| work=[[New York Daily News]]| first=David| last=Hinckley| title=Extra! Extra! Late-breaking News From The World Of Entertainment| date=April 5, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 1995, Lance Alworth Cunningham, a 23-year-old, who thought that Led Zeppelin music contained "satanic messages", tried rushing the stage with a knife. He waited until the song "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" started and then made his charge for the stage, waving the weapon. The man was tackled by patrons and security about 50 feet from the stage.

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] performed two sold–out shows during her [[Drowned World Tour]] on August 25–26, 2001. The shows were recorded and broadcast live on [[HBO]] and were later released as a DVD, entitled ''[[Drowned World Tour 2001]]''.

===Future===
In October 2016, it was reported that the Pistons' ownership were negotiating a possible relocation to [[Little Caesars Arena]], a new multi-purpose venue located in [[Midtown Detroit]] built by [[Olympia Entertainment]] to replace Joe Louis Arena as home of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Detroit Red Wings]], as soon as the [[2017–18 Detroit Pistons season|2017–18 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Derick| last=Hutchinson| url=http://www.clickondetroit.com/sports/detroit-pistons-finalizing-deal-to-move-downtown-sources-say| title=Detroit Pistons finalizing deal to move downtown, sources say| work=[[WDIV-TV]] News| publisher=Graham Media Group| date=October 26, 2016| accessdate=October 30, 2016
