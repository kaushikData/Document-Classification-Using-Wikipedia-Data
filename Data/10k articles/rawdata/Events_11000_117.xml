      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3278">'''1987 Aegean crisis''' took place in late March between [[Turkey]] and [[Greece]], as part of the [[Aegean dispute]]. Turkey learned that Greece was starting to drill for oil in the disputed Aegean waters in the vicinity of [[Thasos]]. 
In response, the Turkish survey ship [[RV MTA Sismik 1]] was sent to the area to conduct survey with an escort of Turkish warships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Greece opposes reported Turkish oil search in Aegean |date=March 26, 1987 |agency=UPI |newspaper=UPI archives |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/03/26/Greece-opposes-reported-Turkish-oil-search-in-Aegean/6705543733200/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=GREEKS AND TURKS EASE AEGEAN CRISIS |date=March 29, 1987 |newspaper=nytimes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/world/greeks-and-turks-ease-aegean-crisis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Oil was discovered off Thasos, in 1973. Greece claimed ownership of mineral rights in the continental shelf extending from beneath all its islands in the Aegean. Turkey proposed that the continental shelf be divided through negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=GREECE AND TURKEY ALERT FORCES AS TENSION BUILDS ON OIL SEARCH |date=March 28, 1987 |newspaper=nytimes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/28/world/greece-and-turkey-alert-forces-as-tension-builds-on-oil-search.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The crisis escalated, armed forces of both countries were on alert, and both sides said they would use force if obstructed by the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=GREEKS AND TURKS EASE AEGEAN CRISIS |date=March 29, 1987 |newspaper=nytimes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/world/greeks-and-turks-ease-aegean-crisis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident nearly started a war between [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/world/greeks-and-turks-ease-aegean-crisis.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Greek prime minister [[Andreas Papandreou]] gave the orders to sink the ship if it was found in the disputed waters claimed by Greece. Turkish Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] said that "If Greece interferes with our vessel in any way, and this is what Papandreou is saying, we will act in the same way against him", "As a result, it could be cause for war.", but he also added that "We are waiting for the first move from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=GREEKS AND TURKS EASE AEGEAN CRISIS |date=March 29, 1987 |newspaper=nytimes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/world/greeks-and-turks-ease-aegean-crisis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Peter Carington]], the Secretary General of NATO, urged Greece and Turkey to avoid the use of force and offered to act as a mediator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=GREEKS AND TURKS EASE AEGEAN CRISIS |date=March 29, 1987 |newspaper=nytimes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/world/greeks-and-turks-ease-aegean-crisis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The crisis was solved when Turkish Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] announced that if the Greek government did not enter the disputed waters, the Turks would stay out as well; he participated in a phone call with Papandreou.

The '''Australia–Indonesia spying scandal''' concerns allegations made in 2013 by [[The Guardian]] and [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], based on documents leaked to [[The Guardian]] and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], that the [[Australian Signals Directorate]] attempted to monitor the mobile phone calls of Indonesian president [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]], his wife [[Kristiani Herawati]], and senior officials.&lt;ref name="ga-mata"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/australia-tried-to-monitor-indonesian-presidents-phone |title=Australia's spy agencies targeted Indonesian president's mobile phone |last1=MacAskill |first1=Ewen |last2=Taylor |first2=Lenore |date=18 November 2013 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc-mata"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-18/australia-spied-on-indonesian-president-leaked-documents-reveal/5098860 |title=Australia spied on Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, leaked Edward Snowden documents reveal |last1=Brissenden |first1=Michael |date=18 November 2013 |website=abc.net.au/news/ |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{see also|2013 global surveillance disclosures}}
Beginning in June 2013, reports from media outlets including [[The Guardian]] and [[The Washington Post]] revealed operational details of the [[United States|US]] [[National Security Agency]]'s [[mass surveillance]] of US and foreign nationals.&lt;ref name="gg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=NSA collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order|work=The Guardian|accessdate=August 16, 2013|quote=Exclusive: Top secret court order requiring [[Verizon]] to hand over all call data shows scale of domestic surveillance under [[Barack Obama|Obama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports were based on a series of secret documents leaked by former NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name="gg"/&gt; Further disclosures indicated that the NSA's surveillance operations extended to include the intelligence-gathering agencies of US allies, including the British [[Government Communications Headquarters]] and Australia's [[Defence Signals Directorate]], members of the [[UKUSA Agreement|UKUSA]] or "Five Eyes" security agreement.&lt;ref name="fiveeyesap"&gt;{{cite news|title=5-nation spy alliance too vital for leaks to harm|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/experts-say-us-spy-alliance-will-survive-snowden|work=Associated Press|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2013, [[Der Spiegel]] reported that German intelligence services had received "credible evidence" that Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been targeted by the NSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german |title=Angela Merkel's call to Obama: are you bugging my mobile phone? |last1=Traynor |first1=Ian |last2=Oltermann |first2=Philip |last3=Lewis |first3=Paul |date=24 October 2013 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, reports from Der Spiegel and [[Fairfax Media]] stated that Australian embassies and diplomatic posts in Asia were being used to intercept phone calls and data, including during the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/exposed-australias-asia-spy-network-20131030-2whia.html |title=Exposed: Australia's Asia spy network |last1=Dorling |first1=Philip |date=31 October 2013 |website=smh.com.au/ |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 during the East Timor crisis, Indonesia bugged Australia's embassy in Jakarta and tried to recruit Australians as spies, retiring Indonesian intelligence chief General Abdullah Mahmud Hendropriyono admitted. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/11/14/1100384426722.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://thediplomat.com/2013/11/indonesia-and-australia-deteriorating-diplomacy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The allegations prompted Indonesia to immediately recall its ambassador to Australia, [[Nadjib Riphat Kesoema]].&lt;ref name="ga-abbott-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/19/tony-abbott-no-apology-explanation-indonesia-spying |title=Tony Abbott: no explanation, no apology to Indonesia for spying |last1=Taylor |first1=Lenore |date=19 November 2013 |website=guardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] initially declined to apologise or comment on the matter, prompting accusations from President Yudhoyono that he had "belittled" Indonesia's response to the issue.&lt;ref name="ga-abbott-1"/&gt; Speaking to [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]], Abbott went on to argue that Australia "should not be expected to apologise for...reasonable intelligence-gathering activities".&lt;ref name="ga-abbott-1"/&gt; The next day, Indonesia responded by reviewing all areas of bilateral cooperation, including on issues around [[people smuggling]], a major component of the [[Abbott Government]]'s [[Operation Sovereign Borders]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/indonesia-suspends-police-cooperation-in-phone-tapping-fallout-20131122-2y1p6.html |title=Indonesia suspends police co-operation in phone- tapping fallout |last1=Bachelard |first1=Michael |last2=Kenny |first2=Mark |date=November 23, 2013 |website=smh.com.au |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian government's response to the issue prompted criticism from current and former leaders in both countries, including former Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/22/spying-row-australians-deserve-accountable-intelligence-services |title=Spying row: Australians deserve accountable intelligence services |last1=Fraser |first1=Malcolm |date=22 November 2013 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Vice President [[Jusuf Kalla]], Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/indonesia-recalls-canberra-ambassador-phone-australia |title=Indonesia recalls Canberra ambassador as phone-tapping diplomatic row grows |last1=Laughland |first1=Oliver |date=19 November 2013 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to negative reporting in the Indonesian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/19/phone-tapping-revelations-dominate-the-news-in-indonesia |title=Phone tapping revelations dominate the news in Indonesia |last1=Laughland |first1=Oliver |date=19 November 2013 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations were also held outside Australia's embassy in Jakarta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/spying-scandal-australian-flags-burnt-as-protests-heat-up-in-indonesia-20131121-2xx9k.html |title=Spying scandal: Australian flags burnt as protests heat up in Indonesia |last1=Bachelard |first1=Michael |date=21 November 2013 |website=smh.com.au |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Opposition Leader]] [[Bill Shorten]] declined to criticise Abbott, instead emphasising the importance of the bilateral relationship, and arguing that the government's response should be a "Team Australia moment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/the-pulse-live/politics-live-november-20-2013-20131120-2xu38.html#post_live_89765 |title=Politics live: November 20, 2013 |last1=Ireland |first1=Judith  |date=20 November 2013 |website=smh.com.au |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer argued that the diplomatic response to the issue was "beyond the control" of Tony Abbott's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-20/alexander-downer-on-indonesia-spying/5106674 |title=Indonesia relationship woes 'beyond control' of Abbott government, Alexander Downer says |date=21 November 2013 |website=abc.net.au/news |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations, and Indonesia's response, attracted significant coverage in Indonesian and international media, particularly following allegations that the US [[National Security Agency]] had attempted to monitor the mobile phone of [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/22/australia-indonesia-spying-row-how-the-international-press-sees-it |title=Australia-Indonesia spying row: how the international press sees it |last1=Jabour |first1=Bridie |date=22 November 2013 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bernard and Doris''''' is a 2006 film directed by [[Bob Balaban]]. The [[screenplay|teleplay]] by [[Hugh Costello]] is a semi-[[fiction]]alized account of the relationship that developed between [[socialite]] [[Beneficiary|heiress]] and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Doris Duke]] and her self-destructive [[Ireland|Irish]] butler, [[Bernard Lafferty (butler)|Bernard Lafferty]] later in her life.

The film premiered at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]] on October 17, 2007 and was broadcast by [[Home Box Office|HBO]] on February 9, 2008. It has been released on [[DVD]].

==Plot==
In 1987, Doris Duke, considered the wealthiest woman in the world, hires Bernard Lafferty, who lists Elizabeth Taylor and Peggy Lee as former employers on his résumé, as her majordomo. He explains a six-month gap in his employment history was due to "health issues," a euphemism for time spent in rehab to deal with his addiction to alcohol. He assures Doris, who immediately suspects the truth, he is capable of performing his duties without any problems. As Bernard moves in, the viewer can quickly tell he is a little neurotic, first putting portraits of his former employers, Taylor and Lee, in his bedroom, then informing the rest of the staff he is now "Miss Duke's eyes and ears" and demanding they listen to him. Despite Bernard's growing affection for Doris, the brash and often crude Doris thinks little of him, not even remembering how to correctly pronounce his name. However, their situation slowly evolves into a more emotionally intimate but non-physical relationship as Doris returns from a plastic surgery center one evening, drunk and on painkillers, and is aided by Bernard who stays with her through the night.

Doris teaches Bernard about horticulture, especially the care of orchids, and he takes control of the operation of her various households during her frequent long absences. Bernard himself enjoys tending the home and making sure things are in their correct order. The first time his sexuality is questioned is when he peers at Doris's much younger lover playing the piano in his underwear. In the greenhouse, Doris flirts with him, telling him belly dancing is a form of seduction and then performing a dance for him. Bernard tentatively informs her that he "swings in the other direction." Doris encourages him to tone down his severe dress and wear brighter colors. Doris begins to take Bernard with her on her world tours and convinces him to pierce his ear. During this time, they grow closer, and Doris begins to favor him above everyone else. Also, whenever Doris is mentioned in newspapers, we see Bernard cutting them out of the newspapers and keeping them for himself.

Doris begins to spend more time with Bernard, and at one point attempts to seduce him.  When Bernard backs away, Doris questions him: "I don't get it. You don't fuck me, you don't steal from me. So what do you want from me?", to which Bernard answers, "I want to take care of you, Miss Duke."

As the two become closer, and Bernard becomes more relaxed, he begins to drink again, initially with discretion but eventually to an extent that it begins to hinder his performance. Rather than dismiss him, as she always has done with employees who displeased her in the past, Doris has him committed for more rehab at her expense despite his having consumed large amounts of her expensive, vintage wines. Doris suffers a stroke, and Bernard returns to take full control of her life. In order to humor her—and to indulge his own proclivities—Bernard wears her makeup, jewelry, and haute couture and begins to affect a more feminine demeanor. One evening, Doris tells Bernard what she wants him to do after she dies, and a  tearful Bernard promises he will perform her requests. Doris's smile fades and she tells him, "I must really be crazy to believe a fucker like you," suggesting that she still resents him for stealing from her.

Meanwhile, Bernard tries to keep Doris' attorney and financial advisor Waldo Taft, away from Doris, hanging up on him whenever he calls. Taft dislikes and distrusts Lafferty enough to have offered him $500,000 to leave his position in the past. Taft calls the police to Doris's estate, but Doris tells the police officer that Bernard is only "peacefully devoted above and beyond in the call of duty," prompting the officer to leave and blame Taft for being jealous. However, Taft encourages Doris to hire a live-in nurse. Although Doris's faith and trust in Bernard cannot be shaken, she agrees to hire a nurse, which Bernard is very unhappy about. Eventually, he convinces her to refrain from hiring a nurse, instead taking care of her himself and only occasionally inviting a doctor to give her checkups.

A while later, Bernard gives a very sick Doris her medicine and injection before putting her to bed, and she dies that night. Before her death, however, she appoints him executor of her massive estate. In his first meeting with her board of directors following Doris's cremation, a now obviously effete Bernard appears confident and in control, dressed in a style and acting in a manner that is peculiarly similar to Doris's at the beginning of the film. As he waters the orchids in her garden, viewers are told that there were accusations against him that he murdered Doris but that no evidence was found.  Viewers are then told that he died from complications related to his alcoholism three years later.

==Production==
[[Old Westbury Gardens]] served as the setting for Duke's [[Hillsborough Township, New Jersey]] estate known as Duke Farms.

[[Dominick Dunne]] and [[Calvin Trillin]] are seen briefly in [[cameo appearance]]s as board members.

==Controversy==
During the production of ''Bernard and Doris'', Pony Duke and Jason Thomas, the authors of ''Too Rich: The Family Secrets of Doris Duke'' (1996), threatened Balaban with a suit for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/controversy-doris-duke-biopic-article-1.242888&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas contended that Balaban had gone so far as to "invite Pony to the movie's set, so he could say he got the material from Pony in an interview. I told Pony not to go." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/controversy-doris-duke-biopic-article-1.242888&lt;/ref&gt; Balaban, however, denied ever admitting anyone to the set.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/controversy-doris-duke-biopic-article-1.242888&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for Duke's and Thomas' contention was an erroneous entry for ''Bernard and Doris'' in the [[IMDb]], which stated that Balaban's film was a "version" of ''Too Rich''. According to the ''[[NY Daily News]]'', "Balaban says his movie is quite different from the TV flick (whose makers optioned the book title) and that he had nothing to do with IMDB.com's posting." ''Bernard and Doris'', Balaban explained, was entirely based on public records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/controversy-doris-duke-biopic-article-1.242888&lt;/ref&gt; Balaban dismissed the threatened suit, saying: "They can do whatever they like, but I'm not going to lose too much sleep over this."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/controversy-doris-duke-biopic-article-1.242888&lt;/ref&gt; (The IMDb listing has since been corrected.)

An earlier miniseries, ''[[Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke]]'', had been aired by [[CBS]] in February 1999 to less critical acclaim than the later Balaban film. Based largely on the book ''The Richest Girl in the World'' by Stephanie Thomas and a series of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' articles by Bob Colacello, it also listed the Duke-Thomas book in the credits.

==Critical reception==
Ginia Bellafante of ''[[The New York Times]]'' likened the film to "the most delectable kind of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article, one that doesn’t leave you feeling guilty or venal or vaguely nuts for reveling in the particulars of great wealth even as you are made fully aware of all the isolating negatives." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/arts/television/08dori.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Bernard%20and%20Doris&amp;st=cse ''The New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the film a "stunner of a movie [that's] the hip antidote to multiplex junk such as ''[[Mad Money (film)|Mad Money]]'' and ''[[Meet the Spartans]]''. He added, "All praise to director Bob Balaban, who doesn't miss a beat or a nuance in bringing us in, close as a whisper, to what might have been." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/18068033/review/18068043/bernard_and_doris ''Rolling Stone'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "a not-very-compelling two-character piece with showy moments for Susan Sarandon and Ralph Fiennes but not much else to recommend it . . . What the movie does provide is a rare indulgence in long, quiet scenes between the leads, which serve both as a showcase for the actors and a reminder as to how undercooked the script is. For Sarandon, Doris is a slightly less shrewish version of the evil queen she just played in ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', while Fiennes is a model of restraint . . . One can see why HBO would gamble on such a modest pickup based on the names attached. Still, much of what passed privately between employer and servant remains shrouded in mystery, and ''Bernard and Doris'' is ultimately unsatisfying in filling those gaps - real, imagined or otherwise." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936093.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blitz!''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] by [[Lionel Bart]]. The musical, described by [[Steven Suskin]] as "massive", was set in the [[East End of London|East End]] of [[London]] during [[the Blitz]] (the aerial bombings during [[World War II]]). The story drew on Bart's childhood memories of London's Jewish East End during the Blitz and, like most musicals, centred on a romance between a young couple, in this case a [[Jew]]ish woman and a [[Cockney]] man, although the largest role and main point-of-view character is that of Mrs. Blitztein, the young woman's mother.&lt;ref name="Suskin 2005, Mandelbaum 2005"&gt;Suskin 2005, Mandelbaum 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Suskin describes it as "''[[Abie's Irish Rose]]'' set against the [[Atlanta Campaign|burning of Atlanta]]."&lt;ref&gt;Suskin 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Bart himself described the play as "…three human stories inside an epic canvas; the major human conflict&amp;mdash;the major plot&amp;mdash;personifies the spirit of London and how that spirit developed during the period of the piece."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mandelbaum 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
''Blitz!'' opened in [[London]] 8 May 1962 at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], while Bart's enormous [[West End theatre|West End]] success ''[[Oliver!]]'' was still running at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]]; at that time ''Oliver!'' had not yet been produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. ''Blitz'' ran for 568 performances.&lt;ref name="Suskin 2005, Mandelbaum 2005" /&gt; It never ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]: between its scale and the fact that New Yorkers could hardly be expected to share Londoners' nostalgia for the period, it proved "unexportable". Bart wrote the music and lyrics, and had directed the original London production himself; [[Joan Maitland]] contributed to the libretto. [[Sean Kenny (theatre designer)|Sean Kenny]] designed the elaborate sets, which included representations of [[Victoria station (London)|Victoria Station]], [[Petticoat Lane Market|Petticoat Lane]], and the [[Bank–Monument station|Bank underground station]], not to mention London on fire during an air raid. Four revolving house units and an enormous, mobile overhead bridge carried on two shifting towers made it, at the time, the most expensive West End musical ever produced. [[Noël Coward]] called it "twice as loud and twice as long as the real thing."&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum 2005" /&gt;

The song "The Day After Tomorrow" was specially written by Bart for [[Vera Lynn]]. Lynn had been a star at the time of the German bombing attacks; in the play, the characters listen to Lynn sing it on the radio while they shelter underground. Lynn did not actually appear onstage during the production, but she recorded the song for it, and the production used her recording on the "radio".&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum 2005" /&gt; The play also makes use of a recording of a [[Winston Churchill]] radio speech.&lt;ref name="guinness"&gt;''Guinness Stage Musicals''&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Mrs. Blitztein was played by [[Amelia Bayntun]] in the original cast; it was her only role in a stage musical.&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum 2005" /&gt; The cast included a large number of children. There is a scene in which the children are to be evacuated from London; they cheerfully sing "We’re Going To The Country", while their mothers try to put on a cheerful face.&lt;ref name="guinness"/&gt; The children's chorus "Mums and Dads" was a "showstopper"&lt;ref&gt;The Independent, Obituary. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-lionel-bart-1085282.html&lt;/ref&gt; that drew much radio play.

The musical was never seen for many years, largely because the original scores went missing during Bart's turbulent years. It was reassembled in Australia by 19-year-old Andrew Jarrett, a Bart devotee, with orchestrations by Kevin Hocking, Jack Westmore and Stephen Smith. So impressed was Bart, that he came out of obscurity and travelled to Australia for Jarrett's triumphant production in 1985.  [[The Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s intended 1990 revival (for the fiftieth anniversary of the Blitz) never happened, although the National Youth Theatre did revive it in London's West End at the Playhouse Theatre in September 1990 with Jarrett imported as Music Director. This production was directed by Edward Wilson and choreographed by David Toguri, with the role of Mrs. Blitzstein played by [[Jessica Hynes|Jessica Stephenson]] (now Hynes), (now an established UK screen actor). According to the review in ''The Guardian'' "Edward Wilson's production for the NYT is necessarily more modest and contains some beautiful, slate-grey designs from Brian Lee: his backdrop of a soaring-arched Victorian railway terminus is stunning. David Toguri's musical staging shows his customary flair, camouflaging the cast's vocal weaknesses by bringing out their physical athleticism. And Jessica Stevenson as the mob-capped Mrs Blitzstein admirably conveys truculent working-class defiance."&lt;ref&gt;Billington, Michael. "Gimme shelter from this blitz - The Playhouse", ''The Guardian'' (London), September 12, 1990, no page number&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict Nightingale wrote in his review: "But the strongest performance comes from Jessica Stevenson as a Jewish matriarch able to sing a silly song about baking cakes being the answer to all ills, yet remain quietly dignified throughout. Here is an apprentice actress to encourage."&lt;ref&gt;Nightingale, Benedict. "Oh what an average war!", Blitz!, Playhouse, ''The Times'', September 11, 1990, no page number&lt;/ref&gt;  This production became the basis for a touring Northern Stage Company revival starring [[Diane Langton]] as Mrs. Blitztein.&lt;ref name="Mandelbaum 2005"&gt;Mandelbaum 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival production of ''Blitz'' was put on at the Queens Theatre in [[Hornchurch]] in 2000 including members of the Queens Theatre's own youth groups playing many characters alongside the resident cast.

==Plot==
The story focuses on two families, the Jewish Blitzteins and the Cockney Lockes. Mrs. Blitztein and Alfie Locke have adjacent stalls on Petticoat Lane: she sells herring, he sells fruit; they do not like each other. Their children, Georgie Locke and Carol Blitztein, are in love with one another.

;ACT 1
The action opens on Bank underground station where the residents of Petticoat Lane are sheltering from yet another air raid (Our Hotel). Amongst them are the two prominent families of the street, the Blitzteins, led by their patriarchal mother and the Lockes, led by father Alfred.  The two welcome home their respective sons Georgie Locke and Harry Blitztein who are home on embarkation leave for a week before shipping out to fight with the Army. Harry has a new (older) girlfriend in tow, Joyce, who is not only not Jewish but married, much to his mother's horror. Georgie, meanwhile, has caught sight of Mrs Blitztein's daughter Carol, who has grown into a beautiful young woman during his absence and is instantly smitten.

Carol likewise is rather struck by the young soldier and they quickly hit it off, before their parents interfere, resulting in their usual round of bickering which never involves them directly speaking to each other but rather through other people (Tell Him, Tell Her). As the argument settles down, Georgie pulls Harry to one side to inform him that he is in love with Carol. Whilst Harry is not against such a union, he advises against it as he knows there could be trouble (I Wanna Whisper Something). The wireless is put on so the residents can listen to the news, which includes a speech by Winston Churchill, and a song by Vera Lynn (The Day After Tomorrow). Ernie Nearmiss, Alf's best friend and fellow  air raid warden, arrives to inform those in the shelter that the Blackwell's house has been destroyed by a bomb and Mr and Mrs Blackwell were still inside at the time, having refused to go down to the shelter.

Their son Tommy, who is in the shelter with the Blitzteins, is thankfully asleep and doesn't hear, but Mrs Blitztein decides that she will send Tommy with her own son Siddy into the country for safety. Mrs Blitztein then sings Siddy to sleep (Our Hotel Lullaby). The next day, the children of the street, apart from Georgie's sister Franie, are assembled to be evacuated and are waved goodbye by their mums (We're Going to The Country). No sooner have the children gone than the bombings get worse; the firemen and ARP are kept very busy and every morning the residents of Petticoat Lane emerge from the shelter not knowing what to expect, but are determined not to let it get them down (Another Morning). On this particular day, they emerge to find the gas mains have been hit and they are not allowed into their homes. Princlet Street has also been completely destroyed leaving several families homeless, including the Murphys and Sens. Alf takes the Murphys in whilst Mrs Blitztein accommodates the Sens. Mrs Blitztein is very frustrated and begins to have a long rant about Hitler and is soon joined by the others (Who's This Geezer Hitler?) Harry re-appears after a week's disappearance and he is immediately put to work by his mother as punishment for not telling her where he was.

Carol and Georgie manage to get a minute to themselves and it is revealed that they have been spending a lot of time together over the last week. Georgie, prior to leaving for duty the next day, asks Carol if she'll wait for him, but before she can answer their parents appear once again. Mrs Blitztein is in full flow about her children and how they have disappointed her - Carol by breaking off her relationship with a Jewish boy because of Georgie and now Harry for having relations with a married woman (Be What You Wanna Be).  An official appears on the scene to conduct a census of all the people in the area who have foreign sounding names to find out how many there are and how long they've been in the area. Whilst this is going on, Alf and Ernie engage in a patriotic rant (As Long As This Is England). That night, Carol and Georgie sneak out together to spend one last night together before Georgie goes abroad.

Their parents look for them but in vain. Carol and Georgie have a laugh at both their parents and their stubborn ways, and reflect on how the fact they are from such different backgrounds actually make them more suited (Opposites). They are interrupted by the air raid siren, but rather than go down to the shelter, they take cover in a doorway (Magic Doorway). Mrs Blitztein, searching for Harry, discovers them and is not less than impressed. Georgie volunteers to pay Joyce a visit and see if Harry is there. Carol meanwhile goes to find Harry herself, leaving Mrs Blitztein alone with her cake tin (Bake a Cake). She then overhears Buddyboy and Bird in the process of stealing lead pipes and is shocked to discover Harry amongst them. Harry announces to his mother he is not going back to the army as he's had enough. Mrs Blitztein is about to go after him when a bomb goes off nearby, followed by a scream from Carol.

The next day at Victoria Station, Georgie is waiting for Carol to see him off and for Harry to report for duty.  When Harry doesn't show, Elsie, his former girlfriend who is still rather taken with him, tries to buy him time by distracting the Sergeant Major (Leave It To The Ladies). Mrs Blitztein arrives after having been at the hospital with Carol all night and is upset that Harry has not turned up. She informs Georgie that Carol was unable to come and see him off. Georgie informs Mrs Blitztein of his love for Carol and his intention to marry her when he returns, and is surprised when she agrees and seems more gentle towards him than before. The soldiers depart and Mrs Blitztein is left alone.

;ACT 2
Act Two opens six months later with Carol (now blind after the bomb blast) alone on Petticoat Lane, thinking of Georgie, who she has not seen at all in that time (Far Away). The Sunday market is slowly beginning to set up and people are discussing Carol and how the bombing seems to have calmed down at last. Alf is pleased as he's had a letter from Georgie to say he's coming home for good after losing a kidney, and even better he doesn't want Carol or her mother to know he's coming, which Alf believes means he's going to finish with Carol.

The market is soon in full swing (Petticoat Lane) and the children return from the country (We've Been To See The Country). With the children having returned, the market starts its usual business, with Elsie commenting on the variety of people one meets at the Petticoat Lane market (Down The Lane). Carol, who is helping out on her Mum's pickled herring stall, asks Mrs Blitztein if what Franie has told her about Georgie coming home is true. Mrs Blitztein is forced to admit it is. Carol is confused as to why Georgie did not tell her he was coming home and worries that he has gone off her because she is blind. Mrs Blitztein tries to reassure her daughter but is secretly thinking the same thing. The Military Police arrive to enquire about Harry's whereabouts as he is still on the run from the army, followed by Joyce who has not seen Harry herself in a long time. Mrs Blitztein is in despair - her daughter is blind and unhappy and her son is a crook on the run. In a moment of desperation, she offers up a prayer to her late husband Jack, pleading for guidance (So Tell Me Jack).

That evening, the adults are assembling in the pub, leaving the children outside to amuse themselves with a game of Mums and Dads (Mums and Dads). After the other children are scared off by Tommy Blackwell and his horror book, Georgie emerges from the pub very drunk and depressed. Feeling a failure as a soldier, a son and a boyfriend he is drowning his sorrows. He is approached by Harry, who reveals that he has spent the last 6 months working on the black market and hiding from the military but has come back to see Carol having only just heard about what happened in the explosion. Georgie confesses that he too is yet to see Carol and it's clear whilst on one side he wants to see her he's too scared to do so. He makes out that Harry had the right idea running away, missing out on the fighting and death. Harry, on the other hand, seems to be fed up with life on the run and is clearly beginning to wish he had just faced his duty. The two agree to meet up later in the evening due to the area being too public where they are.

Georgie, now alone, goes into a drunken rant (Who Wants To Settle Down). Mrs Blitztein is next to discover him and she welcomes him home while trying to sound him out about Carol. Georgie admits the army was too much for him as all the killing and violence has altered his view on life and Carol probably wouldn't like the new him. Mrs Blitztein rubbishes the whole thing, telling Georgie that everyone has had to put up with the same thing at home and it hasn't changed any of them. She tells Georgie that she's very proud of him for going to fight for them and facing up to his responsibilities, unlike Harry, of whom she is very ashamed. She admits she misjudged Georgie because of her dislike of his father but tells him that she would be proud to have Georgie in her family. Georgie admits he still loves Carol as much as he ever did, if not more, but he doesn't think he's good enough for her. Mrs Blitztein informs him that in Carol's eyes no one else apart from Georgie would be good enough. She goes to fetch Carol, whilst Georgie is reunited with his father and Franie.

Carol is brought to Georgie and the two enjoy an emotional reunion, during which Georgie proposes (Is This Gonna Be A Wedding!). Whilst preparations are made, Harry encounters Mrs Smith, who informs him of the impending marriage. Harry then breaks off his agreement with Buddyboy and Bird. At the wedding (Is This Gonna Be a Wedding! (Reprise)), Alf is still not happy about his son marrying a Blitztein but resigns himself to it, although not without a few snide remarks, particularly towards Mrs Blitztein. Georgie and Carol share their first dance (Far Away (Waltz Reprise)). Harry then appears to congratulate Georgie and Carol and announce he is going to fulfil his rightful duty by returning to the army (Duty Calls). The wedding party depart and Mrs Blitztein is left alone when a bomb hits. She is rescued from the rubble by Alf but neither are very gracious either in thanking or receiving that thanks and they leave still arguing, but in a huge step forward they are conversing directly rather than through other people, and the crowd once again come together in union (Who's This Geezer Hitler? - Reprise). &lt;ref&gt;Mandelbaum 2005, Musical Heaven.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* Mrs Blitztein - Typical Jewish matriarch and self-confessed 'Queen of Petticoat Lane'. Mrs Blitztein has spent her entire life trying to bring up her seven children in the proper Jewish way and very disappointed at the fact that they have all in their own way rebelled. Her rival on the street is fruit &amp; veg man Alf Locke with whom she has an explosive relationship and neither can ever resist making snide comments to the other when they get the chance. Her poor relationship with Alf clouds her judgement of Georgie as a potential husband for Carol but she soon realises she was wrong about him.
* Carol Blitztein - Mrs Blitztein's youngest daughter. She clearly loves her mother very much but is not willing to let her run her life. She is in a sort of relationship with a Jewish boy early in the show but she breaks it off when she falls in love with Georgie Locke. Carol is blinded the night before Georgie goes off to fight whilst looking for her brother during an air raid. When Georgie doesn't tell her he's coming home, she worries he has gone off her but he ends up proposing and she marries him. It is implied at the end that her sight is coming back.
* Harry Blitztein - Harry is the eldest son of Mrs Blitztein. He like all his siblings adores his mum but also finds her a pain and is not above rebellion even to the point of having Georgie Locke as his best friend. Harry is a typical Jack the Lad type and a huge hit with ladies, even the married ones. Harry's philandering ways disappoint his mother enough but he makes it worse when he deserts the army. He spends six months on the run working the black market but soon tires of it and wishes that like Georgie he had faced his duty. He ends up turning himself in.
* Alf Locke - Alf owns the fruit &amp; veg stall at the market and is Mrs Blitztein's nemesis. A World War I veteran he is now Chief ARP Warden and along with his mate Ernie Nearmiss he takes the job very seriously. He is father to Georgie and Franie who he tries to keep on a tight leash with little success. Alf has never been happy about Georgie's friendship with Harry and is less happy about his relationship with Carol. He reluctantly attends his son's wedding and resigns himself to the fact that Georgie has married a Blitztein but unlike Mrs Blitztein he is never entirely happy about it.
* Georgie Locke - Eldest child and only son of Alf.  Georgie is very different from his father, quiet and shy around people especially women.  He joined the army at the start of the war and during basic training he made Lance Corporal.  On returning home he found Carol Blitztein had grown from a girl into a beautiful young woman and he instantly fell for her and spent his weeks leave courting her. Georgie left for the front unaware that Carol had been blinded and was informed by his father in a letter. Georgie is injured in battle and loses one of his kidneys which means he is demobbed and sent home. Feeling a complete failure as a son, soldier and boyfriend he can't bring himself to face Carol and begins to think that Harry had the right idea running away. Mrs Blitztein tells him he's not a failure and she's proud of him for facing his duty unlike Harry. Georgie proposes to Carol and they marry.
* Ernie Nearmiss - Alf's best mate and fellow Warden. He takes the job very seriously and he has a high level of self-importance as result. If he hears about any trouble nearby that requires ARP attention he will head off in a flash to investigate and take charge.
* Elsie - Elsie is Mrs Blitztein's lodger and Harry's on/off girlfriend. Like Harry she is very popular with the opposite sex and has clearly had a string of boyfriends. When the Blackwells are killed in an air raid, Elsie seems to take on guardianship of their son Tommy.

The annual '''CTM Festival''' is a music and visual arts event held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. Founded in 1999, the festival originally focused on [[electronic music]], but has since evolved to cover a wide range of genres under the banner "Festival for Adventurous Music and Art".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctm-festival.de DISK/CTM Festival] Official Website&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing through various shapes and formats over the years, the festival currently takes place as a 10-day long event in which the music program is supplemented by an extensive daytime program of workshops, art installations, panel discussions, screenings and presentations that illustrate the latest artistic, technological and economic developments in music and media cultures.

Distinguishing the festival from many others in its field is the fact that CTM spotlights music’s social role in electronic and digital culture. Through the festival, as well as various events curated by CTM throughout the year, the organization reflects the latest musical currents against a backdrop of new technologies, modern art, historical perspective, and social issues.

'''GENDERTRONICS – DER KÖRPER IN DER ELEKTRONISCHEN MUSIK'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ctm-festival.de/projects/gendertronics/ Gendertronics web page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Edited by CTM and Meike Jansen

When, in the early 50s, electronic music appeared on the scene with the promise of abandoning all physical limits of music-making this was – like much besides – a Promethian male fantasy. Indeed, this music subsequently led to everything but disembodiment. From the psychedelic trances of the 60s and Kraftwerk robotics of the 70s, through to Techno ecstasies, gender-political interventions in the 90s and laptop performance – the questions as to how, from whom, to what ends and in which contexts electronics and the human body might be cable-linked have continually had to be addressed anew.

“Gendertronics” is an in-depth study of questions raised by last year’s festival theme, "Performing Sound", edited by CTM and Meike Jansen and published by Edition [[Suhrkamp Verlag]]. With contributions from [[Olaf Arndt]], Claudia Basrawi, Jochen Bonz &amp; [[Thomas Meinecke]], [[Mariola Brillowska]], [[Kurt Dahlke]], [[Diedrich Diederichsen]], [[Harald Fricke]], [[Tom Holert]], [[Miss Kittin]], Pinky Rose, [[Birgit Richard]], [[Terre Thaemlitz]], [[Marc Weiser]] and 17 black and white drawings by [[Jan Rohlf]]. – In German language only.

'''Chhapar Mela''' is celebrated in the village of Chhapar in the district of [[Ludhiana]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], India every year in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ludhianadistrict.com/mela.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520014916/http://www.ludhianadistrict.com/mela.php |archivedate=2009-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[mela]] (fair), held in the memory of [[Gugga|Gugga Pir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unp.me/f16/mela-chappar-da-17681/|title=Mela Chappar da...|website=www.unp.me|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most popular and spectacular festivals of the [[Malwa (Punjab)|Malwa belt of Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090903/ldh1.htm#7|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Ludhiana Stories|website=www.tribuneindia.com|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People mainly worship the snake embodiment of [[Gugga]] at this fair. The fair falls on the fourth day of the month of Bhadas every year. It is believed that, the Chhapar Fair was started around 150 years ago by a small congregation of devotees. In recent years the number of people attending the fair has risen to millions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalsofindia.in/chappar-mela/#sthash.e3jb2oL6.dpuf|title=Chappar Fair of Punjab, Fair in the Month of September 2015|first=Pan India Internet Pvt|last=Ltd.|website=www.festivalsofindia.in|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minor Chhapar Mela is also held at the same place. The special trend of scooping the land (seven times) is also practised in this fair. People consider digging of land will bring [[Gugga]] Pir to protect them against snakes. The fair has much music, fun and dance. The fair has emerged as a grand festival in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The legend narrates the story of a boy and a snake born together in an agricultural family of Chhapar village. The serpent and the boy were so intimate that if one suffered a pain the other used to cry. One day the mother of the child went to the fields after laying him on a cot. To save him from the scorching sun, the snake stretched its hood over him. Thinking that the snake was going to bite the child, a passerby killed it with a stick. The child died immediately after the death of the snake and the family was left in sorrow. The family was advised by the elders to perform religious ceremonies to worship [[Gugga]] and Sidh and a [[he-goat]] was left free to mark the place of worship by striking at a particular place. The place was recognised as Mari [[Gugga]] where people from all walks of life have been worshipping Gugga on the fourth day of the month of Bhadas every year. The farmers of the [[Malwa, Punjab|Malwa]] belt recognise the fair to the extent that they change the agricultural chores according to the dates of the mela.

People also narrate another story regarding the second fair known as Minor Chhapar Mela. At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[maharaja]] was said to have banned the mela because of a complaint by some farmers. But soon after the ruler banned the event, his horses started dying mysteriously and the misfortune stopped only after the ruler announced plans to organise the Minor Mela following the major one.

According to another story, a [[faqir]] once anchored a twig after cleaning his teeth. A local person uprooted the twig in fun. The faqir then cursed the people of the local area so that the place would witness a heavy camp here, which would be followed by a deserted look.

'''''Christie in Love''''' is  an early [[play (theatre)|play]] by [[Howard Brenton]] concerning the life of [[serial killer]] [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]], who murdered at least six women between 1943 and 1953, after which he was caught, tried and [[hanged]].

==Stage history==
The play, Brenton's first for [[Portable Theatre Company|Portable Theatre]], was directed by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]], designed by [[Tony Bicat]] and the [[stage management]] was by [[Snoo Wilson]]. Hare continued on as director when the play was presented at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]] on 12 March 1970.  [[John Russell Taylor]] reviewed the play favourably in ''The Second Wave'', while [[Ronald Bryden]] in [[The Observer]] noted that “Brenton catches the peculiar cosy horror which surrounded our most sensational murder trial of the fifties”.&lt;ref&gt;''Brenton: Plays One'' [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] 1986 {{ISBN|978-0-413-40430-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play won Brenton the [[John Whiting Award]] for 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMTPAPFGXUC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=christie+in+love+john+whiting+award&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uKYD-8dzXh&amp;sig=1FYSHOlcMOqrGC0GmiZINZDME68&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lqLKSvi4HM2y4QaittXHAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage&amp;q=christie%20in%20love%20john%20whiting%20award&amp;f=false "Cambridge Guide to the Theatre"] Retrieved on 6 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been revivals of the play in 1972 ([[Liverpool Playhouse]], starring [[Colin Baker]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/colinbaker/theatre19691986.htm "Colin Baker Online"] Retrieved on 5 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;); in 2003 starring Paul Dundee, Strath Martin and Paul Pirie [Dundee Rep]&lt;ref&gt;[http://living.scotsman.com/features/Murderer-in-the-dark.2423153.jp "The Scotsman"] Retrieved on 5 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;); and in 2008 ([[Edinburgh Fringe]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/11705-christie-in-love "Edinburgh Festival Guide"] Retrieved on 5 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;).

The play was revived in 2009 in a co-production between Thrill Seeker and Cheekish. It was performed at the Lion and Unicorn from 27 October to 22 November.

==Style==
The author's production note to the play states that “It is written to be played very slowly” and should last nearly an hour.&lt;ref&gt;''Plays for the Poor Theatre'' by [[Howard Brenton]], [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 1980 p.26 {{ISBN|0-413-47080-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portable Theatre was a touring company with limited resources and ''Christie in Love'' was written for these conditions.  Brenton described plays like this as being for the [[poor theatre]] and written “to turn “bad theatrical conditions” to advantage”.&lt;ref&gt;''Plays for the Poor Theatre'' by [[Howard Brenton]], [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], 1980 p.6 {{ISBN|0-413-47080-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|conspiracy of silence}}
A '''conspiracy of silence''', or '''culture of silence''', describes the behavior of a group of people of some size, as large as an entire national group or profession or as small as a group of colleagues, that by unspoken consensus does not mention, discuss, or acknowledge a given subject. The practice may be motivated by positive interest in group solidarity or by such negative impulses as fear of political repercussion or social ostracism. It differs from avoiding a [[taboo]] subject in that the term is applied to more limited social and political contexts rather than to an entire culture. As a descriptor, ''conspiracy of silence'' implies dishonesty, sometimes cowardice, sometimes privileging loyalty to one social group over another. As a social practice, it is rather more extensive than the use of [[euphemisms]] to avoid addressing a topic directly.

Some instances of such a practice are sufficiently well-known or enduring to become known by their own specific terms, including [[Code of silence]] for the refusal of law enforcement officers to speak out against crimes committed by fellow officers and [[omertà]], cultural code of organized crime in [[Sicily]].

== Examples ==
Examples of the use of the term vary widely and include:
*An 1854 report on unrest in Hungary said the rulers of the [[Austrian Empire]] were powerless because "It cannot keep up its infamous rule, but by terror. There is a conspiracy without any doubt spread over the whole country–the conspiracy of silence and watchful expectation....[W]e will patiently await the right moment, and then rise as one man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State of Public Feeling among the Hungarian People|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/03/08/75365874.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2015|work=New York Times|date=8 March 1854}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 1885, London's ''Pall Mall Gazette'' reported that prominent men were patronizing brothels. When authorities accused the paper of obscenity and tried to block its distribution, the paper's editors thanked them for "thereby breaking the conspiracy of silence maintained by the press concerning [their] revelations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stirring London's People |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/07/10/103630123.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2015 |work=New York Times|date=10 July 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The early [[lesbian literature|lesbian novel]] ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' (1928) by [[Radclyffe Hall]] was written to "smash the conspiracy of silence" around [[homosexuality]] and the damage of that silence to the lives of LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Nicole |title=The Censor's Library |date=2012 |publisher=Univ. of Queensland Press |isbn=9780702247729 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYMBq6cHuosC&amp;pg=PT86&amp;lpg=PT86&amp;dq=The+Well+of+Loneliness+conspiracy+of+silence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fi4ePwxYB4&amp;sig=W29Vc1-5AwmPSgGY9NxfmkOhU0w&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi3_JWdtM3cAhWmq1kKHSBgCr0Q6AEwBnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness%20conspiracy%20of%20silence&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase would also be applicable to the [[book ban|banning of the book]] under [[Censorship in the United Kingdom#Laws on obscenity and sexual content|UK censorship laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Sarah A |title=Breaking the code |journal=Index on Censorship |date=September 1998 |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=122–126 |doi=10.1080/03064229808536428 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03064229808536428?journalCode=rioc20 |language=en |issn=0306-4220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A conference of social workers and medical personnel in 1936 urged greater efforts to prevent the spread of [[syphilis]] by New York City and state. An official of the federal government said they needed to bring the problems "out in the open" to overcome a "conspiracy of silence" that prevented public education efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wider Drive Urged on Social Disease|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1936/01/16/85201053.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2015|work=New York Times|date=16 January 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 19 March 1937, Pope [[Pius XI]] used the term in his [[encyclical]] ''[[Divini Redemptoris]]'' to characterize the failure of the non-Catholic press in Western Europe and the U.S. to cover the persecution of Christians in the [[Soviet Union]], [[Mexico]], and [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19031937_divini-redemptoris_en.html ''Divini Redemptoris'', Encyclical of Pope Pius XII on Atheistic Communism], § 18: "A third powerful factor in the diffusion of Communism is the conspiracy of silence on the part of a large section of the non-Catholic press of the world." Accessed 17 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1945, British writer [[George Orwell]] published a novel about totalitarian life, ''[[Animal Farm]].'' It soon became famous. He wrote a preface to the novel, but never published it. It first appeared in 1972. Orwell wrote:
::The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary. Unpopular ideas can be silenced, and inconvenient facts kept dark, without the need for any official ban. Anyone who has lived long in a foreign country will know of instances of sensational items of news—things which on their own merits would get the big headlines—being kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that “it wouldn't do” to mention that particular fact....At this moment what is demanded by the prevailing orthodoxy is an uncritical admiration of Soviet Russia. Everyone knows this, nearly everyone acts on it. Any serious criticism of the Soviet regime, any disclosure of facts which the Soviet Government would prefer to keep hidden, is next door to unprintable.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, "The Freedom of the Press," [https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/08/archives/the-freedom-of-the-press-orwell.html ''New York Times'' OCT. 8, 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Between 1972 and 1994, members of the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] community in Massachusetts were unwilling to share information that would facilitate homicide investigations because of their reliance on vigilante justice, fear of retaliation by criminals, and anti-police sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=January 30, 2015| date=October 29, 1993|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8251301.html |title=The code of silence is cracked in Charlestown }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Conspiracy of Silence]]'', a 1995 PBS documentary about [[domestic violence]] in the United States
* ''Breaking the Conspiracy of Silence: Christian Churches and the Global AIDS Crisis'' (2006), a book criticizing the activities of Christian churches.
* ''Conspiracy of Silence'', a 2004 film drama about the sexual activity of some Irish Roman Catholic clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=Sex, Conspiracy and Suicide: Just Another Day at Church|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/movies/03sile.html|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Political adversaries, according to the ''New York Times'' in 2013, sometimes agree to avoid topics they all find difficult: "But on one topic, there was a conspiracy of silence: Republicans and Democrats agreed that they did not really want to talk about the Iraq war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|title=Iraq War’s 10th Anniversary Is Barely Noted in Washington |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/world/iraq-wars-10th-anniversary-is-barely-noted-in-washington.html |accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Co-workers avoid criticizing a colleague, for example pilots do not report another pilot's alcohol problem: "There is a conspiracy of silence among macho men: 'Don't rat on your buddy.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiner|first=Eric|title=Drunken Flying Persists Despite Treatment Effort|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/14/us/drunken-flying-persists-despite-treatment-effort.html?pagewanted=2|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 14, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The unspoken agreement of journalists and media outlets to suppress coverage of topics that their readers, advertisers, or sources prefer to avoid. Chris Lamb's ''Conspiracy of Silence: Sportswriters and the Long Campaign to Desegregate Baseball'' describes the consistent refusal of white sportswriters to report the decades-long efforts to integrate professional baseball in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The College of Charleston |work=The College Today|url= http://today.cofc.edu/2012/04/23/professor-publishes-book-concerning-the-media-and-baseball-desegregation/ | title= Professor Publishes Book Concerning the Media and Baseball Desegregation | accessdate=January 30, 2015| date= April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Powerful men who have [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] or [[sexual assault|assaulted]] women in the U.S. were able to suppress the cases through [[financial settlement]]s and [[nondisclosure agreements]]. The international reckoning against this norm starting in the entertainment industry in October 2017 became known as the [[Weinstein effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Guynn |first1=Jessica |last2=della Cava |first2=Marco |title=Harvey Weinstein effect: Men are getting outed and some are getting fired as women speak up.

'''Cyberwarfare''' is the use or targeting in a [[battlespace]] or [[warfare]] context of [[computer]]s, online [[control system]]s and [[computer network|network]]s.&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/triton-malware-dangers-industrial-system-sabotage?CNDID=50121752|title=Menacing Malware Shows the Dangers of Industrial System Sabotage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves both offensive and defensive operations pertaining to the threat of [[cyberattack]]s, espionage and sabotage.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; There has been controversy over whether such operations can be called "war". Nevertheless, powers have been developing cyber capabilities and engaged in cyberwarfare, both offensively and defensively, including the [[United States]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[Israel]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Two other notable players are [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/05/who-are-the-cyberwar-superpowers/|title=Who are the cyberwar superpowers?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
A number of definitions of cyber warfare have been proposed, with no single definition being widely adopted internationally. [[Richard A. Clarke]] defines it as "actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption",.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Clarke, Richard A. ''Cyber War'', HarperCollins (2010) {{ISBN|9780061962233}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Martin Libicki defines two types of cyber warfare: strategic and operational, with strategic being "a campaign of cyberattacks one entity carries out on another", whilst operational cyber warfare "involves the use of cyberattacks on the other side’s military in the context of a physical war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Libicki |first=Martin |title=Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar |date=21 October 2009 |ISBN=978-0833047342 |publisher=RAND Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some governments have made it an integral part of their overall military strategy, with some having invested heavily in cyberwarfare capability.&lt;ref name="Lynn"&gt;Lynn, William J. III.

This capability uses the same set of penetration testing methodologies but applies them, in the case of United States doctrine, in a strategic way to
* Prevent cyber attacks against critical infrastructure
* Reduce national vulnerability to cyber attacks
* Minimize damage and recovery time from cyber attacks&lt;ref name="Annex 3-12 Cyberspace Ops" /&gt;

Offensive operations are also part of these national level strategies for officially declared wars as well as undeclared secretive operations.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Farwell and Rafael Rohozinski, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00396338.2011.555586 Stuxnet and the future of cyber war], Survival, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of threat ==
Cyber warfare can present a multitude of threats towards a nation.  At the most basic level, cyber attacks can be used to support traditional warfare.  For example, tampering with the operation of air defences via cyber means in order to facilitate an air attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weinberger |first=Sharon |title=How Israel Spoofed Syria's Air Defense System |publisher=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2007/10/how-israel-spoo/ |date=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from these "hard" threats, cyber warfare can also contribute towards "soft" threats such as espionage and propaganda.

=== Espionage ===
Traditional espionage is not an act of war, nor is cyber-espionage, and both are generally assumed to be ongoing between major powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csis.org/files/publication/100425_Laws%20of%20War%20Applicable%20to%20Cyber%20Conflict.pdf "A Note on the Laws of War in Cyberspace"], James A. Lewis, April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this assumption, some incidents can cause serious tensions between nations, and are often described as "attacks". For example:

* [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)#Disclosures|Massive spying by the US]] on many countries, revealed by [[Edward Snowden]].
* After the NSA's spying on Germany's Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] was revealed, the Chancellor compared the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with the [[Stasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rayman|first=Noah|title=Merkel Compared NSA To Stasi in Complaint To Obama|url=http://world.time.com/2013/12/18/nsa-leaks-germany-merkel-obama-stasi/|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The NSA recording nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas, without the Bahamian government's permission, and similar programs in [[Kenya]], the [[Philippines]], [[Mexico]] and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="data pirates"&gt;{{cite web| first1=Ryan |last1=Devereaux |first2=Glenn |last2=Greenwald |first3=Laura |last3=Poitras| url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/ |title=Data Pirates of the Caribbean: The NSA Is Recording Every Cell Phone Call in the Bahamas |work=[[The Intercept]] |publisher=[[First Look Media]] |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zach |last=Schonfeld |title=The Intercept Wouldn't Reveal a Country the U.S. Is Spying On, So WikiLeaks Did Instead |url=http://www.newsweek.com/intercept-wouldnt-reveal-country-us-spying-so-wikileaks-did-instead-252320 |work=Newsweek |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sabotage ===
Computers and [[satellites]] that coordinate other activities are vulnerable components of a system and could lead to the disruption of equipment. Compromise of military systems, such as [[C4ISTAR]] components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to their interception or malicious replacement. Power, water, fuel, communications, and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption. According to Clarke, the civilian realm is also at risk, noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers, and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid, trains, or the stock market.&lt;ref name=Clark2&gt;[http://www.hometownannapolis.com/news/top/2010/09/24-11/Clarke-More-defense-needed-in-cyberspace.html "Clarke: More defense needed in cyberspace"] HometownAnnapolis.com, 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July 2010, security experts discovered a malicious software program called [[Stuxnet]] that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world. It is considered "the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies," notes ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/malware-hits-computerized-industrial-equipment/ "Malware Hits Computerized Industrial Equipment"]. ''The New York Times'', 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stuxnet]], while extremely effective in delaying Iran's nuclear program for the development of nuclear weaponry, came at a high cost.  For the first time, it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive.  The large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective.  Non-state actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors, which leads to dangerous, sometimes disastrous, consequences.  Small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies.  A major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation.  This allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage.  In addition, thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=P.W. |last2=Friedman |first2=Allan |date=2014 |title=Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=156 |isbn=978-0-19-991809-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denial-of-service attack ====
{{Main|Denial-of-service attack}}
In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Perpetrators of DoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks, credit card payment gateways, and even root nameservers. DoS attacks may not be limited to computer-based methods, as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating. For example, cutting undersea communication cables may severely cripple some regions and countries with regards to their information warfare ability.

==== Electrical power grid ====
The [[federal government of the United States]] admits that the [[electric power transmission|electric power grid]] is susceptible to cyberwarfare.&lt;ref&gt;Shiels, Maggie.

The Raw Story (8 April 2009). Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Massive [[power outage]]s caused by a cyber attack could disrupt the economy, distract from a simultaneous military attack, or create a [[national trauma]].

[[Howard Schmidt]], former Cyber-Security Coordinator of the US, commented on those possibilities:&lt;ref name=Wired&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/schmidt-cyberwar/ "White House Cyber Czar: 'There Is No Cyberwar'"]. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', 4 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's possible that [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s have gotten into administrative computer systems of utility companies, but says those aren't linked to the equipment controlling the grid, at least not in developed countries. [Schmidt] has never heard that the grid itself has been hacked.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 23 December 2015, what is believed to be a first known successful [[Ukraine power grid cyber attack|cyber attack on a power grid]] took place in Ukraine leading to temporary blackouts.&lt;ref name="ty"&gt;{{cite web

=== Propaganda ===
Cyber propaganda is an effort to control information in whatever form it takes, and influence public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39062663|title=Russian military admits significant cyber-war effort|date=21 February 2017|work=bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[psychological warfare]], except it uses [[social media]], [[fake news website]]s and other digital means.  In 2018, Sir Nicholas Carter, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army stated that this kind of attack from actors such as Russia "is a form of system warfare that seeks to de-legitimise the political and social system on which our military strength is based".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dynamic Security Threats and the British Army |url=https://rusi.org/event/dynamic-security-threats-and-british-army |date=22 January 2018 |publisher=RUSI |last=Carter |first=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jowell and O'Donnell (2006) state that "propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist" (p.&amp;nbsp;7). The internet is a phenomenal means of communication. People can get their message across to a huge audience, and with this opens a window for evil. Terrorist organizations can use this medium to brainwash people. It has been suggested that restricted media coverage of terrorist attacks would in turn decrease the number of terrorist attacks that occur afterwards (Cowen 2006).

===Economic disruption===
In 2017, the [[WannaCry ransomware attack|WannaCry]] and [[Petya (malware)|Petya (NotPetya)]] cyber attacks, masquerading as ransomware, caused large-scale disruptions in Ukraine as well as to the U.K.’s Nation Health Service, pharmaceutical giant [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], [[Maersk]] shipping company and other organizations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://tech.newstatesman.com/security/notpetya-global-ransomware-attack-kaspersky-ransomware&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/07/05/how-similar-are-wannacry-and-petya-ransomware/#29ace4b346eb|title=How Similar Are WannaCry And Petya Ransomware?|last=Quora|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techrepublic.com/article/notpetya-ransomware-outbreak-cost-merck-more-than-300m-per-quarter/|title=NotPetya ransomware outbreak cost Merck more than $300M per quarter|work=TechRepublic|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/ransomware-hackers.html|title=Cyberattack Hits Ukraine Then Spreads Internationally|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These threats have been recognized as the onset of the fifth generation cyber attacks.

== Motivations ==
=== Military ===
In the U.S., General [[Keith B. Alexander]], first head of [[United States Cyber Command|USCYBERCOM]], told the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] that computer network warfare is evolving so rapidly that there is a "mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies. [[Cyber Command]] is the newest global combatant and its sole mission is cyberspace, outside the traditional battlefields of land, sea, air and space." It will attempt to find and, when necessary, neutralize cyberattacks and to defend military computer networks.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Alexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command, listing the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack, including "traditional battlefield prizes – command-and-control systems at military headquarters, air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/world/15military.html?nl=technology&amp;emc=techupdateema1 "Cyber-War Nominee Sees Gaps in Law"], ''The New York Times'', 14 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One cyber warfare scenario, [[Cyber ShockWave]], which was [[Military simulation|wargame]]d on the cabinet level by former administration officials, raised issues ranging from the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to the [[power grid]] to the limits of statutory authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/news/press-releases/2010/02/cyber-shockwave-shows-us-unprepared-cyber-threats Cyber ShockWave Shows U.S. Unprepared For Cyber Threats].

The distributed nature of internet based attacks means that it is difficult to determine motivation and attacking party, meaning that it is unclear when a specific act should be considered an act of war.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Ragan [http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201007/5245/Report-The-Cyber-ShockWave-and-its-aftermath Report: The Cyber ShockWave event and its aftermath] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722190129/http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201007/5245/Report-The-Cyber-ShockWave-and-its-aftermath |date=22 July 2011 }}. ''The Tech Herald''. 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cyberwarfare driven by political motivations can be found worldwide. In 2008, Russia began a cyber attack on the Georgian government website, which was carried out along with Georgian military operations in South Ossetia. In 2008, Chinese 'nationalist [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]' attacked CNN as it reported on Chinese repression on Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Andy (1 May 2012).

Jobs in cyberwarfare have become increasingly popular in the military. All four branches of the United States military actively recruit for cyber warfare positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/careers/information-and-technology/cyber-warfare-engineer.html|title=Become a Naval Cyber Warfare Engineer (CWE) : Navy.com|website=www.navy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil ===
Potential targets in internet sabotage include all aspects of the Internet from the [[Internet backbone|backbones]] of the web, to the [[internet service provider]]s, to the varying types of data communication mediums and network equipment. This would include: web servers, enterprise information systems, client server systems, communication links, network equipment, and the desktops and laptops in businesses and homes. [[Electrical grid]]s, financial networks, and [[telecommunication systems]] are also deemed vulnerable, especially due to current trends in computerization and automation.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Financial Weapons of War|first=Tom C. W.|last=Lin|date=14 April 2016|journal=Minnesota Law Review|volume=100|pages=1377–1440|ssrn=2765010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hacktivism ===
Politically motivated [[hacktivism]] involves the subversive use of computers and [[computer network]]s to promote an agenda, and can potentially extend to attacks, theft and virtual sabotage that could be seen as cyberwarfare – or mistaken for it.&lt;ref&gt;Denning, D. E. (2008). [http://faculty.nps.edu/dedennin/publications/Ethics%20of%20Cyber%20Conflict.pdf The ethics of cyber conflict. The Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics]. 407–429.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hacktivists use their knowledge and software tools to gain unauthorized access to computer systems they seek to manipulate or damage not for material gain or to cause widespread destruction, but to draw attention to their cause through well-publicized disruptions of select targets. Anonymous and other hacktivist groups are often portrayed in the media as cyber-terrorists, wreaking havoc by hacking websites, posting sensitive information about their victims, and threatening further attacks if their demands are not met. However, hacktivism is more than that. They are politically motivated to change the world, through the use of fundamentalism. Groups like Anonymous have divided opinion with their methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenney|first1=Michael|title=Cyber-Terrorism in a Post-Stuxnet World|journal=Orbis|date=2015|volume=59|issue=1|pages=111–128|doi=10.1016/j.orbis.2014.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Cyber-arms industry|Market for zero-day exploits}}
Computer hacking represents a modern threat in ongoing global conflicts and [[industrial espionage]] and as such is presumed to widely occur.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; It is typical that this type of crime is underreported to the extent they are known. According to McAfee's George Kurtz, corporations around the world face millions of cyberattacks a day. "Most of these [[attack (computing)|attacks]] don't gain any media attention or lead to strong political statements by victims."&lt;ref name=McAfee&gt;[http://siblog.mcafee.com/cto/google-attack-is-tip-of-iceberg/ "Google Attack Is Tip Of Iceberg"], McAfee Security Insights, 13 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This type of crime is usually financially motivated.

But not all examinations with the issue of cyberwarfare are achieving profit or personal gain. There are still institutes and companies like the [[University of Cincinnati]] or the [[Kaspersky Security Lab]] which are trying to increase the sensibility of this topic by researching and publishing of new security threats.

A 2008 article in the ''Culture Mandala: The Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies'' by Jason Fritz alleges that the Chinese government from 1995 to 2008 was involved in a number of high-profile cases of espionage, primarily through the use of a "decentralized network of students, business people, scientists, diplomats, and engineers from within the Chinese Diaspora".&lt;ref name="epublications.bond.edu.au"/&gt; A defector in Belgium, purportedly an agent, claimed that there were hundreds of spies in industries throughout Europe, and on his defection to Australia Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin said there were over 1,000 such in that country.

While China continues to be held responsible for a string of cyber-attacks on a number of public and private institutions in the United States, India, Russia, Canada, and France, the Chinese government denies any involvement in cyber-spying campaigns. The administration maintains the position that China is not the threat but rather the victim of an increasing number of cyber-attacks.

In response to reports of cyberattacks by China against the United States, [[Amitai Etzioni]] of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that China and the United States agree to a policy of mutually assured restraint with respect to cyberspace. This would involve allowing both states to take the measures they deem necessary for their self-defense while simultaneously agreeing to refrain from taking offensive steps; it would also entail vetting these commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, Amitai (September 20, 2013).

[[Operation Shady RAT]] is an ongoing series of [[cyber attack]]s starting mid-2006, reported by Internet security company [[McAfee]] in August 2011.

{{see also|National Cyber Security Policy 2013}}
The Department of Information Technology created the [[Indian Computer Emergency Response Team]] (CERT-In) in 2004 to thwart cyber attacks in India.&lt;ref name="businesstoday.intoday.in"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/india-cyber-security-at-risk/1/191786.html |title= Beware of the bugs: Can cyber attacks on India's critical infrastructure be thwarted? |work= BusinessToday |accessdate= January 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, there were 23 reported cyber security breaches. In 2011, there were 13,301. That year, the government created a new subdivision, the [[National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre]] (NCIIPC) to thwart attacks against energy, transport, banking, telecom, defence, space and other sensitive areas.

The Executive Director of the [[Nuclear Power Corporation of India]] (NPCIL) stated in February 2013 that his company alone was forced to block up to ten targeted attacks a day. CERT-In was left to protect less critical sectors.

A high-profile cyber attack on 12 July 2012 breached the email accounts of about 12,000 people, including those of officials from the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External Affairs]], [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO), and the [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police]] (ITBP).&lt;ref name="businesstoday.intoday.in" /&gt; A government-private sector plan being overseen by [[National Security Advisor (India)|National Security Advisor]] (NSA) [[Shivshankar Menon]] began in October 2012, and intends to beef up India's cyber security capabilities in the light of a group of experts findings that India faces a 470,000 shortfall of such experts despite the country's reputation of being an IT and software powerhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-10-16/india/34498075_1_cyber-security-cyber-attacks-cyber-warfare|title=5 lakh cyber warriors to bolster India's e-defence|date=16 October 2012|work=The Times of India|location=India|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Information Technology Secretary J. Satyanarayana stated that the [[National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre|NCIIPC]]{{page needed|date=November 2013}} was finalizing policies related to national cyber security that would focus on domestic security solutions, reducing exposure through foreign technology.&lt;ref name="businesstoday.intoday.in" /&gt; Other steps include the isolation of various security agencies to ensure that a synchronised attack could not succeed on all fronts and the planned appointment of a National Cyber Security Coordinator. As of that month, there had been no significant economic or physical damage to India related to cyber attacks.

On 26 November 2010, a group calling itself the Indian Cyber Army hacked the websites belonging to the Pakistan Army and the others belong to different ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Pakistan Computer Bureau, Council of Islamic Ideology, etc. The attack was done as a revenge for the [[Mumbai terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/83967/36-government-websites-hacked-by-indian-cyber-army/ "36 government sites hacked by 'Indian Cyber Army'"].

The Chinese are being blamed after a cybersecurity company, F-Secure Labs, found a malware, NanHaiShu, which targeted the Philippines Department of Justice. It sent information in an infected machine to a server with a Chinese IP address.

When Russia was still a part of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1982, a portion of its [[Trans-Siberian Pipeline|Trans-Siberia pipeline]] within its territory exploded, allegedly due to computer malware implanted in the pirated Canadian software by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. The malware caused the SCADA system running the pipeline to malfunction. The "Farewell Dossier" provided information on this attack, and wrote that compromised computer chips would become a part of Soviet military equipment, flawed turbines would be placed in the gas pipeline, and defective plans would disrupt the output of chemical plants and a tractor factor. This caused the "most monumental nonnuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space." However, the Soviet Union did not blame the United States for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Cyber War|last=Mazanec|first=Brain M.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2015|isbn=9781612347639|location=USA|pages=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the South Korean company [[SK Communications]] was hacked, resulting in the theft of the personal details (including names, phone numbers, home and email addresses and resident registration numbers) of up to 35 million people. A trojaned software update was used to gain access to the SK Communications network.

With ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of Korea)|South Korea's defense ministry]] stated that South Korea was going to improve cyber-defense strategies in hopes of preparing itself from possible cyber attacks. In March 2013, South Korea's major banks – Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank and NongHyup Bank – as well as many broadcasting stations – KBS, YTN and MBC – were hacked and more than 30,000 computers were affected; it is one of the biggest attacks South Korea has faced in years.&lt;ref name="Global Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/130320/south-korea-police-investigating-server-outages-at-major-tv-net|title=South Korea raises alert after hackers attack broadcasters, banks|last=Lee|first=Se Young|work=Global Post|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it remains uncertain as to who was involved in this incident, there has been immediate assertions that North Korea is connected, as it threatened to attack South Korea's government institutions, major national banks and traditional newspapers numerous times – in reaction to the sanctions it received from nuclear testing and to the continuation of [[Foal Eagle]], South Korea's annual joint military exercise with the United States. North Korea's cyber warfare capabilities raise the alarm for South Korea, as North Korea is increasing its manpower through military academies specializing in hacking. Current figures state that South Korea only has 400 units of specialized personnel, while North Korea has more than 3,000 highly trained hackers; this portrays a huge gap in cyber warfare capabilities and sends a message to South Korea that it has to step up and strengthen its Cyber Warfare Command forces. Therefore, in order to be prepared from future attacks, South Korea and the United States will discuss further about deterrence plans at the Security Consultative Meeting (SCM). At SCM, they plan on developing strategies that focuses on accelerating the deployment of ballistic missiles as well as fostering its defense shield program, known as the Korean Air and Missile Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/04/01/20/0301000000AEN20130401004000315F.HTML|title=S.

They distributed an infected version of an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]] whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|D-30 Howitzer]] artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the [[X Agent (spyware)|X-Agent]] spyware and posted online on military forums. The attack was claimed by CrowdStrike to be successful, with more than 80% of Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers destroyed, the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army (a percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the [[Ukrainian Armed Forces]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraines-military-denies-russian-hack-attack-143419289.html Ukraine's military denies Russian hack attack] , [[Yahoo!

The Snake tool kit began spreading into Ukrainian computer systems in 2010. It performed Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), as well as highly sophisticated Computer Network Attacks (CNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Cyber War|last=Mazanec|first=Brain M.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2015|isbn=9781612347639|location=USA|pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iran]] has been both victim and predator of several cyberwarfare operations. Iran is considered an emerging [[Great power|military power]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flashcritic.com/irans-military-preparing-for-cyber-warfare/|title=  Iran's military is preparing for cyber warfare |publisher=Flash//CRITIC Cyber Threat News|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, [[Iran]] was attacked by the [[Stuxnet]] worm, thought to specifically target its [[Nuclear program of Iran|Natanz nuclear enrichment facility.]] It was a 500-kilobyte computer worm that infected at least 14 industrial sites in Iran, including the Natanz uranium-enrichment plant. Although the official authors of Stuxnet haven’t been officially identified, Stuxnet is believed to be developed and deployed by the United States and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denning|first=Dorothy E.|date=2012-07-16|title=Stuxnet: What Has Changed?|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/3/672|journal=Future Internet|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=672–687|doi=10.3390/fi4030672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worm is said to be the most advanced piece of malware ever discovered and significantly increases the profile of cyberwarfare.&lt;ref&gt;AFP (1 October 2010).

==== Israel ====
In the 2006 war against [[Hezbollah]], Israel alleges that cyber-warfare was part of the conflict, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) intelligence estimates several countries in the Middle East used Russian hackers and scientists to operate on their behalf. As a result, Israel attached growing importance to cyber-tactics, and became, along with the U.S., France and a couple of other nations, involved in cyber-war planning. Many international high-tech companies are now locating research and development operations in Israel, where local hires are often veterans of the IDF's elite computer units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/features/0,15240,210486,00.html "Israel Adds Cyber-Attack to IDF"], Military.com, 10 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A.

Following US President [[Donald Trump]]'s decision to pull out of the [[Iran nuclear deal]] in May 2018, cyber warfare units in the United States and Israel monitoring internet traffic out of Iran noted a surge in retaliatory cyber attacks from Iran. sSecurity firms warned that Iranian hackers were sending emails containing malware to diplomats who work in the foreign affairs offices of US allies and employees at telecommunications companies, trying to infiltrate their computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/without-the-nuclear-deal-iranian-cyber-attacks-resume-20180512-p4zewk.html Without the nuclear deal, Iranian cyber attacks resume]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saudi Arabia ====
On August 15, 2012 at 11:08 am local time, the [[Shamoon]] virus began destroying over 35,000 computer systems, rendering them inoperable. The virus used to target the [[Saudi]] government by causing destruction to the state owned national oil company [[Saudi Aramco]]. The attackers posted a pastie on PasteBin.com hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring, citing oppression and the Al-Saud regime as a reason behind the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |id= Cutting Sword of Justice |title= Pastie: 'Untitled' |url= https://pastebin.com/HqAgaQRj |accessdate=3 November 2017 |date= 15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Pastie Cutting Sword of Justice.png |thumb|Pastie announcing attack against Saudi Aramco by a group called Cutting Sword of Justice]] The attack was well staged according to [[Chris Kubecka]], a former security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jose Pagliery:The inside story of the biggest hack in history |url= http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/05/technology/aramco-hack/index.html |date=5 August 2015 |accessdate= 19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an unnamed Saudi Aramco employee on the Information Technology team which opened a malicious phishing email, allowing initial entry into the computer network around mid-2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chris Kubecka: How to Implement IT Security after a Cyber Meltdown |date= 29 December 2015 |id= Accessed 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 August 2012. The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 August 2012. However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 September 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to backed business systems still inoperable. 
[[File:Petrol truck shipments halted during Shamoon attacks on 1 September 2012.png|thumb|Tanker trucks unable to be loaded with gasoline due to Shamoon attacks]]

On August 29, 2012 the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin.com, taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network. The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for the CEO Khalid Al- Falih&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pastebin.com/AtN7dLeW |title= Saudi Aramco hug, another one |date= 29 August 2012 |accessdate= 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie.

According to Kubecka, in order to restore operations. Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world's hard drives, driving the price up. New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation. By September 1, 2012 gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia 17 days after the August 15th attack. [[RasGas]] was also affected by a different variant, crippling them in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Youtube - Chris Kubecka: How to Implement IT Security after a Cyber Meltdown |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyMobr_TDSI |date= 3 August 2015 |accessdate= 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times''. 31 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cyberwarfare was, for the first time, considered a larger threat than [[Al Qaeda]] or terrorism, by many U.S. intelligence officials.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Dilanian, Ken.

U.S. government security expert [[Richard A. Clarke]], in his book ''Cyber War'' (May 2010), defines "cyberwarfare" as "actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption."&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;{{rp|6}} ''The Economist'' describes [[cyberspace]] as "the fifth domain of warfare,"&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16481504?story_id=16481504&amp;source=features_box1 "Cyberwar: War in the Fifth Domain"] ''Economist'', 1 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William J.

[which] has become just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space."&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt;

In 2009, president Barack Obama declared America's digital infrastructure to be a "strategic national asset," and in May 2010 the Pentagon set up its new U.S. Cyber Command ([[United States Cyber Command|USCYBERCOM]]), headed by General [[Keith B. Alexander]], director of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), to defend American military networks and attack other countries' systems. The EU has set up [[ENISA]] (European Union Agency for Network and Information Security) which is headed by Prof. Udo Helmbrecht and there are now further plans to significantly expand ENISA's capabilities. The United Kingdom has also set up a cyber-security and "operations centre" based in [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), the British equivalent of the NSA. In the U.S. however, Cyber Command is only set up to protect the military, whereas the government and corporate infrastructures are primarily the responsibility respectively of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and private companies.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

In February 2010, top American lawmakers warned that the "threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and computer networks was sharply on the rise."&lt;ref name=Lipman/&gt; According to The Lipman Report, numerous key sectors of the U.S. economy along with that of other nations, are currently at risk, including cyber threats to public and private facilities, banking and finance, transportation, manufacturing, medical, education and government, all of which are now dependent on computers for daily operations.&lt;ref name=Lipman&gt;[http://www.guardsmark.com/library/computer_security.asp?nav=4&amp;subnav=1 The Lipman Report], 15 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, president Obama stated that "cyber intruders have probed our electrical grids."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Richard.

''The Economist'' writes that China has plans of "winning informationised wars by the mid-21st century". They note that other countries are likewise organizing for cyberwar, among them Russia, Israel and North Korea. Iran boasts of having the world's second-largest cyber-army.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt; James Gosler, a government cybersecurity specialist, worries that the U.S. has a severe shortage of [[computer security]] specialists, estimating that there are only about 1,000 qualified people in the country today, but needs a force of 20,000 to 30,000 skilled experts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128574055 "Cyberwarrior Shortage Threatens U.S. Security"].

In January 2012, [[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]], the former director of national intelligence at the [[National Security Agency]] under president [[George W.

In August 2010, the U.S. for the first time warned publicly about the Chinese military's use of civilian computer experts in clandestine cyber attacks aimed at American companies and government agencies. The Pentagon also pointed to an alleged China-based computer spying network dubbed [[GhostNet]] that was revealed in a research report last year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/pubs/pdfs/2010_CMPR_Final.pdf ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2010].

The [[United States Department of Defense]] sees the use of computers and the Internet to conduct warfare in [[cyberspace]] as a threat to national security. The [[United States Joint Forces Command]] describes some of its attributes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cyberspace technology is emerging as an "instrument of power" in societies, and is becoming more available to a country's opponents, who may use it to attack, degrade, and disrupt communications and the flow of information. With low barriers to entry, coupled with the anonymous nature of activities in cyberspace, the list of potential adversaries is broad.  Furthermore, the globe-spanning range of cyberspace and its disregard for national borders will challenge legal systems and complicate a nation's ability to deter threats and respond to contingencies.&lt;ref name=JOE/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2010, the [[United States Joint Forces Command]] released a study which included a summary of the threats posed by the internet:&lt;ref name=JOE&gt;[http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2010/JOE_2010_o.pdf "The Joint Operating Environment"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810043238/http://www.jfcom.mil/newslink/storyarchive/2010/JOE_2010_o.pdf |date=10 August 2013 }}, Joint Forces Command, 18 February 2010, pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With very little investment, and cloaked in a veil of anonymity, our adversaries will inevitably attempt to harm our national interests. Cyberspace will become a main front in both irregular and traditional conflicts. Enemies in cyberspace will include both states and non-states and will range from the unsophisticated amateur to highly trained professional hackers. Through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains. In much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of World War II, cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication. Indeed, adversaries have already taken advantage of computer networks and the power of information technology not only to plan and execute savage acts of terrorism, but also to influence directly the perceptions and will of the U.S. Government and the American population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the hardest issues in cyber counterintelligence is the problem of attribution. Unlike conventional warfare, figuring out who is behind an attack can be very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, John.

== Controversy over terms ==
There is debate on whether the term "cyberwarfare" is accurate.

[[Eugene Kaspersky]], founder of [[Kaspersky Lab]], concludes that "[[cyberterrorism]]" is a more accurate term than "cyberwar". He states that "with today's attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again. It's not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism."&lt;ref name=Kaspersky1&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/experts-we-lost-the-cyber-war-now-were-in-the-era-of-cyber-terror/ "Latest viruses could mean 'end of world as we know it,' says man who discovered Flame"], ''The Times of Israel'', 6 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He also equates large-scale [[cyber weapon]]s, such as [[Flame (malware)|Flame]] and [[NetTraveler]] which his company discovered, to [[biological weapons]], claiming that in an interconnected world, they have the potential to be equally destructive.&lt;ref name=Kaspersky1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaspersky2&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/new-cyber-bug-targeting-middle-east-but-israel-untouched-so-far/ "Cyber espionage bug attacking Middle East, but Israel untouched — so far"], ''The Times of Israel'', 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011 the ''[[Journal of Strategic Studies]]'', a leading journal in that field, published an article by [[Thomas Rid]], "Cyber War Will Not Take Place" which argued that all politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of sabotage, espionage, or subversion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rid|first=Thomas|title=Cyber War Will Not Take Place|journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|date=October 2011|doi=10.1080/01402390.2011.608939|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2011.608939|accessdate=21 October 2011|volume=35|pages=5–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and that it is unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future.

[[Howard Schmidt]], an American cybersecurity expert, argued in March 2010 that "there is no cyberwar... I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment."&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

Other experts, however, believe that this type of activity already constitutes a war. The warfare analogy is often seen intended to motivate a militaristic response when that is not necessarily appropriate. Ron Deibert, of Canada's Citizen Lab, has warned of a "militarization of cyberspace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deibert|first=Ron|title=Tracking the emerging arms race in cyberspace|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|year=2011|volume=67|issue=1|doi=10.1177/0096340210393703|url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/1/1|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European cybersecurity expert Sandro Gaycken argued for a middle position. He considers cyberwar from a legal perspective an unlikely scenario, due to the reasons lined out by Rid (and, before him, Sommer),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sommer|first=Peter|title=Reducing Systemic Cybersecurity Risk|journal=OECD Multi-Displinary Issues|date=January 2011|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/3/42/46894657.pdf|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the situation looks different from a strategic point of view. States have to consider military-led cyber operations an attractive activity, within and without war, as they offer a large variety of cheap and risk-free options to weaken other countries and strengthen their own positions. Considered from a long-term, geostrategic perspective, cyber offensive operations can cripple whole economies, change political views, agitate conflicts within or among states, reduce their military efficiency and equalize the capacities of high-tech nations to that of low-tech nations, and use access to their critical infrastructures to blackmail them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaycken|first=Sandro|title=Cyberwar – Das Internet als Kriegsschauplatz|year=2010|url=https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&amp;backPID=178&amp;tt_products=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/08/elections-in-ghana-marred-by-hacked-website-and-calls-for-the-president-to-concede/--&gt;

Oxford academic Lucas Kello proposed a new term – "unpeace" – to denote highly damaging cyber actions whose non-violent effects do not rise to the level of traditional war. Such actions are neither warlike nor peacelike. Although they are non-violent, and thus not acts of war, their damaging effects on the economy and society may be greater than even some armed attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kello |first=Lucas |date=2017 |title=The Virtual Weapon and International Order |location=New Haven, Conn. |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=77–79 |isbn=9780300220230 |url=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300220230/virtual-weapon-and-international-order}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Politics of Cyberspace: Grasping the Danger |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21727048-academia-still-grappling-problems-beset-computers-and-networks |magazine=The Economist |location=London |publisher= |date=26 August 2017 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a ''cyber Pearl Harbor'' has been debated by scholars, drawing an analogy to the historical act of war.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Robert Kenneth.

Intelligence and National Security (2017): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have used ''cyber 9/11'' to draw attention to the nontraditional, asymmetric, or irregular aspect of cyber action against a state.&lt;ref&gt;Arquilla, John.

== Legal issues ==
Various parties have attempted to come up with international legal frameworks to clarify what is and is not acceptable, but none have yet been widely accepted.

The [[Tallinn Manual]], published in 2013, is an academic, non-binding study on how international law, in particular the [[jus ad bellum]] and [[international humanitarian law]], apply to cyber conflicts and [[cyber warfare]]. It was written at the invitation of the [[Tallinn]]-based [[NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence]] by an international group of approximately twenty experts between 2009 and 2012.

The [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] (members of which include China and Russia) defines cyberwar to include dissemination of information "harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states". In September 2011, these countries proposed to the UN Secretary General a document called "International code of conduct for information security".&lt;ref&gt;Russian Embassy to the UK [http://www.rusemb.org.uk/policycontact/49]. Retrieved 25 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the United States' approach focuses on physical and economic damage and injury, putting political concerns under [[freedom of speech]]. This difference of opinion has led to reluctance in the West to pursue global cyber arms control agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130052701 | title=Seeing The Internet As An 'Information Weapon' | publisher=NPR | author= Tom Gjelten | date=23 September 2010 | accessdate=23 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, American General [[Keith B. Alexander]] did endorse talks with Russia over a proposal to limit military attacks in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, Siobhan. (4 June 2010) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703340904575284964215965730?KEYWORDS=cybersecurity WSJ: U.S. Backs Talks on Cyber Warfare]. ''The Wall Street Journal''. Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, [[Barack Obama]] and [[Vladimir Putin]] agreed to install a secure ''Cyberwar-Hotline'' providing "a direct secure voice communications line between the US cybersecurity coordinator and the Russian deputy secretary of the security council, should there be a need to directly manage a crisis situation arising from an [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] security incident" (White House quote).&lt;ref name="arshotline"&gt;Sean Gallagher, [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/us-russia-to-install-cyber-hotline-to-prevent-accidental-cyberwar/ ''US, Russia to install "cyber-hotline" to prevent accidental cyberwar''], Arstechnica, 18 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A Ukrainian professor of International Law, Alexander Merezhko, has developed a project called the International Convention on Prohibition of Cyberwar in Internet. According to this project, cyberwar is defined as the use of Internet and related technological means by one state against the political, economic, technological and information sovereignty and independence of another state. Professor Merezhko's project suggests that the Internet ought to remain free from warfare tactics and be treated as an international landmark. He states that the Internet (cyberspace) is a "common heritage of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politik.org.ua/vid/publcontent.php3?y=7&amp;p=57 Український центр політичного менеджменту – Зміст публікації – Конвенция о запрещении использования кибервойны] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007185753/http://www.politik.org.ua/vid/publcontent.php3?y=7&amp;p=57 |date=7 October 2011 }}. Politik.org.ua. Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the February 2017 [[RSA Conference]] [[Microsoft]] president Brad Smith suggested global rules – a "Digital Geneva Convention" – for cyber attacks that "ban the nation-state hacking of all the civilian aspects of our economic and political infrastructures". He also stated that an independent organization could investigate and publicly disclose evidence that attributes nation-state attacks to specific countries. Furthermore, he said that the technology sector should collectively and neutrally work together to protect Internet users and pledge to [[corporate warfare|remain neutral in conflict]] and not aid governments in offensive activity and to adopt a coordinated disclosure process for software and hardware vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Digital Geneva Convention' needed to deter nation-state hacking: Microsoft president|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-cyber-idUSKBN15T26V|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=20 February 2017|date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaspersky|first1=Eugene|title=A Digital Geneva Convention?

{{lead too long|date=October 2017}}
A '''deep state''' (from {{lang-tr|derin devlet}}, also known as a '''state within a state''') is a political situation in a country when an [[Organs of state|internal organ]], such as the [[armed forces]] or [[civilian authority|public authorities]] ([[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], [[police]], [[secret police]], [[administrative agencies]], and branches of government [[bureaucracy]]), does not respond to the civilian political leadership. Although the state within a state can be conspiratorial in nature, the deep state can also take the form of entrenched unelected career [[civil servant]]s acting in a non-conspiratorial manner, to further their own interests (e.g. continuity of the state as distinct from the administration, job security, enhanced power and authority, pursuit of ideological goals and objectives, and the general growth of their agency) and in opposition to the policies of elected officials, by obstructing, resisting, and subverting the policies, conditions and directives of elected officials. The term, like many in [[politics]], derives from the [[Greek language]] (κράτος εν κράτει, ''kratos en kratei'', later adopted into [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''imperium in imperio''&lt;ref&gt;from [[Baruch Spinoza]]: ''[[Tractatus Politicus|Tractatus politicus]]'', Caput II, § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''status in statu'').

Sometimes the term refers to [[Government-owned corporation|state companies]] that, though formally under the command of the government, act 'de facto' like [[Privately held company|private corporations]]. Sometimes the term refers to [[company|companies]] that, though formally private, act ''de facto'' like "states within a state".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel De Leon]]: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/deleon/pdf/1903/jun04_1903.pdf "Imperium in imperio"] in: ''Daily People'', June 4, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political debate surrounding the [[separation of church and state]] previously revolved around the perception that if left unchecked the Church might turn into a kind of State within a State, an illegitimate outgrowth of the State's natural civil power.&lt;ref&gt;Cf William Blackstone, [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], IV, c.4 ss. iii.2, p. *54, where the charge of being ''imperium in imperio'' was notably levied against the Church&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[political science]], this [[pop culture]] concept is studied within the literature on [[the state]]. Current literature on the state generally traces a lineage to ''Bringing the State Back In'' (1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/comparative-politics/bringing-state-back?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521313131#pkTewkspw1IAhOi2.97|title=Bringing state back - Comparative politics|website=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains an active body of scholarly research to this day. Within this literature, the state is understood as both ''venue'' (a set of rules under which others act and interact) as well as ''actor'' (with its own agenda). An example of a non-conspiratorial version of the 'state as actor' from the empirical scholarly literature would be "doing truth to power" (as a play on speaking truth to power, which is what journalists often aspire to do) as studied by Todd La Porte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9600406570652932200&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5|title=- Google Scholar|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this dual understanding, the conspiratorial version of the deep state concept would be one version of the 'state as actor' while the non-conspiratorial version would be another version of the 'state as venue.' 

The fundamental takeaway from the scholarly literature on the dual nature of the state is that the 'state as actor' (deep state) is a characteristic of all states which can have both good and bad effects and should not be seen as bad by default.

==Cases==

===Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia===

The [[Soviet secret police]] have been frequently described by historians as a "state within a state". According to [[Yevgenia Albats]], most KGB leaders, including [[Lavrenty Beria]], [[Yuri Andropov]], and [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], always competed for power with the Communist Party and manipulated communist leaders.&lt;ref name="Albats"&gt;Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick. The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia--Past, Present, and Future. 1994. {{ISBN|0-374-52738-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov]], "It is not true that the [[Political Bureau]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party]] is a supreme power. The Political Bureau is only a shadow of the real supreme power that stands behind the chair of every Bureau member ... The real power thinks, acts and dictates for all of us. The name of the power is [[NKVD]]&amp;mdash;[[MVD]]&amp;mdash;[[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]]. The [[Stalinism|Stalin regime]] is based not on the [[Soviet democracy|Soviets]], [[Leninism|Party ideals]], the power of the Political Bureau or [[Stalin's cult of personality|Stalin's personality]], but on the organization and the techniques of the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet political police]] where Stalin plays the role of the first policeman."&lt;ref name="A"&gt;The Chechen Times №17, 30.08.2003. Translated from "Technology of Power", 1991, chapter 34 [http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/bio_a/avtorhanov.html Russian text]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also noted that "To say that NKVD is ‘a state within the state’ means to belittle the importance of the NKVD because this question allows two forces – a normal state and a supernormal NKVD – whereas the only force is [[Chekism]]".

According to [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] in 2006, "In the Soviet Union, the KGB was a state within a state. Now former KGB officers are running the state. They have custody of the country's 6,000 nuclear weapons, entrusted to the KGB in the 1950s, and they now also manage the strategic oil industry renationalized by Putin. The KGB successor, rechristened FSB, still has the right to electronically monitor the population, control political groups, search homes and businesses, infiltrate the federal government, create its own front enterprises, investigate cases, and run its own prison system. The Soviet Union had one KGB officer for every 428 citizens. Putin's Russia has one FSB-ist for every 297 citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=23038 Symposium: When an Evil Empire Returns], interview with [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], [[R. James Woolsey, Jr.]], Yuri Yarim-Agaev, and Lt. Gen. [[Thomas McInerney]], [[FrontPageMagazine.com]], June 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chechnya ====
According to [[Julia Ioffe]], under [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], [[Chechnya]] has become a state within a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/24/vladimir-putin-polygamy-islam-chechnya-christian-far-right-europe-ramzan-kadyrov/|title=Putin Is Down With Polygamy|author=Julia Ioffe|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] has been called a 'deep state' by senior politicians in the United Kingdom. [[Tony Blair]] said of the Civil Service, "You cannot underestimate how much they believe it’s their job to actually run the country and to resist the changes put forward by people they dismiss as ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ politicians.

{{main|Deep state in the United States}}In the United States, the term "deep state" was used to describe "a hybrid association of government elements and parts of top-level industry and finance that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the [[consent of the governed]] as expressed through the formal political process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://billmoyers.com/2014/02/21/anatomy-of-the-deep-state/|title=Essay: Anatomy of the Deep State|last=Lofgren|first=Mike|date=2014-02-21|work=[[BillMoyers.com]]|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State: Past, Present, Future|last=Jessop|first=Bob|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence agencies such as the [[CIA]] have been accused by elements of the Trump administration of attempting to thwart its policy goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/world/americas/deep-state-leaks-trump.html|title=As Leaks Multiply, Fears of a ‘Deep State’ in America|last=Taub|first=Amanda|date=February 16, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-11-15|last2=Fisher|first2=Max|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[The New York Times]], the analyst Issandr El Amani warned against the "growing discord between a president and his bureaucratic rank-and-file", while analysts of the column ''The Interpreter'' wrote&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;:

=== Venezuela ===
{{further|Cartel of the Suns}}
The Cartel of the Suns, a group of high-ranking officials within the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela, has been described as "a series of often competing networks buried deep within the Chavista regime". Following the [[Bolivarian Revolution]] in Venezuela, the Bolivarian government initially embezzled until there were no more funds to embezzle, which required them to turn to drug trafficking. President [[Hugo Chávez]] made partnerships with the Colombian leftist militia [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)]] and his successor [[Nicolás Maduro]] continued the process, promoting officials to high-ranking positions after they were accused of drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Venezuela: A Mafia State?|last=|first=|publisher=[[InSight Crime]]|year=2018|isbn=|location=[[Medellin, Colombia]]|pages=3-84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Initially supported by UK broadcaster [[Channel 4]] to support British documentaries declined by broadcast commissioners, the BRITDOC Foundation has grown to receive further funding from [[NGO]]s, brands and foundations such as PUMA.Creative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creative.puma.com/us/en/ |title=PUMA.Creative |publisher=Creative.puma.com |date=2011-12-01 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bertha Foundation to invest in the support of documentary film. The Foundation also works in other areas of film funding by creating the pitching forum 'Good Pitch' and popular film torrent site [[VODO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vodo.net/ |title=VODO |publisher=VODO |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mission is to support international [[documentary film]] from production to distribution to outreach. The Foundation is headed by three directors: Jess Search, Beadie Finzi and Maxyne Franklin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16020">The '''Evacuation of Manchukuo''' occurred during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]'s [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion]] of the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] as part of the wider [[Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation]] of August 1945.

The Soviets recovered territory which had been captured by Japan during the [[Russian-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905, and they dismantled the [[Manchu]] industrial [[infrastructure]]. This deprived [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s troops of a vital region of China, and gave [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Eighth Route Army|VIII Army]] the opportunity to establish bases in North East China.

==Kwantung Army strength==

On August 10, 1945, troops of the 17th Japanese [[front (military)|Front]] (in [[Korea]]) and the fifth Japanese Air Army were placed under the command of the [[Kwantung Army]]. At this point, the Japanese Kwantung Army numbered nearly 750,000 officers and men. It had 1,155 [[tank]]s and self-propelled guns, 1,800 warplanes, and 30 [[warship]]s and gunboats. The entire Japanese force deployed in Manchuria, [[Inner Mongolia]], and [[Korea]] numbered over one million officers and men.

==Russian military operations in Manchukuo and Korea==

The Soviet Army possessed 1.7 times more Infantry, 4.5 times more armor, and 2.8 times more aircraft than the Japanese. On the sea theater, Russian naval forces, unlike Japan, had no aircraft carriers and battleships. However, the chances of those vessels appearing in the Gulf of Korea or the Japan Sea were low, since Russian air domination was complete.

On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Army began the [[Sungari Offensive]]. The [[Amur Military Flotilla|Amur Flotilla]] assisted troops of the second Far Eastern Front in routing the Japanese Kwantung Army. Having crossed the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri]] rivers with the help of the Amur Flotilla, troops from two Soviet armies and an [[infantry]] corps captured two river bridgeheads.

The Japanese army used a variety of field artillery in an attempt to stop the Red Army, but had very limited ammunition available at the front line and failed to achieve significant results against the Russian infantry and armor erupting from the Soviet Far East and Mongolia into Manchuria and Mengchiang.

At the same time and with gunboat support a Soviet landing party entered Fuyuan and quickly took the city. The First Brigade of river gunboats from the Amur Flotilla, having swept shipping channels, entered the estuary of the river [[Sungari]] to support the troops as they landed with artillery fire. On August 10, Soviet forces captured the Sungari [[Fortified district (Japan)|Fortified District]] and the [[Tuntsiang]] defense center. It was here that the crew of the gunboat ''[[Sun Yatsen (gunboat)|Sun Yatsen]]'' distinguished itself.

When Soviet forces took the [[Futsing]] Fortified District, the gunboat, acting jointly with a detachment of armoured launches, destroyed five permanent emplacements, a [[munition]]s depot and six [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] batteries with precise artillery. At the same time, the ''Sun Yatsen'' transferred landing parties across the river and supported their land operations with artillery fire.

On August 18, troops of the 15th Army captured the [[Sun'u]] Fortified District and Sun’u City and took 20,000 Japanese officers and soldiers prisoner. On August 19, Soviet ground troops and Amur Flotilla sailors captured [[Sanxingdui|Sansing]]|. On August 20, in [[Harbin]], after combat action captured by Soviet [[paratrooper]]s, the first and second Amur Flotilla Brigades accepted the capitulation of Japan's [[Sungari Flotilla]] only.

If remarked why Soviet air superiority was virtually total;In any case, if any Japanese Army planes attempt to take off from their airdromes,Russian fighters almost instantly shot them down.soon after the crushing raids of Soviet Air Force and Soviet Naval Air Service aviators on Japanese land bases and ports in Manchurian and Korean coasts.

Paratroopers formed from crews of warships and coastal units of the Pacific Fleet landed in Port Arthur ([[Lüshunkou|Liaoshun]]) and [[Dairen]] (Dalian). On August 25, 17 ''[[GST (aircraft)|GST]]'' seaplanes which had flown five hours from [[Sukhodol]] airport near [[Vladivostok]] landed in the Port Arthur inlet with landing parties made up of Pacific navymen. On the same day, Japanese [[garrison]]s in Port Arthur and Dairen laid down their arms, and the Russian Pacific navy hoisted the Soviet naval ensign over Port Arthur fortress.

It was the Pacific Fleet's aviation group that opened hostilities by delivering heavy strikes against the Japanese-controlled Korean ports of [[Unggi|Yuki]], [[Najin|Rashin]] and [[Chongjin|Seishin]], which served as the Japanese naval bases in [[North Korea]]. As a result of Soviet air strikes, Japan's sea communications were cut during the first days of the war.

Soon after effective raids by Soviet aviators on Japanese bases Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral [[Ivan Stepanovich Yumashev|I. S. Yumashev]] decided, by agreement with Marshal [[A. M. Vasilevsky]], to make landings in Yuki, Rashin and Seishin. On the eve of the operation naval bombers and attack planes continued to attack those ports. At the same time, the ports were attacked from the sea by [[torpedo boat]]s led by division commanders Captain [[K. V. Kazachinsky]], Captain [[S. P. Kostritsky]] and Lieutenant-Captain [[M. G. Malik]]. The sea and air attacks seriously weakened the defenses of the three cities, causing the Japanese to lose as many as twenty transports and other vessels.

The purpose of the Seishin landing operation, achieved during the first days of the war, was to capture the Japanese naval base in order to deprive the enemy of the ability to transport reinforcements, equipment, and ammunition from Japan, and also to prevent the evacuation of troops and equipment to Japan proper. Seishin was a fortified district with 4,000 officers and men, protected from the sea by coastal artillery. The Pacific Fleet's intention was to make a sudden landing to capture the port's moorage line and reconnoiter enemy forces. It was planned to subsequently land the main forces, occupy the city and hold it until the arrival of the 25th Soviet Army's troops advancing along the coastline.

The main landing force included the 355th Separate Marine Battalion under Major [[M. Barabolko]] (1st echelon), the 13th Marine Brigade under Major-General [[V. P. Trushin]] (2nd echelon) and the 335th Infantry Division (3rd echelon). The destroyer ''[[Voikov (ship)|Voikov]]'', mine-layer ''[[Argun (ship)|Argun]]'', eight coast guards, seven [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], twenty-four torpedo boats, twelve landing vessels and seven transports were involved. The air protection and landing support group had 188 bombers and 73 fighters — almost seven air regiments. Major-General Trushin was in command of the entire operation with Captain [[A. F Studenchikov]] leading the landing party.

At 0700 hours on August 13, after the [[Pacific Fleet air force]] had finished bombing enemy defense structures in Seishin, six torpedo boats led by Lieutenant-Captain Markovsky sailed to Seishin. These boats came with a scout detachment under Senior Lieutenant [[V. N. Leonov]], and a company of submachine gunners under Senior Lieutenant [[I. M. Yarotsky]] from Inlet Novik ([[Russky Island]]). As the vanguard of this landing party advanced along the streets of Seishin, Japanese resistance became fiercer. The sailors advanced slowly while engaged with the enemy in hand-to-hand fighting. On the morning of August 14, fighters of the first echelon landed in Seishin, with the second echelon landing on August 15. There was no need to land the third echelon, since the six thousand sailors who had already entered Seishin were sufficient to capture the city. By the afternoon of August 16, the sailors, cooperating with the 393rd Infantry Division of the 25th Soviet Army, had captured the city.

The success of the landing was largely possible thanks to the effective support provided by warships and naval aviation. The destroyer ''Voikov'', the minelayer ''Argun'' and other warships opened fire against the enemy sixty-five times. The coast guard ''[[Metel]]'', under Lieutenant-Captain [[L. N. Baliakin]] provided support to the landing party by shooting down an enemy plane. ''Metel'''s artillery also destroyed an armoured train carrying combat equipment, a Japanese coastal battery, and eight enemy concrete fortifications and emplacements.

In the [[Battle of Seishin]], the Japanese lost more than 3,000 officers and men and a large quantity of armaments and equipment. Hundreds of Soviet officers and men were awarded orders and medals.

After taking Seishin, Pacific Fleet sailors under the command of Studenchikov captured two more major strongholds: the ports of [[Odetsin]] and [[Genzan]], where 6,238 Japanese officers and men were taken prisoner.

One particular case as the action sustained by Japanese against Soviets in Kotou Fortress, as part of Japanese Army Frontier [[Fortified district (Japan)|Fortified District]]s, located near Ussuri River in the Soviet-Manchurian border. If one of most strongest fortress in Manchukuo, among others eight Japanese fortresses in Russian-Manchu frontier.{{clarify|date=May 2016}}

Your detachment as the 15th Border Guard Unit,same unit are special artillery unit also conformed by 1st Battery (with 5 howitzers and operators), 2nd Battery (with 6 heavy cannons and 2 field guns with personnel), 3rd Battalion (Type 88 75mm AA Guns with operators),13th Battery (Type 90 24&amp;nbsp;cm Railway Gun and personnel) and 14th Battery (Experimental 41&amp;nbsp;cm Howitzer and operators); all unit under lead in time by Captain Ohki.

During July 1945 the 15th Border Guard Unit was created and commissioned for the garrison of the Kotou Fortress. When the Soviets irrupted over Manchukuo in Aug., 1945, stayed ones 1,400 units in place. Although the Soviets announced the surrender of Japan, Japanese garrisons did not believe this. They decided to continued to fight until last men.

Such gun fired and destroyed a railway bridge of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Then, it fired with over 100 rounds during about one week until it was overrun by Red Army.in same action, the Type 90 24&amp;nbsp;cm Railway Gun was moved to other position for best firing against Russians. It was destroyed by Soviet artillery and abandoned heavily damaged by Japanese in area. The battle for Kotou Fortress ended on August 26; at same time Japanese forces in others frontier posts used Type 45 24&amp;nbsp;cm Howitzers against the Soviets which invaded Manchukuo in that period.

==The fate of the Puyi regime==
On August 9, [[Kwantung Army]] [[Commander-in-chief|supreme commander]], General [[Otozō Yamada]], informed [[Puyi]] that the Soviet Union had violated the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] and had invaded across the Manchukuo frontier. Although assured by General Yamada that the situation was under control, the same day [[Hsinking]] was attacked by the first [[airstrike|air raid]] of the war, and Puyi witnessed explosions from bombs falling near the [[Wei Huang Gong]] palace.

On August 10, General Yamada advised Puyi that although the Army was "giving heavy resistance" the capital was being temporarily evacuated to [[Tonghua]]. Puyi was reluctant to abandon Hsinking, but was warned that if he did not leave, he would be the first killed by [[Red Army]] troops. Puyi donned the uniform of [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Manchukuo Imperial Army]] as a gesture of solidarity with his troops.

On August 11, Puyi and other members of the imperial court departed Hsinking by train. [[Hiro Saga]] witnessed the local population preparing to receive the Red Army by making [[hammer and sickle]] [[flag]]s. Because of the rapid Soviet advance, the entourage was unable to reach Tunghua, and changed its route to [[Talitzou]], arriving at night. On the way, they witnessed Japanese military convoys fleeing south, in contrast to General Yamada's assurances that "the Japanese army are gaining and destroyed many aircraft and enemy tanks". Talitzou station was a scene of panic, with civilians desperately attempting to board the overcrowded last trains "crying and bribing guards to let them enter and between guards there were fights."

At Talitzou Puyi and his court stayed in a two-storey administrative building belonging to a mining company. Puyi talked with his Japanese advisors about his future, and plans were made to take him to [[Korea]], which the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had yet to invade, and from there to Japan. Puyi was uncertain where he would like to stay, but settled upon [[Kyoto]].

On August 15, the group met around a [[radio receiver]], listening to Japanese emperor [[Hirohito]] announcing the unconditional [[surrender of Japan]]. Pujie translated the speech for the group. Hiro mentioned how both brothers shook hands and cried.

Two days later, on August 18 Puyi formally renounced the Manchukuo throne and proclaimed the dissolution of the Manchukuo government. In a symbolic vote, all present approved, and Puyi stamped his [[seal (device)|seal]] to enact the law, ending the Manchukuo government after 13 years and five months. Coincidentally, it was at Talitzou 350 years before that Puyi's ancestor [[Nurhaci]] began his campaign to defeat the [[Ming Dynasty]].

The region was no longer safe due to [[Communism|Communist]] guerrillas, and the group divided; one part returned to Hsinking with ex-prime minister [[Zhang Jinghui]] for a last radio contact with [[Chiang Kai-shek]], in an unsuccessful attempt to give over control of Manchukuo to the [[Kuomintang]] to prevent Soviet occupation. The women in the entourage were sent separately by train towards Korea, as it was thought that they were not in immediate danger, and were not political targets of the Soviet or Chinese forces. As the train left Hiro saw Puyi cry.

At Talitzou airport a [[Tachikawa Ki-54]], was prepared for Puyi's escape. Puyi selected only eight people, including his brother [[Pujie]], [[Yuyan]], [[Big Li]] and his personal medic. The small plane took the imperial entourage to [[Mukden]] where a larger plane,one [[Mitsubishi Ki-57]] was to take them to Korea. However, while waiting at Mukden, Soviet troops of [[Transbaikal Front]] seized the airport, disarming the small Japanese garrison.

Puyi and his companions spent the night at the airport under guard, and the next morning were taken aboard a Russian plane. Between Mukden and [[Khabarovsk]] the plane landed for refueling, where Puyi spoke to the Soviet commander, telling him that he "did not like being in the same airplane with [[Japanese war criminals]]" and the Japanese were left at the airfield while Puyi continued on. On reaching Khabarovsk, Puyi was first sent a hotel which was transformed into a detention centre. Later he was sent to "[[Detention Center N°45]]" in a school building in same city.

The '''Exposición Internacional del Centenario''' ('''Centennial International Exposition''') was an exhibition held between May and November 1910 in [[Buenos Aires]], to commemorate the [[Argentina Centennial|Centennial]] of the [[May Revolution]] in [[Argentina]] (the formation of the first local government on May 25, 1810). With a population of around 1.2 million, Buenos Aires was then the largest urban complex in [[Latin America]], the eighth city in the world, and one of the richest. As the capital city and main port of the young Argentine Republic at the height of its economic expansion, the city was growing rapidly with the successive waves of [[Immigration to Argentina|European immigration]].

==Summary==
A total of 20 pavilions were built specially for the exhibition.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/unico-pabellon-quedo-festejo-centenario-olvidado-mal_0_HksxJOvATte.html El único pabellón que quedó del festejo del Centenario, olvidado y en mal estado], ''Clarín'',
 28 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A number of young Italian architects, including [[Virginio Colombo]], [[Francisco Gianotti]] and [[Mario Palanti]] who designed the Italian pavilion, went on to establish successful careers in Buenos Aires working in a number of styles, including Art Nouveau. Their buildings were some of the most important of the 20th century in Buenos Aires and those that remain continue to play a significant role in defining the city's architectural landscape.

Each pavilion feature a different theme, such as:

* Agriculture and Cattle Raising – Organised by the [[La Rural|Sociedad Rural Argentina]], this was housed in a pavilion within the organisation's house in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]]. It and contained an exhibition of agricultural activities and products from various parts of the country. 
* Industry – This was located on what today is [[Avenida del Libertador|Del Libertador Avenue]] near El Rosedal, and featured industrial machinery much of which had never been seen before in Argentina.
* Railways and Overland Transport – An  exhibition of the latest automobiles from Europe, yachts, aeroplanes, railway locomotives, carriages and wagons. The pavilion, designed by Italian architect Virginio Colombo,&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt; was located near the [[Hipódromo Argentino de Palermo|Hipódromo de Palermo]]. It was the most attended exhibition. 
* Hygiene - this was located on the Unzué Residence gardens, now occupied by the [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|Argentine National Library]].
* Fine Arts - this was located in the "Argentine Pavilion", a steel structure covered in ceramics and multi-coloured glass designed by French architect [[Albert Ballu]] for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Exposition Universelle of Paris]], where it stood next to the newly built [[Eiffel Tower]]. By 1910 the pavilion had been relocated in [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]], opposite the [[Marriott Plaza Hotel, Buenos Aires|Plaza Hotel]]. The pavilion would be dismantled in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugr.es/~rgutierr/PDF1/095.pdf Exposiciones históricas en la Argentina III. De la Exposición Internacional del Centenario (1910) a la creación del Salón Nacional (1911)], by Gutiérrez Viñuales, Rodrigo, May 2005, Universidad de Granada website&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition there were pavilions for several of the [[Provinces of Argentina|Argentine provinces]], including Córdoba, Mendoza, Salta, Jujuy and Tucumán, and for countries including Spain, Italy, Germany, England, Switzerland, Austro-Hungarian Empire and Paraguay. The [[Art Nouveau]] style played an important role in the designs of many of the buildings.

The '''Federation of European Carnival Cities''' (FECC) was founded in 1980 and has been registered in the Court of Luxembourg. Member cities, organization and individual members are engaged in producing popular celebrations or [[carnivals]] which represent an authentic [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] or [[parade]] of a people's cultural identity. The General membership meets twice each year generally at the end of May and in October. [[File:FECC-logo.png|right]]

== History ==
On the occasion of the 700th anniversary of [[Amsterdam]] (The Nederlands), Carnival Princes from all over the world met each other in the Amsterdam RAI congress centre in November 1975. The Amsterdam Carnival Association, governed by Mr.[[Henk van der Kroon]] was called "Amstelpieren &amp; Brokkerijders."  The big event brought an unprecedented number of Carnival Associations from different countries together. The guests of honour included Her Royal Highness [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands]] as well as diplomats and dignitaries from afar including [[Brazil]], [[Greece]], [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]]. This unique event is widely recognized as the starting point for the lasting contacts and exchanges between associations and cities that has become the FECC.

In 1980, international carnival associations met in Patras (Greece), again under the initiative of the Amsterdam Carnival Association Ämstelpieren &amp; Bfrokkerijders. It is generally accepted that the FECC (Foundation of European Carnival) came into existence during this meeting. At the 5th reunion in Kos-Patmos (Greece), which took place in 1985, a membership was introduced and it was decided to drawn up rules and bylaws. The first countries that became a member of the Foundation were Belgium, Netherlands, [[Luxembourg]], [[England]] and [[Malta]]. Articles of association were formulated and the creation of FECC was registered in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Directly following the 1987 7th reunion in Malta, the Belgian members founded their own section FECC-Belgium with its own governing board. In 1988 FECC-Germany founded their own section as did FECC-Netherlands and FECC –Luxembourg. The first elected International President was Mr. Henk van der Kroon.

Throughout the year the International President and other Board Members travel to member cities and interested Carnivals to learn, educate and often officiate at the ceremonies surrounding what is often the most important annual event for the community and even country. The FECC is a global organization holding its first annual convention outside the Mediterranean in the twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in 1987. Many Carnivals, particularly those in Eastern Europe, have grown up under the mentorship of FECC engagement. Since its founding, the FECC has been the only unswerving organization consistently speaking for the interests and concerns of Carnival organizations. Representatives from Carnival organizations in over 50 countries are members and annual conventions generally have several Mayors seeking ways to bring more international recognition and culturally oriented tourists to their festivals.

==Annual Carnival City Congress==
Once a year, all FECC members: cities, associations and individual members are invited to an international assembly. This convention is organized by a member-city and takes place every year in a different country.
The convention lasts 1 week end takes place between end mid-May and mid- June. These conventions enjoy a lot of interest: every year, participants from more than 20 countries are present.
During these annual conventions, the members get an international forum which enables them to promote their carnival and their town on the occasion of seminars and workshops.

Direct personal contacts with the numerous participants can also increase the international publicity of a member's carnival and/of town.
The organizers of the convention moreover, use these gatherings to show the participants a few tourist attractions and places of interest of their town and the surrounding area. 

The 11 October 1980 marks the founding of the FECC and it is observed by the FECC membership with a '''Dies Natalis''' celebration. This weekend gathering is hosted by a member city.

[[File:Polizeikontrolle Rügendamm.jpg|thumb|[[Sobriety checkpoint]] in [[Stralsund]], [[Germany]]]]

'''Field Sobriety Tests (FSTs)''', also referred to as '''Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs)''', are a battery of tests used by [[police officer]]s to determine if a person suspected of [[impaired driving]] is intoxicated with [[ethanol|alcohol]] or [[drugs]].  ''FSTs'' (and ''SFSTs'') are primarily used in the US, to meet "[[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]]" requirements (or the equivalent), necessary to sustain an alcohol-impaired driving (DWI or DUI) conviction based on a chemical blood alcohol test. 

==Background==
===Impaired driving===
&lt;!-- Definition --&gt;
[[Driving under the influence|Impaired driving]], referred to as Driving under the influence (DUI), or Driving while intoxicated (DWI), is the crime of driving a [[motor vehicle]] while impaired by [[ethanol|alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s (including [[recreational drug]]s and those prescribed by [[physicians]]), to a level that renders the driver incapable of operating a motor vehicle safely. People who receive multiple DUI offenses are often people struggling with [[alcoholism]] or [[alcohol dependence]].

&lt;!--Impact --&gt;
Traffic accidents are predominantly caused by driving under the influence; for people in Europe between the age of 15 and 29, DUI is one of the main causes of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;(Alonso, Pastor, Montoro &amp; Esteban, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration alcohol-related crashes cause approximately $37 billion in damages annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Impaired Driving {{!}} National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|url = http://www.nhtsa.gov/Impaired|website = www.nhtsa.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;DUI and alcohol-related crashes produce an estimated $45 billion in damages every year.&lt;ref name="Between bail, court, insurance and attorney's fees, the true cost of DUI is more like $10,000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-tampa/between-bail-court-insurance-and-attorneys-fees-the-true-cost-of-dui-is-more-like-10000|title=Between bail, court, insurance and attorney's fees, the true cost of DUI is more like $10,000|publisher=ABCActionNews.com.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111115411/http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-tampa/between-bail-court-insurance-and-attorneys-fees-the-true-cost-of-dui-is-more-like-10000|archivedate=2014-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;!-- Diagnosis --&gt;
With alcohol, a [[drunk driver]]'s level of intoxication is typically determined by a measurement of [[blood alcohol content]] or BAC; but this can also be expressed as a breath test measurement, often referred to as a BrAC. A BAC or BrAC measurement in excess of the specific threshold level, such as 0.08%, defines the [[criminal offense]] with no need to prove impairment. In some jurisdictions, there is an aggravated category of the offense at a higher BAC level, such as 0.12%, 0.15% or 0.20%. In many jurisdictions, police officers can conduct field tests of suspects to look for signs of intoxication. The US state of Colorado has a maximum blood content of [[THC]] for drivers who have consumed [[cannabis]].

&lt;!-- Prevention --&gt;
In most countries, driver's licence suspensions, fines and prison sentences for DUI offenders are used as a deterrent. Anyone who is convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs can be heavily fined and/or given a prison sentence. In some jurisdictions, impaired drivers who injure or kill another person while driving may face heavier penalties. In addition, many countries have prevention campaigns that use [[advertising]] to make people aware of the danger of driving while impaired and the potential fines and criminal charges, discourage impaired driving, and encourage drivers to take taxis or public transport home after using alcohol or drugs. In some jurisdictions, the bar that served an impaired driver may face civil liability. In some countries, non-profit advocacy organizations, a well-known example being [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD) run their own publicity campaigns against drunk driving.

===History===
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began research in 1975 on how to test suspects for impaired driving.&lt;ref name="nhtsa_SFST_1999"&gt;{{cite web|title=Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) Validated at BACS Below 0.10 Percent|url=https://one.nhtsa.gov/portal/site/NHTSA/menuitem.554fad9f184c9fb0cc7ee21056b67789/?vgnextoid=1e2fcd8c4e7bff00VgnVCM1000002c567798RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=d8274dc9e66d5210VgnVCM100000656b7798RCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default|website=NHTSA|publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=7 December 2017|date=March 1999}} [https://one.nhtsa.gov/About-NHTSA/Traffic-Techs/current/ci.Standardized-Field-Sobriety-Test-(SFST)-Validated-at-BACS-Below-0.10-Percent.print (''unframed "print" format'')] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NHTSA developed a series of tests that police officers could use when evaluating suspected impaired drivers. By 1981, officers in the United States began using the organization's battery of standardized sobriety tests to help make decisions about whether to arrest suspected impaired drivers. The tests were designed to indicate intoxication associated with a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.10%.&lt;ref name="nhtsa_SFST_1999" /&gt;

After some US states began lowering their BAC limits to 0.08%, a study was done to see if the battery could be used to detect BACs at or above 0.08% and above and below 0.04%. This was done to deal with the changes in the laws that led to lower legal BAC limits across the US.&lt;ref name="nhtsa_SFST_1999" /&gt;

===Use of Field Sobriety Tests===
[[File:Fieldsobrietytest usa ct.jpg|right|thumb|Police administer a one-leg-stand test after a crash.]]
One of the most controversial aspects of a DUI stop is the use of Field Sobriety Tests (FST). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has developed a model system for managing Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) training. They have published several training manuals associated with FSTs. As a result of the NHTSA studies, the walk-and-turn test was determined to be 68% accurate, and the one-leg stand test is only 65% accurate when administered to people within the study parameters. The tests were not validated for people with medical conditions, injuries, 65 years or older, and 50 pounds or greater overweight. The officer will administer one or more field sobriety tests. FSTs are considered "divided attention tests" that test the suspect's ability to perform the type of mental and physical multitasking that is required to operate an automobile.  Nevertheless, these tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting [[Proprioception#Applications|proprioception]], such as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome|Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)]].

=== Purpose ===
FSTs and SFSTs are promoted as, "used to determine whether a subject is impaired",&lt;ref name="NHTSA_refresher"&gt;[https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/sfst_ig_refresher_manual.pdf Instructor Guide - DWI Detection and SFST Refresher], NHTSA (rev. 10/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;[https://duijusticelink.aaa.com/issues/detection/standard-field-sobriety-test-sfst-and-admissibility/ Standardized Field Sobriety Test], AAA (US) "DUI Justice Link"&lt;/ref&gt; but FST tests are widely regarded having, as their primary purpose, establishing tangible evidence of "[[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]]" ("reasonable grounds" in Canada).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cga.ct.gov/2000/rpt/2000-R-0873.htm Connecticut OLR report, ''The use of field sobriety tests in drunk driving enforcement''], 2000-R-0873 (9-Nov-2000); ''see "Phase III—Pre-arrest Screening and Administration of Field Sobriety Tests"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findlawFST"&gt;[https://dui.findlaw.com/dui-arrests/field-sobriety-tests.html Field Sobriety Tests], findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idahoman"&gt;''accord, p. 29'' [http://www.nlelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SFST_Handout.pdf Field Sobriety Tests Review], Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;  A secondary purpose, is to provide supporting corroborative tangible evidence for use against the suspect for use at trial.  [[Probable cause]] is necessary under US law ([[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]) to sustain an arrest and invocation of the [[Implied consent|implied consent law]].

Similar considerations apply under the Canadian requirement to establish "reasonable grounds" for making an [[approved instrument]] demand, by establishing that there is reasonable and probable cause which lies at the point where "point where credibly-based probability replaces suspicion".&lt;ref&gt;Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc at p. 114, 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ca_exclusionary"&gt;[https://icclr.law.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ES-paper-exclusionary-evidence-rule.pdf Improperly or Illegally Obtained Evidence: The Exclusionary Evidence Rule in Canada], International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy (12-2005) (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;   It is likely that, if FSTs are being used, some equivalent to ''probable cause'' is necessary to sustain a conviction based on a demand for a chemical test.

While the primary purpose of FSTs is to document [[probable cause]] or the equivalent, in some jurisdictions, FST performance can be introduced as corroborating evidence of impairment.&lt;ref name="HGN_APRI"&gt;[https://www.ndaa.org/pdf/admissibility%20of%20hgn_april_2003.pdf Admissibility of Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Evidence], American Prosecutors Research Institute (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing ==
According to the NHTSA, a suspect does not "pass" or "fail" a ''field sobriety test'', but rather the police determine whether "clues" are observed during the test.&lt;ref name="NHTSA_pp"&gt;[http://www.ncids.org/Defender%20Training/2017SpringConf/SFSTandDWI.pdf NHTSA: Standardized Field Sobriety Tests Powerpoint slides], "Defender Training" 2017 Spring Conference&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHTSA_refresher" /&gt;  Nevertheless, some of the literature will still include comments that a suspect "fails" one or more of these tests.&lt;ref name="NHTSA_pp" /&gt;

The three validated tests by NHTSA are:
*The Horizontal Gaze [[Physiologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]] Test, which involves following an object with the eyes (such as a pen) to determine characteristic eye movement reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus: The Science and the Law|url=https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/1647|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=American Prosecutors Research Institute|accessdate=30 June 2017}} (link to '''.pdf''' document)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Walk-and-Turn Test ([[Tandem gait|heel-to-toe]] in a straight line). This test is designed to measure a person's ability to follow directions and remember a series of steps while dividing attention between physical and mental tasks.
*The One-Leg-Stand Test

Alternative tests, which have not been "scientifically" validated by the NHTSA, include:
*[[Romberg test]], or the Modified-Position-of-Attention Test, (feet together, head back, eyes closed for thirty seconds).
*The Finger-to-Nose Test (tip head back, eyes closed, touch the tip of nose with tip of index finger).
*The Alphabet Test (recite all or part of the alphabet).
*The Finger Count Test (touch each finger of hand to thumb counting with each touch (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1)).
*The Counting Test (counting backwards from a number ending in a number other than 5 or 0 and stopping at a number ending other than 5 or 0. The series of numbers should be more than 15).
*The Preliminary Alcohol Screening Test, PAS Test or PBT, (breathe into a "portable or preliminary breath tester", PAS Test or PBT).

=== Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) ===
There were three tests chosen to constitute the "Standardized Field Sobriety Tests", which are: (1) the [[Nystagmus|Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test]]; (2) the Walk &amp; Turn Test; and (3) the One-Leg Stand Test.

Although most law enforcement agencies continue to use a variety of these FSTs, most use the three-test battery of validated field sobriety tests, referred to as the Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST). The NHTSA-approved battery of tests consists of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test (HGN Test), the Walk-and-Turn Test (WAT), and the One-Leg-Stand Test (OLS).

In some states, e.g., Ohio, only the standardized tests will be admitted into evidence, provided they were administered and objectively scored "in substantial compliance" with NHTSA standards (ORC 4511.19(D)(4)(b)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traffic laws - Operation of motor vehicles|url=http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4511.19|website=Ohio Laws and Rules|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test (HGN) ====
The first test that is typically administered is the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus or HGN test, which is administered by the police officer checking the test subject's eyes. During this test, the officer looks for involuntary jerking of the suspect's eyes as they gaze toward the side. The officer checks for three clues in each eye, which gives six clues for this test.  The clues are: lack of smooth pursuit of the eyes, distinct and sustained [[nystagmus]] at the eyes' maximum deviation and nystagmus starting before the eyes reach 45 degrees.

:'''Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Instructions (HGN)'''
# I am going to check your eyes. (Please remove your glasses) 
# Keep your head still and follow the stimulus with your eyes only. 
# Do not move your head. 
# Do you understand the instructions?

:'''Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Evaluation'''
:There are six cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test, they are as follows:
# Lack of smooth pursuit 
# Distinct and sustained nystagmus and maximum deviation 
# Onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees
:'''Total Cues: 6 Cues - Decision Point: 4/6 Cues'''

While the original research indicated that 6 out of 6 clues (or cues) meant that a person was more likely above 0.08% at the time of the test, subsequent research conducted by the NHTSA has indicated that a "Hit" occurred when the number of reported signs for a given BAC fell within the range: a &gt;&amp;nbsp;0.06% at 4–6 clues; a 0.05&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;0.059% at 2–4 clues; a 0.03&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;0.049% at 0–4 clues and a &lt;&amp;nbsp;0.03% at 0–2 cues or clues.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nhtsa.gov/DOT/NHTSA/Traffic%20Injury%20Control/Articles/Associated%20Files/810831.pdf The Robustness of the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test]" (September, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  The police may also then check for Vertical Gaze Nystagmus, which is used to test for high blood alcohol levels and/or the presence of certain drugs.

While the purpose is obtaining [[probable cause]] support for an arrest and possibly screening, in some jurisdictions, the HGN test may be used as corroborating evidence at the trial stage.  US jurisdictions differ on whether trial use of the HGN test requires that an expert establish a reliable foundation, as required under the [[Daubert standard|''Daubert'' standard]]&lt;ref name="frye"&gt;''see also'' [[Frye standard|''Frye'' standard]] for test results "generally accepted as reliable".&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Walk &amp; Turn test (WAT) ====
The second test that is usually administered is the Walk and Turn Test, or WAT Test.&lt;ref name="NJ_card"&gt;{{cite web|author1=The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)|title=Standardized Field Sobriety Testing Procedures| publisher = New Jersey (US) police reference card|url=http://www.nj.gov/oag/hts/downloads/SFST_Procedures.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test measures the suspect's ability to maintain their balance, walk in a straight line, and follow directions. To perform the test, the suspect will take nine heel-to-toe steps along a straight line during which time they must keep their arms to their side and count each step out loud. While the suspect performs this test, the officer is attempting to observe if the suspect fails to follow instructions; is having difficulty keeping their balance; stops walking in order to regain their balance; takes an incorrect number of steps; or fails to walk the line heel-to-toe.
The walk-and-turn test is composed of two phases: the Instruction Phase and Walking Phase. During the test, the individual is directed to take nine steps along a straight line.  The individual is supposed to walk heel to toe, and while looking down at a real or imaginary line, count the steps out loud.  The test subject's arms must remain at their side.  Reaching the ending point, the individual must turn around using a series of small steps, and return to the starting point. The proper instruction, according to the NHTSA Guidelines, is as follows:

:'''Walk-and-Turn test instructions'''
# Put your left foot on the line, then place your right foot on the line ahead of your left, with the heel of your right foot against the toe of your left foot. 
# Do not start until I tell you to do so. 
# Do you understand? (must receive affirmative response) 
# When I tell you to begin, take 9 heel-to-toe steps on the line (demonstrate) and take 9 heel-to-toe steps back down the line. 
# When you turn on the ninth step, keep your front foot on the line and turn taking several small steps with the other foot (demonstrate) and take 9 heel-to-toe steps back down the line. 
# Ensure you look at your feet, count each step out loud, keep your arms at your side, ensure you touch heel-to-toe and do not stop until you have completed the test.
# Do you understand the instructions? 
# You may begin. 
# If the suspect does not understand some part of the instructions, only the part in which the suspect does not understand should be repeated

:'''Walk-and-Turn test evaluation'''
:There are eight cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the Walk &amp; Turn Test; they are as follows:
# Can’t keep balance during instructions
# Starts too soon
# Stops walking
# Misses heel-to-toe
# Steps off line
# Uses arms for balance
# Improper turn
# Incorrect number of steps
:'''Total cues: 8 cues – Decision point: 2/8 cues'''

==== One Leg Stand test (OLS) ====
The other standardized test is the One Leg Stand (OLS). The OLS test requires the suspect to stand on one leg for 30 seconds and also measures balance, coordination, and similar to the WAT test, divides the suspect's attention.  The officer is looking for any of the four possible clues: Sways while balancing, uses arms for balance, hopping and puts their foot down.

The One-Leg Stand test is composed of two stages: the Instruction Phase and Balancing Phase. The proper instruction, according to the NHTSA Guidelines, is as follows:

:'''One-Leg Stand test instructions'''
# Stand with your feet together and your arms at your side (demonstrate).  
# Maintain position until told otherwise.  
# When I tell you to, I want you to raise one leg, either one, approximately 6 inches off the ground, foot pointed out, both legs straight and look at the elevated foot. Count out loud in the following manner: 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004 and so on until told to stop.
# Do you understand the instructions?  
# You may begin the test.

:'''One-Leg Stand Test evaluation'''
:There are four cues or clues that a police officer is looking for on the One-Leg Stand Test; they are as follows:
# Sways while balancing
# Uses arms to balance
# Hops
# Puts foot down
:'''Total cues: 4 cues – Decision point: 2/4 cues'''

=== Non-standardized tests ===
The term "non-standardized" references the NTSA SFSTs, sometimes referenced by the NHTSA as "other sobriety tests".&lt;ref name="NHTSA_pp" /&gt;  The NHTSA indicates that the non-standardized tests are either "not scientifically reliable"&lt;ref name="NHTSA_pp" /&gt;, with some assertions that SFSTs can be used to estimate 0.08% BAC.  Nevertheless, these tests are common in North America, because the primary purpose of FSTs is to establish [[probable cause]] to sustain an arrest and invoke the [[Implied consent|implied consent law]].

"Non-standardized tests" include sequentially touching fingertips while counting forward and backward, touching the nose, alphabet recitals and [[Romberg's test]] (stationary balance, test for Romberg's sign).

===Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS)===
{{See also|Breathalyzer#Preliminary_Breath_Test_(PBT)_or_Preliminary_Alcohol_Screening_test_(PAS)}}
The Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) or Preliminary Alcohol Screening test (PAS) is sometimes categorised as part of ''field sobriety testing'', although it is not part of the series of performance tests.  The PBT (or PAS) uses a portable breath tester, but its primary use is for screening and establishing [[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]], to invoke the [[Implied consent#Driving_while_intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements or to establish "reasonable grounds" for making an [[approved instrument]] demand [[Impaired_driving_in_Canada#Field_sobriety_tests|in Canada]].

Different requirements apply in many states to drivers under DUI probation, in which case participation in a preliminary breath test (PBT) may be a condition of probation, and for commercial drivers under "drug screening" requirements.  Some US states, notably California, have statutes on the books penalizing PBT refusal for drivers under 21; however the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Constitutionality]] of those statutes has not been tested.  (As a practical matter, most criminal lawyers advise not engaging in discussion or "justifying" a refusal with the police.)

In Canada, PBT refusal may be considered a ''refusal'' offense under Canada Criminal Code §&amp;nbsp;254.&lt;ref name="CC254"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-254.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 254.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The status of PBT refusal in Australia is unclear, although in [[Western Australia]] it appears to mandate submission to PBTs under the ''Road Traffic Act 1974''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4279/can-a-person-refuse-a-breathalyser-test-and-other-.aspx Refusing a Breath Test in Western Australia], gotocourt.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slp.wa.gov.au/statutes/swans.nsf/(DownloadFiles)/Road+Traffic+Act+1974.pdf/$file/Road+Traffic+Act+1974.pdf Road Traffic Act 1974] ('''.pdf''') ''search for "preliminary test"&lt;/ref&gt;  (National states without [[probable cause]] or "reasonable grounds" requirements are of course likely to be less restrictive on PBT/PAS requirements.)

== Limitations and criticism ==
{{see also|Drunk_driving_in_the_United_States#Field_sobriety_test_criticisms}}
&lt;section begin=fst_criticisms /&gt; 
FSTs are considered subjective.  Additionally, their applicability to large segments of the population is limited.

Critics of standardized field sobriety tests often question the statistical evidence behind them, and the ability of the officers to administer the tests and actually judge for impairments related to alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.isba.org/sections/trafficlaw/newsletter/2010/08/backtothebasicschallengingtheaccuracyoffieldsobriet Hess, ''Back to the basics: Challenging the accuracy of field sobriety tests''], Illinois State Bar Assn., Section on Traffic Laws &amp; Courts (vol. 20, no. 1, 8-2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nhtsa_SFST_1998" /&gt;  According to Barone, one study involved completely sober individuals who were asked to perform the standardized field sobriety tests, and their performances were videotaped. "After viewing the 21 videos of sober individuals taking the standardized field tests, the police officers believed that forty-six percent of the individuals had 'too much to drink'".&lt;ref name="barone"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319155941/http://www.capwayne.org/2005/handouts/2005-10-07_barone.pdf Standardized Field Sobriety Testing], Patrick T. Barone&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be out of the question for the standardized field sobriety tests to be re-examined for reliability and validity.  A standardized test that claims to have scientific support should be able to be repeated. Along with that, the standardized field sobriety tests do not have a specific standard for grading, and it is left up to the discretion of the officer to determine whether what he/she see observes is actually a cue sufficient to count against the test subject. The NHTSA's 1977 study had an error rate of 47 percent, and the 1981 study had an error rate of 32 percent, which is considered unusually high for a scientific study.&lt;ref name="hum_behav"&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/532d/9532d8755b5903930f8166dc9d8264935fc2.pdf Rubenzer, ''The Standardized Field Sobriety Tests: A Review of Scientific and Legal Issues''], Law and Human Behavior, Vol. 32, No. 4, pp. 293-313 (Aug., 2008) ''see, e.g., p. 295''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icadtsinternational.com/files/documents/1992_150.pdf Perrine, R.D. Foss, A.R. Meyers, R.B. Voas, and C. Vélez, ''Field Sobriety Tests: Reliability and Validity''], Vermont Alcohol Research Center (Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main criticisms of field sobriety tests is that the judgment is left up to the discretion of the police officer.  An officer may have some bias towards a suspect and judge the test more critically than necessary.  Additionally, it is almost impossible to tell whether or not a police officer used proper procedures for administering the field sobriety test when a case is brought to court.  The original research conducted by the NHTSA is often disputed because of the manner in which they were conducted and the conclusions that were reported.

One author alleges that FSD analysis reports do not meet scientific ''[[peer review]]'' standards: "The reports for all three studies issued by NHTSA are lacking much of the material and analysis expected in a scientific paper, and none have been published in peer-reviewed journals" (Rubenzer&amp;nbsp;2008&lt;ref name="hum_behav" /&gt;; Rubenzer 2011).

&lt;noinclude&gt;As noted ''supra'', these&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;These&lt;/includeonly&gt; tests can be problematic for people with non-obvious disabilities affecting [[proprioception]], such as [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome|Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)]].  Conditions affecting mobility, physical ailments and age adversely affect performance on FSTs.
&lt;section end=fst_criticisms /&gt; &lt;!-- NOTE:  "NOINCLUDE" TAG REMOVES ''supra'' TEXT --&gt;
=== Walk-and-turn test criticisms ===
One of the main problems with the walk-and-turn test is that some of the signs of alcohol impairment may stem from other physical problems.  Along with that, there are other signs of physical impairment that can stem from various causes, including fatigue, an injury or illness, and nervousness.  Those who are physically inactive, elderly, or obese may have trouble completing the walk-and-turn test without flaw.&lt;ref name="hum_behav" /&gt; The NTSA used to say that those who are 50 pounds or more overweight may have difficulty performing the test, and that the suspect must walk along a real line.  "Later NHTSA manuals removed the weight comment, and also inserted the phrase 'imaginary line' at the instruction phase, even though original research always used a visible line".&lt;ref name="barone" /&gt;  The fact that officers are no longer required to provide a line for the suspect to walk along may affect the outcome of the test, and often adds to the scrutiny received from critics.

== Field Sobriety Test Refusals ==
&lt;section begin=fst_refusals /&gt; 
In all US jurisdictions, participation in a Field Sobriety Test is voluntary.&lt;ref name="nolo_ref-long"&gt;[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press ("As a general rule (and unlike chemical testing), there is no legal penalty for refusing to take these tests although the arresting officer can typically testify as to your refusal in court.")&lt;/ref&gt;.  (Police are not obliged to advise the suspect that participation in a FST or other pre-arrest procedures is voluntary.  In contrast, formal evidentiary tests given under [[Implied consent#Driving_while_intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements are considered mandatory.)&lt;ref name="nolo_ref" /&gt;

A suspect requested to participate in a Field Sobriety Test is likely to be told that the purpose is to determine whether the suspect is impaired;&lt;ref name="NHTSA_refresher"&gt;[https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/sfst_ig_refresher_manual.pdf Instructor Guide - DWI Detection and SFST Refresher], NHTSA (rev. 10/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt; however, FST tests are widely regarded as having, as their primary purpose, gaining tangible evidence for use against the suspect.&lt;ref name="findlawFST"&gt;[https://dui.findlaw.com/dui-arrests/field-sobriety-tests.html Field Sobriety Tests], findlaw.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idahoman"&gt;''accord, p. 29'' [http://www.nlelp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/SFST_Handout.pdf Field Sobriety Tests Review], Idaho Prosecuting Attorneys Association (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence is important in the establishment of [[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]].  Since ''[[probable cause]]'' is necessary under US law ([[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]]) to sustain an arrest and invocation of the [[Implied consent|implied consent law]], it is important that the police document ''[[probable cause]]''.
&lt;section end=fst_criticisms /&gt;
&lt;!-- ===="HGN first"==== --&gt;'''"HGN first"'''

The NHTSA recommends administering the HGN test as the first of the SFSTs,&lt;ref name="NHTSA_refresher" /&gt; but does not state the reason.  FSTs are voluntary, so consideration is given to encourage suspects to comply with requests to participate in the tests.   The HST is characterized by the tester performing a visible activity, so the suspect is less likely to decline at that stage.  The completion of one test increases the likelihood that the suspect will participate in follow-up FSTs.  The suspect may also perceive the HGN (as administered) as having a scientific foundation.

In cases in which a PBT (or PST) is administered first, the HGN may be administered after completion of other SFSTs, as the purpose of administering the HGN first is obviated by the PBT/PST.

== National procedures ==
&lt;!-- NEED STATEMENT WITH REFERENCE, INDICATING FSTs ARE PECULIAR TO NATIONAL STATES THAT REQUIRE "PROBABLE CAUSE" FOR EVIDENTIARY CHEMICAL TESTS.  THIS WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN THE APPARENT US-CENTRIC NATURE OF THE SUBJECT, AS FSTs ARE NOT UNIVERSAL. --&gt;

''FSTs'' are primarily used in national states that require the police establish [[probable cause|probable cause for arrest]] (''reasonable grounds'' in Canada) as a prerequisite for requiring a chemical blood alcohol test.  FSTs are generally regarded as a curiosity elsewhere. 

=== Australia ===

To determine impairment in countries such as Australia, a simple breath or urine test is often taken. If police suspect that a driver is under the influence of a substance such as alcohol, then the driver will undergo a breath test.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/topics/bac|title = Blood alcohol concentration|date = 2014|accessdate = 2015-04-16|website = DrugInfo|publisher = Australian Drug Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; If over the legal limit of 0.05g per 100 milliltres of blood, then a second breath test will be taken and used as evidence against the driver when charged with the offence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If a person is suspected to be under the influence of an illegal drug, they will be required to supply a urine sample.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/topics/drug-testing|title = Drug testing|date = 2014|accessdate = 2015-04-15|website = DrugInfo|publisher = Australian Drug Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the urine sample is positive, then the urine is sent for more testing to determine the exact drug taken (confirmation of being illegal or prescribed).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A similar process to being over the legal BAC level is undertaken using the evidence to penalise the user.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{See also|Impaired driving in Canada#Field_sobriety_tests}}
Commentary varies on taking SFSTs in Canada.  Some sources, especially official ones, indicate that the SFSTs are mandatory,&lt;ref name="sfj"&gt;[https://stepstojustice.ca/common-question-step/1-do-roadside-standardized-field-sobriety-test What are my rights if the police think I’ve been taking drugs and driving?], Steps to Justice (advises that FST is mandatory)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Breathalyzer"&gt;[https://www.legalline.ca/legal-answers/breathalyzer-and-roadside-tests/Breathalyzer Breathalyzer and roadside tests (Ont.)], legalline.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rcmp"&gt;[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ts-sr/aldr-id-cfa-aldr-eng.htm Alcohol and Drug Impaired Driving - Tests, Criminal Charges, Penalties, Suspensions and Prohibitions] - RCMP&lt;/ref&gt; and required under §&amp;nbsp;254(2)(a) of the Criminal code, whereas other sources are silent on FST testing.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/what-must-i-legally-do-when-police-pull-me-over/article25829415/ What must I legally do when police pull me over?], ''Globe and Mail'', 4-Aug-2015&lt;/ref&gt;.  The assertion regarding mandatory compliance with SFSTs is based on "failure to comply with a demand", as an offence under §&amp;nbsp;254(5) of the Criminal Code, but it is unclear how refusal of SFSTs under §&amp;nbsp;254(2)(a) are treated (provided the suspect agrees to take a chemical test).  '''''N.B.:''''' There are some reports that refusal to submit to an SFST can result in the same penalties as impaired driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bruceengel.com/2015/03/test-time-what-to-expect-from-field-sobriety-tests-if-youre-pulled-over-for-suspicion-of-impaired-driving/ Engel &amp; Associates] (law firm in Ottawa)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether there has ever been a prosecution under this interpretation of "failure to comply with a demand" as applied to SFSTs.  Canada Criminal Code §&amp;nbsp;254(1) and (5) addresses this, but only with respect to chemical testing (breath, blood, etc.)&lt;ref name="C-46_254"&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-254.html Canada Code §254] [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/FullText.html (full text of criminal code)] [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/C-46.pdf (full text, .pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

United States law on DUI, primarily falls under state law, but are still subject to federal Constitutional requirements.  Thus, in all jurisdictions, participation in FSTs is voluntary.&lt;ref name="nolo_ref-long"&gt;[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press ("As a general rule (and unlike chemical testing), there is no legal penalty for refusing to take these tests although the arresting officer can typically testify as to your refusal in court.")&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the legal procedure is ''police stop'' (Police stop requiring "reasonable suspicion" or another qualified reason for a police stop), ''probable cause'', and ''arrest''.  FSTs are requested in the ''police stop'' phase, and are used to provide tangible evidence sufficient to meet the requirements for ''probable cause'' for an arrest.  Evidential tests are performed in the ''arrest'' stage, although the terminology may vary.&lt;ref name="aclu_orsherif"&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/files/FilesPDFs/ALPR/oregon/Washington%20County%20Sheriff%27s%20Office/30012-30050%20Search%20and%20Seizure%20Field%20Guide.pdf Search and Seizure Field Guide, Wash. Cty., OR (2008)], distributed by ACLU as ''Stops and Arrests - American Civil Liberties Union''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nolo_ref"&gt;[https://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test.htm DUI: Refusal to Take a Field Test, or Blood, Breath or Urine Test], NOLO Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of the terminology, in order to sustain a conviction based on evidential tests, ''probable cause'' must be shown (or the suspect must volunteer to take the evidential test without [[Implied consent#Driving_while_intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements being invoked).&lt;ref name="nolo_ref" /&gt;

Police are not obliged to advise the suspect that participation in a FST or other pre-arrest procedures is voluntary.  In contrast, formal evidentiary tests given under [[Implied consent#Driving_while_intoxicated|implied consent]] requirements are considered mandatory.&lt;ref name="nolo_ref" /&gt;

[[File:Montgolfiere Gatineau.png|right|250pxl]]

The '''Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival''' is a yearly festival, held in [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]], Canada, and organized by a not-for-profit organization, during which [[hot air balloons]] of every shape and colour are flown and where 300 shows and performances adding up to over 60 hours’ worth of programming are taking place. More than 200,000 visitors and 1,000 RVs usually participate.
It is held over four days in late-August and early September during the [[Labor Day Weekend]].

==History==

[[File:Filling balloons with hot air.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Filling balloons for the festival]]
[[File:Ballons in Gatineau.JPG|thumb|200px|Balloon riding during the 2005 Festival]]

===Jean Boileau era and the festival's beginning (1988-2001)===
The festival started in 1988 by [[Jean Boileau]] and attracted about 50 000 visitors and about 50 balloons. Through the following years the festival became much larger and was one of the biggest festivals in Canada. Attendance at one point reached over 225,000 people and had over 150 balloons. In 1998, the festival was also hosting the [[World Hot Air Airship Championship]], which was disputed by 16 teams from Europe, China and the United States.

===Fatal accident and festival departure (2001-2002)===

On July 14, 2001, Boileau who was the general manager since its beginning was involved in a horrific hot-air balloon accident just east of the [[Ottawa International Airport]] on [[Leitrim Road (Ottawa)|Leitrim Road]]. The balloon, while trying to land in an open field, struck some hydro wires after a sudden wind gust. It suddenly engulfed in flames. Boileau sustained multiple burns while trying to rescue his 15-year-old daughter, Julie, who was trapped inside the balloon's basket. Unfortunately, the rescue effort failed as the girl died instantly while two other people also sustained burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Duquette, Patrick | title = Une jeune fille meurt dans une nacelle en feu | publisher = Le Droit | date = July 16, 2001 | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boileau, despite the fact that a subsequent Transport Canada report which mention that the accident was caused by a pilot error and bad weather conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Plante, Jean-Francois|title = Jean Boileau n'aurait pas respecté les procédures de vol, affirme le BST | publisher = Le Droit| date = January 15, 2003 | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was later honored by then-governor general [[Adrienne Clarkson]] for bravery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Duqette, Patrick | title = Jean Boileau reçoit la médaille de la bravoure | publisher = Le Droit|date = June 14, 2003 | page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a commemorative plaque was unveiled at the La Baie Park for Boileau's daughter known as the festival's first volunteer and a tree was also planted on site in her honor in conjunction of the festival's 20th Anniversary which also honored the founder of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Radio Canada |title = Que la Fete commence |publisher = Radio-Canada | url = http://www.radio-canada.ca/regions/ottawa/2007/08/31/002-festival-montgolfieres.shtml | date = August 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Le Droit|title = Une 20e édition du Festival de montgolfières remplie d'émotions|date = August 31, 2001| page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that event, he never piloted a hot-air balloon and left his general manager spot of the Festival afterwards - some speculations were that the new city of Gatineau administration of [[Yves Ducharme]] tried to force him out of the job by offering a spot for the new city as chief of communications. He was handled that position for a few months during rehabilitation, but the position was later removed and changed as the position of director of communications and the City did not appointed him due to health reasons caused by his accident. Some speculated that the Ducharme administration wanted to remove people who were associated with the former city of Gatineau's last mayor, [[Robert Labine]] and Ducharme's mayoral rival in the 2001 elections for the new city of Gatineau. However, a settlement between the city and Boileau was made in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Larocque, Sylvain| title = Gatineau se défend d'avoir voulu "tasser" Jean Boileau | publisher = Le Droit| date = July 10, 2002|page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The departure of Boileau had also put the Festival's future in doubt as several of his associates also left the Festival's organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Le Droit|title = Boileau : la bataille se fait sur l'occupation de son poste
 | date = February 25, 2003 | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Theriault, Charles | title = Le Festival de montgolfières en péril | publisher = Le Droit | date = January 11, 2002|page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boileau is currently the communication director of the City of Gatineau since October 2013

[[Pope Leo X]] called [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croatia]] the ''[[Antemurale Christianitatis]]'' ("Bulwark of Christianity") in 1519,&lt;ref name="Velikonja2003"&gt;{{cite book|last= Velikonja|first= Mitja|title =Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rqjLgtYDKQ0C&amp;pg=PA78|year= 2003|publisher= Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn= 978-1-60344-724-9|page= 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; given that Croatian soldiers made significant contributions to the struggle against the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]]. The advancement of the Ottoman Empire in Europe was stopped in 1593 on Croatian soil ([[Battle of Sisak]]). Nevertheless, the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Muslim Ottoman Empire]] occupied parts of Croatia from the 16th to the end of the 17th century.

== Time span ==
There are several different variations about the exact length of the war. According to one group of historians, the war began with the [[Battle of Krbava Field]] in 1493, and ended with the [[Battle of Sisak]] in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.hrstud.hr/hrvatskistudiji/nastavniprogrami/POVIJEST.pdf Hrvatski studiji] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011113332/http://www.hrstud.hr/hrvatskistudiji/nastavniprogrami/POVIJEST.pdf |date=2010-10-11 }} Studij povijesti&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the other group of historians, the war lasted from the second half of the 15th century and into the entire 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.hercegbosna.org/kontroverze/politicko-povijesne-analize-mladen-ancic/mladen-ancic-hrvatski-ulog-u-bosni-193.html Hercegbosna.org] Mladen Ančić: Hrvatski ulog u Bosni, 2. prosinca 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third group of historians mark the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]] in 1606 as the end of the war. The war was won by the Ottoman's defeat upon their advance on the [[Kupa]] river border, with the remainder of Croatia's territory consisting of only 16,800&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Milan Kruhek: Granice Hrvatskog Kraljevstva u međunarodnim državnim ugovorima, Povijesni prilozi 10/1991., str.37-39, ISSN 0351-9767&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the human and territorial loss, and also from [[Croatian nationalism|the modern Croatian Romanticist point of view]], the 15th and 16th centuries were known as the "Two centuries of Croatia in mourning" ({{lang-la|Plorantis Croatiae saecula duo carmine descripta|links=no}}) in the lyric-epic poem of [[Pavao Ritter Vitezović]] from 1703.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://arhinet.arhiv.hr/_Generated/Pages/Stvaratelji.PublicDetails.aspx?ItemId=10075 ARHiNET arhivski informacijski sistem] Pavao Ritter Vitezović&lt;/ref&gt;

== Battlefield ==
The battlefields were concentrated in the central-eastern areas of the Kingdom of Croatia, stretching from the eastern border of the [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|pre-Ottoman times]] to the eastern border of the "''reliquiae reliquiarum olim inclyti regni Croatiae''" ("remnants of the remnants of the once great kingdom of Croatia").

After the 1493 loss at Krbava, the Ottomans started the occupation of significant forts: [[Knin]] and [[Skradin]] fell in 1522.&lt;ref name="Raukar-1990"/&gt; The [[Battle of Mohács]] happened in 1526. [[Jajce]] fell in 1528, [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]] in 1536, [[Klis]] fell in 1537, [[Nadin]] and [[Vrana (town)|Vrana]] in 1538, moving the Croatian-Ottoman border to the line, roughly, Požega-[[Bihać]]-[[Velebit]]-[[Zrmanja]]-[[Cetina]].&lt;ref name="Raukar-1990"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Tomislav | last = Raukar | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=110340&amp;lang=en | title = Hrvatska na razmeđu XV i XVI. stoljeća | language = Croatian | journal = Senjer Jahrbuch  | volume = 10 | number = 1 |date=October 1990 | issn = 0582-673X | page = 5–14 | accessdate = 2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1540, the Ottoman Empire occupied the Croatian possessions between [[Skradin]] and [[Donji Karin|Karin]], eliminating them as a buffer zone between the Ottoman and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] territory in [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=76941&amp;lang=en | language = Serbian | author = Bogumil Hrabak | title = Turske provale i osvajanja na području današnje severne Dalmacije do sredine XVI. stoleća | journal = Journal of the Institute of Croatian History| volume = 19 | number = 1 |date=September 1986 | issn = 0353-295X | accessdate = 2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1573, the remainder of the Dalmatian hinterland, now largely controlled by the Venetian cities, was even further reduced by Ottoman advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Tomislav | last = Raukar | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=86538&amp;lang=en | title = Venecija i ekonomski razvoj Dalmacije u XV i XVI stoljeću | language = Croatian | journal = Journal of the Institute of Croatian History| volume = 10 | number = 1 |date=November 1977 | issn = 0353-295X | page = 221 | accessdate = 2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International impact ==
Although the Croatian Kingdom suffered major defeats in battles, it remained in existence, keeping its identity, religion and culture under the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In addition, some [[Croats]] in the territories lost to the Ottomans remained because the [[High Porte|Porte]] [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|embraced ethnic diversity]], many of them eventually converting to [[Sunni Islam|Islam]] throughout the following centuries of Ottoman rule.

The Croatian combat against the Ottomans did not remain unnoticed in the political circles of European states. Copious amounts of information from the war was written in ''Monumenta Hungariae Historica, Codex diplomaticus partium Regno Hungariae adnexarum'' from 1903 (over 600 documents).

== Type of conflicts ==
During those 100 years (or 150 years, depending on criteria), the war on the territory of Kingdom of Croatia was overall a series of smaller [[armed conflict]]s ("small war") over the long duration of the war (in other words, armies were not always in constant battle.)

The Ottoman tactic consisted of persistent [[looting|loot]] and [[Scorched earth|scorching]] raids whose aim was to intimidate and demoralize the [[peasants|local civil inhabitants]], to exhaust the economic opportunities and disable the normal economic life on the frontier areas. On the other side, Croatian and [[Holy Roman Empire|allied Christian]] forces implemented counterattacks, especially in the first phases of war, when they were still able to apply the counterattacking or the offensive tactics. Despite these destructive tactics, the armies did sometimes clash. Sometimes the local armies intercepted or pursued the raiders in their return from the raid. There was also more intense military actions, such as the [[Battle of Krbava Field]] or the [[Battle of Sisak]].

== Zones of war peril ==
The war-endangered areas can be classified in three zones:

*The '''first zone''' was the territory of Kingdom of Croatia, that had no effective control by both sides, as well as the parts of Kingdom of Croatia that were heavily struck by the [[Ottoman army|Ottoman military]] and [[Martolos|paramilitary]] operations. This zone was up to 50&amp;nbsp;km deep in the Croatian territory. It mostly covered the areas along the border and the later-formed [[Military Frontier]]. The [[infrastructure]] and the supra-structure became ruined and devastated, and the economic life suffered. This zone had high rate of [[emigration]], mostly to the second and the third zones, along with emigrations abroad.
*The '''second zone''' was from time to time exposed to the raids of the [[Ottoman Army|Ottoman regular]] and [[Akıncı|irregular forces]]. The area was controlled by the [[Ban of Croatia|Croatian authorities]] and the economic life was still somewhat functioning. Population level was steady and received a continuous inflow of displacees from the first zone. The Croatian nobles used this zone as the support point and the base for the defense or for the attempts of retaking of their estates in the first zone. These areas lived as economic support of the armies.
*The '''third zone''' was mostly Ottoman raid-safe zone, in which the majority of the zone had no Ottoman raids, although few areas were subjected to Ottoman [[raid (military)|raids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Migracijske i Etničke Teme|issn=1333-2546|author=Ivan Jurković|language=Croatian|pages=147–174|title=Klasifikacija hrvatskih raseljenika za trajanja osmanske ugroze (od 1463. do 1593.)|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=11913|trans-title=Classification of Displacees Among Croats During the Ottoman Peril (from 1463 till 1593)|accessdate=5 November 2011|volume=19|issue=2–3|date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indore Fashion Week''' (IFW) or '''Blenders Pride Indore Fashion Week''' (BPIFW) is an annual fashion event that takes place in [[Indore]]. It is considered a premier fashion event in central India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Its gonna be fashionable in March at Indore|url=http://digital.dnaindia.com/story.aspx?edorsup=Sup&amp;wintype=popup&amp;queryed=820076&amp;querypage=1&amp;boxid=26952376&amp;id=27912&amp;eddate=2012-9-26&amp;ed_date=2012-9-26&amp;ed_code=820076|newspaper=''[[Daily News and Analysis]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is run by ''Storm Fashion Company'' (SFC) and the title sponsor is [[Seagram|Blenders Pride]].

==Indore Fashion Week 2012==
Organised by Storm Fashion Company, Pernod Ricard India and Hotel Sayaji, the first Blenders Pride Indore Fashion Week saw participation from both established and emerging designers from across the country, including biggies like Jattinn Kochhar and [[Rocky S]]. Fifty models, including the show’s brand ambassadors [[Shawar Ali]] and Miss Asia Pacific World 2012 [[Himangini Singh Yadu]], were the style ambassadors for the fashion week. The shows was choreographed and directed by Former Miss India Priyanka Shah and Renu Sukheja.

BPIFW featured the collection of designers from all over India. There were three shows each day. Designers from [[Indore]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], and [[Cochin]] showcased their collections, mostly on bridal themes.

The Spring Summer edition of the Blenders Pride Indore Fashion Week 2013 took place from 6 to 10 March which saw a number of high-profile designers like Rocky S., Jatinn Kochhar, Riyaz Ganji, Poonam Vora, Sanjana Jon and many more from [[Dubai]], [[New York City]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Delhi]] participating. Many of the designers had show-stoppers to add that extra edge of glamour to their shows. Famous models like [[Kashmira Shah]], [[Zulfi Syed]], [[Simran Kaur Mundi|Simran Kaur]] as well as Indian film stars such as [[Mugdha Godse]], [[Nafisa Khan|Ziah Khan]], [[Payal Rohatgi]] and [[Sangram Singh]] have participated in the BPIFW, 2013.

The fashion week saw sensational collections ranging from heavy Indian/Bridal wear to lustrous western designs. The week was aimed at involving the discerning and ever evolving Indore crowd with the latest and upcoming trends in the fashion industry. Around 40 models walked the ramp displaying western, ethnic and Indian Bridal Wear on the first day of mega event.  Second day of Indore Fashion week witnessed some of finest dresses made from Madhya Pradesh’s handwork including Begham and Anarkali Collection.  The last day were dedicated to summer collections of three fashion designers from [[Indore]], [[New York City]] and [[Mumbai]] with their creative creations on ramp.

==Indore Fashion Week 2014==
IFW, 2014 was organized at [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Blu]], [[Indore]] from 21–23 March 2014. A robust line-up of 9 designers  participated in the event.

==Criticism==
The BPIFW, 2013 was a success and received well response by media and audience but the less number of local designers and models made it an issue of criticism among local fashion fraternity of Indore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MP-based designers and models feel left out|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-15/shows/37743455_1_fashion-designers-local-designers-fashion-week|newspaper=''[[The Times of India]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large participation of international fashion designers, film actors and models from [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Kolkata]] disappointed local models and designers though the fashion week was concluded with a thumbs up from audience and media.

'''''Jerk''''' is a one-person [[Puppetry|puppet play]] by the American writer [[Dennis Cooper]], made in collaboration with director Gisèle Vienne and performer Jonathan Capdevielle, based on Cooper's 1993 novel of the same name.&lt;ref name=prog&gt;From the programme ''Paris Calling: A Franco-British Season of Performing Arts 09''; see also ''Jerk'' on denniscooper.net and the ''Jerk'' page on Gisèle Vienne's website.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the story of [[serial killer]] [[Dean Corll]] and his teenage accomplices David Brooks and [[Elmer Wayne Henley]].&lt;ref name=prog/&gt; The play develops the conceit that Brooks has learnt puppetry in prison and, as part of his rehabilitation, acts out the murders in which he participated via the use of glove puppets and [[ventriloquism]]. The performance also involved sections in which the audience read about the murders in pamphlets, entitled "Two Texts for a Puppet Play by David Brooks" that were distributed.

The production premiered on 5 March 2008 in [[Brest, France]].&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Jerk'' page on Gisèle Vienne's website.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was also performed in an English-language version at the [[South London Gallery]] as part of the ''Paris Calling'' season of performing arts, opening on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;See the SLG Events webpage.&lt;/ref&gt; Its performance included music by [[Peter Rehberg]].

In his analysis of ''Jerk'', theater scholar Jordan Schildcrout states, "The production becomes a meta-puppet show when the actor playing David is giving voice to the puppets playing the killers, who in turn give voice to the puppets playing the corpses... In the final scenario, though, David abandons his puppets and does all the voices, including his own, as a ventriloquist, not moving his lips, as if he is also losing his humanity, becoming increasingly inanimate. In the story, David is ultimately alone in a house of corpses, and in performance he is alone on an empty stage, with only lifeless puppets sharing the space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schildcrout|first1=Jordan|title=Murder Most Queer: The Homicidal Homosexual in the American Theater|date=2014|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472072323|pages=171-172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Births==
*[[100 BC]] &amp;ndash; [[Julius Caesar]], Roman politician and general (d. 44 BC)&lt;ref&gt;There is some dispute over the year of Caesar's birth.

Similarly, some scholars prefer 12 July for the day of his birth, but others give 13 July.

"'''Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)'''" is a song by American singer [[Katy Perry]] from her third studio album, ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]''. The song was written and produced by [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Max Martin]], who also co-wrote the song with Perry and [[Bonnie McKee]]. Perry stated that she was inspired to write the track after a night of wild partying and streaking. It was released as the album's fifth single on June 6, 2011, by [[Capitol Records]], with a remix featuring American rapper [[Missy Elliott]] released to US radio stations and digital retailers on August 8, 2011; this version was included in ''[[Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection]]'' edition. It is a [[dance-pop]] song with lyrics about drunken fun and debauchery. Some of the risque lyrics in the song are often censored in radio versions of the song.

The song had chart success worldwide, reaching number one in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, and has attained top-ten positions in Austria, Ireland, Italy, and Poland. By topping the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], Perry became the first female solo artist to have five number-one singles on the Hot 100 from a single album; it also was Perry's sixth number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, and her fifth consecutive number one single. The single had sold 3.7 million digital copies in the US and was the tenth most played single on US radio during 2011.

The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Marc Klasfeld]]. The clip features Perry, as her teenage alter-ego Kathy Beth Terry, at a house party filled with music and dancing. While at the party, Terry is made over by her friend and draws attention to herself as the life of the party. The video features appearances by notable music artists and actors, which includes [[Rebecca Black]], [[Corey Feldman]], [[Debbie Gibson]], [[Kenny G]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], and [[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]] and [[Darren Criss]] of ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. According to the director, the inspiration behind the video was ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'', works by American filmmaker [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], and other 1980s high school films. The music video won Favorite Music Video award at the [[38th People's Choice Awards]].

==Background and artwork==
Perry has revealed that she was inspired to write the track after running naked through a park with her friends. According to Music Rooms, Perry claims that after a wild night of partying and streaking, she wrote the song about her antics and what she remembered the next day. Perry revealed: "There's nothing better than an impromptu dance party with my friends. My track 'Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)' is a song about debauchery because I had one of those nights in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. We went out to this place called Wildcat and got crazy," Perry admitted: "We had a couple of beers and danced until we died, then brought the party back to the hotel room." She added: "Most of that song is actual truth, apart from the [[ménage à trois]]..... unfortunately! But, yes, streaking in the park, that's what we did, so we had to write a song about it the next day!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/katy-perry/news/261855-katy-perry-streaking-naked-russell-brand |title=Katy Perry Says Streaking Inspired Album Track |date=March 10, 2011 |publisher=MTV |accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the friends in this trip was co-writer [[Bonnie McKee]], who said the song encapsulated "Katy and my wild drinking days" from their younger days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diehl|first=Matt|title=Singles Lady: Bonnie McKee Is Looking Out For Number One|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5646340/singles-lady-bonnie-mckee-is-looking-out-for-number-one?page=0%2C1|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKee stated "TGIF is pretty much a word for word description of our trip to Santa Barbara, so I love that one. It's really catchy and fun and makes me nostalgic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://alexkazemi.com/2010/07/listensingle-review-teenage-dream-katy-perry/ Alexkazemi.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807001855/http://alexkazemi.com/2010/07/listensingle-review-teenage-dream-katy-perry/ |date=August 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official artwork for "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" using scenes from the music video, shows Perry both before and after a makeover.

==Critical reception==
[[AllMusic]] picked it among the top tracks on the album, and said that Perry "salutes fellow attention-whore [[Kesha]] on 'Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/teenage-dream-r1834720/review |title=Teenage Dream – Katy Perry |publisher=AllMusic |date=August 24, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that "Perry likes her songs chatty; in the kegger romp "Last Friday Night," she chirps, "Think I need a ginger ale/That was such an epic fail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/teenage-dream-20100823 |title=Teenage Dream by Katy Perry &amp;#124; Music Reviews |work=Rolling Stone  |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' said that "'Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)' is a lifeless roller-rink jam with a 'T! G! I! F!' shout-along that will no doubt provide the soundtrack to any number of trashy sorority parties this semester".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/katy-perry-teenage-dream/2219 |title=Katy Perry: Teenage Dream |work=Slant Magazine |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spin Magazine]]'' said that "Last Friday Night recounts an evening of nonstop naughtiness – think streaking, skinny-dipping, and ménage à trois-ing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood |first=Mikael |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/katy-perry-teenage-dream-capitol |title=Katy Perry, 'Teenage Dream' (Capitol) |work=Spin |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Richards from ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' wrote, "The singer recently said that the catchy 'Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)' is her version of '[[I Gotta Feeling]]'. With lyrics about photos ending up online after a debauched evening, it's also reminiscent of Lady Gaga singing about drunkenly losing her keys and phone on '[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]].' Derivative, sure, but the song strikes a perfect equilibrium between Perry's sex appeal and goofy, self-effacing charm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards |first=Jason |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/discs.cfm?content=176438 |title=NOW Magazine // Music // Katy Perry |publisher=Nowtoronto.com |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Hawthorne from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that "assuming that everything here is based on real life also means we have to accept that she's had a ménage à trois on the indie-rock-meets-American Idol cut Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)".&lt;ref name="indie rock"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawthorne |first=Marc |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/katy-perry-teenage-dream,44690/ |title=Katy Perry: Teenage Dream |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Richards from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that "Over strummy guitars and zigzagging keyboards, Perry recounts an evening of debauchery with no repercussions, her innocent transgressions (streaking, skinny-dipping) mentioned in the same breath as more serious trouble (mysterious bruises, a blackout), but..... [when] it's time for Perry to reflect on her 3 am follies, she stiffly sings, "That was such an epic fail." It sounds like a clueless parent's attempt to speak teenager."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/23/AR2010082304256.html |title=Album review of 'Teenage Dream' by Katy Perry |work=The Washington Post |date= August 24, 2010|accessdate=April 9, 2011 |first=Chris |last=Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' included the song in their ''Five Potential Pop Hits for 2011'' list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/473732/ask-billboard-readers-2010-top-picks-continued |title=Ask Billboard: Readers' 2010 Top Picks, Continued – Chart Beat |work=Billboard  |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Hawthorne from ''Future Music Charts'' said that it sounds like a pop song as it should be without any auto-tune voice changes and hard DJ beats, which is the song's strength and weakness at the same time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawthorne |first=Tom |url=http://www.futuremusiccharts.nl/futuremusiccharts/2011/04/katy-perry-last-friday-night-tgif.html |title=Katy Perry: Teenage Dream FMC Review|publisher=Future Music Charts |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the form of an [[open letter]] to Perry, comedian [[Rob Delaney (comedian)|Rob Delaney]] takes her to task for glamorizing [[binge drinking]], [[unsafe sex]], and possibly [[date rape]] in the song. He comments on it lyric-by-lyric, sometimes humorously (in response to the line "''Yeah we maxed our credit cards''", Delaney writes "[[Suze Orman]] would be so angry if I told her this.") but more often seriously. To the line "''Don't know what to tell my boss''", he says:
{{quote|Why do you have to tell your boss anything? Were your exploits reported in the paper? Is your boss also your landlord? Wait—aren't you international pop superstar, Katy Perry? I would have thought you were your own boss. Uh oh, I think we're arriving at why this song is not just awful, but is in fact dangerous. You are playing a character in this song! A character ''based on the young female demographic you target your music at'': young women who do have jobs and bosses and mothers and fathers and necks and vaginas which sure as hell will be damaged and violated if they subscribe to the ideas you foist on them with your songs and the confusing "goofy slut" persona you've created.&lt;ref name="RobDelaney"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Delaney|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Delaney (comedian)|title=Dear Katy Perry|url=https://www.vice.com/read/take-a-stroll-with-rob-delaney-dear-katy-perry|work=[[Vice (magazine)|vice.com]]|date=October 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" made Perry the first and only female artist to have five #1 singles from one album in ''Billboard'' Hot 100, tying [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'', with his last #1 single being "[[Dirty Diana]]", on July 2, 1988. Perry's song debuted at number 67 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pietroluongo, Silvio (September 2, 2010).|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/956542/eminem-and-rihanna-still-no-1-on-hot-100-cee-los-fk-you-debuts |title=Eminem and Rihanna Still No. 1 on Hot 100, Cee Lo's 'F**k You' Debuts |work=Billboard  |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also charted at number 49 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]] chart that same week. Following its single release, the song re-entered the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 on June 18, 2011 at number 63 and at number 31 on the ''Billboard'' [[Pop Songs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trust, Gary (June 8, 2011).|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/470794/adeles-still-deep-atop-hot-100-coldplay-makes-a-splash |title=Adele's Still 'Deep' Atop Hot 100, Coldplay Makes a Splash |work=Billboard  |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, the song jumped 63-31 with the Hot 100's "Greatest Gainer" award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Trust, Gary (June 15, 2011).|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/470537/adele-rolling-along-atop-hot-100-jason-aldean-nicki-minaj-reach-top-10 |title=Adele 'Rolling' Along Atop Hot 100, Jason Aldean &amp; Nicki Minaj Reach Top 10 |work=Billboard  |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its fourth week on the chart, "Friday" leaped to number four, spurred by a number one ranking on [[Hot Digital Songs]].

The song finally reached the number-one position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 on August 17, 2011, and spent two straight weeks there. The song became Perry's sixth number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, and her fifth consecutive number-one single. Perry became the first woman in the 53-year history of ''Billboard'' to take five singles from the same album to number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, equaling the record established by Michael Jackson 23 years earlier.&lt;ref name="billboard1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trust|first=Gary|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467879/katy-perry-makes-hot-100-history-ties-michael-jacksons-record |title= Katy Perry Makes Hot 100 History: Ties Michael Jackson's Record|work=Billboard|date= August 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song has also peaked at number-one on the Canadian Hot 100, and has become her fourth number-one single from the album.

===Synopsis===
[[File:LFN KatyPerry video.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Perry's alter-ego 'Kathy Beth Terry' in the music video for "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)"]]
Kathy Beth Terry (Perry), a nerdy teenager with braces, headgear, and oversized glasses, has just awakened the morning after a house party, surrounded by passed-out partygoers. A male guest, Aaron Christopherson (''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' star [[Darren Criss]]) opens the door to her bedroom and congratulates her on having the "best party ever." Puzzled as to what happened, she goes online, only to find pictures of herself in various compromising positions, including one picture of her licking the stomach of the boy in bed next to her. The video then goes into a flashback of the events that occurred the night before. While doing a [[Sudoku]] puzzle, Kathy hears loud music from the house next door, and goes over to complain. She is greeted by [[Rebecca Black]] (who appears as a homage to Black's viral video "[[Friday (Rebecca Black song)|Friday]]"), who invites her in. A nerdy Everett McDonald (''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' star [[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) ogles Terry from afar and fantasizes about being with her.

However, Kathy is more interested in Steve Johnson aka "The [[Jock (athlete)|Jock]]" (model Richie Nuzzolese), an attractive football player, who turns her down because of her appearance. To cheer her up, Black gives Kathy a makeover, ripping off her headgear with pliers, waxing her upper lip, dressing her in tight-fitting neon clothes, and teasing her hair out. Steve becomes enamored with her, and everyone starts dancing. Kathy and Rebecca are also seen playing the song "[[Hot Stuff (Donna Summer song)|Hot Stuff]]" on ''[[Just Dance 2]]'' by [[Ubisoft]]  (a game that features Perry as DLC). Musician [[Kenny G]], despite not having played the saxophone on the song's actual recording, plays the saxophone solo on the roof while [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] act as the house band. The entire party ends up moving to Kathy's house, where she throws up after drinking too much. Everett punches Steve for trying to fondle Kathy's buttocks (visualized by him as a medieval sword fight with Kathy as a [[damsel in distress]]).

At the end of the night, Kathy finally passes out next to Steve. The video shifts back to the next morning, where she looks at the photos with regret, but is also ecstatic to have a naked Steve passed out in her bed. The film ends with former [[teen idol]]s [[Corey Feldman]] and [[Debbie Gibson]] as Kathy's parents, Kirk and Tiffany Terry, confronting Kathy about the state of the house but forgiving her after recalling their own wild youth, Feldman making several references to ''[[The Lost Boys]]'', in which he starred. The video's ending credits feature various deleted lines, bloopers, and extra scenes from the party, as well as Everett bringing Kathy breakfast in bed. After the credits end, it repeats the shot where Kathy gets tape ripped off her upper lip; her scream is heard this time.

==Live performances==
On September 5, 2010, Perry performed the song live for the first time along with "[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry song)|Teenage Dream]]", "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]" and "[[Not Like The Movies]]" in the show's launch of the ''Teenage Dream'' in Berlin.
Though the song has never been performed live as part of a televised performance, the song is featured on the set lists of the ''Teenage Dream Tour'', ''[[California Dreams Tour]]'', ''[[Prismatic World Tour]]'' and ''[[Witness: The Tour]]''. The first televised performance was during her presentation at [[Rock In Rio]], which was broadcast live by the [[Multishow]]. During this song, photos of fans are displayed on the screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.einnews.com/pr-news/385792-katy-perry-debuts-tweet-to-screen-for-california-dreams-2011-tour- |title=Katy Perry Debuts Tweet-to-Screen for California Dreams 2011 Tour – Music Industry Today |publisher=Music.einnews.com |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724051624/http://music.einnews.com/pr-news/385792-katy-perry-debuts-tweet-to-screen-for-california-dreams-2011-tour- |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Maclean's'' "Too Asian" controversy''' is a controversy around an article published by ''[[Maclean's]]'' in 2010.

==Article's content and criticism==
The article begins by introducing Alexandra and Rachel, two recently graduated [[White people|white]] students from [[Havergal College]], an [[elite]] [[Single-sex education|all-girl]]'s [[private school]] located in [[Toronto]]. Kohler and Findlay explain that these students made a choice that is common among [[North America]]'s white youth: opting not to attend a [[university]] with the reputation of being "too Asian".  The term, Kohler and Findlay continue to explain, indicates a university that is intellectually rigorous with an unbalanced [[campus]] social climate, brought upon by the presence of academically focused Asian students.&lt;ref name="macleans1" /&gt; The article concludes with a note that Alexandra left [[University of Western Ontario|Western University]], a school considered to be attended by "white students" in the article, for [[University of Toronto]], which is considered to be "too Asian".

Many critics argued that the article's subsequent attempts to provide a debate about the role of race on [[List of universities in Canada|Canadian university campuses]], and the "over-representation" of Asian students on elite university campuses, was highly offensive: it framed "Asian" students as single-minded and socially inept hard-workers, spurred by their tradition and culture, while "white" students are more concerned with the social aspect of universities, such as drinking and partying. Many critiques also took issue with the article's conflation of "[[Asian people|Asian]]" with [[Chinese people|Chinese]], quoting a number of Chinese students in their article, while never addressing how "Asian" itself is a category that subsumes many different ethnic groups. Moreover, no distinction between international students and Canadian-born "Asians" was made (an important distinction that was completely disregarded in the survey). Critics were also shocked by the article's reference to debates in American universities regarding the initiation of race-based quotas to "balance" their campuses because of the over-representation of Asian students.&lt;ref name="macleans1" /&gt;

Response to the article was immediate, widespread and disfavourable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/11/15/jeet-heer-macleans-article-on-asians-familiar-to-anti-semites-of-old/ |first=Jeet|last=Heer |title=Maclean’s article on Asians familiar to anti-Semites of old |newspaper=[[National Post]] |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zi-Ann |last=Lum |url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/divercity/2010/11/11/too-asian-too-racist-magazine-macleans |title="Too Asian?" too racist for a magazine like Maclean's? |newspaper=The Vancouver Observer |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jezebel.com/5687559/yes-calling-a-school-too-asian-is-racist |title=Yes, Calling A School "Too Asian" Is Racist |publisher=Jezebel.com |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics{{snd}} ranging from journalist bloggers&lt;ref name="tumblr1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etiquette-etc.tumblr.com/post/1607948924/not-white-enough-what-the-macleans-article-says-about |title=Etiquette, etc |publisher=Etiquette-etc.tumblr.com |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2012-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231218/http://etiquette-etc.tumblr.com/post/1607948924/not-white-enough-what-the-macleans-article-says-about |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ask a Model Minority Suicide |url=http://www.hyphenmagazine.com/blog/archive/2010/11/too-asian-responding-question |title='Too Asian?': Responding to the Question |publisher=Hyphen magazine |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="racialicious1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Arturo R. |last=García |url=http://www.racialicious.com/2010/11/12/macleans-magazine-revisits-old-fears-with-too-asian-article/ |title=Maclean’s Magazine revisits old fears with ‘Too Asian?’ article |publisher=Racialicious |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2012-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608095453/http://www.racialicious.com/2010/11/12/macleans-magazine-revisits-old-fears-with-too-asian-article/ |archivedate=2012-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to academics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Krissy |last=Darch |url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/thescene/2010/11/25/asian-whatever-means |title=Asian, whatever that means |newspaper=The Vancouver Observer |date=2010-11-25 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-358546/vancouver/henry-yu-why-macleans-and-racism-should-no-longer-define-canada |first=Henry |last=Yu |title=Why Macleans and racism should no longer define Canada |publisher=Straight.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ring.uvic.ca/10dec/tooasian.html |first=Shelly |last=Chan |title="Too Asian"?

The article was criticized for recalling stereotypes of Asians as unbalanced foreigners, with the aim of overthrowing white [[Canadians]] from power.&lt;ref name="Open Letter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Minelle |last=Mahtani |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/canadian-media-its-time-to-cover-the-undercovered/article1314521/ |title=Canadian media: It’s time to cover the undercovered |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2012-04-04 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further criticism followed from the fact that the article depicted Asians as a homogeneous group, without attention to the fact that people from various groups can be classified as "Asian".&lt;ref name="walrusmagazine1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/blogs/2010/11/24/too-brazen/ |title=Too Brazen |first=Jeet |last=Heer |publisher=The Walrus Blog |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2012-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202222425/http://walrusmagazine.com/blogs/2010/11/24/too-brazen/ |archive-date=2012-12-02 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another commentator argued that the article inaccurately perpetuated the myth that universities functioned as [[Meritocracy|meritocracies]], without taking into account that minorities have to overcome social hurdles, such as racial discrimination and [[prejudice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ghabrial |first=Sarah |url=http://rabble.ca/news/2010/11/when-asians-enroll-and-other-tales-meritocracy%E2%80%99s-margins |title=When Asians enroll! (And other tales from meritocracy's margins) |publisher=Rabble.ca |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also argued that the article justified the idea that whites are entitled to attend university, because it never explicitly condemns, and therefore indirectly condones, Alexandra and Rachel's belief that certain universities were "too Asian".&lt;ref name="tumblr1" /&gt;

==Protest and government action==
Coupled with the critiques of the piece was activism and action from [[grassroots]], academic, governmental, university, and youth sectors.  The activism protesting the piece manifested in a number of different forms, ranging from humorous (but critical) videos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tetsuro |last=Shigematsu |url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/thescene/2011/01/25/too-asian |title=Too Asian? |newspaper=The Vancouver Observer |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to community web pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/TooAsianTALKBACK |title="Too Asian"? TALK BACK |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gatherings.

[[Olivia Chow]], a [[Member of Parliament]] and member of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], put forth a motion in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] calling for the censure of ''Maclean's'', arguing that the article "is offensive, divisive and suggests that Canadian students of Asian heritage may be limiting opportunities for non-Asian students at certain universities".&lt;ref name="oliviachow1" /&gt;  [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] [[Vivienne Poy]], former [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] Emerita of the [[University of Toronto]], argued that the offensive content of the piece makes the magazine unsuitable as a beneficiary of the Canadian government's periodical fund{{snd}} which identifies it as "material that is denigrating to an identifiable group".  The periodical fund annually subsidizes the magazine's publication with $1.8 million of federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viviennepoy.ca/english/speeches/2010Speeches/Moore,J_161210(2).pdf |first=Vivienne |last=Poy |title=Letter to The Hon.

==Maclean's response and aftermath==
No apology has been offered by either ''Maclean's'' or Rogers Communications.  Negotiations between Maclean's and Rogers Communications, and the [[Chinese Canadian National Council]] and the Chinese Canadian National Council Toronto Chapter were held, but those failed to yield an apology, as the magazine refused to acknowledge that the article was offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccnc.ca/content/pr.php?entry=218 |title=CCNC Statement on Dialogue with Maclean’s |publisher=Chinese Canadian National Council |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The magazine instead initially revised the piece's content.&lt;ref name="racialicious1" /&gt;  It then issued a clarification about the piece's content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/665157/maclean-s-issues-clarification |title=Maclean's Issues Clarification |publisher=Newswire.ca |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; changed the article's title twice,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/article-361819/vancouver/macleans-changes-title-too-asian-article-enrollment-controversy Maclean's changes title Too Asian article enrollment controversy]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and issued an additional statement with the online version of the piece, stating that some of the content could be interpreted as offensive.  ''Maclean's'' stated that they do not advocate race as a criterion in university admissions, and commended Asians in Canada for succeeding in universities on the basis of merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/11/25/who-gets-into-university/ |title=Merit: the best and only way to decide who gets into university  |publisher=Maclean's Magazine |date=2010-11-25 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists [[Margaret Wente]] and [[Barbara Kay]] respectively sided with the magazine, stating that it initiated an important conversation that Canadians were afraid to have, and that the magazine, rather than those aggrieved, deserved an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Margaret |last=Wente |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/where-cherished-values-collide/article4348879/ |title=Where cherished values collide |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2012-04-04 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/11/23/barbara-kay-macleans-owed-an-apology-over-anti-asian-racism-claims/ |first=Barbara |last=Kay |title=Maclean’s owed an apology over anti-Asian racism claims |newspaper=National Post |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Professor Henry Yu of the [[University of British Columbia]] labelled ''Maclean's'' actions as a non-apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-361680/vancouver/henry-yu-macleans-offers-nonapology-writing-nonstory-called-too-asian |first=Henry |last=Yu |title=Macleans offers a nonapology for writing a nonstory called "Too Asian?" |publisher=Straight.com |date=2010-11-27 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Miller, a former Professor of [[Journalism]] at [[Ryerson University]], argued that the article was an example of poor journalism and ''Maclean's'' reply indicated that "the publication just doesn't seem to get it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Miller |url=http://www.thejournalismdoctor.ca/Blog.php/archived/20110101/shame-on-maclean-s |title=Blog: Shame on Maclean's |publisher=The Journalism Doctor |date=2011-01-27 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Journalist Jeet Heer articulated that, in dealing with the ordeal in the way that they did, both ''Maclean's'' and its supporters reflected Canada's inability to constructively talk about the reality of racism.  Heer further noted that those who argued in favor of the article evaded acknowledging that it was evocative of racist stereotypes.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walrusmagazine1" /&gt;

[[Kenneth Whyte]], then publisher of ''Maclean's'', has since been promoted as the Head of Rogers' Publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://j-source.ca/article/macleans-ken-whyte-promoted-head-rogers-publishing |first=Janice |last=Neil |title=Maclean's Ken Whyte promoted to head Rogers Publishing |publisher=Canadian Journalism Project |date=2011-06-17 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nicholas Kohler, one of the authors of the article, is no longer on staff with the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Stephanie Findlay, the second author and then an intern with the publication, moved on to an internship with the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  The decision to hire Findlay by the ''Star'' was criticized by some, prompting doubt{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} as to whether or not the ''Star'' was sincere in issuing an apology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2010/11/20/english_star_falls_below_its_standard.html |title=English: Star falls below its standard |first=Kathy |last=English |work=Toronto Star |date=2010-11-20 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a similar themed and timed article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chatterjee |first=Soma |url=http://rabble.ca/news/2010/11/macleans-and-toronto-star-asian-invasion-higher-education |title=Maclean's and The Toronto Star: The Asian invasion of higher education |publisher=Rabble.ca |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findlay is no longer with the ''Star''.

To commemorate the year of activism that resulted from the article's publication, an event organized by the Solidarity Committee Against Anti-Asian Racism was held at the University of Toronto on November 17, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.settlementatwork.org/_event_/93730 |title="Too Asian?"

'''National Tom Sawyer Days'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/mo/es_mo_sawyer_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  is a yearly event on 4 July, organized by the Hannibal JayCees in [[Hannibal, Missouri]] in the United States. In the town, National Tom Sawyer Days and the [[fourth of July]] are celebrated at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Tom Sawyer Days: A Local Legacy|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/es/mo/es_mo_sawyer_1.html|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannibal is the hometown of the famous author [[Mark Twain]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/mark-twain&lt;/ref&gt; the writer of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/the-adventures-of-tom-sawyer&lt;/ref&gt; Many local Tom fans or some other fans from all over the world are attracted by the big parade float, [[flea market]], carnival for children. Fans can enter a no speed-limited car competition and a Mud Volleyball Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;http://mudvb.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the competitions are inspired from the novels written by Mark Twain, for instance, the inspiration “Frog long jump” is from ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]'' which is Mark Twain’s first famous book. This activity and contest “Tom and Becky ” are one of the earliest activities which were celebrated in National Tom Sawyer Days. Besides, a couple of goodwill ambassadors from Junior school students in Grade 7 will be selected to introduce the local culture in Hannibal.

“Painting fence contest” is the same as “Tom and Becky”, which is based on ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''. Aunt Polly punishes Tom to paint the fence, but little Tom asked some friends to help him paint the fence. Children from place to place aged from ten to thirteen will dress up as Tom, because the costume is one of the 3 standards for evaluation. The other two dominating factors are the speed and the quality of painting the fence. Once the child wins the preliminary contest, he or she qualifies for the final competition.

'''''Out of Ireland''''' is a 1999 novel by [[Christopher Koch]] which tells the story of Irish 'gentleman-convict' Robert Devereux and his transportation to Van Diemen's Land ([[Tasmania]]). Koch observed that ''Out of Ireland'' was an exploration of his "interest in the idea that the past resonates off the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/a-life-full-of-achievements-20121012-27gc0.html | title=A life full of achievements | work=Sydney Morning Hearld | date=October 13, 2012 | accessdate=May 21, 2018 | author= Wyndham, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is considered uniquely Tasmanian because of the way it deals with convict ancestry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Chad |last=Habel |title=Christopher Koch, Out of Ireland: no more 'Hiding the Stain'|journal=Australian Literary Studies in the 21st Century |volume= |issue= |year=2000 |pages=128-134 [p. 129] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasies the island's geographic isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Genoi |title=Girt by Sea: islands in the novels of Thea Astley and Christopher Koch |journal=Australian Literary Studies in the 21st Century |volume= |issue= |year=2000 |pages=121-127 [p. 125] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ratha Yatra''' ([[Oriya Language|Oriya]]: ରଥଯାତ୍ରା or '''Ratha Jatra''' or '''Chariot Festival''') is a [[Hindu festival]] associated with the god [[Jagannath]] held at [[Mandir Thakur Shri Saty Narayan Ji]] in the  [[Nabha]] City, state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], India. This annual festival is celebrated in the month of August or September.
The festival commemorates Jagannath's annual visit to [[Nabha]] city.

As part of Ratha Yatra, the deities of Jagannath, [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]] are taken out in a procession to Devi Chowk. Then the deities or Ratha Yatra starts and the Parikrama of the Nabha city. The return journey of Puri Jagannath Ratha Jatra is known as Bahuda Jatra.
[[File:Prabhu Hari Kishore Joshi Holdin Lord Jagannath.jpg|thumb|Prabhu Hari Kishore Joshi Holdin Lord Jagannath]]

Three richly decorated [[Ratha|chariots]], resembling temple structures, are pulled through the streets of Puri called Badadanda. This commemorates the annual journey of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra, and their sister Subhadra to their aunt's temple, the [[Gundicha Temple]] which is situated at a distance of 2&amp;nbsp;km from their temple. This is the only day when devotees who are not allowed in the temple premises, such as non-Hindus and foreigners, can get their glimpse of the deities. During the festival, devotees from all over the world go to Puri with an earnest desire to help pull the Lords' chariots with the help of other priests pulling the chariots with ropes. They consider this a pious deed and risk their lives in the huge crowd. The huge processions accompanying the chariots play devotional songs with drums, tambourines, trumpets etc. Children line the streets through which the chariot will pass and add to the mass chorus. The [[Temple car|Rath]]a carts themselves are some approximately {{convert|45|ft|m}} high and are pulled by the thousands of pilgrims who turn up for the event; the chariots are built anew each year only from a particular type of tree. Millions of devotees congregate at Puri for this annual event from all over the country and abroad. It is also broadcast live on many Indian, foreign television channels as well as many of the websites telecast jagannath ratha yatra live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iskcontruth.com ISKCON TRUTH] Live broadcast Jagannatha Ratha Yatra festival throughout the day&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Chariot ==
[[File:Bhajan Mandli.jpg|thumb|Bhajan Mandli]]
The chariot of Balarama, Subhadra and Jagannatha is newly constructed every year with wood of specified trees like phassi, dhausa, etc. They are customarily brought from the ex-princely state of Dasapalla by a specialist team of carpenters who have hereditary rights and privileges for the same. The logs are traditionally set afloat as rafts in the river Mahanadi. These are collected near Puri and then transported by road.

The chariot is decorated as per the unique scheme prescribed and followed for centuries stand on the Santoshi Mata Mandir, Duladdi Gate the Grand Avenue. Covered with bright canopies made of stripes of red cloth and combined with those of black, yellow and blue colors, the huge chariot is lined across the wide avenue in front of the majestic temple close to its eastern entrance.

Lord Jagannatha's chariot is called Nandighosa. It is decked with a cover made of red and yellow cloth. Lord Jagannatha is identified with Krushna, who is also known as Pitambara, the one attired in golden yellow robes and hence the distinguishing yellow stripes on the canopy of this chariot.

The chariot of Lord Balarama, called the Taladhwaja, is the one with the Palm Tree on its flag.

The chariot of Subhadra, known as Dwarpadalana, literally "trampler of pride,” This chariot is decked with a covering of red and black cloth – black being traditionally associated with Shakti and the Mother Goddess.

Around the chariot are nine Parsva devatas, painted wooden images representing different deities on the chariots' sides. Chariots is attached to four horses. These are of different colours – dark ones for Balarama, white ones for Jagannatha, and red ones for Subhadra. Each chariot has a charioteer called Sarathi.

The '''SL-1''', or '''Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One''', was a [[United States Army]] experimental [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power reactor]] in the [[United States]] which underwent a [[steam explosion]] and [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] on January 3, 1961, killing its three operators. The direct cause was the improper withdrawal of the central [[control rod]], responsible for absorbing neutrons in the reactor core.

==Design and operations==
From 1954 to 1955, the U.S. Army evaluated their need for nuclear reactor plants that would be operable in remote regions of the [[Arctic]]. The reactors were to replace diesel generators and boilers that provided electricity and space heating for the Army's radar stations. The Army Reactors Branch formed the guidelines for the project and contracted with [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (ANL) to design, build, and test a prototype reactor plant to be called the Argonne Low Power Reactor (ALPR).&lt;ref name=SEC /&gt;

Some of the more important criteria included:
*All components able to be transported by air&lt;ref name=design /&gt;
*All components limited to packages measuring {{convert|7.5|x|9|x|20|ft|m}}and weighing {{convert|20000|lb|kg}}&lt;ref name=design /&gt;
*Use of standard components
*Minimal on-site construction&lt;ref name=design /&gt;
*Simplicity and reliability&lt;ref name=design /&gt;
*Adaptable to the Arctic "permafrost region"&lt;ref name=design /&gt;
*3-year fuel operating lifetime per core loading&lt;ref name=SEC&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/pdfs/sec/inl/inler-219-r2.pdf SEC-00219, Petition Evaluation Report, Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Revision 2], NIOSH/ORAU, Idaho National Laboratory, March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=design /&gt;

The prototype was constructed at the NRTS site from July 1957 to July 1958. It went critical on August 11, 1958,&lt;ref name=SEC /&gt; became operational on October 24, and was formally dedicated on December 2, 1958.&lt;ref name=SEC /&gt; The 3 MW (thermal) [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR) used 93.20% [[highly enriched uranium]] fuel.&lt;ref name=ido19311&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1029163/m2/1/high_res_d/4763434.pdf IDO-19311 Final Report of SL-1 Recovery Operation], Idaho Test Station, General Electric Corporation, July 27, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; It operated with [[natural circulation]], using light water as a coolant (vs. [[heavy water]]) and moderator. ANL used its experience from the [[BORAX experiments]] to design the BWR. The circulating water system operated at {{convert|300|psi}} flowing through fuel plates of uranium-aluminum alloy. The plant was turned over to the U.S. Army for training and operating experience in December 1958 after extensive testing, with [[Combustion Engineering]] Incorporated (CEI) acting as the lead contractor beginning February 5, 1959.&lt;ref name="annual-59-60" /&gt;

{{Cquote|CEI was responsible for the actual operation of the SL-1 reactor, for the routine training of military personnel and for developmental research programs.

The Contractor provided at the site a Project Manager, Operations Supervisor, a Test Supervisor and a technical staff of approximately six personnel. In recent months, the Project Manager spent approximately half time at the site and half time at the contractor's office in Connecticut. In his absence, either the Operations Supervisor or the Test Supervisor was assigned as the Project Manager.

[...]It was understood, as indicated by testimony before the Board, that CEI would provide supervision on any shifts when non-routine work was carried out.

[...]the AEC's Idaho Office and the Army Reactors Office clearly believed that addition of night supervisors when only routine work was involved would defeat a part of the purpose of operating the reactor under the existing arrangement, i.e., to obtain plant operating experience with only military personnel.

Trainees in the Army Reactor Training Program included members of the U.S. Army, called ''cadre'', who were the primarily plant operators, although many "Maritime" civilians (see [[NS Savannah|NS ''Savannah'']]) trained, along with a few U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy personnel.&lt;ref name="annual-59-60"&gt;[https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4143544 IDO-19012, CEND-82, SL-1 Annual Operating Report, Feb. 1959 - Feb 1960], Canfield, Vallario, Crudele, Young, Rausch, Combustion Engineering Nuclear Division, May 1, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; While plant operation was generally done by the ''cadre'' in two-man crews, any development of the reactor was to be supervised directly by CEI staff. CEI decided to perform development work on the reactor as recent as the later half of 1960 in which the reactor was to be operated at 4.7 MW&lt;sub&gt;thermal&lt;/sub&gt; for a "PL-1 condenser test."&lt;ref name=Joint61&gt;Joint Committee on Atomic Energy Congress (1961), SL-1 Accident Atomic Energy Commission Investigation Board Report, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy Congress of the United States, Washington, DC, available at: [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002221&amp;mediaType=application/pdf] (accessed September 29, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; As the reactor core aged and boron "poison" strips corroded and flaked off, CEI calculated that about 18% of the boron in the core had been "lost." This resulted in the addition of "[[cadmium]] sheets" (also a "poison") being added on November 11, 1960, two months before the accident. Corrective actions to the flaking off and/or corrosion loss of boron poison strips included a recent change to the reactor core in which new cadmium sheets were installed "to several tee slot positions to increase reactor shutdown margin."&lt;ref name=ido19024&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1058207/  IDO-19024 SL-1 Annual Operating Report, February 1960 - January 3, 1961] Combustion Engineering Nuclear Division, CEND-1009, W. B. Allred, June 15, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; This modification was done on November 15, 1960, some weeks before the accident.

[[File:ALPR.jpg|thumb|The ALPR before the accident. The large cylindrical building holds the nuclear reactor embedded in gravel at the bottom, the main operating area or operating floor in the middle, and the condenser fan room near the top. Miscellaneous support and administration buildings surround it.]]
The majority of the plant equipment was located in a cylindrical steel reactor building {{convert|38.5|ft}} in diameter and an overall height of {{convert|48|ft}}.&lt;ref name=design /&gt; The reactor building known as ARA-602 was made of plate steel, most of which had a thickness of 1/4 inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm). Access to the building was provided by an ordinary door through an enclosed exterior stairwell from ARA-603, the Support Facilities Building. An emergency exit door was also included, with an exterior stairwell going to the ground level.&lt;ref name=design /&gt; The reactor building was not a pressure-type containment shell as would have been used for reactors located in populated areas. Nevertheless, the building was able to contain most of the radioactive particles released by the eventual explosion.

The reactor core structure was built for a capacity of 59 fuel assemblies, one source assembly, and 9 control rods. The core in use, however, had 40 fuel elements and was controlled by 5 cruciform rods.&lt;ref name=design&gt;[https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4014868 Design of the Argonne Low Power Reactor (ALPR), ANL-6076 Reactor Technology], Grant, Hamer, Hooker, Jorgensen, Kann, Lipinski, Milak, Rossin, Shaftman, Smaardyk, Treshow, May 1961, University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; The 5 active rods were in the shape of a plus symbol (+) in cross section: 1 in the center (Rod Number 9), and 4 on the periphery of the active core (Rods 1, 3, 5, and 7).&lt;ref name=design /&gt; The control rods were made of {{Convert|60|mil}} thick [[cadmium]], clad with {{convert|80|mil}} of aluminum. They had an overall span of {{convert|14|in|cm}} and an effective length of {{convert|32|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name=design /&gt; The 40 fuel assemblies were composed of 9 fuel plates each.&lt;ref name=design /&gt; The plates were {{convert|120|mil}} thick consisting of {{convert|50|mil}} of uranium-aluminum alloy "meat" covered by {{convert|35|mil}} of X-8001 aluminum cladding.&lt;ref name=design /&gt; The meat was {{convert|25.8|in|cm}} long and {{convert|3.5|in|cm}} wide. The water gap between fuel plates was {{convert|310|mil}}.&lt;ref name=design /&gt; Water channels within the control rod shrouds was {{convert|0.5|in}}. The initial loading of the 40 assembly core was highly enriched with 93.2% uranium-235 and contained {{convert|31|lb}} of U-235.&lt;ref name=design /&gt;

The deliberate choice of a smaller fuel loading made the region near the center more active than it would have been with 59 fuel assemblies. The four outer control rods weren't even used in the smaller core after tests concluded they weren't necessary.&lt;ref name=design /&gt;&lt;ref name=Press&gt;[https://archive.org/details/SL1PressRelease1961 Report on the SL-1 Incident, January 3, 1961], The General Manager's Board of Investigation, For Release in Newspapers dated Sunday, Curtis A. Nelson, Clifford Beck, Peter Morris, Donald Walker, Forrest Western, June 11, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; In the operating SL-1 core, Rods Number 2, 4, 6, and 8 were dummy rods, had [[cadmium]] shims after November 11, 1960, or were filled with test sensors, and were shaped like the capital letter T.&lt;ref name=Joint61 /&gt; The effort to minimize the size of the core gave the central rod an abnormally large reactivity worth.

==Accident and response==
On December 21, 1960, the reactor was shut down for maintenance, calibration of the instruments, installation of auxiliary instruments, and installation of 44 flux wires to monitor the [[neutron flux]] levels in the reactor core. The wires were made of [[aluminum]], and contained slugs of [[aluminum]]–[[cobalt]] [[alloy]].

On January 3, 1961, the reactor was being prepared for restart after a shutdown of eleven days over the holidays. Maintenance procedures required that the main central control rod be manually withdrawn a few inches to reconnect it to its drive mechanism. At 9:01&amp;nbsp;p.m., this rod was suddenly withdrawn too far, causing SL-1 to go [[prompt criticality|prompt critical]] instantly. In four milliseconds, the heat generated by the resulting enormous [[power excursion]] caused fuel inside the core to melt and to explosively vaporize. The expanding fuel produced an extreme pressure wave which blasted water upward, striking the top of the reactor vessel with {{convert|460000|ftlb|J}}. The slug of water was propelled at about {{convert|159|ft/s}} with average pressure of around {{convert|500|psi}}.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; This extreme form of [[water hammer]] propelled the entire reactor vessel upward at about {{convert|27|ft/s}}, while the shield plugs were ejected at about {{convert|85|ft/s}}.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; With 6 holes on the top of the reactor vessel, high pressure water and steam sprayed the entire room with radioactive debris from the damaged core. A later investigation concluded that the {{convert|26,000|lb|kg|adj=on}} vessel had jumped {{convert|9|ft|1|in|m}}, parts of which struck the ceiling of the reactor building before settling back into its original location,&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;&lt;ref name=ProvePrinciple15&gt;{{cite book

===Reactor principles and events===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
Several "kinetic" factors affect the rate at which the power (heat) produced in a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] responds to changes in the position of a control rod. Other features of the design govern how rapidly heat is transferred from the reactor fuel to the coolant.

The [[nuclear chain reaction]] has a [[positive feedback]] component whenever a critical mass is created; specifically, excess neutrons are produced for every fission. Inside a nuclear reactor, these excess neutrons must be controlled as long as a critical mass exists. The most significant and effective control mechanism is the use of control rods to absorb the excess neutrons. Other controls include the size and shape of the reactor and the presence of [[neutron reflector]]s in and around a core. Changing the amount of absorption or reflection of neutrons will affect neutron flux, and therefore, the power of the reactor.

One kinetic factor is the tendency of most [[light-water reactor|light-water-moderated reactor]] (LWR) designs to have negative [[neutron moderator|moderator]] temperature and [[void coefficient of reactivity|void coefficients of reactivity]]. (Due to the low density of steam, pockets of water vapor are known as "voids" in a LWR.) A negative reactivity coefficient means that as the water moderator heats up, molecules move farther apart (water expands and eventually boils) and neutrons are less likely to be slowed by collisions to energies favorable for inducing fission in the fuel. Because of these [[negative feedback]] mechanisms, most LWRs will naturally tend to decrease their rate of fissioning in response to additional heat produced within the reactor core. If enough heat is produced that water boils inside the core, fissions in that vicinity will drastically decrease.

However, when power output from the nuclear reaction increases rapidly, it may take longer for the water to heat up and boil than it does for the voids to cause the nuclear reactions to decrease. In such an event, reactor power can grow rapidly without any negative feedback from the expansion or boiling of the water, even if it is in a channel just {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} away. Dramatic heating will occur to the nuclear fuel, leading to melting and vaporization of the metals within the core. Rapid expansion, increases in pressure, and failure of core components may lead to the destruction of the nuclear reactor, as was the case with SL-1. As the energy of expansion and heat travel from the nuclear fuel to the water and the vessel, it becomes likely that the nuclear reaction will shut down, either from the lack of sufficient moderator or from the fuel expanding beyond the realm of a [[critical mass]]. In the post-accident analysis of SL-1, scientists determined that the two shutdown mechanisms were almost equally matched (see below).

Another relevant kinetics factor is the contribution of what are called [[delayed neutron]]s to the chain reaction in the core. Most neutrons (the ''prompt'' neutrons) are produced nearly instantaneously via fission. But a few — approximately 0.7 percent in a [[Uranium-235|U-235]]-fueled reactor operating at steady-state — are produced through the relatively slow radioactive decay of certain fission products. (These fission products are trapped inside the fuel plates in close proximity to the uranium-235 fuel.) Delayed production of a fraction of the neutrons is what enables reactor power changes to be controllable on a time scale that is amenable to humans and machinery.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Nuclear Engineering"&gt;{{cite book

In the case of an ejected control assembly or poison, it is possible for the reactor to become [[critical mass|critical]] ''on the prompt neutrons alone'' (i.e. [[prompt criticality|prompt critical]]). When the reactor is prompt critical, the time to double the power is on the order of 10 microseconds. The duration necessary for temperature to follow the power level depends on the design of the reactor core. Typically, the coolant temperature lags behind the power by 3 to 5 seconds in a conventional LWR. In the SL-1 design, it was about 6 milliseconds before steam formation started.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt;

SL-1 was constructed with a main central control rod that was capable of producing a very large excess reactivity if it were completely removed. The extra rod worth was in part due to the decision to load only 40 of the 59 fuel assemblies with nuclear fuel, thus making the prototype reactor core more active in the center. In normal operation control rods are withdrawn only enough to cause sufficient reactivity for a sustained nuclear reaction and power generation. In this accident, however, the reactivity addition was sufficient to take the reactor prompt critical within a time estimated at 4 milliseconds.&lt;ref name=ido19313 /&gt; That was too fast for the heat from the fuel to get through the aluminum cladding and boil enough water to fully stop the power growth in all parts of the core via negative moderator temperature and void feedback.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ido19313 /&gt;

Post-accident analysis concluded that the final control method (i.e., dissipation of the prompt critical state and the end of the sustained nuclear reaction) occurred by means of catastrophic core disassembly: destructive melting, vaporization, and consequent conventional explosive expansion of the parts of the reactor core where the greatest amount of heat was being produced most quickly. It was estimated that this core heating and vaporization process happened in about 7.5 milliseconds, before enough steam had been formed to shut down the reaction, beating the steam shutdown by a few milliseconds. A key statistic makes it clear why the core blew apart: the reactor designed for a 3 MW power output operated momentarily at a peak of about 20 GW, a power density over 6,000 times higher than its safe operating limit.&lt;ref name=la13638 /&gt; This [[criticality accident]] is estimated to have produced 4.4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; fissions,&lt;ref name=la13638 /&gt; or about {{convert|133|MJ|kgTNT}}.&lt;ref name=ido19313 /&gt;

===Events after the power excursion===
[[File:Sl-1-ineel61-9.jpg|left|thumb|Checking for [[radioactive contamination]] on nearby [[U.S. Route 20#Idaho|Highway 20]]]] There were no other people at the reactor site. The ending of the nuclear reaction was caused solely by the design of the reactor and the basic physics of heated water and core elements melting, separating the core elements and removing the moderator.

Heat sensors above the reactor set off an alarm at the central test site security facility at 9:01&amp;nbsp;p.m. MST, the time of the accident. False alarms had occurred in the morning and afternoon that same day. The first response crew of six firemen (Ken Dearden Asst Chief, Mel Hess Lt., Bob Archer, Carl Johnson, Egon Lamprecht, Gerald Stuart, &amp; Vern Conlon) arrived nine minutes later, expecting another false alarm.&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;{{cite news |last=Berg|first=Sven|title=Nuclear accident still mystery to rescue worker |url=http://www.argusobserver.com/news/nuclear-accident-still-mystery-to-rescue-worker/article_272b80ac-57d0-5dfc-9fe7-440e6e27b6e3.html|accessdate=April 6, 2015|newspaper=The Argus Observer|date=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They initially noticed nothing unusual, with only a little steam rising from the building, normal for the cold {{convert|6|F}} night. The control building appeared normal. The firefighters entered the reactor building and noticed a radiation warning light. Their radiation detectors jumped sharply to above their maximum range limit as they were climbing the stairs to SL-1's floor level. They peered into the reactor room before withdrawing.&lt;ref name="berg" /&gt;

At 9:17&amp;nbsp;p.m., a [[health physics|health physicist]] arrived. He and a fireman, both wearing air tanks and masks with positive pressure in the mask to force out any potential contaminants, approached the reactor building stairs. Their detectors read 25 [[Roentgen (unit)|röntgen]]s per hour (R/hr) as they started up the stairs, and they withdrew.

Some minutes later, a health physics response team arrived with radiation meters capable of measuring [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] up to 500 R/hr and full-body protective clothing. One health physicist and two firefighters ascended the stairs and, from the top, saw damage in the reactor room. With the meter showing maximum scale readings, they withdrew rather than approach the reactor more closely and risk further exposure.

[[File:Sl-1-ineel61-667.jpg|thumb|The stretcher rig. Army volunteers from a special Chemical Radiological Unit at [[Dugway Proving Ground]] practiced before a crane inserted the rig into the SL-1 reactor building to collect the body of the man (Legg) impaled to the ceiling directly above the reactor vessel.]]Around 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. MST, the supervisor for the contractor running the site ([[Combustion Engineering]]) and the chief health physicist arrived. They entered the reactor building around 10:45 pm and found two mutilated men soaked with water: one clearly dead (Byrnes), the other moving slightly (McKinley) and moaning. With one entry per person and a 1-minute limit, a team of 5 men with stretchers recovered the operator who was still breathing around 10:50; he did not regain consciousness and died of his head injury at about 11 p.m. Even stripped, his body was so contaminated that it was emitting about 500 R/hr. Meanwhile, the third man was discovered about 11:38 p.m., impaled to the ceiling. With all potential survivors now recovered, safety of rescuers took precedence and work was slowed to protect them.

The third man was discovered last because he was pinned to the ceiling above the reactor by a shield plug and not easily recognizable.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; On the night of January 4, a team of six volunteers used a plan involving teams of two to recover the body of Byrnes. On January 9, in relays of two at a time, a team of ten men, allowed no more than 65 seconds exposure each, used sharp hooks on the end of long poles to pull Legg's body free of the shield plug, dropping it onto a {{convert|5|by|20|ft|adj=on}} stretcher attached to a crane outside the building.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

Radioactive gold [[isotopes of gold|&lt;sup&gt;198&lt;/sup&gt;Au]] from the man's gold watch buckle and copper [[copper-64|&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu]] from a screw in a cigarette lighter subsequently proved that the reactor had indeed gone prompt critical. Prior to the discovery of [[neutron activation|neutron-activated elements]] in the men's belongings, scientists had doubted that a nuclear excursion had occurred, believing the reactor was inherently safe. These findings ruled out early speculations that a chemical explosion caused the accident.&lt;ref name=ProvePrinciple15/&gt;

The bodies of all three were buried in lead-lined caskets sealed with concrete and placed in metal vaults with a concrete cover. Some highly radioactive body parts were buried in the Idaho desert as radioactive waste. Army Specialist Richard Leroy McKinley is buried in section 31 of [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Some sources and eyewitness accounts confuse the names and positions of each victim.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; In ''Idaho Falls: The untold story of America's first nuclear accident'',&lt;ref name=McKeown&gt;{{cite book |last=McKeown |first=William |title=Idaho Falls: The Untold Story of America's First Nuclear Accident |isbn=978-1-55022-562-4 |year=2003 |publisher=ECW Press |location=Toronto}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ATkLIZ06YJQC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; the author indicates that initial rescue teams identified Byrnes as the man found initially alive, believing that Legg's body was the one found next to the reactor shield and recovered the night after the accident, and that McKinley was impaled by the control rod to the ceiling directly above the reactor. This misidentification, caused by the severe blast injuries to the victims, was later rectified during the autopsies, but this would cause confusion for some time.&lt;ref name=McKeown /&gt;

==Cause==
One of the required maintenance procedures called for the central control rod to be manually withdrawn approximately 4 inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) in order to attach it to the automated control mechanism from which it had been disconnected. Post-accident calculations estimate that the main control rod was actually withdrawn approximately {{convert|26|in|cm}}, causing the reactor to go [[prompt criticality|prompt critical]], which resulted in the steam explosion. The fuel, portions of the fuel plates, and water surrounding the fuel plates vaporized in the extreme heat. The expansion caused by this heating process caused [[water hammer]] as water was accelerated upwards toward the reactor vessel head, producing peak pressures of {{convert|10000|psi}} on the head of the reactor vessel when air and then water struck the head at {{convert|160|ft/s|-1}}.&lt;ref name=ido19313&gt;''[http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf IDO-19313: Additional Analysis of the SL-1 Excursion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065809/http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }} Final Report of Progress July through October 1962'', November 21, 1962, Flight Propulsion Laboratory Department, General Electric Company, Idaho Falls, Idaho, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information.&lt;/ref&gt;

The water hammer not only caused extreme physical damage and distortion of the reactor vessel, it also caused the shield plugs of the vessel to be ejected, one of which impaled Legg. The most surprising and unforeseen evidences of the steam explosion and water hammer were the impressions made on the ceiling above the reactor vessel when it jumped {{convert|9|ft|1|in|m}} in the air before settling back into its prior location. The post-accident analysis also concluded that the reactor vessel was dry, since most of the water and steam had been either ejected immediately or evaporated due to the heat inside the reactor. A [[borescope]] was used to confirm this prior to the removal of the reactor.

It was water hammer that caused the physical damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, and the release of radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme water hammer hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the accident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful water hammer. Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very effective radiation shield for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to pump down the level of water in the reactor prior to the maintenance procedure that destroyed it.

The most common theories proposed for the withdrawal of the rod are (1) sabotage or suicide by one of the operators, (2) a suicide-murder involving an affair with the wife of one of the other operators, (3) inadvertent withdrawal of the main control rod, or (4) an intentional attempt to "exercise" the rod (to make it travel more smoothly within its sheath).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.tinhouse.com/magazine/current-issue.html#justin-nobel ATOMIC CITY, by Justin Nobel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522203550/http://www.tinhouse.com/magazine/current-issue.html#justin-nobel#justin-nobel |date=2012-05-22 }}'' Tin House Magazine, Issue #51, Spring, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/01/magazine/the-one-page-magazine.html A Nuclear Family, By Maud Newton]'' The New York Times Magazine, April 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The maintenance logs do not address what the technicians were attempting to do, and thus the actual cause of the accident will never be known. The investigation took almost two years to complete.

Investigators analyzed the flux wires installed during the maintenance to determine the power output level. They also examined scratches on the central control rod. Using this data, they concluded that the central rod had been withdrawn {{convert|26.25|in|cm|1}}.&lt;ref name=ProvePrinciple15/&gt; The reactor would have been critical at {{convert|23|in|cm|1}}, and it took approximately 100 ms for the rod to travel the final {{convert|3.25|in|cm|1}}. Once this was calculated, experiments were conducted with an identically weighted mock control rod to determine whether it was possible or feasible for one or two men to have performed this. Experiments included a simulation of the possibility that the {{convert|84|lb|kg|adj=on}} rod was stuck and one man freed it himself, reproducing the scenario that investigators considered the best explanation: Byrnes broke the control rod loose and withdrew it accidentally, killing all three men.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt;

At SL-1, control rods would get stuck in the control rod channel sporadically. Numerous procedures were conducted to evaluate control rods to ensure they were operating properly. There were rod drop tests and scram tests of each rod, in addition to periodic rod exercising and rod withdrawals for normal operation. From February 1959 to November 18, 1960, there were 40 cases of a stuck control rod for scram and rod drop tests and about a 2.5% failure rate. From November 18, 1960 to December 23, 1960, there was a dramatic increase in stuck rods, with 23 in that time period and a 13.0% failure rate. Besides these test failures, there were an additional 21 rod sticking incidents from February 1959 to December 1960; 4 of these had occurred in the last month of operation during routine rod withdrawal. The central control rod, No. 9, had the best operational performance record even though it was operated more frequently than any of the other rods.

Rod sticking has been attributed to misalignment, corrosion product build-up, bearing wear, clutch wear, and drive mechanism seal wear. Many of the failure modes that caused a stuck rod during tests (like bearing and clutch wear) would only apply to a movement performed by the control rod drive mechanism. Since the No. 9 rod is centrally located, its alignment may have been better than Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7 which were more prone to sticking. After the accident, logbooks and former plant operators were consulted to determine if there had been any rods stuck during the reassembly operation that Byrnes was performing. One person had performed this about 300 times, and another 250 times; neither had ever felt a control rod stick when being manually raised during this procedure. Furthermore, no one had ever reported a stuck rod during manual reconnection.

{{Quote|The mechanical and material evidence, combined with the nuclear and chemical evidence, forced them to believe that the central control rod had been withdrawn very rapidly. […] The scientists questioned the [former operators of SL-1]: “Did you know that the reactor would go critical if the central control rod were removed?” Answer: “Of course! We often talked about what we would do if we were at a radar station and the Russians came. We’d yank it out.”|Susan M. Stacy|Proving the Principle|&lt;ref name=ProvePrinciple15/&gt;}}

==Consequences==

The accident caused this design to be abandoned and future reactors to be designed so that a single control rod removal would not have the ability to produce the very large excess reactivity which was possible with this design. Today this is known as the "one stuck rod" criterion and requires complete shutdown capability even with the most reactive rod stuck in the fully withdrawn position. The reduced excess reactivity limits the possible size and speed of the power surge. The "one stuck rod" criterion did not originate as a result of the SL-1 accident. It was, in fact, a hard and fast design criterion long before the SL-1, from the beginning of the [[Naval Reactors]] program, under the leadership of Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover|Hyman Rickover]]. This design criterion started with the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS Nautilus]], and continued throughout subsequent submarine and surface ship designs, and with the Shippingport civilian nuclear plant. It continues to be a requirement for all US reactor designs to this day.

Although portions of the center of the reactor core had been vaporized briefly, very little [[corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]] was recovered. The fuel plates showed signs of catastrophic destruction leaving voids, but "no appreciable amount of glazed molten material was recovered or observed." Additionally, "There is no evidence of molten material having flowed out between the plates." It is believed that rapid cooling of the core was responsible for the small amount of molten material. There was insufficient heat generated for any corium to reach or penetrate the bottom of the reactor vessel. The reactor vessel was removed on November 29, 1961 without accident. The only holes in the bottom of the vessel were the ones bored through with [[borescope]]s to determine the condition of the melted core.

Even without an engineered [[containment building]] like those used today, the SL-1 reactor building contained most of the radioactivity, though [[iodine-131]] levels on plants during several days of monitoring reached fifty times background levels downwind. Radiation surveys of the Support Facilities Building, for example, indicated high contamination in halls, but light contamination in offices.

Radiation exposure limits prior to the accident were 100 [[Roentgen (unit)|röntgen]]s to save a life and 25 to save valuable property. During the response to the accident, 22 people received doses of 3 to 27 Röntgens full-body exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Wm. Robert|title=SL-1 reactor excursion, 1961 |url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1961USA1.html |work=Johnston's Archive |accessdate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of radioactive waste and disposal of the three bodies eventually exposed 790 people to harmful levels of radiation.&lt;ref name="maslin"/&gt; In March 1962, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] awarded certificates of heroism to 32 participants in the response.

The documentation and procedures required for operating nuclear reactors expanded substantially, becoming far more formal as procedures which had previously taken two pages expanded to hundreds. Radiation meters were changed to allow higher ranges for emergency response activities.

After a pause for evaluation of procedures, the Army continued its use of reactors, operating the Mobile Low-Power Reactor ([[ML-1]]), which started full power operation on February 28, 1963, becoming the smallest nuclear power plant on record to do so. This design was eventually abandoned after [[corrosion]] problems. While the tests had shown that nuclear power was likely to have lower total costs, the financial pressures of the [[Vietnam War]] caused the Army to favor lower initial costs and it stopped the development of its reactor program in 1965, although the existing reactors continued operating ([[MH-1A]] until 1977).

==Cleanup==
[[General Electric]] Corporation was tasked with the removal of the reactor vessel and the dismantling and cleanup of the contaminated buildings at the SL-1 project site.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; The site was cleaned in 1961 to 1962, removing the bulk of the contaminated debris and burying it.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; The massive cleanup operation included the transport of the reactor vessel to a nearby "hot shop" for extensive analysis.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; Other items of less importance were either disposed of or transported to decontamination sites for various kinds of cleaning. About 475 people took part in the SL-1 site cleanup, including volunteers from the U.S. Army and the Atomic Energy Commission.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt;

The recovery operation included clearing the operating room floor of radioactive debris. The extremely high radiation areas surrounding the reactor vessel and the fan room directly above it contributed to the difficulty of recovering the reactor vessel. Remotely operated equipment, cranes, boom trucks, and safety precautions had to be developed and tested by the recovery team. Radiation surveys and photographic analysis was used to determine what items needed to be removed from the building first.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; Powerful vacuum cleaners, operated manually by teams of men, collected vast quantities of debris.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; The manual overhead crane above the operating floor was used to move numerous heavy objects weighing up to {{convert|19600|lbs}} for them to be dumped out onto the ground outside.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; Hot spots up to 400 R/hr were discovered and removed from the work area.

With the operating room floor relatively clean and radiation fields manageable, the manual overhead crane was employed to do a trial lift of the reactor vessel.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; The crane was fitted with a dial-type load indicator and the vessel was lifted a few inches. The successful test found that the estimated {{convert|23000|lb}} vessel plus an unknown amount of debris weighed about {{convert|26000|lbs}}. After removing a large amount of the building structure above the reactor vessel, a 60-ton Manitowoc Model 3900 crane lifted the vessel out of the building into an awaiting transport cask attached to a tractor-trailer combination with a low-boy 60-ton capacity trailer.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; After raising or removing 45 power lines, phone lines, and guy wires from the proposed roadway, the tractor trailer, accompanied by numerous observers and supervisors, proceeded at about {{convert|10|mph|abbr=on}} to the ANP Hot Shop, about {{convert|35|miles}} away.&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; The Hot Shop, originally associated with the [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion]] (ANP) program,&lt;ref name=ido19311 /&gt; was in a remote area of the NRTS known later as [[Test Area North]].

A burial ground was constructed approximately {{convert|1600|ft|-2}} northeast of the original site of the reactor. It was opened on May 21, 1961.&lt;ref name=SEC /&gt; Burial of the waste helped minimize radiation exposure to the public and site workers that would have resulted from transport of contaminated debris from SL-1 to the Radioactive-Waste Management Complex over {{convert|16|mi}} of public highway. Original cleanup of the site took about 18 months. The entire reactor building, contaminated materials from nearby buildings, and soil and gravel contaminated during cleanup operations were disposed of in the burial ground. The majority of buried materials consist of soils and gravel.&lt;ref name=95rod&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/rods/fulltext/r1096147.pdf|title=Superfund - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,OSRTI|website=US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ar.inel.gov/images/pdf/199602/1996020812012503W-T.pdf Record of Decision], Stationary Low-Power Reactor-1 and Boiling Water Reactor Experiment-I Burial Grounds (Operable Units 5-05 and 6-01), and 10 No Action Sites (Operable Units 5-01, 5-03, 5-04, and 5-11), January 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovered portions of the reactor core, including the fuel and all other parts of the reactor that were important to the accident investigation, were taken to the ANP Hot Shop for study. After the accident investigation was complete, the reactor fuel was sent to the [[Idaho Chemical Processing Plant]] for reprocessing. The reactor core minus the fuel, along with the other components sent to the Hot Shop for study, was eventually disposed of at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex.&lt;ref name=95rod /&gt;

The remains of the SL-1 reactor are now buried near the original site at {{Coord|43|31|02.9|N|112|49|22.2|W|display=inline}}.&lt;ref name=AccidentsAndDisasters&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mahaffey|first1=James|title=Nuclear Accidents and Disasters|date=2012|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0-8160-7650-5|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SL-1 burial ground consists of three excavations, in which a total volume of 99,000 cubic feet (2800 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of contaminated material was deposited. The excavations were dug as close to basalt as the equipment used would allow and ranges from 8 to 14 feet (2.4 to 4.3 m) in depth. At least 2 feet (0.6 m) of clean backfill was placed over each excavation. Shallow mounds of soil over the excavations were added at the completion of cleanup activities in September 1962. The site and burial mound are collectively known as [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Superfund]] Operable Unit 5-05.&lt;ref name=95rod/&gt;&lt;ref name=epa2003&gt;[http://ar.inel.gov/images/pdf/200311/2003110400237GSJ.pdf 2003 Annual Inspection Summary for the Stationary Low-Power Reactor Burial Ground, Operable Unit 5-05]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous radiation surveys and cleanup of the surface of the burial ground and surrounding area have been performed in the years since the SL-1 accident. Aerial surveys were performed by EG&amp;G Las Vegas in 1974, 1982, 1990, and 1993. The Radiological and Environmental Sciences Laboratory conducted gamma radiation surveys every 3 to 4 years between 1973 and 1987 and every year between 1987 and 1994. Particle-picking at the site was performed in 1985 and 1993. Results from the surveys indicated that [[cesium-137]] and its progeny (decay products) are the primary surface-soil contaminants. During a survey of surface soil in June 1994, "hot spots," areas of higher radioactivity, were found within the burial ground with activities ranging from 0.1 to 50 milliroentgen (mR)/hour. On November 17, 1994, the highest radiation reading measured at 2.5 feet (0.75 m) above the surface at the SL-1 burial ground was 0.5 mR/hour; local background radiation was 0.2 mR/hour. A 1995 assessment by the EPA recommended that a cap be placed over the burial mounds. The primary remedy for SL-1 was to be containment by capping with an engineered barrier constructed primarily of native materials.&lt;ref name=95rod/&gt; This remedial action was completed in 2000 and first reviewed by the EPA in 2003.&lt;ref name=epa2003 /&gt;

In 1975, the anti-nuclear book ''[[We Almost Lost Detroit]]'', by [[John G. Fuller]] was published, referring at one point to the Idaho Falls accident. ''Prompt Critical'' is the title of a 2012 short film, viewable on YouTube.com, written and directed by James Lawrence Sicard, dramatizing the events surrounding the SL-1 accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|tPfXBqXJ_o4|Prompt Critical}} by James Lawrence Sicard.&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary about the accident was shown on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|OurgpWnRufE|SL-1 Nuclear Accident}} [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tucker used the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] to obtain reports, including autopsies of the victims, writing in detail how each person died and how parts of their bodies were severed, analyzed, and buried as [[radioactive waste]].&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Todd |title=Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History|isbn=978-1-4165-4433-3 |year=2009 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York}} See summary: [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0904/2008013842-s.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsies were performed by the same pathologist known for his work following the [[Cecil Kelley criticality accident]]. Tucker explains the reasoning behind the autopsies and the severing of victims' body parts, one of which gave off 1,500 R/hour on contact. Because the SL-1 accident killed all three of the military operators on site, Tucker calls it "the deadliest nuclear reactor incident in U.S. history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/17/AR2009041701368.html|title=Book Reviews: 'The Day We Lost the H-Bomb' - 'Atomic America'; by Barbara Moran - by Todd Tucker|first=Review by Seth|last=Shulman|date=19 April 2009|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Samaritan revolts''' were a series of insurrections during the 5th and 6th centuries in  [[Palaestina Prima]] province, launched by the [[Samaritans]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The revolts were marked by great violence on both sides, and their brutal suppression at the hands of the Byzantines and their [[Ghassanids|Ghassanid]] allies severely reduced the Samaritan population. The events irreversibly shifted the demographics of the region, making the Christians the only dominant group in the Palaestina Prima province for many decades onward. 

Some historians{{who|date=March 2015}} draft comparisons between the consequences of the Samaritan revolts of the 5th and 6th centuries upon Samaritans to the consequences of [[Jewish–Roman Wars]] of the 1st and 2nd centuries upon the Jews in the region.

== Conflict background ==
[[File:Volusian Neapolis.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A coin with the inscription of Roman stairs of Neapolis to Mt. Gerizim]]
{{main|Baba Rabba|Samaria}}
{{see also|Jewish revolt against Constantius Gallus}}
Following the period of [[Jewish–Roman wars]], the previously dominating Jewish community went almost extinct across Judaea and the shore of [[Southern Levant]], remaining a majority only in Southern Judea, [[Galilee]] and Bashan ([[Golan]]). Samaritans and Byzantine Christians filled this vacuum in the central regions of Southern Levant, whereas [[Nabataeans]] and Christian [[Ghassanids|Ghassanid]] Arabs settled the periphery.

This period is considered a golden age for the [[Samaritan]] community. The Temple of Gerizim was rebuilt after the [[Bar Kochba revolt]] in Judaea, around 135 CE. With the withdrawal of Roman legions, Samaria enjoyed a limited kind of independence during the 3rd and 4th centuries. [[Baba Rabba]] (ca. 288-362), the leader of the Samaritans, divided Samaritan territories into districts, and established local rulers out of aristocratic Samaritan families. He also executed a series of reforms and installed state institutions. Much of Samaritan liturgy was set by Baba Rabba during this time. This period of semi-independence was brief, however, as Byzantine forces overran Samaria and took Baba Rabba captive to [[Constantinople]], where he died in prison several years later around 362 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstamm, Ayala. "Baba Rabbah." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica.'' Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. ''Gale Biography In Context.'' Web. 22 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Justa uprising ==
During the reign of Emperor Zeno, tensions between the Christian community and the [[Samaritans]] in Neapolis ([[Shechem]]) grew dramatically. According to Samaritan sources, [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (who ruled 474–491 and whom the sources call "Zait the King of Edom") persecuted the Samaritans with no mercy. The Emperor went to Neapolis, gathered the elders and asked them to convert; when they refused, Zeno had many Samaritans killed, and rebuilt the [[synagogue]] into a church. Zeno then took for himself [[Mount Gerizim]], where the Samaritans worshipped God, and built several edifices, among them a tomb for his recently deceased son, on which he put a cross, so that the Samaritans, worshipping God, would prostrate in front of the tomb.

Later, in 484, the Samaritans revolted, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of [[Aaron]]'s sons and grandsons [[Eleazar]], [[Ithamar]] and [[Phinehas]]. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus.

The Samaritans elected [[Justa (rebel)|Justa]] (or Justasas) as their king and moved to [[Caesarea]], where a noteworthy Samaritan community lived. There many Christians were killed and the church of St. Procopius was destroyed.&lt;ref name=Kohen27&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohen|first=Elli|title=History of the Byzantine Jews: A Microcosmos in the Thousand Year Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-9qJRP20MIC&amp;pg=PA26|year=2007|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-3623-0|pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justa celebrated the victory with games in the circus.&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt;

According to [[John Malalas]], Asclepiades, the ''dux Palaestinae'' (commander of the province's [[Limes Arabicus]] troops), whose units were reinforced by the Caesarea-based ''Arcadiani'' of ''lestodioktes'' (police chief) Rheges, defeated Justa, killed him and sent his head to Zeno.&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alan David Crown 1989, pp. 72–73"/&gt; Terebinthus meanwhile fled to [[Constantinople]], requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. According to [[Procopius]], Terebinthus went to Zeno to ask for revenge;&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt; the Emperor personally went to Samaria to quell the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Buildings'', 5.7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2011}}

As a result of the revolt, Zeno erected a church dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.&lt;ref name="STF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/035discuss.html |title=Neapolis – (Nablus) |accessdate=2008-04-19 |date=19 December 2000 |publisher=Studium Biblicum Franciscanum – Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern historians believe that the order of the facts preserved by Samaritan sources should be inverted, as the persecution of Zeno was a consequence of the rebellion rather than its cause, and should have happened after 484, around 489. Zeno rebuilt the church of Saint Procopius in Neapolis and the Samaritans were banned from Mount Gerizim, on whose top a signaling tower was built to alert in case of civil unrest.&lt;ref name="Alan David Crown 1989, pp. 72–73"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crown|first=Alan David|title=The Samaritans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzo6KAH3FmUC&amp;pg=PA72|year=1989|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-145237-6|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 495 Samaritan unrest ==
Samaritans rebelled again in 495, during the reign of Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus]], reoccupying Mount Gerizim. The Samaritan mob commanded by a Samaritan woman is said to have seized the Church of St. Mary and massacred the garrison.&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt; The revolt was subsequently suppressed by the Byzantine governor of [[Edessa]], [[Procopius (governor)|Procopius]],&lt;ref name="Alan David Crown 1989, pp. 72–73"/&gt; and the Samaritan leaders were slain.&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt;

==Ben Sabar Revolt (529-531)==
{{main|Julianus ben Sabar}}
Under a [[charismatic authority|charismatic]], [[messianic figure]] named [[Julianus ben Sabar]] (or ben Sahir), the Samaritans launched a war, sometimes referred as the final Samaritan revolt,&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt; to create their own independent state in 529. This was perhaps the most violent among all the Samaritan uprisings. According to Procopius, the violence erupted due to restrictions imposed on Samaritans by the Byzantine authorities via Justinian's edicts, while [[Cyril of Scythopolis]] indicates sectarian tensions between Christians and Samaritans as the primary cause for the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;
Alan David Crown, Reinhard Pummer, Abraham Tal. ''A Companion to Samaritan Studies''. Mohr Siebeck. Page 140: https://books.google.com/books?id=_iMnzhSSbowC - "[...] Cyril of Scythopolis indicates as the main reason of the riots the friction between Christian and Samaritan communities."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Following massive riots in [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]] and Samarian countryside, the rebels could quickly conquer Neapolis and ben Sabar emerged as their leader, being proclaimed a king.&lt;ref name=crown140/&gt; Ben Sabar followed a strict anti-Christian policy: Neapolis' bishop and many priests were murdered and he persecuted the Christians, destroyed churches and organized guerrilla warfare in the countryside, driving the Christians away.&lt;ref name=crown140&gt;Alan David Crown, Reinhard Pummer, Abraham Tal. ''A Companion to Samaritan Studies''. Mohr Siebeck. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Byzantine sources, the name of the bishop was [[Ammonas (bishop)|Ammonas]] (also Sammon or Ammon).{{citation needed|date= August 2016}} As a response, forces of the ''dux Palaestinae'', combined with units of local governors and the [[Ghassanids|Ghassanid Arab]] [[phylarch]], were dispatched{{by whom|date=April 2018}} to deal with the uprising.&lt;ref name=crown140/&gt; Ben Sabar was surrounded and defeated after withdrawing with his forces from Neapolis.&lt;ref name=crown140/&gt; After his capture, he was beheaded and his head, crowned with a [[diadem]], was sent to Emperor Justianian.&lt;ref name=crown140/&gt;

By 531 the rebellion had been put down.&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Shahîd ''Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century'', Volume 2, Part 2, Harvard University Press (2010) p8&lt;/ref&gt; The forces of Emperor [[Justinian I]] quelled the revolt with the help of the [[Ghassanid]] Arabs; tens of thousands of Samaritans died or were [[slavery|enslaved]], with their death-toll possibly being between 20,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt; The Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] thereafter virtually outlawed the Samaritan faith. According to [[Procopius]] of Caesarea, the majority of Samaritan peasants chose to be defiant in this revolt, and "were cut to pieces".&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt; Further, [[Samaria]], the "world's most fertile land, was left with no one to till it".&lt;ref name=Kohen27/&gt;

== 556 Samaritan revolt ==
The emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] faced another major revolt in 556. On this occasion the Jews and the Samaritans seem to have made common cause, beginning their rebellion in Caesarea early in July.&lt;ref name ="Microcosmos"&gt;{{cite book |title= History of the Byzantine Jews: A Microcosmos in the Thousand Year Empire |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r-9qJRP20MIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=578&amp;f=false |author=Elli Kohen |publisher= University Press of America |year=2007 |accessdate= 15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} They fell upon the Christians in the city, killing many of them, after which they attacked and plundered the churches. The governor, Stephanus, and his military escort were pressed hard, and eventually the governor was killed, while taking refuge in his own house.&lt;ref name ="Microcosmos"/&gt;{{rp| 31}} Amantius, the governor of the [[Diocese of the East|East]] was ordered to quell the revolt, after the widow of Stephanus reached Constantinople.&lt;ref name ="Microcosmos"/&gt;{{rp| 31}}

Despite the Jewish participation, the rebellion seems to have gathered less support than the revolt of Ben Sabar.&lt;ref name ="Microcosmos"/&gt;{{rp|31}} The [[Church of the Nativity]] was burned down, suggesting that the rebellion had spread south to [[Bethlehem]]. Either 100,000 or 120,000 are said to have been butchered following the revolt. Others were tortured or driven into exile. However, this is probably an exaggeration as punishment seems to have been limited to the district of Caesarea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Samaritans |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pzo6KAH3FmUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+samaritans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AqwkU_ygE4SNygG3k4HACg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bethlehem&amp;f=false |editor=Alan David Crown |page=76 |publisher= Mohr Siebeck |year= 1989 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 572 revolt ==
Still, the tensions were not over yet. Emperor [[Justin II]] (r. 565-578) complained about "outrages committed by....Samaritans at the foot of Mount Carmel upon the Christian Churches and the holy images".&lt;ref name ="Microcosmos"/&gt;{{rp|31}} Probably in response to this event, Justin II issued an order in May 572 rescinding the restoration of rights granted by Justinian.&lt;ref name ="Microcosmos"/&gt;{{rp|30–31}}&lt;ref name="Pummer"&gt;{{cite book |title= Early Christian Authors on Samaritans and Samaritanism: Texts, Translations and Commentary |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dhDlzh--Q2AC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;dq=samaritan+578+Revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UpkkU--hGeiqyAHMmYCABg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=samaritan%20578%20Revolt&amp;f=false |author= Reinhard Pummer |publisher= Mohr Siebeck |page=318 |year=2002 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a second joint Samaritan-Jewish revolt took place in summer 572 and again in early 573 or alternatively in 578.&lt;ref name ="Pummer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Jews in Babylonia.

== Aftermath ==
The Samaritan faith was outlawed and from a population of nearly a million, the Samaritan community dwindled to near extinction. The situation of Samaritans further worsened with the failure of [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]] and slaughter of Jewish population in 629.

Samaritan numbers remained very low in the Islamic era, similar to the late Byzantine period - a result of previous revolts and forced conversions.&lt;ref name=mohr71/&gt; Contemporary sources claim between 30 and 80 thousand Samaritans to have lived in Caesarea prior to Muslim invasion, compared with roughly 100 thousand Jews, and those minorities out of the total provincial population of 700 thousand,&lt;ref name=mohr45&gt;Mohr Siebeck. Editorial by Alan David Crown, Reinhard Pummer, Abraham Tal. ''A Companion to Samaritan Studies''. p70-45.&lt;/ref&gt; a majority of whom were Christian at the time. By the early Islamic period the Samaritan diaspora disappears from records except small communities of Egypt and Damascus.&lt;ref name=mohr71&gt;Mohr Siebeck. Editorial by Alan David Crown, Reinhard Pummer, Abraham Tal. ''A Companion to Samaritan Studies''. p70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian Samaritan community was likely swelled due to refugees from coastal cities of Palestine as a result of Muslim invasion.

Following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]] in 636, Samaritans suffered more disabilities than Christians and Jews, as Arab rulers often doubted whether Samaritans are included within the Muslim definition of "[[People of the Book]]", though according to Nathan Schur, the Arab Islamic invasion had initially benefited with the community.&lt;ref name=russel&gt;Russel, G. ''Heirs to Forgotten Kingdoms: Journeys Into the Disappearing Religions of the Middle East''. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Samaritans still converted to Islam due to economic reasons, social advancement and theological reasons and thus community numbers plunged further.&lt;ref name=russel/&gt; Harsh persecution of Samaritans was however led by the more fanatical Caliphs, such as [[Al-Mansur]] (754-775), [[Harun al-Rashid]] (786-809) and [[al-Mutawakkil]] (847-861).&lt;ref name=mohr2&gt;Mohr Siebeck. Editorial by Alan David Crown, Reinhard Pummer, Abraham Tal. ''A Companion to Samaritan Studies''. p2.&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic religious leaders had periodically sought to consolidate their power by stirring anti-Samaritan sentiments and occasionally calling for their annihilation.&lt;ref name=mohr83&gt;Mohr Siebeck. Editorial by Alan David Crown, Reinhard Pummer, Abraham Tal. ''A Companion to Samaritan Studies''. p83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Samaritan wealth was practically wiped out.&lt;ref name=mohr83/&gt;

On April 23, 1988, within minutes of the grand opening of a new [[Save-On-Foods]] store, a {{convert|6,400|sqfoot|m2}} portion of the roof collapsed sending the rooftop parking deck and 20 automobiles crashing into the produce section below. There were no fatalities and 21 people were treated in hospital.&lt;ref name="attgen"&gt;[http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/pubdocs/bcdocs/43459/commissionerinquirystationsquare.pdf Report of the Commissioner of Inquiry, 1988]. Retrieved 2017-09-28&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following the collapse, recommendations from a commission of inquiry resulted in significant changes to the practice of [[architecture]] and [[engineering]] throughout [[British Columbia]].

==Collapse==
At 9:00&amp;nbsp;AM on the morning of April 23, 1988, customers were let into the store as part of a grand opening sale for senior citizens.  Within 10 minutes an employee noticed water spraying from an overhead pipe that had burst.  It was buckling under pressure from a roof beam that was twisting out of shape above a steel column.  The 4.5 minute-long structural failure was heard and witnessed by many of the store occupants, including several who took photographs of the twisting and crushed beam.  Evacuation alerts were issued through the public address system and the store was emptied in less than 5 minutes.  The mayor of Burnaby, Bill Copeland, who presided over the opening ceremonies, assisted in directing the evacuation of approximately 600 customers and 307 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology1988.htm The History of Metropolitan Vancouver - 1988].  Retrieved 2015-03-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Four structural bays of the roof, measuring {{convert|27|by|23|m|ft}}, collapsed into the produce section.  One store employee was trapped under the debris and was removed by first responders using forklifts; he suffered a crushed pelvis.  Several people were blown off their feet by the rushing air from the collapse.

==Background and cause==
The $100 million Station Square development project was begun in 1985 by Georgilas Investments.  In 1986 Station Square/Wesbild purchased the as-yet unbuilt project.

The supermarket facility was a $5.4 million part of the newly constructed mixed-use [[Metrotown, Burnaby|Station Square]], complex in the Metrotown area of Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;''Beams downsized at big store where roof collapsed, engineer says'', Associated Press, printed in the Spokane Chronicle, December 16, 1988.  Retrieved 2015-03-14&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was owned and developed by Wesbild Enterprises and Station Square Developments Inc..  Urban Design Group were the architects. Amako Construction Ltd. was the general contractor.  Two structural engineering firms were involved: Tamm Tacy and Associates and MSS Group who were engaged during construction to provide additional structural verification.  Save-On-Foods, then owned by the [[Overwaitea Foods]] division of Jim Pattison Industries (now [[Jim Pattison Group]]), was a tenant, not the owner or developer of the building.&lt;ref name="attgen"/&gt;

Before construction started, one of the contractors bidding on the work proposed adding car parking onto the roof.  The owner asked the architects and engineers to determine if this was feasible; they did and recommended changes to the design of the structure for additional support and to provide access by way of a [[moving walkway]].

The structural failure was a direct result of the failure of the roof beam to support the weight of the rooftop parking structure and automobiles above.  It was determined that the steel beam was undersized for its intended purpose and did not have bracing required to resist buckling above where it was supported on the column.

Several factors were determined by the Commissioner of Inquiry into the collapse to have contributed to the collapse.  These included, in part or in combination, errors on the part of the engineers, contractors, and steel supplier/mill.  It has also been argued that then-industry standard procedures in engaging and valuation of engineering services and certification of contractors' work were also contributing factors.&lt;ref name="attgen"/&gt;

===Beam size===
During the design phase, the thickness of the roof beam that failed was reduced by 27% to a size incapable of supporting the loads above, even with lateral bracing.  The reasons for this change have not been determined. "The beam was greatly under designed.  The beam column assembly lacked essential lateral supports.  Failure was inevitable.  If not under April 23 loads, then under full service loads."&lt;ref name="attgen"/&gt;

November 1987, during construction, a beam in the area of the moving walkway deflected and caused the residential structure above to tilt approximately {{convert|2|in|mm}} from vertical.  The structural engineers reviewed the design in this area and recommended additional columns, stronger beams, and concrete reinforcing be added. This was done.  In December 1987, Wesbild/Station Square hired the MSS Group to conduct a review of the engineering design in this area.  They made recommendations, including remedial work to beams with insufficient capacity, to which Tamm Tacy concurred.  Both firms later certified that this remedial work has been completed by the contractor.

In March 1988 the MSS Group was hired by the tenant, Save-On-Foods, to conduct a structural review of the entire project due to concerns about deflections of roof beams above the store.  MSS found two beams to have "insufficient capacity" and made recommendations for correction.  Both engineering firms, the architects, developer, and contractor took steps to initiate this action.  The following day Tamm Tacy advised that this remedial work would not be necessary due to the steel mill who had fabricated the beam provided documentation indicating the actual capacity of the beam was significantly greater than documentation used during design.  MSS Group advised that the beam was therefore "satisfactory to resist the design loadings imposed" and "this information is a blessing for all concerned".&lt;ref name="attgen"/&gt;

Two types of failure occurred:  beam bending with buckling of the lower beam flange, and buckling of the beam-column assembly.  The first was determined to be the most probable prime failure and the second the less probably prime cause.

The beam that failed was a 24 inch ({{convert|24|in|mm|disp=out}}) deep wide flange steel beam.  Failure occurred at the point where it was supported on top of a steel column.  One end of the beam was continuously supported (on other columns) and the other end was [[cantilever]]ed (not supported on other columns). With the weight of the cars parking on the roof, the beam began to buckle and was photographed to have rotated approximately 90 degrees from the vertical to the horizontal position above the supporting column.  For an estimate 4 1/2 minutes, the roof deck and supporting joists sagged and functioned as a form of suspension bridge.

===Concrete topping===
The concrete topping on the roof deck was increased from {{convert|2|in|mm}} to {{convert|3|in|mm}} thickness.  The design of the supporting roof joists were increased to account for this increased dead load, but the beam was not.

===Rooftop sidewalk===
The width of the rooftop sidewalk was increased from {{convert|5|feet|m}} to {{convert|11|feet|m}}.  The engineer's design called for this to be concrete over styrofoam; the contractor built the extra width of solid concrete.  This increase in dead load was not known to the architects and engineers at the time and so no change to supporting structure was investigated.

===Steel strength===
The MSS Group recommended strengthening the beam above the column by adding a beam bracket with web stiffeners.  This change was not implemented when Tamm Tacy advised that mill certificates obtained from the steel sub-contractor indicated to be 25% higher strength than expected.  It was later determined that this type of data is not a truly representative sampling of the steel as fabricated and so is not a valid measure of actual strength.

===Lateral bracing===
Lateral bracing can increase the capacity of beams. It can be provided by roof joists or beam web stiffeners. The engineering drawings did not indicate lateral bracing to be provided at the column where the collapse occurred.  The engineers did not study the reduced capacity of the beam due to lack of lateral support.

===Scope of work===
There was a misunderstanding of who was to determine the need for lateral bracing. The steel subcontractor stated they did not provide web stiffeners to the beam as they weren't indicated on the engineering drawings.  Tamm Tacy stated they believed the decision to provide the stiffeners resided with the steel subcontractor's detailer.

===Live load miscalculation===
Engineers at the MSS Group made incorrect assumptions about the live loads on the roof deck in checking the design.

===Industry practices===
The Commissioner of Inquiry noted three common practices of the development and construction industry were cause for concern:  fast-tracking, bidding for professional services, and fragmentation of contractual responsibility.

The [[Fast-track construction]] process obtaining permits and commencing construction on a portion of the project before the design is fully completed.  This process, where "time is money", can involve significant design changes being made during construction.  This can create confusion and delay and significantly increase opportunities for error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/resources/conteduc/archives/0202fast-track-1.asp ''Fast-track construction becomes the norm'', Barbara Knecht, Architectural Record].  Retrieved 2015-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcd.com/oleary/oleary_marapr_2006.html ''Fast Track Construction - Is It Too Good To Be True?'', Arthur O'Leary, Design Cost Data]. Retrieved 2015-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary structural engineering firm for Station Square project, Tamm Tacy and Associates, was one of several firms who submitted fee proposals to the developer for services.  The Commissioner's report stated that, based on the fees, all of the firms "did not intend to provide" the proper level of professional service&lt;ref name="attgen"/&gt; Their fee of $17,000 on a $5.4 million total construction cost was a significantly lower percentage than recommended by the [[Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of British Columbia]] tariff of fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apeg.bc.ca/getmedia/c31c2f50-83fe-4cc2-83a6-f3d9f81c6905/APEGBC-Budget-Guidelines-for-Consulting-Engineering-Services.pdf.aspx APEGBC -  Budget Guidelines for Consulting Engineering Services 2009].  Retrieved 2015-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commissioner's report recommended that the APEGBC be permitted to establish and enforce a minimum tariff of fees.

==Aftermath==
The provincial government convened a Commissioner Inquiry on May 4, 1988 to report on the causes of the failure.  It was headed by Dan J. Closkey and delivered its report on August 26 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/pubdocs/bcdocs/43459/commissionerinquirystationsquare.pdf Report of the commissioner inquiry - Station Square development, (1988).

Retrieved 2015-03-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Key findings of the Commissioner of Inquiry's report are listed in the Background and cause section above.  Major recommendations included:

===Structural reviews===
It was noted that contrary to the perception of the general public, engineering design, verification, and monitoring of construction lies with professional engineers hired for the project, not the building inspectors.  The report recommended that the BC Building Code and Engineers Act be amended to require that structural calculations and drawings be submitted when applying for a building permit; detailed review should be conducted on a random sampling; where warranted the designs should be submitted for detailed review to the professional engineers' governing body; and review costs should be born by municipal levies on building permits.&lt;ref name="attgen"/&gt;

===Professional letters of assurance===
The building code should include province-wide, standard Letters of Assurance, documents that the registered professionals (architects and engineers) responsible for the design would certify that the design conforms to the building codes, will be retained for construction review and, at the end of construction, to certify that the construction conforms with the approved construction documents and codes.  This recommendation was implemented in the 1992 edition of the British Columbia Building Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://housing.gov.bc.ca/mod/WhitePaper_Building_Regulatory_System.pdf Modern Building Regulatory System, White Paper, February 2012, British Columbia Ministry of Housing].  Retrieved 2015-03-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional negligence===
In 1989 the four engineers from the two engineering firms (Tammy Tacy and Associates, MSS Engineering (Structural) Ltd.) involved in the collapse were found guilty of incompetence, negligence or professional misconduct by a five-member panel of the professional engineers governing body. The panel noted inadequate design of the roof structure, including the support beams, failure to inspect the construction of the roofs assembly, and failure to direct or check the work on the project of the engineer in training who was directly managing the project. The panel also found that the engineers’ code of ethics had been breached by one of the firm's partners signing and applying his professional seal to plans and specifications that he had not prepared or supervised. Also faulted were the engineers for inadequately reviewing the structure before the collapse, including not noticing that lateral supports were missing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/ca/alberta/medicine-hat/medicine-hat-news/1989/04-08/page-7 ''Parkade engineers negligent'', Canadian Press story in Medicine Hat News, April 8, 1989].  Retrieved 2015-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1991 and 1994, the APEGBC also made recommendations and took actions in their professional governance geared towards preventing reoccurrence of the actions that led to the collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seabc.ca/documents/guidelines/concept_review.pdf APEGBC Special Review Committee, Concept Review].

===Re-opening===
The Save-On-Foods and rooftop parking structure was repaired and the store operated until 2012.  The complex was demolished in 2013 as part of a [[Station Square (Metrotown)|new development]] with a 35-story tower comprising condominium units, offices, and ground floor retail.  The store reopened in a new space approximately half its previous size in late 2015 in this development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burnabynewsleader.com/news/192320691.html ''Station Square Save-On-Foods demolished'', Burnaby Newsreader, February 21, 2013].

'''Tafelmusik''' (German: literally, "table-music") is a term used since the mid-16th century for music played at feasts and banquets.  Often the term was also used as a title for collections of music, some of which was intended to be so used. The function was displaced in the late 18th century by the [[divertimento]], and its importance soon diminished, but it was revived and partially restored in the vocal genre of the ''Liedertafel'' by [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]] beginning in 1809, and male-voice choral societies describing themselves by this name continued the practice until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unverricht|first =Hubert|editors = Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell|chapter=Tafelmusik|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|date=2001|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most significant composers of ''Tafelmusik'' included [[Johann Schein]], whose ''Banchetto musicale'' of 1617 acquired considerable fame, and [[Michael Praetorius]], who wrote about the phenomenon of ''Tafelmusik'' in his ''Syntagma musicum'' of 1619.  Music from Schein's collection is still performed by early music ensembles with some regularity.

The ''[[Tafelmusik (Telemann)|Tafelmusik]]'' or ''Musique de Table'' by the Baroque composer [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] is perhaps his most celebrated collection of music.&lt;ref&gt;It was voted #76 in the [[Classic 100 Baroque and Before (ABC)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Composed in 1733, Telemann's ''Tafelmusik'' has been compared as a collection to the renowned [[Brandenburg concertos]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] in clearly demonstrating the composer’s supreme skill in handling a diversity of musical genres and a variety of instruments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!--Who has made this comparison, and was this comparison a favourable one, as suggested here?--&gt;

''Tafelmusik'' could be either instrumental, vocal, or both.  As might be expected, it was often of a somewhat lighter character than music for other occasions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1542">The '''Tallinna saksa teater''' or '''Reval German Theater''' (German: ''Revaler Deutsches Theater''), was the second theater building and the first professional theater in the city of [[Tallin]] (then Reval) in [[Estonia]], founded in 1795 and closed in 1939. It was named (German) ''Revaler Theater'' or (Estonian) ''Tallinna Teater'' in 1809-1860, (Estonian) ''Tallinna Linnateater'' or (German) ''Revaler Stadttheater'' in 1860-1910, and ''Tallinna saksa teater'' in 1910-1939. 

==History==
The theater was built to replace the first theater in Tallin, the ''Revaler Liebhaber Theater'' (1784-1792). It was used by the German language amateur dramatic society, which was founded in 1784 and performed German language drama and opera under [[August von Kotzebue]]. 

In 1809, however, the theater was made a professional theater with professional German language actors, which made it the first professional theater in Tallin. 

In 1939, the theater was closed and moved to occupied Poland by the order of the German government. 

The building is no used by the [[Estonian Drama Theatre]].

==The Pride of Tokyo==
The Sabres' general manager at the time, [[Punch Imlach]], was reportedly fed up with the slow drafting process via the [[telephone]], a process intended to keep draft picks secret from the rival [[World Hockey Association]]. Imlach, who had already drafted several players that would go on to great success with the team ([[Derek Smith (ice hockey, born 1954)|Derek Smith]] in the previous round and All-Stars [[Lee Fogolin]] and [[Danny Gare]] in the first two rounds) earlier in the draft, decided to have some fun at the expense of the league and [[Clarence Campbell]], the NHL president for the last 28 years. He enlisted PR Director Paul Wieland to create a fictional player. 

Wieland wanted the player to be of Asian descent and he knew instantly what the last name would be. As a college student driving [[New York State Route 16|Route 16]] from Buffalo to St. Bonaventure, Wieland would regularly pass the Tsujimoto store and that name just stuck in his head. In 2013, hockey blogger Ben Tsujimoto revealed that Imlach eventually called his grandfather – Joshua Tsujimoto, a local grocery store owner – and a Sabres staffer asked for permission to use his family name without revealing the club's true intent, as well as asking what were "popular" first names in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.com/style/blog/slashing-into-the-season-new-era-releases-tokyo-katanas-hat/44000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314195134/http://www.buffalo.com/style/blog/slashing-into-the-season-new-era-releases-tokyo-katanas-hat/44000|title=Slashing into the season: New Era releases Tokyo Katanas hat|archivedate=14 March 2014|author= Ben Tsujimoto|date=January 16, 2013 |work=buffalodotcom|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imlach chose to select star center Taro Tsujimoto of the [[Japan Ice Hockey League|Japanese Hockey League]]'s Tokyo Katanas,&lt;ref name=AHL/&gt; with "[[Katana]]s" being an approximation for "[[Sabre]]s" in the [[Japanese language]], both referring to types of swords. (The JIHL, although it was a real entity, had no team representing Tokyo at the time; [[Seibu Prince Rabbits|Kokudo]] would not relocate to the city until 1984. Incidentally, many years later, Kokudo would provide the first ''real'' Japanese player to play in the NHL, [[Yutaka Fukufuji]].) The NHL made the pick official, and so it was reported by media outlets including ''[[The Hockey News]]''.&lt;ref name=AHL/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd/&gt;

Tsujimoto's pick came at a time when the NHL was only beginning to expand its reach for players outside Canada and the United States; [[Scandinavia]]n players were beginning to be drafted into, and enter, the league at around the same time. Although the players of the [[Soviet Union]], at the time an international powerhouse, were effectively off-limits, it would have not been out of the ordinary to be scouting for new hockey talent in unusual places, which is part of the reason there were no major objections to the legitimacy of Imlach's draft pick.

Imlach did not acknowledge the fake draft pick until just before the start of training camp that year. The NHL would eventually change the pick to an "invalid claim" for its official record-keeping purposes. Campbell did not find the hoax draft pick nearly as funny as Imlach, but this was after Tsujimoto's name had appeared in several NHL publications.&lt;ref name=AHL/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd/&gt; Tsujimoto is still listed as a [[fictitious entry]] among Sabres' draft picks in the Sabres [[media guide]].&lt;ref name=His&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabres.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=438557|title=History|accessdate=2007-07-31|year=2006|publisher=Buffalo Sabres and the National Hockey League}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/draft.asp?yr=1974 |title=All-Time Draft Picks – 1974 |publisher=Buffalo Sabres |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307135855/http://forty.sabres.nhl.com/draft.asp?yr=1974 |archivedate=March 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockey-Reference.com lists the Sabres as having no 11th-round pick in 1974 on their list of Sabres draft picks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/BUF/draft.html|title=Buffalo Sabres Draft Picks - Hockey-Reference.com|author=|date=|work=hockey-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and skips right over the 183rd pick on their lists of 1974 selections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/NHL_1974_amateur.html|title=1974 NHL Amateur Draft - Hockey-Reference.com|author=|date=|work=hockey-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the players selected after Tsujimoto were [[Dave Lumley]], who played nine years in the NHL and won two [[Stanley Cups]] with the [[Edmonton Oilers]], and [[Stefan Persson (ice hockey)|Stefan Persson]], who was selected in the 14th round by the [[New York Islanders]] and played for all four of their Cup-winning teams. (Lumley and Persson even faced each other in the [[1983 Stanley Cup Finals]].)

==Taro Today==
Tsujimoto quickly became an [[inside joke]] for Sabres' fans and staffers.&lt;ref name=CtT40&gt;Bailey, Budd, ''Celebrate the Tradition: 1970-1990,'' Boncraft Inc., 1989, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  For years after the pick, fans would chant "We Want Taro" when games at the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]] became one-sided. In addition, for many years, banners would be hung from the balcony rail stating "Taro Says..." followed by a witty comment against an opponent or player for the opponent.

In the summer of 2011, trading card company [[Donruss|Panini America]] added Tsujimoto to its ''2010-11 Score Rookies &amp; Traded box set''. The card used a picture of an unidentified Asian man playing hockey for a team wearing similar blue-and-gold colors to the Sabres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/blog/puck_daddy/post/the-taro-tsujimoto-rookie-card-honoring-an-unreal-player?urn=nhl,wp8508|title=The Taro Tsujimoto rookie card: Honoring an unreal player|author=|date=|work=yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Andrew Kulyk, sportswriter for local alternative weekly, ''[[Artvoice]]'', includes short musings on the local sports scene under the heading "Taro Sez" in most of his columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artvoice.com/issues/v14n43/sports_football|title=Index of /issues/v14n43/sports_football|author=|date=|work=artvoice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{lang|it|'''Teatro Comunale di Firenze'''|italic=no}} is an [[opera house]] in [[Florence]], Italy. It was originally built as the open-air amphitheatre, the '''Politeama Fiorentino Vittorio Emanuele''', which was inaugurated on 17 May 1862 with a production of 
[[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and which seated 6,000 people. It became the focus on cultural life in the city. After closure caused by fire, it reopened in April 1864 and acquired a roof in 1882. By 1911 it had both electricity and heating.
[[Image:Teatro Comunale di Firenze 04.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Theatre: street view]]
In 1930 the building was taken over by the city authorities who renamed it the ''Teatro Comunale''.  Bombing during the [[Second World War]] damaged the building once again, and other problems closed it for three years in 1958.  Finally, in May 1961, the then-modernized theatre reopened with [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlo]]''. It had become a 2,000 seat elliptically shaped auditorium consisting of a large orchestra section, one tier of boxes, and two wide semicircular galleries, which betray the building's amphitheatre origins.

As the theatre became more closely associated with Italy's first and most important music festival, the annual [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]] which had begun in 1931 as a triennial festival and, except for the war years, became an annual one after 1937, so its name was changed once again for the festivals to the {{lang|it|'''Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino'''|italic=no}}.

'''Terminalia''' was an [[Roman festivals|ancient Roman festival]] in honour of the [[List of Roman deities|god]] [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], who presided over boundaries. His statue was merely a stone or post stuck in the ground to distinguish between properties. His worship is said to have been instituted by [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] who ordered that every one should mark the boundaries of his landed property by stones to be consecrated to Jupiter Terminalis, and at which every year sacrifices were to be offered at the festival of the Terminalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]], ''Roman Antiquities'' [https://archive.org/stream/romanantiquities01dionuoft#page/530/mode/2up II, 74]&lt;/ref&gt; On the festival the two owners of adjacent property crowned the statue with [[garland]]s and raised a crude [[altar]], on which they offered up some corn, honeycombs, and wine, and sacrificed a lamb&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''[[Epodes]]'' II.59&lt;/ref&gt; or a suckling pig. They concluded with singing the praises of the god.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' II.639, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; The public festival in honour of this god was celebrated at the sixth milestone on the road towards [[Laurentum]]&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' II.682&lt;/ref&gt; doubtless because this was originally the extent of the Roman territory in that direction.

The festival of the Terminalia was celebrated {{smallcaps|a. d.}} VII. ''Kal. Mart.'', or the 23d of February on the day before the [[Regifugium]]. The Terminalia was celebrated on the last day of the old Roman year, whence some derive its name. We know that February was the last month of the Roman year, and that when the intercalary month [[Mercedonius]] was added, the last five days of February were added to the intercalary month, making the 23d of February the last day of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''L. L.'' VI.13, ed. Müller&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''[[Saturnalia]]'' I.13&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Cicero]] in a letter to Atticus&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] VI.1&lt;/ref&gt; says, ''Accepi tuas litteras a. d. V. Terminalia'' (i.e. Feb. 19), he uses this strange mode of defining a date, because being then in Cilicia he did not know whether any intercalation had been inserted that year.&lt;ref&gt;Calendarium, pp. 229, b. 230, a.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central Terminus of Rome (to which all roads led) was the god's ancient shrine on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. The [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|temple of Jupiter]], king of the gods, had to be built around it (with a hole in the ceiling as Terminus demanded open-air sacrifices) by the city's last king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquinius Superbus]], who had closed down other shrines on the site to make room for this prestigious project. But the [[augur]]s had read into the flight patterns of birds that the god Terminus refused to be moved, which was taken as a sign of stability for the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'' I.55&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6680">'''Voice phishing''' is a form of criminal [[phone fraud]], using [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] over the [[PSTN|telephone system]] to gain access to private personal and financial information for the purpose of financial reward. It is sometimes referred to as {{'}}'''vishing'''{{'}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/02/crooks-net-millions-in-coordinated-atm-heists/|title=Crooks Net Millions in Coordinated ATM Heists —  Krebs on Security|website=krebsonsecurity.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romney, Marshall and Paul Steinbart (2015) Accounting Information Systems, 13th ed., Chapter 13 - The expenditure cycle: Purchasing to cash disbursements, Upper Saddle River, NJ:Pearson Education, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; - a [[portmanteau]] of "voice" and [[phishing]]. 

Landline telephone services have traditionally been trustworthy; terminated in physical locations known to the telephone company, and associated with a bill-payer. Now however, vishing fraudsters often use modern [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP) features such as [[caller ID spoofing]] and automated systems ([[interactive voice response|IVR]]) to make it difficult for legal authorities to monitor, trace or block. Voice phishing is typically used to steal [[Payment card number|credit card numbers]] or other information used in [[identity theft]] schemes from individuals.

== Example ==
#The criminal either configures a [[war dialer]] to call phone numbers in a given region or list of phone numbers stolen from an institution.
#Typically, when the victim answers the call, an automated recording, often generated with a [[Speech synthesis|text to speech synthesizer]], is played to alert the consumers that their credit card has had fraudulent activity or that their bank account has had unusual activity. The message instructs the consumers to call a specific phone number immediately. The same phone number is often shown in the spoofed caller ID and given the same name as the financial company they are pretending to represent.
#When the victim calls the number, it is answered by automated instructions to enter his or her credit card number or bank account number on the key pad.
#Once the consumer enters a credit card number or bank account number, the visher has the information necessary to make fraudulent use of the card or to access the account.
#The call is often used to harvest additional details, such as security [[Personal identification number]] (PIN), expiration date, date of birth, etc.

Although the use of automated responders and war dialers is preferred by the vishers, there have been reported cases where human operators play an active role in these scams, in an attempt to persuade their victims. Posing as an employee of a legitimate body such as the bank, police, telephone or internet provider, the fraudster attempts to obtain personal details and financial information regarding credit card, bank accounts (e.g. the PIN) as well as personal information of the victim. With the received information, the fraudster might be able to access and empty the account or to commit [[identity fraud]]. Some fraudsters may also try to persuade the victim to transfer money to another bank account or withdraw cash to be given to them directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/aug/28/vishing-scams-fraudsters-seven-million-pounds|title='Vishing' scams net fraudsters £7m in one year|last=Association|first=Press|date=2013-08-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another simple trick used by the fraudsters is to ask the called parties to hang up and dial their bank, but after the victim hangs up, the fraudster does not, keeping the line open and remaining connected when the victim picks up the phone to dial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25365698|title='Vishing' and courier scam complaints increase|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in doubt, calling a company's telephone number listed on billing statements or other official sources is recommended, as opposed to calling numbers received from messages or callers of dubious authenticity. However, sometimes hanging up and redialing is insufficient: if the caller has not hung up, the victim might still be connected, and the fraudster spoofs a dial tone down the phone line to entice the victim to dial. Then the fraudster's accomplice answers and impersonates whomever the victim is trying to call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barclays refunds grandmother's £68k following vishing scam|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-dorset-25986699|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as a 'no hang-up' scam.&lt;ref name="BBC News Online 6 July 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Milligan |first= Brian |title= Banks not liable in most vishing fraud, says Ombudsman |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33386934| date= 6 July 2015|work= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 17 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence consumers are advised to use a different phone when dialing a company's number to confirm.

Bank account data is not the only sensitive information being targeted. Fraudsters are also trying to obtain security credentials from consumers who use Microsoft or Apple products by spoofing the [[caller ID]] of [[Microsoft]] or [[Apple Inc.]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

"'''Wake Me Up When September Ends'''" is a song by American rock band [[Green Day]], released on August 31, 2005, as the fourth single from the group's seventh studio album, ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004). The song was written by frontman [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] regarding the death of his father of [[esophageal cancer]] on September 1, 1982 when the singer was just 10 years old.

The song became a [[hit single]], peaking at number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was also a top ten single in the United Kingdom, Belgium, New Zealand, and was a number one single in the Czech Republic. In the United States, the song became symbolic after [[Hurricane Katrina]], where it was dedicated to victims of the disaster and also regarded as a dedication to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] that occurred in 2001.  The song became certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].

The song's [[music video]] depicts a couple broken apart by the [[Iraq War]], which was intended to convey the song's central theme of loss.

==Background==
"Wake Me Up When September Ends" was written by Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong about his father, who died of cancer on September 1982 when Billie Joe was ten.&lt;ref name=rs05.2&gt;{{cite journal| author =Matt Hendrickson| date =February 24, 2005| title =Green Day and the Palace of Wisdom| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| issue =968| page =| publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]]| issn =0035-791X| url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/green-day-and-the-palace-of-wisdom-20050224| accessdate =June 3, 2015| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150608015044/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/green-day-and-the-palace-of-wisdom-20050224| archive-date =2015-06-08| dead-url =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3936 |title=Wake Me Up When September Ends |work=Song Facts |access-date=2016-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129060815/http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3936 |archive-date=2016-01-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong, at one point, dubbed the song the most autobiographical he had written to that point, considering it "therapeutic" but also difficult to perform.&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite news|author=James Montgomery|title=It's A Dark Day For Green Day In Somber 'September' Video|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1500393/its-a-dark-day-for-green-day-in-somber-september-video/|date=April 19, 2005|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=June 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610040741/http://www.mtv.com/news/1500393/its-a-dark-day-for-green-day-in-somber-september-video/|archive-date=2015-06-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is largely unrelated to the storyline that is central to ''American Idiot''.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt;

==Commercial performance==
The single peaked at number six in the United States, becoming Green Day's second top 10 single. It also peaked at number eight in Canada and the UK, while reaching number 13 in Australia. The song was certified Gold in the United Kingdom for sales of 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards/search.aspx |title=Certified Awards |accessdate=2017-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331041236/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards/search.aspx |archive-date=2013-03-31 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song ended the streak of Green Day's three consecutive number-one hits on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart ("[[American Idiot (song)|American Idiot]]", "[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]", and "[[Holiday (Green Day song)|Holiday]]"), but it peaked at number two on the chart, kept from number one by [[Gorillaz]]' "[[Feel Good Inc.]]" The song also made it to number two on the [[Adult Top 40]] chart and the [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Mainstream Top 40]] chart. This was the band's most successful song in the [[adult contemporary]] market, hitting number three on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary Chart]] and their only song to appear on that specific chart other than "Boulevard of Broken Dreams".

"Wake Me Up When September Ends" had sold 1,652,000 copies as of May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/53615/#postcomment |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |title=Chart Watch }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' deemed the song a sequel to the group's 1997 single "[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)]]".&lt;ref name=rs04.1&gt;{{cite journal| author =Rob Sheffield| date =September 30, 2004| title =Green Day: ''American Idiot''| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| issue =958| page =| publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]]| issn =0035-791X| url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/american-idiot-20040930| accessdate =June 3, 2015| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150303205804/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/american-idiot-20040930| archive-date =2015-03-03| dead-url =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The song's [[music video]] was directed by [[Samuel Bayer]], best known for his work with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Metallica]].&lt;ref name="mtv1"/&gt; Bayer wrote the treatment for the video, which he envisioned as a mini-movie.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt; Bayer brought the idea of an [[Iraq War]]-themed video to the trio after interviewing soldiers who had signed up to fight after being persuaded by a television advertisement. The song's music video thus attempts to "turn the machine on itself" by acting as a commercial for "free thought or peace."&lt;ref name=rs05/&gt; Although it was far from the song's literal meaning, Armstrong felt it appropriate considering the song's theme of loss.&lt;ref name="mtv3"&gt;{{cite news|author=Corey Moss|title=Think Green Day's 'September' Clip Is Epic? Just Wait For 'Jesus Of Suburbia'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1508693/think-green-days-september-clip-is-epic-just-wait-for-jesus-of-suburbia/|date=August 31, 2005|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=June 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610040735/http://www.mtv.com/news/1508693/think-green-days-september-clip-is-epic-just-wait-for-jesus-of-suburbia/|archive-date=2015-06-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer noted that he felt bored with predictable music videos, and wanted to produce a video that felt like a film. Consequently, he and a crew spent a month casting actors for the roles and conducted rehearsals, uncommon for music videos.&lt;ref name="mtv1"/&gt; The clip was filmed in Los Angeles in late March 2004.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt;

The video focuses on a couple in love (played by [[Jamie Bell]] and [[Evan Rachel Wood]]).&lt;ref name="mtv1"/&gt; The boyfriend promises never to leave his girlfriend but they later argue when the boyfriend enlists in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. The boyfriend interprets his actions as a way to show her that he loves her so much that he would put his life on the line to keep her safe. However, the girlfriend is heartbroken, as he broke his vow to never leave her. The video then shows the boyfriend in battle in [[Iraq]] being ambushed by insurgents. This scene is intercut with scenes of the girlfriend tearfully mourning in a quiet field. The video ends on this juxtaposition, emphasizing the pain and heartache of losing loved ones due to the war.

The clip prompted criticism from conservative media pundits.&lt;ref name="mtv4"&gt;{{cite news|author=James Montgomery|title=Green Day's Greatest Video Moments|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1609824/green-days-greatest-video-moments/|date=April 22, 2009|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=June 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110215354/http://www.mtv.com/news/1609824/green-days-greatest-video-moments/|archive-date=2016-01-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of the clip being seen as exploitive of the war for entertainment purposes, Dirnt rejected this notion: "Rock &amp; roll ''should'' be dangerous. […] It should be striking and stir questions, and I think that that video, at the end of the day, comes down to that core emotion of loss."&lt;ref name=rs05&gt;{{cite journal | author =John Colapinto | date =November 17, 2005 | title =Green Day: Working Class Heroes | journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | issue =987 | pages =50–56 | publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]] | location =[[New York City]] | issn =0035-791X | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/green-day-working-class-heroes-20051117 | accessdate =June 3, 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150610030650/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/green-day-working-class-heroes-20051117 | archive-date =2015-06-10 | dead-url =no | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer considered it his best production to that point, remarking, "'September' is hands down the greatest thing I've ever done."&lt;ref name="mtv1"&gt;{{cite news|author=James Montgomery|title='Teen Spirit' Director Calls Green Day Clip His Career Highlight|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1507300/teen-spirit-director-calls-green-day-clip-his-career-highlight/|date=August 9, 2005|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=June 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610040738/http://www.mtv.com/news/1507300/teen-spirit-director-calls-green-day-clip-his-career-highlight/|archive-date=2015-06-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video reached number one on ''[[Total Request Live]]'',&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt; and came in second for best video of the year in a 2005 Reader's Poll by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref name=rs06.1&gt;{{cite journal| author =Andy Greene| date =January 11, 2006| title =The 2005 Readers' Poll| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| issue =| page =| publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]]| issn =0035-791X| url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-2005-readers-poll-20060111| accessdate =June 3, 2015| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150610030622/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-2005-readers-poll-20060111| archive-date =2015-06-10| dead-url =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
"Wake Me Up When September Ends" became closely associated with [[Hurricane Katrina]], which struck the [[Gulf Coast]] of the United States on August 29, 2005. "Wake Me Up When September Ends" became symbolic in the aftermath; one online blogger paired the song with television coverage of the disaster, creating a viral video.&lt;ref name="nyt05"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/arts/art-of-the-internet-a-protest-song-reloaded.html|title=Art of the Internet: A Protest Song, Reloaded|author=Sarah Boxer|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 31, 2015|date=September 24, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529192356/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/arts/art-of-the-internet-a-protest-song-reloaded.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Day performed the song days after the disaster on ''[[ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief]]'', a [[benefit concert]] broadcast on [[MTV]] and its associated properties.&lt;ref name="mtv2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Corey Moss|title=Reznor, Kanye, Green Day Reflect On Disaster, Inspire Relief For MTV Special|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1509302/reznor-kanye-green-day-reflect-on-disaster-inspire-relief-for-mtv-special/|date=September 10, 2005|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=June 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610050046/http://www.mtv.com/news/1509302/reznor-kanye-green-day-reflect-on-disaster-inspire-relief-for-mtv-special/|archive-date=2015-06-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A live version of the song, recorded on September 3, 2005 at [[Gillette Stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]], [[Massachusetts]], was released soon after and dedicated to the hurricane's victims.

The song was performed live with [[U2]] guitarist [[The Edge]] in the pregame show of the [[Monday Night Football]] game between the [[New Orleans Saints]] and the [[Atlanta Falcons]]; it was the first game played in the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] in [[New Orleans]] after the hurricane.&lt;ref name="mtv5"&gt;{{cite news|author=Uptin Saiidi|title='Wake Me Up When September Ends': 10 Fun Ways To Commemorate Green Day's Hit|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/09/30/green-day-wake-me-up-when-september-ends-commemorate/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150630084227/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/09/30/green-day-wake-me-up-when-september-ends-commemorate/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 30, 2015|date=September 30, 2005|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''What's the Frequency, Kenneth?'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]] from their 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]''. It was the first single taken from the album, which was released three weeks later. It peaked at number 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 9 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and was the first song to debut at number one on [[Billboard Modern Rock Tracks]].&lt;ref name=billboard-rhcp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58757/powter-stays-hot-chili-peppers-sizzle-on-charts |title=Powter Stays Hot, Chili Peppers Sizzle On Charts |work=[[Billboard.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song's title refers to an incident in New York City in 1986, when two then-unknown assailants attacked journalist [[Dan Rather]], while repeating [[Dan Rather#"Kenneth, what is the frequency?"|"Kenneth, what is the frequency?"]]

It was placed on R.E.M.'s compilation albums ''[[In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011]]'' in 2011, the only track from ''Monster'' to feature on either. The song is one of the band's most-played songs at live gigs, and was played at every show on their 2008 ''Accelerate'' tour.&lt;ref name = setlistfm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/rem-33d6b859.html?tour=Accelerate+Tour|title=Setlist.fm tour statistics|accessdate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A live version was released on ''[[R.E.M. Live]]'' in 2007.

== History ==

=== Background and recording ===
R.E.M. began work on ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' in August 1993 and "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" was realized about two months later in October. This song was written and recorded at Kingsway Studio, New Orleans, where the band also wrote and recorded "Tongue" and "[[Crush with Eyeliner]]".&lt;ref name=remtimeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~darryl74/1992.html|title=R.E.M. Timeline – 1992/93/94 Concert Chronology|work=iinet.net.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521174315/http://members.iinet.net.au/~darryl74/1992.html|archivedate=May 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead singer [[Michael Stipe]] has said in interviews{{When|date=November 2016}} that the lyrics are about the [[Generation X]] phenomenon in contemporary mass media, sung in character as an older critic whose information consists exclusively of media products.

{{cquote|I wrote that protagonist as a guy who's desperately trying to understand what motivates the younger generation, who has gone to great lengths to try and figure them out, and at the end of the song it's completely fucking bogus. He got nowhere.|30px|30px|[[Michael Stipe]]}}

Guitarist [[Peter Buck]] explained why the song slows towards its conclusion in an interview with [[Guitar World]] magazine:

{{cquote|The truth is, Mike [Mills, bassist] slowed down the pace and we all followed, and then I noticed he looked strange.  It turned out he had [[appendicitis]] and we had to rush him to the hospital.  So we never wound up redoing it.&lt;ref&gt;Garbarini, Vic. "Reconstruction Of The Fables". ''[[Guitar World]]''. November 14, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;|30px|30px|[[Peter Buck]]}}

=== Post-release ===
"What's The Frequency, Kenneth?" made its first live television debut on November 12, 1994, for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', recorded at NBC Studios in New York City. The set on the show opened with "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?" and was followed by two other songs from the new album, ''Monster'', "[[Bang and Blame]]" and "I Don't Sleep, I Dream".&lt;ref name = remtimeline /&gt; The following year, on June 22, 1995, at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, Dan Rather accompanied the band during a [[soundcheck]] performance of the song. The clip was shown prior to R.E.M.'s performance of "[[Crush with Eyeliner]]" on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' the following night.

== Music video ==
The music video was directed by Peter Care, who had previously worked with the band on music videos for "[[Drive (R.E.M. song)|Drive]]" and "[[Man on the Moon (song)|Man on the Moon]]" in 1992. It features the band playing along to the song under bright blue, red and yellow flashing lights. [[Michael Stipe]] appears timid behind the microphone until the first chorus, breaking into an energetic dance. Prominent in the guitar solo, [[Peter Buck]] uses [[Kurt Cobain]]'s [[Jag-Stang]] that he received as a gift from [[Courtney Love]] after Cobain died; he plays it upside-down as Cobain was left-handed. Singer Stipe's newly shaven head and bassist [[Mike Mills]]'s new look (long-hair and the use of [[Nudie suit]]s) prominent on the 1995 ''Monster'' world tour, were given wide exposure in this video. The suit seen in the music video was in fact owned by musician [[Gram Parsons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/music/rem-faq/part1/|title=Rec.music.rem Frequently-Asked Questions list (1 of 3)|work=faqs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DVD companion to ''[[In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003|In Time]]'', entitled ''[[In View: The Best of R.E.M. 1988–2003]]'' (featuring the promotional videos to most of the songs from ''In Time'') included the music video to "What's the Frequency, Kenneth?".

"'''Where Are They Now'''" is a song recorded by [[England|English]] [[Oi!]]/[[punk rock]] band [[Cock Sparrer]] in 1982, from their album ''[[Shock Troops (album)|Shock Troops]]''. The lyrics comment on the previous six years of the [[punk subculture]]. The song portrays the early years of the punk movement in a negative light, bemoaning the lack of follow-through by the leading figures. It also comments on the band members' own naivete, exhorting listeners to not make the same idealistic mistakes. Its lyrics mention several punk legends. In an interview with the fanzine ''Schizoipunx'' from 27 July 2006, Mickey Beaufoy of Cock Sparrer stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''[[Julie Burchill]] and [[Tony Parsons (British journalist)|Tony Parsons]] were rebellious "punk" journalists from the late-1970s. Joe is the late, great [[Joe Strummer]], Jimmy is [[Jimmy Pursey]] and Rotten was [[Johnny Rotten]] from the [[Sex Pistols]] - and the song, which was written in 1982 was about what we saw as the quiet death of Punk - as none of these people were active then - but I am glad to say that the scene has recovered since then - but people still love that song so we keep it in the set as a warning that we have to keep at it or all this great music could disappear.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:eEBxDHqm7zQJ:www.schizoifanzine.net/intervju_cocksparrer.htm Cock Sparrer interview in the ''Schizoipunx'' fanzine (cached copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The lyrics "Rotten on the telly, showing what a few choice words can do" refer to the [[Sex Pistols]]' lead singer [[Johnny Rotten]] and the ''[[Sex Pistols#EMI and the Grundy incident|Grundy incident]],'' in which Rotten and other Sex Pistols swore on live television, sending Britain into an uproar.

The song has been covered and recorded by [[Swingin' Utters]], [[Strike Anywhere]], [[Roger Miret And The Disasters]] and also, in their own language, the Spanish band [[La Polla Records]], the German band Beck's Pistols and Polish band [[The Analogs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/Becks-Pistols-P%C3%B6bel-Und-Gesocks/release/1541795 Beck's Pistols first album Pöbel und Gesocks]&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears on the German punk band [[Die Toten Hosen]]'s cover album [[Learning English Lesson 2]] (2017), with [[Colin McFaull]] participating.

The '''White Nights''' are a kind of all-night [[arts festival]] held in many cities in the summer. The original festival is the [[White Nights Festival]] held in  [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]].  The ''white nights'' is the name given in areas of [[high latitude]] to the weeks around the [[summer solstice]] in June  during which sunsets are late, sunrises are early and darkness is never complete. In Saint Petersburg,  the Sun does not set until after 10 p.m., and the [[twilight]] lasts almost all night.

The White Nights Festival in Saint Petersburg is famous for spectacular fireworks and [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]], a massive show celebrating the end of school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ3Wv0xscJQ|title= Video of 2007 White Nights Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other festivals following this lead have arisen, using names such as White Night, Light Nights or [[Nuit Blanche]], see that article for examples around the world.

==Nomenclature==

Some cities use the French phrase ''Nuit blanche'' (or ''Nuits blanches'', if the event is spread over more than one night).  Some use the same words in their language: White Nights, ''La Notte Bianca'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''La Noche en Blanco'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''Noaptea alba'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), ''Nata e Bardhe'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]), ''Baltā Nakts'' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Others invent their own names, such as ''Lejl Imdawwal'' ("Lit Night") in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], ''Virada Cultural'' in São Paulo, ''Taiteiden yö'' ("[[Night of the arts]]") in Finland, and ''[http://www.kulturnatten.dk/en Kulturnatten]'' ("Night of Culture") in Copenhagen.

==Worldwide==
===Europe===

====Britain====
The British festivals are called ''Light night'' and began in  [[Leeds]], [[England]] in 2005 as part of  the launch of the region-wide Illuminate Cultural Festival.&lt;ref name="lightnight.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.lightnight.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Leeds in October 2005, these 'unusual cultural events' included a string quartet playing at the top of the Town Hall clock tower, a tour round a pitch black church with only a torch and a sinister audio-guide that could not be trusted, and a 'Treasure Hunt' from the Institute for Crazy Dancing.  The Treasure Hunt involved 200 audience members being led across the city and becoming a show in their own right, collecting white boiler suits and umbrellas en route, and dancing up and down [[Briggate]], the main shopping street, with three shire horses, an ice cream van and the bagpipes of Leeds Pipe Band.&lt;ref name="lightnight.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2006/09/28/light_night_2006_feature.shtml BBC Feature]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leeds was joined by [[Bradford]], [[Sheffield]], [[York]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] for Light Night 2006. Several other major cities across the country including  [[Birmingham]] hosted Light Night events in 2008. This has spread even further in 2009 and includes [[Belfast]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Nottingham]].  [[Brighton and Hove]] launched an official partner event 'White Night' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitenightbrightonandhove.com&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by Brighton and Hove Arts Commission, the event is partnered with the annual event in Amiens and sees the cities' arts venues, theatres, galleries and outdoor spaces play host to a wide selection of arts activities, shows, installations, tours and trails.  In 2009, a British network of Light Night towns and cities was established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightnight.co.uk Light Night website]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iceland====
The summer solstice in [[Iceland]] is celebrated on the 24th of June, on the day of [[St. John the Baptist]], when only three hours of modest darkness are experienced in the region of [[Reykjavík]]. It is called [[Jónsmessa]], and it is celebrated in small groups of family or friends around bonfires. It is however not as popular as it was before, and most people don't take any part of it, although some people hold on to it. Icelandic folk stories say that on this day all of nature is thought to work in an unusual way, with rocks and herbs gaining magical powers, cows gaining the ability to speak, seals take on human form, and elves emerge from the netherworld. It is also less commonly known as the Viking New Year.

====Italy====
[[Image:Roma campidoglio notte bianca 2006.jpg|thumb|The crowded steps of the [[Campidoglio]] in [[Rome]] during the 2006 Nuit Blanche]]
In 2005, [[Rome]]'s ''Notte Bianca'' (English: White Night) was held in mid-September, and the guest star was [[Roberto Benigni]]. There were similar initiatives in other cities as well. In [[Naples]] it first took place at the end of October 2005 with numerous concerts (Baglioni, Pino Daniele, 99 Posse, Almamegretta, Stadio) and theatrical and cultural events. The attendance was twice the population of Naples itself. Other Italian ''Notti Bianche'' took place in [[Genoa]], [[Turin]], [[Reggio Calabria]], and [[Catanzaro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanottebianca.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malta====
2006 also saw the first ''Lejl Imdawwal'' (Lit Night) in [[Malta]], in the capital city of [[Valletta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottebiancamalta.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Co-Cathedral of St. John was open for display.

====Paris and the Nuit Blanche====
The first city outside of Russia to host such a festival was apparently Paris, which has had its famous ''[[Nuit Blanche]]'' festival since 2001, when it was started by mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]].&lt;ref name=Parascczuk&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/LocalIsrael/TelAvivAndCenter/Article.aspx?id=180870]" Staying up all night in the nonstop city," Joanna Parascczuk, 07/09/2010, Jerusalem Post.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland a [[Night of the Arts]] (Finnish: Taiteiden yö, Swedish: Konstens natt) is an annual event held in several major cities in late August. First [[Night of the Arts]] was held in 1989 in Helsinki.

Many other cities have followed.  
(Listed in chronological order)

'''Wine fraud'''  relates to the commercial aspects of wine. The most prevalent type of [[fraud]] is one where [[wine]]s are adulterated, usually with the addition of cheaper products (e.g. juices) and sometimes with harmful [[chemical]]s and sweeteners (compensating for colour or flavour).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wineries were doctoring their beverages with sugar water, colouring agents, and artificial flavourings, and using famous brand names|url=http://www.itulip.com/forums/showthread.php/18007-China-cracks-down-on-fake-wine-industry-30-wineries-shut-down|website=itulip.com Cognachome|publisher=The Global Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Counterfeiting and the relabelling of inferior and cheaper wines to more expensive brands is another common type of wine fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Insider's Guide to Counterfeiting Wine - Apple MacHome|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2012-03-11/an-insiders-guide-to-counterfeiting-wine|website=Relabeling: The simplest way to counterfeit wine is to slap the label of a fine wine on to another, similar-looking bottle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third category of wine fraud relates to the [[investment wine]] industry. An example of this is when wines are offered to investors at excessively high prices by a company who then go into planned liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fine Wine Investment |url = https://thelondonwinecellar.com/wine-valuation/fine-wine-investment/|website = The London Wine Cellar|accessdate = 2015-12-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Millions of pounds have been pocketed by offering fine wines at two to three times their market value|url=http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/budd-and-the-dti-strike-the-dodgy-wine-investment-merchants|website=jancisrobinson.com |publisher=Department of Trade and industry (Jim Budd) - LilacHomesite}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the wine is never bought for the investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Watch out for the scams|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9061aee4-79c0-11df-85be-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3hfBDkNEp|website=FT.Com - Four directors involved in the International Wine Commodities Ltd and The Bordeaux Wine Trading Company are charged with conspiracy to defraud and money laundering.

In wine production, as wine is technically defined as [[fermentation (wine)|fermented]] [[grape juice]], the term "wine fraud" can be used to describe the [[adulteration]] of wine by substances that are not related to grapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World News Research |url=http://world-news-research.com/wine.html |website=world-news-research.com |quote= "in 1985, around 100 Austrian wine-makers were indicted with boosting the body and sweetness{{dubious|Adulterants for sweetness|date=March 2018}} of their wines with diethylene glycol, a chemical used in antifreeze." |publisher=My World Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the retailing of wine, as wine is comparable with any other commodity, the term "wine fraud" can be used to describe the mis-selling of wine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The DTI successfully wound up in the High Court - Boington &amp; Fredericks of London Limited, City Vintners Limited and Goldman Williams Limited - (for the) mis-selling of fine wines, and there are more in the pipeline.|url=http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/budd-and-the-dti-strike-the-dodgy-wine-investment-merchants|website=jancisrobinson.com|publisher=The Department of trade and Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; (either as an investment or in its deceitful misrepresentation) in general.

Fraud in wine production refers to the use of additives in order to deceive. This may include colouring agents such as [[elderberry]] juice, and flavourings such as [[cinnamon]] at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics. For example some wines have a deep, dark [[color (wine)|color]] and [[flavor notes (wine)|flavor notes]] of spices due to the presence of various [[phenolic compounds (wine)|phenolic compounds]] found in the skin of the grapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wine Lingo - Definitions and Terms|url=http://www.taylorbrookewinery.com/wine_lingo.html|website=taylorbrookewinery.com|publisher=Taylor Brook winery Llc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraudsters will use additives to artificially create these characteristics when they are lacking. Fraud in the selling of wine, has seen much attention focused on [[wine label|label fraud]] and the [[investment wine]] market. [[Counterfeit]] labelling of rare, expensive, and [[cult wine]]s, and unregulated investment wine firms characterise this type of fraud. ''[[Wine Spectator]]'' noted as much as 5% of the wine sold in secondary markets could be counterfeit&lt;ref name="Spectator pg 14"&gt;M. Frank, ''Wine Spectator'' ( January 31-February 28, 2007). "Counterfeit bottles multiply as global demand for collectible wine surges", p.14&lt;/ref&gt; and the DTI (UK) believes losses by investors to rogue wine investment firms amount to hundreds of millions of pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fine Wine Scam Which Has Cost Investors [Pounds Sterling]110m- "WINE investors are being duped out of millions of pounds by unscrupulous salesmen"|url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-82754022/fine-wine-scam-which-has-cost-investors-pounds-sterling-110m|website=questia.com|publisher=The London Evening Standard - Apple MacHome - DTI (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pliny the Elder.png|left|thumb|During the classical period, wine was so often adulterated and counterfeited that [[Pliny the Elder]] complained that not even the nobility could be assured that their wine was genuine.]]

For [[history of wine|as long as wine has been made]], it has been manipulated, adulterated, and counterfeited. In [[ancient Rome]], [[Pliny the Elder]] complained about the abundance of fraudulent [[Roman wine]] which was so great that even the [[patrician (ancient Rome)|nobility]] could not be assured that the wine they were pouring on their table was genuine. For the poor and middle class of Rome, local bar establishments seemed to have an unlimited supply of the prestigious [[Falernian wine]] for unusually low prices.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 4 &amp; 26-27 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], wines from questionable origins were often passed off as wines from more prestigious regions. In [[London]], local authorities established laws for tavern owners prohibiting [[French (wine)|French]], [[Spanish (wine)|Spanish]], and [[German wines]] from being [[cellared (wine)|cellared]] together so as to prevent the potential for mixing the wines or falsely representing them to the consumer. If a producer or merchant was found selling fraudulent or "corrupt wine", they were forced to drink all of it. In medieval Germany, the penalty for selling fraudulent wine ranged from [[human branding|branding]] to [[assault|beating]] to [[death penalty|death]] by [[hanging]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], advancements in science ushered in a new occupation of "wine doctors" who could fashion examples of wines from obscure items and chemicals. Writers like [[Joseph Addison]] wrote of this "''fraternity of chymical operators (sic)"'' who would use [[apples]] to make [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] and [[sloe]] to make [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]] and then sell these wines fraudulently on the market. Following the [[Phylloxera epidemic]], when true wine was scarce, wine fraud rose. Some merchants would take dried raisins grown from other [[Vitis|species of grapevines]] and make wine that they passed off as being from a more prestigious [[provenance]] such as the more well known wines from [[France (wine)|France]] or [[Italy (wine)|Italy]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, several European writers wrote about the risk and prevalence of wine fraud. In 1820, German chemist [[Friedrich Accum]] noted that wine was one of the commodities most at risk for being fraudulently manipulated and misrepresented. In 1833, the British wine writer [[Cyrus Redding]] echoed the alarm over the unchecked operations of these "wine doctors". Eventually the concern over wine fraud grew enough that provisions against the adulteration and misrepresentation of wine was included in [[British Parliament]]'s [[Adulteration of Food and Drink Act 1860]]. Several European governments also enacted legislation defining what exactly constitutes "wine" so as to distinguish authentic winemaking from the workings of these wine counterfeiters. The French government first legally defined wine as the product of fermented grape juice in 1889, followed by the German government in 1892 (later expanded in 1909) and the Italian government in 1904.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

Fraud of a different nature occurred during [[prohibition in the United States]], when wine production was illegal, as grape merchants would sell "bricks" of grape [[concentrate]] across the United States along with a packet of [[yeast (wine)|dried yeast]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt; The bricks would come with a "[[warning label]]" cautioning people not to mix the contents of the brick, yeast, water, and sugar in a pot and then seal such pot for seven days, or else ''"an illegal alcoholic beverage will result"''.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 630-631"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 630-631 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practices that were once considered fraudulent===
The practice of adding grape spirits to wine was once considered manipulative and fraudulent but today is accepted practice for the production of all fortified wines, like [[Portwine|Port]].

Over the years, [[winemaking]] techniques have evolved. The first, primitive "[[natural wine]]" or "authentic wine" was most likely the result of crushed grapes being forgotten while stored in a container. The process of allowing wild [[yeast]] found on the surface of the grape conduct [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] in an uncontrolled environment creates a very crude style of wine that may not be palatable to many people. Hence the development of various techniques and practices designed to improve the quality of the wine but which could be viewed as "manipulating" or "adulterating" the wine from its natural or "authentic state". At various points in history, these techniques may be considered ''too much'' manipulation, more than what a consumer would likely expect, and thus labeled as "fraud". However as these techniques became more common place in the wine industry, they gained an air of acceptability and eventually became just another tool in the winemaker's tool box to help craft good-quality wine.&lt;ref name="Bird pgs 1-7, 223-233"&gt;D. Bird ''Understanding Wine Technology'' pgs 1-7, 223-233 DBQA Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-891267-91-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most techniques of manipulation arose from need. Early wine had many [[wine faults]] that caused a wine to spoil quickly. Classical writings from the Greeks and Romans detailed recipes that could cure "sick wines". These include adding various items like [[milk]], ground [[Mustard seed|mustard]], [[wood ash|ashes]], [[Urtica|nettles]], and [[lead]]. Another example of early "manipulation" that became accepted, common practice was the process of adding [[grape spirit]] to wine made in the [[Douro (wine)|Douro]] region of [[Portugal (wine)|Portugal]]. This process of [[fortification (wine)|fortification]] gave the wine [[chemical stability]] for long sea voyages and, when added during the fermentation process, left the wine with a balance of [[residual sugar]] and [[alcohol content]] that gave the wine a unique taste. This style of wine became very popular on the world wine market. Today the accepted way to make [[Port (wine)|Port]] is to "manipulate" it by adding [[brandy]] during the fermentation process.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

Other winemaking techniques that have been at various times considered fraudulent or too manipulative of the wine include [[chaptalization]], fermenting and [[aging (wine)|aging]] in [[oak barrels (wine)|oak barrels]], using oak chips, stirring [[lees (wine)|lees]], [[racking]], [[clarification and filtration]], [[reverse osmosis]], cold [[maceration (wine)|maceration]], the use of cultured instead of wild yeast, [[cryo-extraction]], [[micro-oxygenation]], and the addition of [[enzyme]]s, [[anti-oxidant]] agents, [[acids (wine)|acids]] or other [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] that may be used to "[[balance (wine)|balance]]" the wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 424-425"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 424-425 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adding water to wine====
While some winemaking techniques once considered fraudulent are now generally accepted, a few practices have gone in the opposite direction. One of the most controversial is adding water to wine in a technique known today as [[humidification]]. [[Master of wine]] [[Jancis Robinson]] calls the act of adding water to "stretch out" or dilute wine ''"possibly the oldest form of wine fraud in the book."''&lt;ref name="Jancis"&gt;J. Robinson ''"[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/jr437.html Adding water to wine]"'' Purple Pages, December 31st 2002&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long history of adding water to [[Serial dilution|dilute]] wine in order to make it more palatable. The [[ancient Greeks]] thought it was "[[barbaric]]" to drink [[Ancient Greece (wine)|undiluted wine]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt; They further believed that [[wine and health|undiluted wine was unhealthy]] and that the [[Kings of Sparta|Spartan king]] [[Cleomenes I]] was once driven insane after drinking wine that was not diluted with water. Today, few consumers dilute their wine as the Greeks did, but the use of water during the winemaking process is still prevalent.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 762"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 762 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today water is used to help balance extremely ripe grapes that would have a concentration of [[sugar (wine)|sugar]]s and [[phenolic compounds (wine)|phenolic compounds]]. Modern winemaking has begun to promote higher levels of [[ripeness (wine)|ripeness]] and longer "hang time" on the vine before [[harvest (wine)|harvesting]]. This increased emphasis on ripeness has had the effect of producing wines with higher [[alcohol levels]] (often over 15%). In many countries, such high alcohol levels qualify the wines for higher levels of [[duty|duties]] and [[taxes]]. Adding water to [[grape must]] can dilute the wine to such a degree that the overall [[alcohol by volume]] drops below the percentage threshold for these higher taxes.&lt;ref name="Jancis"/&gt; The deliberate act of diluting a wine with water in order to pay lower duties and taxes is illegal in several countries.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

The gray area between accepted practice and fraud is where water is added to the winemaking process as a means of "quality preservation". Water is often used during the winemaking process to help pump grapes through equipment and to "rehydrate" the grapes that have begun to shrivel from the extended hang time. This rehydration is used to help balance the wine and, it is hoped, to prevent "[[dried fruit]]" flavors that may be unpalatable to the consumer. In the [[United States (wine)|United States]], the [[California Wine Institute]] has developed guidelines that allow for the addition of a certain amount of water to compensate for the loss of natural water in the vineyard from [[dehydration]]. The addition of water has been argued by its proponents as necessary to prevent [[stuck fermentation]]s. Despite being allowed limited legal use, the practice of adding water to wine is still shrouded in controversy, and few winemakers willingly admit to it.&lt;ref name="Jancis"/&gt; A "[[code word]]" for the practice in the wine industry is adding "[[Jesus]] units" in a play on words about the [[Biblical]] story of the [[miracle]] performed at the [[Marriage at Cana]] where Jesus turned water into wine.&lt;ref&gt;J.

==Label fraud==
[[File:Black Rooster Label Chianti.jpg|thumb|Several European countries developed appellation systems, with their own unique labels and seals, to try to combat label fraud that misrepresented a wine's true origins.]]

One form of fraud involves affixing counterfeit labels of expensive wines to bottles of less expensive wine. This practice became particularly prominent following the devastation of the [[phylloxera]] epidemic in the 19th century when the supply of expensive premium wine was scarce. At first, the label fraud mostly consisted of taking a wine from a region of lesser acclaim (such as [[Southwest France (wine)|Southwest France]] or [[Calabria (wine)|Calabria]] in Italy) and then labeling the wine as if it came from more prestigious regions such as Bordeaux or [[Tuscany (wine)|Tuscany]]. To counter this type of fraud, governments developed extensive [[appellation]] systems and [[Protected Designation of Origin]] or (PDOs) that attempted to regulate wines labeled as coming from particular wine regions. Early attempts to protect the name of a wine region led to government declaration on the boundaries and wine permitted to carry the names of [[Chianti (wine)|Chianti]], [[Oporto (wine)|Oporto]] and [[Tokaji]]. Today most major European [[wine producing countries]] have some appellation system of protected origins. The most well known systems include the ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) used in [[France]], the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) used in [[Italy]], the ''[[Denominação de Origem Controlada]]'' (DOC) used in [[Portugal]], and the ''[[Denominación de Origen]]'' (DO) system used in [[Spain]]. Producers who are registered in each appellation must abide by the appellation's rules, including exact percentage of grapes (often 100%) that must come from that region. Producers who fraudulently use grapes outside the region they are proclaiming on their wine labels can be caught by the appellation's authorities.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

As it became more difficult to fraudulently label wines with the wrong provenance, label fraud soon evolved to the pilfering of the identities of wine estates themselves. Merchants would take the bottles of lesser priced wines and label them with the names of the finest [[classified Bordeaux estates]] or [[Grand crus of Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt; Label fraud, to be done well, requires bottles, corks, and packaging to be similarly manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Counterfeits and Other Problems |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/fakes.lml |publisher=Wine-searcher.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporter {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Marie Doutrelant|fr}} "disclosed that many famous [[Champagne houses]], when short on stock, bought bottled but unlabeled wine from cooperatives or one of the big private-label producers in the region, then sold it as their own".&lt;ref name=prial&gt;Prial, Frank. J, ''Decantations''. NY: St. Martin's Griffin, 2001. Pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt; A high-profile instance of alleged wine fraud was disclosed in early 2007, when it was reported that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] had opened an investigation into the counterfeiting of old and rare [[vintages]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, John, ''The Wall Street Journal'' (March 6, 2007). "U.S. Investigates Counterfeiting of Rare Wines"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Elin, ''Bloomberg.com'' (March 20, 2007). "Trophy Status and History Trump Taste in Fuss Over Old Wines"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of label fraud===
One of the most famous, alleged purveyors of label fraud is wine collector [[Hardy Rodenstock]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, Rodenstock hosted a series of high-profile wine tasting events of old and rare wines from his collection, including many from the 18th and 19th centuries. He invited to these tastings dignitaries, celebrities and internationally acclaimed wine writers and critics such as Jancis Robinson, [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.]] and [[Michael Broadbent]] who at the time was a director at the London [[wine auction|auction]] house [[Christie's]] and considered one of the world's foremost authorities on rare wine. At one such tasting, Rodenstock produced 125 vintages of [[Château d'Yquem]], including a very rare bottle from the 1784 vintage. In addition to holding these extravagant tastings, Rodenstock also sold many bottles from his collection at auction houses, which supposedly regularly inspect and research wines for authenticity. One such lot that Rodenstock sold were the rare "[[Jefferson bottles]]", reportedly rare Bordeaux wines bottled for the [[American president]], [[Thomas Jefferson]]. American businessman [[Bill Koch (businessman)|Bill Koch]] bought four of these Jefferson bottles which were later determined to be fake - the engravings on the bottle that purportedly linked them to Jefferson were determined to have been done with a high-speed electric drill similar to a dentist's drill; technology that did not exist until modern times. This revelation cast a net of suspicion on the authenticity of all the rare bottles that Rodenstock served at his tastings and sold at auctions.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;P. Keefe ''[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/09/03/070903fa_fact_keefe?currentPage=1 The Jefferson Bottles]'', The New Yorker pages 1-10, September 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jancis 2007"&gt;[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/20070315_1 Jancisrobinson.com, March 17, 2007: Flushing out wine fraud and fakes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-publicized example of label fraud is the case of [[Rudy Kurniawan]]; he was arrested on March 8, 2012 and indicted for fraud. Allegedly, Kurniwan was buying large stocks of negociant [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] and re-labeling them as more expensive wines, such as [[Domaine de la Romanée-Conti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinberger|first=Michael|title=A Vintage Crime|journal=Vanity Fair|date=July 2012|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/07/wine-fraud-rudy-kurniawan-vintage-burgundies|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He famously consigned several lots of Clos St. Denis from Domaine Ponsot from vintages long prior to any recorded production of Ponsot wines from that vineyard; the auction lots were withdrawn prior to bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wallace|first=Benjamin|title=Château Sucker|journal=NY Magazine|date=13 May 2012|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/rudy-kurniawan-wine-fraud-2012-5/index4.html|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, bottles of the weaker 1991 vintage of [[Château Lafite Rothschild]] were relabeled and sold as the acclaimed 1982 vintage in [[China]]. In 2000, [[Italy|Italian]] authorities uncovered a warehouse with nearly twenty thousand bottles of fake "[[Super Tuscan]]" 1995 [[Sassicaia]] and arrested a number of people including the group's salesperson, who was selling the fake wine out of the back of a [[Peugeot]] [[hatchback]].&lt;ref name="Spectator pg 14"/&gt;

===Preventive actions===
Federal governments and individual producers have taken many efforts in order to curb the prevalence of wine fraud. One of the earliest such preventive measures was the founding of the ''Service de la Répression des Fraudes'' by the French government to detect and stamp out fraud among France's AOC wines.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;
Some major producers are taking actions to prevent fraud of future vintages including marking bottles with engraved [[serial number]]s on the glass and taking more control of the distribution process of their wines. However, for older vintages, the threat of fraud persists, although new techniques, like [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf071211r stable isotope analysis] and [[isoscapes]] are likely to grow in importance.

==Wine blending==
[[File:Sangiovese grapes for chianti.jpg|thumb|The rumors that grapes other than [[Sangiovese]] ''(pictured)'' was being used in the production of [[Brunello di Montalcino]] triggered an investigation into the potential wine fraud.]]

Some practices of manipulation and adulteration have gone through stages of being considered fraudulent and later accepted{{By whom|date=June 2012}} as common practice. One of these is the practice of blending other grape varieties in order to add a characteristic that is lacking in the original wine. This most often occurred in the case of a wine lacking color. A wine with a deep dark color is often associated with being of a higher quality, so blending a darker color variety (or a [[teinturier]]) into a lighter wine could enhance the marketability of the wine. Today the practice of blending grape varieties together is commonly accepted (such as blending [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]]), except where such blending is against the regulation of a particular [[appellation]] (such as the controversy over the ''[[Brunellopoli]]'' scandal in [[Brunello di Montalcino]]).&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

The gray area comes when inferior wine is being blended in with more expensive, higher quality wine in order to increase the total quantity of wine available to be sold at higher prices. This is a process known as "stretching" or "cutting in" the wine. During the 18th century, [[Bordeaux wine]] producers would often import wine from [[Spain (wine)|Spain]], [[Rhone (wine)|Rhone]] or the [[Languedoc (wine)|Languedoc]] to blend and stretch out their wine which they sold to the [[English (people)|English]] as [[claret]]. While this practice would be frowned upon today by Bordeaux authorities, the French wine writer [[André Jullien]] noted that some merchants believed this practice was necessary in order for the claret to be agreeable with English tastes—a practice he describes as ''"travail à l'anglaise"''.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

===Examples of illegal blending===
Reporter Doutrelant reported the comments of "a government inspector on the illegal use of sugar to boost the alcoholic content of [[Beaujolais-Villages (wine)|Beaujolais-Villages]]: 'If the law had been enforced in 1973 and 1974, at least a thousand producers would have been put out of business'".&lt;ref name=prial/&gt; The same writer explained how growers "planted [[Mourvèdre]] and [[Syrah]], two low-yield grapes that give the wine finesse, strictly for the benefit of the government inspectors. Then, when the inspectors left, they grafted cheap, high-yield vines, [[Grenache]] and [[Carignan]], back onto the vines".&lt;ref name=prial/&gt;

In March 2008, allegations were made against producers of Brunello di Montalcino that there were illegally blended other types of [[grape varieties]] into wine stipulated to be of 100% [[Sangiovese]], allegedly to inflate production and increase profit, in a scandal termed "Brunellopoli".&lt;ref name=vw2803&gt;{{cite web |last= ''VinoWire.com'' |date= March 28, 2008 |url=http://vinowire.simplicissimus.it/2008/03/28/antinori-argiano-and-frescobaldi-implicated-in-brunellopoli-brunello-scandal/ |title= Antinori, Argiano, and Frescobaldi named in "Brunellopoli" Brunello Scandal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Burgundy wine]] shippers have been found guilty of blending inexpensive wine with red Burgundies and exporting them at exorbitant prices.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Vins [[Georges Duboeuf]] company was found guilty and fined in 2006 for illegally mixing [[Gamay]] from [[Beaujolais Villages]] with [[Beaujolais Cru]] grapes from [[Brouilly]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Côte-de-brouilly|fr}} and [[Moulin-à-Vent]] in the 2005 [[vintage]]. The issue was confined to a small percentage of the wine produced by Duboeuf; the affected wines that were wrongly labeled as Cru Beaujolais were declassified to Beaujolais Villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Frank|first=Mitch|title=Georges Duboeuf's Company Convicted of Fraud|url=http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Georges-Duboeufs-Company-Convicted-of-Fraud_3133|publisher=[[Wine Spectator]]|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazardous materials==
[[File:Lead(II)Acetate.jpg|thumb|A dangerous form of wine fraud is the use of [[hazardous materials]] in the wine making. Ancient Romans and others used to blend lead acetate into their wine in order to add sweetness.]]

One of the most dangerous forms of wine fraud is when producers add hazardous materials such as [[lead(II) acetate]] ("sugar of lead"), [[diethylene glycol]]{{dubious|Adulterants for sweetness|date=March 2018}}, and [[methanol]]{{dubious|Adulterants for sweetness|date=March 2018}} to wine in order to increase sweetness. Some chemicals may be used to mask other wine faults and unpleasant aroma. Government authorities, such as the [[European Union]] and the American [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]], across the globe have set up laws and regulations of acceptable chemicals that can be added to wine in order to avoid some of the scandals that have plagued certain wine producing countries in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 4"/&gt;

In 1985, [[1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal|diethylene glycol was added as an adulterant]] by some [[Austrian (wine)|Austrian]] producers of white wines to make them [[sweetness of wine|sweeter]] and upgrade the dry wines to sweet wines;{{dubious|Adulterants for sweetness|date=March 2018}} production of sweet wines is expensive and addition of sugar is easy to detect. In 1986,  twenty-three people died because a fraudulent winemaker in [[Italy (wine)|Italy]] blended toxic [[methyl alcohol]]  into his low-alcohol wine to increase its alcohol content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/04/09/poisoning-scandal-rocks-italian-wine-export-business/0d1c784f-2e47-4078-af57-e1c04f3469ed/ Poisoning Scandal Rocks Italian Wine Export Business] Loren Jenkins, [[Washington Post]], April 9, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2011/08/top-10-wine-scandals/7/ TOP 10 WINE SCANDALS] Rupert Millar, 17 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/09/world/italy-acting-to-end-the-sale-of-methanol-tainted-wine.html ITALY ACTING TO END THE SALE OF METHANOL-TAINTED WINE] ROBERTO SURO, [[New York Times]], April 9, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-29/food/fo-7639_1_italian-wine How Italian Wine Was Contaminated] DANIEL P.
