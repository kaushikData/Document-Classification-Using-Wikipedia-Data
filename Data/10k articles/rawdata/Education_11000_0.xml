A '''Bachelor of Business''' ('''BBus, BBus (Major)''') is a three-year undergraduate business [[Bachelor's degree|degree]] offered by traditional and newer universities from the post-Dawkins era in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and [[Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dbs.ie/course/full-time-undergraduate/full-time-undergraduate-bachelor-of-business|title=Full-time Undergraduate - Bachelor of Business|website=www.dbs.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is similar in format and structure to a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (BCom).

In Australia, it was traditionally awarded by former non-university tertiary institutions which include institutes of technologies, such as [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[RMIT University]] and the [[University of Technology, Sydney]]. Some former Institute of Technologies and Colleges such as Ballarat College of Advanced Education ([[University of Ballarat]]), Swinburne Institute of Technology ([[Swinburne University]]) the South Australia Institute of Technology ([[University of South Australia]]) and the Western Australia Institute of Technology ([[Curtin University of Technology]]) have renamed their Bachelor of Business programs to Bachelor of Commerce after achieving university status.

Many universities such as [[Monash University]] and the [[University of Queensland]] are offering Bachelor of Business degrees as a way to further specialise students study needs while other universities such as [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[James Cook University]], [[Griffith University]] and [[La Trobe University]] have replaced many of their traditional general Commerce programs with Business programs.  Within Australia, Bachelor of Business degrees are as common as Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Economics degrees.

In Ireland this award can also be offered as an honours degree '''B Business (Hons)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dorset-college.ie/course/131/bachelor-of-business-honours-in-international-business|title=HETAC/QQI Bachelor of Business in International Business Level 8 - Dorset College Dublin|website=www.dorset-college.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a further one year study than the ordinary level Bachelor degree.

The '''Budapest University of Technology and Economics''' ({{lang-hu|Budapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem}} or in short {{lang|hu|Műegyetem|italic=yes}}), official abbreviation '''BME''', is the most significant [[University of Technology]] in [[Hungary]] and  is considered the world's oldest [[Institute of Technology]] which has university rank and structure. It was the first institute in Europe to train engineers at university level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moveonnet.eu/directory/institution?id=HUBUDAPES02&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1782.

More than 110 departments and institutes operate within the structure of eight faculties. About 1100 lecturers, 400 researchers and other degree holders and numerous invited lecturers and practising expert specialists participate in education and research at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Approximately 1381 of the university's 21.171 students are from 50 countries abroad. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics issues about 70% of Hungary's engineering degrees. 34 professors/researchers of the university are members of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

Training courses are provided in five languages: [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

The [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credit system was introduced in 1995. This helps students to enroll in the student exchange program of the [[European Union]], the [[Socrates programme|Socrates]] (also known as Erasmus), and earn a double degree through the [[Top Industrial Managers for Europe]] network.

==The organizational structure==
[[Image:Budapesti_Műszaki_Egyetem_R_épülete.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The "R" building is the seat of the Chancellery and the Central Student Office]]

The Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) is a public higher education institute operating as a central budgetary institution. Its founding regulation has been issued by the Minister of Human Resources. Its Organizational and operational conditions are summarized in its own regulation in accordance with laws.

The steering body of the University is the Senate. BME is divided into faculties.

The faculties in the order of their founding:

*Faculty of Civil Engineering (ÉMK)
*Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (GPK)
*Faculty of Architecture (ÉPK)
*Faculty of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology (VBK)
*Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics (VIK)
*Faculty of Transportation Engineering and Vehicle Engineering (KJK)
*Faculty of Natural Sciences (TTK)
*Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences (GTK)

Education, research, innovation and direct additional services are proceeded by the faculties. Work-sharing between the faculties are subject oriented both in the fields of education and that of technology. The organogram of BME is available here. The faculties consist of departments, institutes, research centres that are supported by deans offices and other units.
Governing is assisted by the Rectors Office and the Chancellors Office. There is a highly independent Group of integrated internal control.

Faculties and Students organizations are supported by service units.

The core and ancillary activities are supported

*with system management and system support services
**by the units of Chancellery
*with specialized services, like
**library and information management
***by the National Technical Information Centre and Library and within it the University Archives
**student registration, study management and coordination
***by the Central Student Office
**student support and advice management together with cultural services
***by the Student Service Directorate
**secretariat of Senate, Rectors Council and Ethics Committee
***by the Rectors Office
**assistance to the faculty councils, education committees and other committees of the faculties
***by deans offices
**secretariat of the University Committee of Teaching Authorization and Doctoral Council and Scientific Students Association
***by the Central Student Office
**assistance to the BME Organization of Union of Higher Education Employee, and the BME Unite of the Union of Employee in Public Culture and Collections, the Council of Public Employee and the BME Committee of Equal Opportunities
***by the Office of Representations
**assistance to the governing body of University Student and Doctoral Student Representation (EHDK)
***by the Student Service Directorate
**with coordination of independent organizational units and activities
***by other umbrella organizations

There are other organizations like companies established or owned by the University, welfare institutions, student or teacher activity groups and other organizations associated to the University.

The Rector is the top manager and representative of the University. The Chancellor ensures the technical conditions, the administration, the financial management in order to complete the functions of the University. The Rector and the Chancellor regularly calls Executive Board meetings to prepare strategic decisions. Employment relations between are regulated in the Annex of the Human Resource Policy.

==Admissions==
All Hungarians who pass the Hungarian secondary school [[matura]] with enough points are eligible for admission, as well as for anyone else in possession of an [[International Baccalaureate]] (again, with enough points).

As with all Hungarian universities, a tuition fee of around [[US dollar|$]]1000 has to be paid each semester for the Hungarian program. No extra fee is required for Hungarians for whom it is their first university, unless they spend more than 13 semesters there.

The university offers extensive English language programs on all its faculties, at all levels of study (Preparatory Year, [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]]). The Tuition fees vary from €2000 - €4500 per semester.
6% of all students come from different countries of the world representing over fifty different countries; the majority of the students in the English Program are from [[US]], [[England]] and [[Germany]].

==Location==
[[Image:Panorama_BME.jpg|500px|thumb|right|Panoramic view of the buildings of BME]]

The university is located on the right side of the [[Danube]] between [[Szabadság Bridge]] and [[Petőfi Bridge]] and towards [[Rákóczi Bridge]]. This makes the university campus especially long and narrow: walking from one side of the university to the other can take as much as 20 minutes.

The [[Inner City (Budapest)|Inner City of Budapest (Pest)]] is just across the river, about 10 minutes' walk by either of the bridges.

==National Technical Information Centre and Library==

The National Technical Information Centre and Library at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME OMIKK) is the successor of two major libraries in Hungary.

===The Central Library of BME===
[[Image:BME-OMIKK.jpg|300px|thumb|right|BME OMIKK]]
The library of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (then Joseph Polytechnics) was formally founded in 1848 when Baron [[József Eötvös]], Minister of Religion and Public Education donated a book in five volumes that become the first item in the inventory of the library.

Since its foundation it moved with the University from Pest to the Buda Castle in 1854 and back to Pest in 1872. In 1882 it moved again, to the campus near the National Museum, now the campus of Faculty of Humanities of [[Eötvös Loránd University]]. In 1909 the Library was moved to a separated cathedral like building in the new Campus of BME. The building was designed by [[Samu Pécz]], professor of architecture at the University. The central Aula connects the spacious, 16.5 meter wide reading room to the north, the multi floor storage facility to the west and the workrooms of library procedures to the south. The eastern facade is connected to the central building of the University with the 'Bridge of Sighs'. The architectural concept has been proven timeless.

Later on the storage capacity was enlarged with the introduction of compact storage technology, and adding a large capacity underground storage facility under the garden of the Campus.

Today a remote storage building near Budapest is also used.

In the beginning the library was directed by university professors. The first full-time director was appointed in 1936.

In the early years the library served only professors. It was opened for students in 1869, and for the general public in 1884.

In 1884 the first classification system of the library was elaborated and the first printed catalogue of the library was published by Vince Wartha, who was by the way professor of urban chemical technologies, dealing with construction materials, with gas production and water supply, and rector of university two times. In the following years extended editions of the printed catalogue were published and distributed to the departments and to other major libraries in the country. In 1936 the library introduced the index card system of catalogue.
Transition to electronic cataloguing began in the 1980s, and the integrated library system was introduced in the 1990s. With the spreading of internet and widening the bandwidth the catalogue has become available from anywhere.

The library collection was extended by acquisitions, and with donations of professors. There were two major additions by receiving the heritage of baron József Eötvös in 1872, and of [[Károly Hieronymi]] engineer and politician in 1912.

During the Second World War both the building and the collection were damaged. Nevertheless, it continued its work in 1945, and the main reading room was reopened during the academic year of 1949-1950.

Since 1952, increasing amount of the collection has been placed on open shelves for direct access of the readers. In the beginning only fiction, later on handbooks, and nowadays textbooks and current literature can be found on the shelves in the reading rooms.
In 1953 the library started publishing serials (Methodical papers of the Central Library of Budapest Technical University, publications on history of science and engineering, Scientific Technical Bibliographies) and some other serials in the 1960s.

Since the mid sixties the library takes part in the instruction of first year students with training on using the library and in teaching literature search skills.

In 1991 the library opened the Study of Natural Sciences with mostly chemistry-regarded literature open shelves.

The library is the centre of the library network of the University, and the thematic library in mathematics and physics.

===The National Technical Information Centre and Library (OMIKK)===
In 1883 [[Ágoston Trefort]], minister of education opened the Technological Museum including a library consisting the “basic Hungarian and international literature dealing with industry”.
In 1889 the library was moved and merged with the library of Public Polytechnics. In 1921 the Institute of Technological and Material Testing was established, merging two institutions. With the integration, the Library of Technological Institute was formed. From 1923 the library was intensively developed by the direction of Géza Káplány. In 1949 the Library of Technology was formally merged with the Technical Documentation Centre. Since then the library started establishing liaison libraries in the country. In 1952 the name changed to National Technical Library. In 1956 the Library was moved into a representative building near the National Museum.
In 1982 with the introduction of electronic technologies and with the development of information exchange of cooperating libraries on multinational level the library took the name of National Technical Information Centre and Library. After several changes in the organization and supervision, in 2001, with the decision of the minister of education, most of the tasks, the staff and the whole collection of the National Technical Information Centre and Library were integrated into the Library of Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

===BME OMIKK, the integrated library===
After the integration of the two libraries the Main Reading Room were renovated and under it the Reading Room of Technical and Natural Sciences was created, three reading rooms in the central university building were formed, and a service tunnel connecting the library building with the underground storage facility and with the new reading rooms was constructed.
In 2011, following the erection of new university buildings in the new southern (Lágymányos) campus, a new service point of BME OMIKK was opened in building “I”.

==University rank==
The Budapest University of Technology and Economics ranked 250th in mechanical engineering by QS 2017 world ranking.

It takes the 322nd place among the world’s top 400 universities for engineering and technology, being the only university from Hungary that is listed in Quacquarelli Symonds ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bme.hu/news/20140919/BME_among_the_Worlds_Best_Universities_for_Engineering_and_Technology?language=en|title=BME among the World's Best Universities for Engineering and Technology - Budapest University of Technology and Economics|author=|date=|website=www.bme.hu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chicago Humanities Festival''' is a foundation which organizes an annual series of lectures, concerts, and films in [[Chicago]]. The main festival takes place in the first and second weeks of November. The festival was started in 1990 by the Illinois Humanities Council and became an independent foundation in 1997. The annual Festival is generally built around a theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/around-town/archive/Explore_Chicago_Humanities_Festival__.html|title=Explore Chicago Humanities Festival|work=NBC Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in 2012, the Festival theme was "America". Scheduled events included [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], [[Russ Feingold]], [[Adam Hochschild]], [[Nathan Gunn]],  [[Grant Achatz]], [[Philip Kotler]], [[Tricia Rose]], and [[Adam Gopnik]]. The Foundation also presents other shows and lectures during the remainder of the year. In 2012, past year-round events included [[Marina Abramović]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], and [[Etgar Keret]].  The theme for 2018 is Graphic.

==Mission==
The Chicago Humanities Festival is designed to create opportunities for people to explore the [[humanities]]. In addition to its annual Festival of the Humanities, it presents programs throughout the year on the study and enjoyment of the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagohumanities.org/About/Mission-And-History.aspx|title=About - Mission and History - Chicago Humanities Festival|work=chicagohumanities.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Under the aegis of the [[Illinois Humanities Council]] and its then-chairman Richard J. Franke, the notion of a "humanities day" was proposed, and then expanded into a "festival". [[Eileen Mackevich]] created the first Chicago Humanities Festival, a one-day affair, held on November 11, 1990 at the Art Institute of Chicago and Orchestra Hall, before an audience of 3,500 people. Eight programs addressed the theme Expressions of Freedom, including a keynote address by playwright [[Arthur Miller]]. Founding co-sponsor institutions included the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], and the [[University of Chicago]].

In 1997, the Festival formally separated from the Illinois Humanities Council and established itself as an independent, nonprofit organization.  Under Eileen Mackevich's leadership, by 2006, the independent Festival had expanded to nearly 150 programs over 16 days, in more than 30 venues, involving nearly 40 partner institutions and several hundred site volunteers, and attracting a combined audience of nearly 50,000.

A Children's Humanities Festival was introduced in 2000.  In addition, a year-round slate of education programs is devoted to supporting classroom teachers and students. The Festival also expanded its presence year-round, offering public lectures, readings, concerts, and special events that anticipate and build interest in the November Festival.

In 2006, [[Lawrence Weschler]] was appointed as the first artistic director of CHF,&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawrence Weschler|url=https://www.brown.edu/academics/english/lawrence-weschler|website=Depart of English|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 [[Stuart Flack]] joined as Executive Director.

In January 2010, [[Matti Bunzl]] was appointed as associate artistic director. In the fall, after four years with the festival, Lawrence Weschler became emeritus artistic director&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; and Matti Bunzl assumed the role of artistic director.  Bunzl left in 2014 for Vienna's Wien Museum.&lt;ref name="Bunzl"&gt;{{cite web|title=CHF Artistic Director Matti Bunzl Named Director of Vienna's Wien Museum|url=https://chicagohumanities.org/~/media/Files/PDFs/2014/CHF_MattiBunzl.ashx|website=Chicago Humanities Festival|publisher=Chicago Humanities Festival|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunzl2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caro|first1=Mark|title=Chicago Humanities Festival artistic director leaving for Vienna museum|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-matti-bunzl-leaving-chicago-humanities-festival-20140910-column.html|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alison Cuddy]] has been the artistic director since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicagohumanities.org/profile/bio?userid=5bea5976-dec1-4a47-884d-fca11a9bb698|title=Profile - Bio - Chicago Humanities Festival|website=chicagohumanities.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-alison-cuddy-chicago-humanities-festival-20170720-story.html|title=Alison Cuddy promoted to Chicago Humanities Festival artistic director|first=Steve|last=Johnson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages, Sights &amp; Sounds ==
In 2009, the Children's Humanities Festival was renamed to Stages, Sights &amp; Sounds to better reflect the full breadth of the spring festival. Stages, Sights &amp; Sounds is now{{when|date=March 2018}} in its third year. The spring festival's emphasis on performance provides contrast
to the fall festival's adult-centered programming, which includes more lectures and
discussions in exploration of a central theme that changes each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3456">'''Directed Individual Study''' or '''DIS''' is a [[college]], [[university]] or  [[college preparatory school]]&lt;ref&gt;https://schools.cranbrook.edu/ftpimages/209/download/2013-14-Upper-School-Curriculum-Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; level class providing a more in-depth and comprehensive study of a specific topic than is available in the [[classroom]]. 

Courses may be taken as electives. In some cases, a Directed Individual Study may be: 
*A [[professor]]-[[student]] rendition of a course that will not be offered again before a student graduates
*The college or university department does not have an established course on the subject area
*The student wishes to research an available course in more depth
*A course offered at another college or university that is not a part of the general curriculum.
*Courses that may be applied to satisfy the requirements for a [[Master's degree]]

== Requirements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In general,{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} a student should have or may have to acquire: 
*An earned overall [[GPA]] of 3.0 (B) or better{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
*An earned 90 hours toward graduation{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} 
*Have registered for a course load of no more than 15 semester hours{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
*The advance approval of the department head of the department offering the course, and the instructor{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
*Follow an approved course of study of prerequisite or courses{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Process==
A student identifies an area in which he or she wishes to undertake research and approaches a [[teacher|faculty member]] with expertise in that field to request a Directed Individual Study.

The student and instructor complete DIS Form and submit it to the Academic Coordinator who establishes the course in the registration system. The student often titles his/her own subject area.

The content and requirements of the course are worked out between each instructor and student. Generally, students should not expect a faculty member to agree to a Directed Individual Study unless they have had the student in a regular class and are familiar with that student. The faculty member develops a related [[syllabus]], for review and approval by the department chair and in some cases the [[Dean (education)]] of the college.

'''e-Pro''' (styled '''e-PRO''') is an [[Internet]] [[professional certification]] program approved by the [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR) for its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realtor.org/runivers.nsf/pages/designation?OpenDocument  NAR's list of its designations offered]&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the [[Canadian Real Estate Association]] (CREA) may also pursue the e-Pro certification and use the [[trademark|logo]] by completing the [[electronic learning|online learning]] program.

The four core areas of study (arranged in modules) are:
# Internet fundamentals (e.g., [[Internet service provider]]s, [[electronic mailing list]]s, [[domain name]]s, and [[domain name system|DNS]]).
# [[E-mail]] communication methods and strategies for clients/customers.
# The [[World Wide Web]] and its uses in developing a real estate business.
# Other technology ([[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[computer software|software]], both general purpose and [[real estate]] industry-specific).

The course material prior to 2010 was based on the ''Real Estate Technology Guide''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Mike; Klein, Saul; and [[John Reilly (lawyer)|Reilly, John]], ''Real Estate Technology Guide'', Dearborn Real Estate Education, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-7931-7732-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the entire e-Pro course was re-written by Bill Lublin and his team at the Social Media Marketing Institute. The new course was the winner of the 2011 Award for best educational offering from the Real Estate Educators Association (REEA).

'''Education Act 1918''' (8 &amp; 9 Geo. V c. 39), often known as the '''Fisher Act''', is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was drawn up by [[H. A. L. Fisher]]. Note that the "Education Act 1918" applied to England and Wales, whereas a separate "Education (Scotland) Act 1918" applied for Scotland.

This [[Raising Of School Leaving Age|raised the school leaving age]] to fourteen and planned to expand [[tertiary education]]. Other features of the 1918 Education Act included the provision of ancillary services ([[school health services|medical inspection]], [[nursery schools]], [[special needs education|centres for pupils with special needs]], etc.).

By the 1920s, the education of young children was of growing interest and concern to [[politician]]s, as well as to [[educationalist]]s. As a result of this rising level of public debate, the Government of the day referred a number of topics for enquiry to the Consultative Committee of the Board of Education,&lt;ref&gt;Brehony, K. J. (1994). "The 'School Masters Parliament: the origins and formation of the Consultative Committee of the Board of Education 1868–1916." History of Education 23(2): 171–193.&lt;/ref&gt; then chaired by Sir [[William Henry Hadow]]. Altogether the [[Hadow Committee]] published three very important reports – 1926, 1931 and 1933.

These reports led to major changes in the structure of primary education. In particular, they resulted in separate and distinctive educational practice for children aged 5–7 (infants) and those aged 7–11 (juniors).

The Reports recommended child centred approaches and class sizes of no more than thirty. These recommendations marked a triumph of 'progressive' educational thought and practice over the more 'traditional' ideas and proved to be popular with many policy makers and teachers alike.

There have been several educational controversies in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==Eileen Flynn==
In 1982 [[Eileen Flynn]], a teacher, was sacked from her teaching post for being pregnant while unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0911/1221039067831.html |title=Eileen Flynn, teacher sacked in 1982, dies |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=6 April 2009 |date=11 September 2008 |last=Carbery |first=Genevieve }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dunboyne Controversy==
In 2002, Tomás Ó Dulaing, the headmaster of [[Gaelscoil]] Thúlach na nÓg in [[Dunboyne]], [[County Meath]] was dismissed after a controversy over religious education in the school.&lt;ref name="independent-editorial-31-july-2002"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/this-sad-school-story-301387.html This sad school story], Editorial, [[Irish Independent]], 31 July 2002, retrieved 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="it-bruton-remark"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2002/0418/breaking46.htm Meath school row needs national debate – Bruton], Breaking News, [[The Irish Times]], 4 April 2002, retrieved 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-john-carr-31-july-2002"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/a-school-principal-sacked-for-a-principle-301390.html A school principal sacked for a principle], John Carr, [[Irish Independent]], 31 July 2002, retrieved 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The school is interdenominational, with education in both [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Church of Ireland]] faiths.&lt;ref name="independent-editorial-31-july-2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-john-carr-31-july-2002"/&gt; Tomás Ó Dulaing arranged for religious education classes to take place outside regular school hours after consulting with parents and management, but the schools patron body objected and the board of management sacked him. He was sacked for mis-conduct following his un authorised letter sent to parents of the children, this dismissal was upheld by the labour court after he withdrew his appeal.&lt;ref name="independent-editorial-31-july-2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-john-carr-31-july-2002"/&gt;

==Balbriggan Controversy==
In 2007, controversy broke when a school in [[Balbriggan]] was reported to have only black pupils, all Irish-born, leading to accusations of de facto segregation in the school system.&lt;ref name="independent-4-sep-2007"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/catholic-education-race-row-brewing-1070713.html Catholic education race row brewing], [[Irish Independent]], 4 September 2007, retrieved 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some claimed it was an unintended consequence of the school enrolment policies, others blamed the state failing to plan for growth in the area.&lt;ref name="suhaila-kassim"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/equal-education-for-all-children--as-long-as-theyre-catholic-1116922.html Equal education for all children – as long as they're Catholic], Suhaila Kassim, [[Irish Independent]], 7 October 2007, retrieved 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="principals-fury"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/principals-fury-at-racist-slurs-in-schoolplace-crisis-1073697.html Principals' fury at 'racist' slurs in school-place crisis], [[Irish Independent]], 7 September 2007, retrieved 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the shortage of school places, an [[Educate Together]] school that was scheduled to open in 2008 was opened a year ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="educationmatters"&gt;[http://www.educationmatters.ie/2007/09/24/emergency-national-schools-opens-in-balbriggan/ Emergency national school opens in Balbriggan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118223526/http://www.educationmatters.ie/2007/09/24/emergency-national-schools-opens-in-balbriggan/ |date=18 November 2007 }}, Education Matters, 24 September 2007, retrieved 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drogheda Controversy==
During the 2009 Leaving Certificate examination, a school in [[Drogheda]] [[Co. Louth]] handed out English Paper Two instead of English Paper One. As a result, the original date for English Paper Two was reset to the following Saturday with a different, contingency paper.&lt;ref name="IncorrectEnglishPaperTwo"&gt;http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0726/leavingcert.html{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Report on Leaving Cert error published&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant Schools grant controversy==

==Leaving Certificate 2010 cheating controversy==
In June 2010 a student alleged on [[boards.ie]] that cheating in the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] exams was happening in her school.&lt;ref name="it-cheating-allegations"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/0615/1224272522104.html

|author=Seán Flynn &amp; Gráinne Faller
|date=6 June 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Examinations Commission confirmed that it was investigating the allegations.&lt;ref name="it-cheating-allegations"/&gt;

On the 13th June 2017 it was confirmed that someone somehow took a picture of Irish Paper 2 and was sent to a Facebook group of about 3000 teachers. The State Examinations Commission is now ongoing the investigation.

==Ban of Muslim Veil==
At the start of the 2010–2011 term there was controversy over an announcement that a number of Catholic run second level schools in Ireland have imposed a ban on Muslim girls covering their faces with a full veil,&lt;ref&gt;[http://vladtepesblog.com/?p=26071 Ireland’s Catholic schools ban full Muslim veil] 24 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; although head scarfs are allowed.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Edward C. Hayes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Edward Hayes]] --&gt;
'''Edward Cary Hayes''' (1868–1928) was a pioneer in American [[sociology]] and was a founder and president of the [[American Sociological Association]].

Edward Cary Hayes was born on February 10, 1868 in [[Lewiston, Maine]] to Professor [[Benjamin Francis Hayes]].  He received a bachelor's degree from [[Bates College]] and then studied at the [[Cobb Divinity School]].  He then became a pastor in Augusta, Maine until 1896 (his views clashed with the congregation) when he became a Dean at [[Keuka College]]. In 1899 he enrolled at the [[University of Chicago]] to study philosophy but soon began to study sociology.  He studied under [[Albion Small]] and alongside [[George Herbert Mead]], [[John Dewey]] and [[James Tufts]]. Hayes then spent a year in Germany at the [[University of Berlin]], where he studied with [[Georg Schmoller]], [[Adolph Wagner]], [[Friedrich Paulsen]], [[Alfred Vierkandt]] and [[Georg Simmel]]. Hayes was one of the pioneers promoting in bringing sociology into the American educational system.  He received his doctorate in 1902. [[Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Chase Regatta]]   

Hayes went on to teach at [[Miami University]] in Oxford, Ohio and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]].  He wrote many books and articles including, ''Introduction to the Study of Sociology'' (1915) and ''Sociology and Ethics'' (1921).  Hayes attended the first meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1905 and became one of its most influential founding members. He served on the Society’s Committee of Ten, selected to create a universal model for schools’ undergraduate introductory sociology courses. Hayes was elected Second Vice President of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1919, First Vice President in 1920, and became its eleventh President in 1921.  He died in [[Urbana, Illinois]] in 1928.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4489">'''Els Goulmy''' (born 27 November 1946, [[The Hague]]) is an eminent professor of transplantation biology, especially regarding [[minor histocompatibility antigen]], at [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://leidsewetenschappers.leidenuniv.nl/show.php3?medewerker_id=336 Leiden University website]&lt;/ref&gt; Goulmy is an expert in the area of tissue typing and belongs internationally to the absolute top of her discipline. She was awarded the [[Spinozaprice]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/spinoza+prize/spinoza+laureates/overview+by+year/2002 |title=NWO Spinoza Prize 2002 |publisher=Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Goulmy did groundbreaking research on the role of antigens in organ and stem cell transplantation. She is the pioneer of the so-called Minor Transplantation Antigens in men. Minor antigens can induce strong immune reactions. She discovered the H-Y minor antigen encoded by the Y-chromosome (1976) and the autosomally encoded HA-1 antigen (1983). She then described the polymorphism and the population frequencies of several autosomal minor antigens. Crucial was her work on the differential expression of minor antigens showing either overall expression on all body cells, such as the male specific H-Y antigens, or restricted expression on solely blood and blood cancer cells, such as HA-1. Goulmy was the first to describe the chemical structure of the human minor antigens (1995). In 1996 she demonstrated the crucial role of minor antigens in the outcome of organ and stem cell transplantation. In 1997 she launched new concepts for immunotherapy of blood cancer applying the blood and cancer cell specific minor antigens, such as HA-1, for tumor specific treatment. The basis for the translation ‘from the lab to the clinic’ of these cancer and patient specific treatment was laid in her laboratory. Hereby minor antigens, such as HA-1, are used as ‘vaccin’ to boost the anti-blood cancer reaction in the patients' body.

==Career==

Els Goulmy has a remarkable career. After secondary school and an education for  laboratory technician, she worked as a clinical-chemical technician in Nijmegen, Switzerland and Norway. In 1972 she started as research technician at the University Hospital in Leiden in the department of Jon van Rood. Goulmy has a ''Master en Immunology'' (cum laude 1984) and a ''Doctorat d’Etat  es Sciences Naturelles'' (summa cum laude 1985) of the Paris University ‘Paris VI Pierre et Marie Curie'. In 1990 she worked as visiting scientist in the Department of Cell Biology of the Stanford University School of Medicine (USA). Goulmy wrote over 250 scientific articles among which several in Nature and Science. For her scientific pioneering work, she received nationally and internationally more than a dozen prices and awards among which the Spinoza Prize of the Netherlands Organization of Scientific Research. 
Goulmy was active in many national and international scientific advisory committees, among which the KNAW, the European Research Council and Institut Pasteur. Goulmy was one of the founders of the Dutch Network of Women Professors (2001) and their president from 2001-2012. (Landelijk Netwerk Vrouwelijke Hoogleraren).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lnvh.nl/site/Het-LNVH/bestuur-bureau/els-goulmy Dutch Network of Female Professors website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109132153/http://www.lnvh.nl/site/Het-LNVH/bestuur-bureau/els-goulmy |date=2011-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities (KHMW)

Since November 11, 2011 Goulmy is an emeritus professor. Following her farewell speech, she was honoured with the distinction 'Knight in the order of the Netherlands Lion'.

'''William Ewart John Farvis''' (12 December 1911 – 12 October 2005) was a pioneering [[electronic engineering|electronics engineer]] and educator. His war-time service was in [[electronic countermeasure]]s. In his subsequent career at the [[University of Edinburgh]] he initiated the Department of Electrical Engineering, establishing its capabilities in [[Semiconductor device|silicon device]] processing and enhancing industrial interactions through [[Wolfson Microelectronics]].

== Education ==
Ewart Farvis was born in [[Bristol]] and schooled there. He then studied at the [[University of Bristol]], graduating BSc (Eng) in 1936 with First Class Honours in [[Electrical engineering|Electrical Engineering]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Career ==
In 1937, he was appointed Lecturer in [[Electrical engineering|Electrical Engineering]] at [[Swansea University|University College, Swansea]] until called away to war service in the scientific [[civil service]]. Here he first extended the [[Chain Home|chain-home]] radars to detect low flying targets. He subsequently met with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s scientific adviser, [[R V Jones]], and assisted in detecting the signals from the enemy navigator aids used to direct bombers on to target. Farvis led the interception group, with [[Martin Ryle]] in charge of the associated radio jamming group, all coordinated by [[Robert Cockburn (physicist)|Robert Cockburn]].

One of Farvis’ major wartime achievements was to counteract a sophisticated new [[Germany|German]] navigation aid, "Benito", with [[Alec Reeves|Alex Harley Reeves]], the later inventor of [[Pulse-code modulation|pulse code modulation]] telephony. Farvis went to London with the new [[Radio jamming|radio jammer]] and, on listening to the German bombers’ radio telephone traffic, he noted that they suspected equipment malfunction, rather than intentional jamming. After the war, Farvis debriefed these German equipment designers.

Academic appointments at The [[University of Edinburgh]] followed in 1948 as a lecturer in Applied Electricity. Here his research focussed on the then fashionable topic of gaseous electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=D.H.|year=1954|title=Electron groups in the helium negative glow|url=|journal=Physical Review|volume=96|pages=536–538|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was closely associated in [[Ionosphere|ionospheric]] research with [[Edward appleton Layer|Edward Appleton]] when he was University Principal. In 1961, Farvis became the first Professor and Head of the new Department of Electrical Engineering. Following this, his interests moved into the rapidly expanding field of [[solid-state electronics]]. In 1964 he took the bold move to construct a centre for solid-state devices and [[materials science]] research at Edinburgh and constructed the first university cleanrooms for [[Semiconductor|silicon semiconductor device]] fabrication. he was an early pioneer in identifying the significance of semiconductor transistors for application in future electronic systems.

In 1969 Farvis set up of the Wolfson Microelectronics Liaison Unit (WMLU), coinciding with the first appointment of part-time paid visiting Professors in a UK university. WMLU later expanded into an independent company, [[Wolfson Microelectronics]], under Professor David Milne before being acquired by [[Cirrus Logic]].

Many of his post-war innovations in the undergraduate curriculum were tried out at Edinburgh before catching on elsewhere, including: open book examinations; individual experimental project work and in-depth dissertation writing. He was innovative in moving the final honours’ examinations from June to January, to improve the student focus on project work.

== Committee activities ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Ewart Farvis had a record of service in national policy-forming via: the Electrical Industries' Training Board, the [[Science and Engineering Research Council|Science Research Council]] and the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]]. Farvis served on numerous committees: the [[Engineering Council|Council of Engineering Institutions]] Board of Moderators; [[UNESCO]] International Working Group on Continuing Education; and as President of the Education &amp; Training Committee of the Fédération Européenne d‘Associations Nationales d’Ingénieurs [[FEANI]] from 1974- 1977.

He retired in 1977 after 29 years of University service. He was elected to Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1958 and RefReded a [[CBE]] in 1978.

The '''Foster Business Library''' is the business [[library]] at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. As part of the university [[University of Washington Libraries|system of libraries]], it serves the 3,500 students, faculty, and staff of the [[University of Washington Michael G. Foster School of Business|Foster School of Business]]. The 21,500 square-foot facility, which opened in 1997, is located under a garden, beneath an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} skylight, on two floors, connected with PACCAR Hall and adjacent to Dempsey Hall and the Bank of America Executive Education Center.

==Location==
The library is located below-ground among the complex of buildings that comprise the [[Foster School of Business]]. The main entrance is located on the first floor of PACCAR Hall with an accessible entrance on the lower (basement) level. Previous to a 2009 renovation, the library's main entrance had been through the Bank of America Executive Education Center.

==Name ==
The library is named in honor of Albert O. and Evelyn W. Foster. A 1928 graduate of the University of Washington Business School, Albert Foster founded Seattle-based investment banking firm Foster &amp; Marshall in 1938. Evelyn Foster was a 1932 graduate of the University of Washington. Albert and Evelyn were the parents of Michael G. Foster, for whom the Foster School of Business is named. Together, the Fosters established the Foster Foundation in 1984

== History ==
Made possible by a $3 million gift from the Foster Foundation in 1990, construction began in March 1995 with the library opening on June 23, 1997. A major renovation from 2009 to 2012 reoriented the library entrance through PACCAR Hall and increased seating and group study space.

==Inside Foster Library==

=== Hours ===
During the fall, winter, and spring quarters, the library is open Mondays through Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., on Fridays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 12 noon to 5 p.m. on Saturdays, and 1 to 5 p.m. on Sundays. Hours are extended during exam weeks and shortened during the summer quarter, university holidays, and between quarters.

===Study Areas===

'''Framhaldsskólinn í Austur-Skaftafellssýslu''' (often abbreviated '''FAS''') is a secondary school located in [[Höfn]], southeast [[Iceland]].  It was founded in 1987 by the Icelandic government and municipalities in [[Austur-Skaftafellssýsla]].  The first 15 years, it was located in Nesjaskóli, in Nes, a nearby rural area, but was moved to a new building, Nýheimar, in 2002.  The school has about 200 students, mostly locals, but distance education is also quite common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Um skólann - fas.is|url=http://www.fas.is/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=18|publisher=Framhaldsskólinn í Austur-Skaftafellssýslu|accessdate=14 February 2014|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current principal is Eyjólfur Guðmundsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Starfsfólk - fas.is|url=http://www.fas.is/images/stories/frettir_h13/starf_fas_h13.pdf|publisher=Framhaldsskólinn í Austur-Skaftafellssýslu|accessdate=14 February 2014|language=Icelandic|format=pdf document, 116 kb.|quote=Look for the Icelandic word "Skólameistari"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frances M. Hill''' (July 10, 1799—August 5, 1884) was an American missionary and educator who moved to Greece during the [[Greek War of Independence]] and established the first educational facilities for girls in Greece. She and her husband were the first foreign missionaries sent by the Episcopal Church in the United States to serve abroad. While her husband worked to establish their mission, Hill supervised the girls' educational facilities and ran the mission during his absences. After her retirement from the mission, she founded a teacher training academy and continued to administer the school until her death.

==Early life==
Francis Maria Mulligan was born on July 10, 1799 in [[New York City]], New York to Elizabeth (née Winter) and [[John W. Mulligan]]. She was the eldest of nine children, three boys and six girls, in the family. Her father was a prominent attorney in New York City and her grandfather [[Hercules Mulligan]] was an Irish immigrant who had served in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. He was a familiar of both [[George Washington]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]].{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=191}} Educated at home with her siblings in the family mansion on Cedar Street across the street from the [[Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church#1731 Middle Collegiate Church|Old Dutch Church]], Mulligan was trained as was typical for cultured and refined young women in the period.{{sfn|Kimber|Flichtner|1884|p=600}} On April 26, 1821, she married [[John Henry Hill]], a local banker.{{sfn|The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society|2015}} Hill was a Sunday school teacher at [[St. George's Episcopal Church (Manhattan)]] and her husband was the superintendent of the Sunday school. In 1829, John retired from banking to enter the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]].{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=191}}{{sfn|The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society|2015}} When he was ordained in 1830, the couple were posted to Greece,{{sfn|The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society|2015}} the first foreign mission undertaken by the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=191}}

==Career==
On October 1, 1830, the couple set sail along with Mr. Bingham, a printer and the Rev. John Jacob Robertson and his wife Julia. They arrived in [[Malta]] on November 16.{{sfn|Choules|Smith|1837|pp=553-554}} Robertson had been the minister who had originally proposed a foreign mission to the church.{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=191}} From Malta, they proceeded that same day to [[Smyrna]] making their way to [[Tenos]],{{sfn|Choules|Smith|1837|p=554}} where they would remain until spring due to the ongoing conflict in Athens during the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek struggle]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=191}} On May 26, 1831 the group left the island and made their way to [[Athens]], their original destination. By July 18, they had found suitable accommodations for Hill to establish a [[Hill Memorial School|school for girls]], as Athens was in ruins due to the war.{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=191}}{{sfn|Choules|Smith|1837|p=554}} She began with twenty pupils, who studied in the basement of the house she and her husband occupied{{sfn|Choules|Smith|1837|p=554}} in [[Plaka]], near the [[Ancient Agora of Athens]].{{sfn|The Hellenic Archives of Scientific Instruments|2010}} Within two months enrollment at the school had increased to 167 pupils,{{sfn|Stephens|1839|p=18}} ranging in age from three to eighteen years old.{{sfn|Choules|Smith|1837|p=554}} It was the only school in Greece offering education to women at that time{{sfn|Stephens|1839|p=18}} and from the beginning, the girls' schools were under the direction of Hill, while her husband supervised the boys' education.{{sfn|''Annual report of the Board of Missions''|1836|p=82}}

While the two husbands returned to Smyrna on missionary business, in September, Hill and Mrs. Robertson remained in Athens and taught at the school. Robertson was in charge of teaching [[sewing|needle skills]] to the girls, while Hill attended to their recitation and reading skills,{{sfn|Choules|Smith|1837|p=555}} using the Bible as their main text book. The girls also studied [[geography]], spelling, writing and mathematics.{{sfn|Choules|Smith|1837|p=559}} The girls were divided into three groups, the elementary school, a trade school to teach those students who would need to earn a living industrial skills and a teacher training school.{{sfn|Choules|Smith|1837|p=560}} Within eighteen months, Mrs. Robertson withdrew from active participation because of her growing family, leaving Hill, as the only teacher for girls at the facility.{{sfn|Hale|1834|p=448}} Hill's goal was to use local girls to serve as [[Student teacher|under-teachers]] to assist with instruction; however, as there were only two schools teaching girls in Greece, the other being on the island of [[Syros]], she found she had to train the teachers before she could employ them.{{sfn|Hale|1834|p=449}} By 1834, Hill had received the approval of the Greek government for the [[normal school]], the only such facility in operation.{{sfn|Hale|1834|p=450}} Three assistant teachers, Elizabeth and Frederica Mulligan and Mary B. Baldwin had been sent by the Missionary Board and were assisting with teaching the school in 1836.{{sfn|''Annual report of the Board of Missions''|1836|pp=81, 85}}

In 1837, Hill founded a boarding school for paying students of wealthy Greek families. The students were housed in a wing of the mission house and had 70 enrollees. Continuing her supervision of all the female students, Hill also oversaw the boys' education during 1841, when her husband took an extended trip to the United States. During that time, she also maintained all the mission duties.{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=192}} In 1842, an attack against the mission and Rev. Hill was launched by an editor of ''The Age'', a newspaper in Athens. Investigation by an ecclesiastical commission appointed by the Synod of the Kingdom, cleared the Hills of any anti-Greek actions, as were alleged by the paper. The editor then attacked the Synod, as well as the Archbishop of Argos, for support of the missionaries and its editor was prosecuted by the government.{{sfn|Harris|Cooke|1843|p=286}} The strain of managing the mission and the subsequent allegations of wrongdoing caused Hill to suspend the school for girls for the remainder of the year, retiring to the countryside to regain her health. She was sent an official communique from the Secretary of State, of the government's satisfaction with her efforts to educate Greek girls and returned to the school in November{{sfn|Harris|Cooke|1843|p=287}} with a class of 500 students.{{sfn|Harris|Cooke|1843|p=288}} These students were the pupils of the kindergarten, elementary school for girls and the industrial training classes for girls. The boarding school, normal school, and boys' schools were not reopened.{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=192}}

In late 1843, the Mission Board determined that they would suspend the mission in Athens, but an onslaught of support from organizations and individuals reversed their decision, allowing the girls' school to continue.{{sfn|Dana Jr.|1844|pp=360-368}} Hill continued to manage the school until her husband retired from mission work in 1869. Rather than stop teaching, she then organized the Hill Institute, a private normal school. She continued to assist Marian Muir, who had taken over operation of the mission schools.{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=192}}

==Death and legacy==
Hill died on August 5, 1884 in Athens, two years after her husband's death. They were both buried in the Protestant Cemetery of Athens and marble monument to them was erected at the grave site by the City of Athens.{{sfn|Hero|1971|p=192}} Her niece, Bessie Masson, took over the administration of the Hill Memorial School{{sfn|The Hellenic Archives of Scientific Instruments|2010}} which was still in operation in 2015 as the oldest continuously-operating school founded by missionaries in the country.{{sfn|''GRReporter''|2015}}

'''Goal theory''' is the label used in [[educational psychology]] to discuss research into [[motivation]] to learn. [[Objective (goal)|Goals]] of learning are thought to be a key factor influencing the level of a student's [[intrinsic motivation]].

==Main axes of goal theory==
Research in goal theory has identified the following dichotomies:

===Task/ego involvement===
A student is described as task-involved when he is interested in the task for its own qualities. This is associated with higher intrinsic motivation. Task-involved students are less threatened by failure because their own ego is not tied up in the success of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicholls|first=John G.|last2=Cobb|first2=Paul|last3=Wood|first3=Terry|last4=Yackel|first4=Erna|last5=Patashnick|first5=Michael|date=1990-01-01|title=Assessing Students' Theories of Success in Mathematics: Individual and Classroom Differences|jstor=749138|journal=Journal for Research in Mathematics Education|volume=21|issue=2|pages=109–122|doi=10.2307/749138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A student who is ego-involved will be seeking to perform the task to boost their own ego, for the praise that completing the task might attract, or because completing the task confirms their own [[self-concept]] (e.g. clever, strong, funny etc...). Ego-involved students can become very anxious or discouraged in the face of failure, because such failure challenges their self-concept.

===Approach/avoidance goals===
Not all goals are directed towards ''approaching'' a desirable outcome (e.g., demonstrating competence). Goals can also be directed towards ''avoiding'' an undesirable outcome (e.g., avoiding the demonstration of incompetence to others).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11031-006-9028-7 | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 111–116 | last = Elliot | first = Andrew | title = The Hierarchical Model of Approach-Avoidance Motivation | journal = Motivation and Emotion| date = 2006-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that approach goals contribute positively to intrinsic motivation whereas avoidance goals do not.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Performance goals===
A performance goal is a goal focused on gaining favorable judgement or avoiding unfavorable judgements by others. Performance goals focuses on ensuring that one's performance is noticeably superior to others. This motivation to outperform others is what enables the person to strive for more achievement in and outside of school and work as well.

====In the classroom====
Performance goals can heavily impact adolescents in the classroom. This deep desire to out-do those around oneself can alter classroom ideologies in each student; some for the better and sometimes for the worse. For the betterment of performance in class, performance goals lead students to place a greater importance on GPA and class rankings. This in turn, leads to better academic performance. Along with a focus on grades, students see exams as a competitive competition that also allows them to enhance their performance.&lt;ref name="Crouzevillae"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1027/1016-9040/a000281 | volume = 22 | pages = 73–82 | last = Crouzevillae | first = Marie | title = Performance Goals and Task Performance Integrative Considerations on the Distraction Hypothesis | journal = European Phycologist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant advantage in academic performance in students who possess performance goals in the classroom. It also generates a healthy form of competition between peers enhancing peer relationships and grades among all of those particular students.&lt;ref name="Midgley"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 93 | pages = 77–86 | last = Midgley | first = C. | title = Performance - Approach Goals: Good for What, For Whom, and Under What Conditions, and at What Cost? | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.93.1.77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance goals lead to a strong sense of commitment that can appear in the classroom and also outside of the classroom as well. The student exemplifies a strong relationship with the goal of doing better than others, and this leads to a longterm commitment to achieving that goal.&lt;ref name="Bipp"/&gt; On the other hand, there can be extensive downsides that can come along with focusing entirely on out-performing others. Students can feel accomplished when they receive a better grade on the test than everyone else, but that can simply be linked to memorization and not full comprehension.&lt;ref name="Midgley"/&gt; There comes a conflict when the student attempts to fully comprehend new information on top of trying to focus on doing better than those around them. The student may not be able to handle the combined pressure of learning and constant competition; one of those two variables must alter. Other concerns involve stress on the student to try to keep up with those around them, tension in the classroom as a student struggles with asking questions for fear of seeming incapable to others, and anxiety and frustration with all of those variables on top of each other.&lt;ref name="Bipp"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1548051816641874 | volume = 23 | pages = 469–485 | last = Bipp | first = Tanja | title = The Effect of Subconscious Performance Goals on Academic Performance | journal = Journal of Experimental Education }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other developments==
Other researchers have adopted a more complex perspective on goals, arguing that there are many different kinds of goals individuals can have in achievement settings. For instance, Ford and Nichols (1987) extended this point of view into within-person goals and person-environment goals, which lays equal significance on learners per se and learning environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Humans as Self-Constructing Living Systems: Putting the Framework to Work|last=Ford|first=ME.|last2=Nichols|first2=CW.|publisher=Erlbaum|year=1987|isbn=|location=Hillsdale|pages=289–311|chapter=A taxonomy of human goals and some possible application|doi=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, all the theories are devoted to studying the types of goals as well as their impact on multiple facets of learning. In other words, research that takes goals as a dependent variable remains scarce. Such a strategy to take goals for granted could be defended on the grounds that one cannot deal with all aspects of so complex an issue and that the theorists possibly feel the question of how goals originate was not relevant to the models they developed.

On the other hand, young children are frequently ignored within this area, based on the assumption that they might not have a clear pattern of setting a goal or they even do not own a goal when starting a task. Klahr argued that although there are large adult-child differences in overall problem-solving performance, even preschoolers have rudimentary forms of strategies such as means-ends analysis that rely on the use of goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, expanding the subject selection range and focusing on the process of goal-setting are expected to be the two main tasks in future research direction.

'''Grace Thorp Gemberling''' (July 31, 1903 – December 26, 1997) was an American artist known for the broad range of her subjects in paintings having a pronounced psychological as well as aesthetic impact.&lt;ref name="Gemberling bio Chalfont"/&gt; One critic said they conveyed a mood that was "ethereal, bold and engaged."&lt;ref name="Gemberling bio Chalfont"/&gt; Another said her work showed "a disciplined hand and a romantic eye" together with "a magical color sense."&lt;ref name="2001 Feb Morning Call"/&gt; Known for her control of detail and successful handling of line and blocks of color,&lt;ref name="1938 Jan Philadelphia Art News"/&gt; she was said to paint in a modernist style that stayed clear of abstraction and was remembered by a teacher and fellow artist as "the finest woman painter in Philadelphia during the 20s and 30s."&lt;ref name="Gemberling bio Chalfont"/&gt;
 
==Early life and training==
Born in Philadelphia, Gemberling grew up in that city and at a farm her family owned in [[Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania]]. She developed an interest in art while a student at [[Friends' Central School]]. With the encouragement of her parents, she enrolled in the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1920 and for the next three years she studied under [[Daniel Garber]], Hugh Breckenridge,{{refn|group=note|Hugh H. Breckenridge (1870-1937) was a prominent Philadelphia painter and teacher. Educated in the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, he made portraits in the academic style, landscapes that showed a strong influence of neo-impressionism, and later works that are fully abstract.&lt;ref name="Sullivan Goss Breckenridge"/&gt;  He began teaching at the Academy in 1894 and was appointed dean of instructors in 1934.&lt;ref name="National Academy 2004"/&gt; }} and [[Arthur Beecher Carles|Arthur Carles]].&lt;ref name="Gemberling bio Chalfont"/&gt; Showing great promise as a student, she received the valuable [[Cresson Traveling Scholarship]] in both 1923&lt;ref name="1923 Jun Art News"/&gt; and 1924.&lt;ref name="1924 May Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Cresson Traveling Scholarship was created in 1902 by Emlen Cresson and his wife in honor of their son, an artist who died young. Winners were chosen from among students who were 35 or younger and who had been studying at the Academy for at least 96 weeks.  They were given advice on where in Europe to travel and what to see but were free to make their own itineraries.&lt;ref name="1952 May Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; In 1923 and again in 1924 Gemberling was awarded $700 for summer travel. During the first trip she and her mother visited France, England, and Italy&lt;ref name="1923 Passport Grace"/&gt; and in second they expanded their tour, visiting the same countries plus Spain, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Austria.&lt;ref name="1924 Passport Grace"/&gt; }}

==Career==

Gemberling's career as a professional artist began after she returned from European travel in 1924 and decided not to continue attending classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. When in 1926 she exhibited with the Philadelphia Water Color Club, a reviewer said her painting, "Marine" was "gorgeous,"&lt;ref name="1926 Nov Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|In 1900 a group of painters founded the Philadelphia Water Color Club to promote the medium and give publicity to watercolorists. With the cooperation and support of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the club held annual exhibitions of works on paper by members and other artists. As well as watercolors, the exhibitions included pastel, pencil, and charcoal works as well as illustrations and graphic arts. It used purchase funds to make annual additions to its collections. The group continues to exist, now known as the Philadelphia Water Color Society. Prominent former members include [[Cecilia Beaux]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[John Singer Sargent]] and [[Maxfield Parrish]].&lt;ref name="1929 Jan American Magazine of Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Water Color Society"/&gt;}} and later that year when she exhibited at the [[The Plastic Club|Plastic Club]], the same reviewer praised a portrait of hers, "Anna Ruth," as "nicely spontaneous."&lt;ref name="1926 Nov 21 Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; Thereafter, her paintings appeared frequently in Philadelphia exhibitions and quite often received favorable notice.{{refn|group=note|Thus, for example, she received another favorable notice in the Plastic Club's exhibitions of 1929&lt;ref name="1929 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; and 1930,&lt;ref name="1930 Mar Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; the Women's University Club in 1938,&lt;ref name="1938 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; and exhibitions at Friends' Central in 1942&lt;ref name="1942 May Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; and 1943,&lt;ref name="1943 Apr Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; and exhibitions at the Academy in 1938&lt;ref name="1938 Feb NYT"/&gt; and 1943,&lt;ref name="1943 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; }} From 1930 onwards, she showed in other East Coast locations including the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art|Corcoran]] Biennials of 1930&lt;ref name="1930 Dec NYT"/&gt; and 1935 in Washington, D.C.;&lt;ref name="1935 Oct Rochester Democrat"/&gt; the Salons of America&lt;ref name="1932 Apr NYT"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Founded in 1922 by [[Hamilton Easter Field]], Salons of America aimed to give artists an alternative to the [[Society of Independent Artists]] whose financial and publicity methods he found objectionable.

Critics singled out specific paintings for discussion. Regarding "Otakar Sevcik" C. H. Bonte of the ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' wrote: "Her so called 'sketch' of Professor Otakar Sevcik (1852-1936) is a creation of so much life, charm and dignity of coloring as to constitute a finished portrait." Of her "Amusement Park" Edward Alden Jewell of the ''New York Times'' wrote: "Grace Thorp Gemberling's "Amusement Park" young ladies look quite as indisposed as ever. Those who pin their admiration exclusively to subject will doubtless turn away from protagonists so depressing, but the judicious can hardly fail to admire this painter's astuteness in constructing a picture."&lt;ref name="1933 Aug NYT"/&gt;
[[File:Gemberling Landscape.jpg|right|thumb|Grace Gemberling, Untitled (landscape), undated, oil on canvas, height: 28 inches, width: 35 inches]]
In reviewing an untitled landscape Scott Chalfont wrote in an exhibition catalog: "So characteristic of Gemberling's finest talent, in this landscape she takes a scene and makes it her own. From the wispy trees, to the dark skies and vibrant houses, the contrasts create a compelling painting."&lt;ref name="2011 Gemberling catalog"/&gt; In 1938 a critic wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As personal as are the creations of Grace Gemberling, there is extraordinary variety in her canvasses. The artist's delineation of well-worn houses is unique as her interpretation of them in color, and there is nothing we like more than the simple but fruitful wedding of line and color mass. Control of detail is, in this case, an additional gift. Canvases may be flooded with subsidiary graphic or pigmental themes, but there is never confusion. Grace Gemberling is one of Philadelphia's most promising painters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
[[File:Gemberling Colonial Stairway.jpg|left|thumb|Grace Gemberling, "Colonial Stairway," about 1943, oil on canvas, height: 35 inches, width: 26 inches]]
Concerning the painting "Colonial Stairway" Chalfont wrote: "One of the more realistically interpreted compositions by Gemberling, this is clearly the "Montmorenci" Stair Hall at Winterthur Museum. Wonder- fully rendered, this painting invites the viewer into the opulence of the interior and demonstrates her deep ap- preciation for the Winterthur Museum and the impressive collection within."&lt;ref name="2011 Gemberling catalog"/&gt;

===Exhibitions and awards===

The exhibitions in which Gemberling participated were mostly non-commercial. The two organizations that showed her work more than any others were both ones where she had been a student: She contributed paintings, watercolors, and drawings to nearly all the annual exhibitions held by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts between 1927 and 1943{{refn|group=note|Her work was included in PAFA exhibitions in 1927,&lt;ref name="1927 Jan American Magazine of Art"/&gt; 1930,&lt;ref name="1930 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1931,&lt;ref name="1931 American Art Annual"/&gt; 1932,&lt;ref name="1932 Jan NYT"/&gt; 1934,&lt;ref name="1934 Jan NYT"/&gt; 1936,&lt;ref name="1936 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1938,&lt;ref name="1938 Feb NYT"/&gt; 1939,&lt;ref name="1939 Arts Magazine"/&gt; 1940,&lt;ref name="1940 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; and 1943.&lt;ref name="1943 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt;}} and to many of the annual exhibitions held at Friends' Central School between 1934 and 1955.{{refn|group=note|She contributed paintings to exhibitions at Friends' Central in 1934,&lt;ref name="1934 Friends Intelligencer"/&gt; 1936,&lt;ref name="1936 Apr Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1941,&lt;ref name="1941 May Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1942,&lt;ref name="1942 May Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1943,&lt;ref name="1943 May Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1948,&lt;ref name="1948 May Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1949,&lt;ref name="1949 May Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; and 1955.&lt;ref name="1955 Feb Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; }} Other non-commercial organizations that showed her work on multiple occasions included the Plastic Club of Philadelphia,{{refn|group=note|Gemberling showed at the Plastic Club in 1926,&lt;ref name="1926 Nov 21 Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1929,&lt;ref name="1929 Jan Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; 1930,&lt;ref name="1930 Mar Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; and 1931.&lt;ref name="1931 Oct Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; }} the Corcoran Gallery of Art,{{refn|group=note| She showed in Corcoran Gallery exhibitions of modern American paintings in 1930,&lt;ref name="1930 Dec NYT"/&gt; 1935,&lt;ref name="1935 Corcoran"/&gt; and 1937.&lt;ref name="Gemberling bio Chalfont"/&gt; }} the North Shore Art Association,{{refn|group=note|Her paintings were included in North Shore exhibitions in 1932&lt;ref name="1932 Aug NYT"/&gt; and 1933.&lt;ref name="1933 Aug NYT"/&gt; }} and the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors.{{refn|group=note|She appeared in group shows of this organization in 1932&lt;ref name="1932 Oct NYT"/&gt; and 1933.&lt;ref name="1933 Jan NYT"/&gt; }} Non-commercial organizations that showed her a single time included the [[Saint Louis Art Museum|City Art Museum of St. Louis]] (1930),&lt;ref name="Gemberling bio Chalfont"/&gt; Salons of America (New York, 1932),&lt;ref name="1932 Apr NYT"/&gt; Philadelphia Water Color Club (1926),&lt;ref name="1926 Nov Philadelphia Inquirer"/&gt; [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy of Design]] (New York, 1932),&lt;ref name="Gemberling bio Chalfont"/&gt; [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] (New York, 1934),&lt;ref name="1934 Oct NYT"/&gt; [[Society of Independent Artists]] (New York, 1934),&lt;ref name="Gemberling bio Chalfont"/&gt; Studio House (Washington, D.C., 1936),&lt;ref name="1936 Feb Washington Post"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|In 1902, the American socialite and painter, [[Alice Pike Barney]], built a townhouse in Washington, D.C., to showcase local artistic talent.

Gemberling was known for the number of important awards she had won. Most came from the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], which honored her twice with its highly valued student award, the [[Cresson Traveling Scholarship]], in 1923 and 1924, and twice with its Fellowship Prize, given by members of the Academy to one of its own (1931, 1940). It also awarded her the Lambert Purchase Prize and the [[Mary Smith Prize]] for best painting by a Philadelphia woman artist, both in 1930, and a Gold Medal for her painting "Landscape."{{refn|group=note|The source of this information, a web page by H.

The '''Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education''' ('''IMPACT-SE'''), formerly known as the '''Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace''' ('''CMIP'''), is a non-profit organization that monitors the content of school textbooks.&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;[http://www.impact-se.org/ Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; It examines school curricula worldwide, especially throughout the [[Middle East]], to determine whether the material conforms to international standards and is teaching recognition and acceptance of the 'Other'.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.impact-se.org/about/about.html About]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization believes that education should be utilized to encourage tolerance, pluralism and democracy, and promote peaceful means of solving conflicts.&lt;ref name="homepage"/&gt;

In October 2011, IMPACT-SE opposed the recognition of [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] at [[UNESCO]], arguing that the [[Palestinian Authority]] does not meet the organization's recommendations for becoming a full member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NGO: PA doesn’t meet UNESCO statehood guidelines|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=243916|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The organization analyzes textbooks according to the following criteria:&lt;ref name="methodology"&gt;[http://www.impact-se.org/research/methodology.html Methodology]&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Is the data given accurate and complete?"
#"Are illustrations, maps, and graphs up-to-date and accurate?"
#"Are the achievements of others recognized?"
#"Are equal standards applied?"
#"Are political disputes presented objectively and honestly?"
#"Is wording likely to create prejudice, misapprehension, and conflict?"
#"Are the ideals of freedom, dignity, and fraternity being promoted?"
#"Are the following needs being emphasized: international cooperation, elaboration of common human ideals, advancement of the cause of peace, and enforcement of the law?"
#"How are other peoples, religions, and communities perceived? Are they recognized, accepted as equal, and respected? Or are they presented in a stereotyped and prejudiced way?"
#"Does education foster peace? Does it support a peace process? Is there room for improvement?"

According to the organization's website, criteria one through eight were recommended by [[UNESCO]] experts.&lt;ref name="methodology" /&gt;

From 1960 to 1963 he served as an R&amp;D Officer in the U.S. Air Force Solid State Physics Group at Wright Patterson AFB, before returning to WVU to complete his Ph.D. in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Slide, Video and CD Program Library|format=review of ''Nature of Earth''|first=Bill|last=Gissler|journal=CFMS Newsletter|volume=XLIV|issue=4|date=April 2007|url=http://www.cfmsinc.org/newsletter/news2007/004apr07/newsapr07.htm|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
He taught at WVU from 1965 until his retirement in May 2015, reaching approximately 35,000 students during 100 semesters prior.&lt;ref name=wvu/&gt; His research specializations are coal geology and geochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.wvu.edu/people/faculty WVU Geology faculty listing].&lt;/ref&gt; His scholarly contributions have been in geochemistry, coal geology, X-Ray diffractometry, and clay mineralogy. Throughout his career he published ~70 papers and managed almost $5 million in research funding. Many of his scientific contributions came while he headed the West Virginia Geological &amp; Economic Survey Analytical Section concurrent with his WVU appointment from 1965 to 1992.

==Nature of Earth==
Renton has created a 36 part lecture series on DVD called Nature of Earth.  [[Bill Gates]] has this program as example of the sorts of educational innovation that the [[Gates Foundation]] intends to support, calling the course "phenomenal".&lt;ref name=gates&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bill and Melinda Gates go back to school|first=Claudia|last=Wallis|date=November 26, 2008|journal=[[CNN Money]]|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/25/magazines/fortune/GatesFoundation_Wallis.fortune/|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katimavik''' ([[Inuktitut]]: "meeting place") is a registered charity which educates [[Canadians|Canadian]] youth through volunteer work. Katimavik provides opportunities for young Canadians to participate in intensive six-month periods of volunteer service through the following themed programs: "Cultural Discovery and Civic Engagement", "Eco-citizenship and Active Living", "Second Language and Cultural Identity", "Eco-internship" (Éco-stage), and "Katimavik Horizon". In each program, volunteers live in groups of 11 young people in one or two different regions of the country, work full-time for not-for-profit organizations, and engage in an educational curriculum in which volunteers improve their second official language, learn about environmental stewardship and Canadian cultures, and develop a healthy lifestyle and leadership skills.&lt;ref name="katimavik1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-85/What-is-Katimavik |title=What is Katimavik? |publisher=Katimavik |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142142/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-85/What-is-Katimavik |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2011-12 program year, approximately 1,150 young Canadians volunteered in a Katimavik program and lived at one of 53 Katimavik houses located across the country while contributing to the work of one of 545 partner organizations.&lt;ref name="katimavik2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-50/Mission-and-objectives |title=Our mission |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142251/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-50/Mission-and-objectives |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is currently headed by Daniel Lapointe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katimavik.org/news-421/Katimavik-Names-Daniel-Lapointe-to-Serve-as-CEO Katimavik Names Daniel Lapointe to Serve as CEO] from katimavik.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231215104/http://www.katimavik.org/news-421/Katimavik-Names-Daniel-Lapointe-to-Serve-as-CEO |date=December 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, more than 30,000 Canadians have participated in the program, staged in more than 2000 communities.&lt;ref name="katimavik2"/&gt;

==Overview==
Each Katimavik program consists of groups of 11 youth aged 17 to 21 who are drawn from across [[Canada]]. They travel together to one or two different places in Canada for a period of six months. During the 2007-2008 program year there were 99 such groups spread across Canada. Each participant volunteers for about 40 hours per week and completes a learning program that focuses on Canada's [[official language]]s, protecting the environment, leadership, [[cultural diversity]], and leading a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-372/Life-in-Katimavik |title=Activities |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143735/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-372/Life-in-Katimavik |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, more than 500 community non-profit organizations are assisted by Katimavik volunteers doing full-time work for them.&lt;ref name="katimavik2"/&gt; Katimavik has volunteer projects in all 10 Canadian provinces and three territories. Katimavik has signed partnerships with a number of post-secondary institutions in Canada, including [[Vancouver Island University]], [[Capilano University]], Quebec's public community colleges ([[CEGEP]]), and [[George Brown College]] in order for Katimavik participants to receive post-secondary credit for their experiences.

Katimavik has its national headquarters in [[Montréal]], Quebec, which also serves as regional office for the Atlantic and Quebec region. For the Central region, the regional office is located in [[Ottawa]], Ontario. For the North, Pacific and Prairies regions, the organization's regional office is located in [[Calgary]], Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-77/Contact-us |title=Contact us |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214637/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-77/Contact-us |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Katimavik was started by [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s government and then Senator [[Jacques Hébert (Canadian politician)|Jacques Hébert]] as well as then [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] [[Barney Danson]].  Legally, it was incorporated as '''OPCAN''', a non-profit corporation created by [[letters patent]] dated January 26, 1977 pursuant to Part II of the [[Canada Business Corporations Act|Canada Corporations Act]]. Much of Katimavik's structure was taken from [[Canadian Cadet Organizations]] and the defunct [[Company of Young Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, William Stenner. "Why I Hate Canadians", 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Katimavik offered a military option, an opportunity to spend three months on an Army or Navy base learning fundamental skills such as first aid and map reading, as well as basic military skills, such as drills and rifle handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The overall program grew quickly in its initial years to its peak in 1985-86, when there were more than 5,000 participants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The program was cancelled that year by [[Brian Mulroney]]'s new government.

The cancellation prompted founder Jacques Hébert to undertake on a 21-day [[hunger strike]] in protest, to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-53/History |title=Our history |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726214852/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-53/History |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently worked with Quebec region director Claude Raiche to continue Katimavik as an [[outdoor recreation]] training centre at [[Notre-Dame-de-l'Île-Perrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/files/File/rapportannuelEN20012002.pdf |title=Annual Report |publisher=Katimavik |year=2001–2002 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013545/http://www.katimavik.org/files/File/rapportannuelEN20012002.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It continued in this form until 1994 when [[Service Canada Centres for Youth|Youth Service Canada]] helped Katimavik to form a pilot program involving six projects and 66 participants. The next year, the [[Government of Canada]]'s [[Department of Canadian Heritage|Department of Heritage]] provided the program with ongoing funding and the number of projects and participants tripled. The size of the program then continued to increase; during the 2005-2006 program year there were 1,155 participants in 105 communities across Canada.  In 2008 Katimavik was granted consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] which has allowed Katimavik to liaise with similar organizations in other countries and represent Canada internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://file.katimavik.org/homes/root/File/Background%20document_ENG.pdf |title=Background document: Katimavik-Opcan's Special Consultative Status with ECOSOC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316120956/http://file.katimavik.org/homes/root/File/Background%20document_ENG.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Katimavik was told by the government that its funding was under review and that it was to cease recruitment activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://katimaviktoms.blogspot.com/2006/08/katimavik-funding-cuts.html |title=Unofficial Katimavik Blog: Katimavik funding cuts ? |publisher=blogspot.com |date=2006-08-14 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316120956/http://katimaviktoms.blogspot.com/2006/08/katimavik-funding-cuts.html |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter-writing campaign was organized by Katimavik and funding levels were maintained until October 2010 when the government announced three-year funding in the sum of $15 million per year, a reduction from its previous funding levels ($19.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katimavik.org/news-403/Katimavik-receives-multi-year-funding-from-the-federal-government Katimavik receives multi-year funding from federal government] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107210457/http://www.katimavik.org/news-403/Katimavik-receives-multi-year-funding-from-the-federal-government |date=January 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Katimavik diversified its program offerings. Katimavik launched a program called Katimavik North which focused upon pairing groups of youth between the ages of 18 and 25 that were half-composed of young Canadians from the territories and half-composed of young Canadians from the southern provinces; the groups then lived in both Canada's north and south in order to learn from each culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niyc.ca/opportunuties/katimavik-program |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706190640/http://www.niyc.ca/opportunuties/katimavik-program |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katimavik expanded beyond youth service when it launched an Eco-stage program in conjunction with the [[Government of Quebec]]; the program allowed Quebecers between the ages of 18 and 35 to gain experience in an environmentally-related career while drawing upon the educational expertise that Katimavik has built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecostage.qc.ca/ |title=Éco-stage - Katimavik |publisher=Ecostage.qc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104222427/http://www.ecostage.qc.ca/ |archivedate=2012-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current programs==
Katimavik's current program offerings relate to the themes of "Cultural Discovery and Civic Engagement", "Eco-citizenship and Active Living", "Second Language and Cultural Identity", and the program "Katimavik Horizon" which combines all of the program elements into a less focused but more diverse experience.&lt;ref name="katimavik1"/&gt; About these programs:

;Katimavik Horizon
This six-month program provides an opportunity to live and volunteer in two different Canadian communities. The volunteers can shape the program based on the particular aptitudes and interests of the
group.

;Cultural discovery and civic engagement
For six months youth volunteer in two distinct Canadian communities, one of which has a significant aboriginal population. This program is designed for youth who are interested in discovering the diversity of
Canada while engaging in meaningful volunteer service activities. Volunteers will explore the geography, history, economy and socio-cultural makeup of their host communities.

;Eco-citizenship and active living
This program gives youth the opportunity to develop a healthy lifestyle and to thoroughly acquire an understanding of the important ecological challenges in a Canadian community where they will be located
while participating in volunteer initiatives that promote environmental stewardship. Over the course of six months, volunteers obtain an in-depth knowledge and fully integrate in one Canadian community outside
the volunteer’s home province where they apply the principles of eco-citizenship.

;Second language and cultural identity
For six months youth volunteer in two Canadian communities: one Anglophone community in Western Canada and one Francophone community in Québec. It gives participants intense immersion in an linguistic and cultural experience while engaging in meaningful volunteer service.

;Éco-stage
Éco-stage is a three-month program for young Québécois between the ages of 18 and 35 who want to engage in periods of work experience related to getting professional experience in the environmental sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecostage.qc.ca/tabid/58.html |title=Vivez l'expérience Éco-stage! |publisher=Ecostage.qc.ca |language=French |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827225422/http://www.ecostage.qc.ca/tabid/58.html |archivedate=2011-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interns in this program receive a $3000 allowance to cover travel and accommodation expenses.

;British Columbia pilot project
In conjunction with the [[British Columbia]] [[Ministry of Children and Family Development (British Columbia)|Ministry of Children and Family Development]] and the Francophone Secretariat of British Columbia, Katimavik has a program in which British Columbia youth are paired with youth from Quebec in non-profit programs, including [[World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms]], with the aim of developing knowledge of sustainable agriculture and increasing employability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/news/katimavik-and-bc-government-partners-promotion-youth-employability |title=Katimavik and the BC Government: partners in promotion of youth employability |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201220436/http://www.katimavik.org/news/katimavik-and-bc-government-partners-promotion-youth-employability |archivedate=2012-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current funding==
Katimavik had a funding agreement with the Department of Canadian Heritage that ran until March 31, 2013. $15 million per year was contributed to the program under this agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/sites/default/files/etatsfinanciers2011en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091353/http://www.katimavik.org/sites/default/files/etatsfinanciers2011en.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katimavik also has the organization the Katimavik Fund which receives donations on behalf of Katimavik, including those donations made via the Katimavik website.  The Eco-Internship program is currently supported by a funding agreement with the [[government of Quebec]].

==Application process and costs==
Youth who apply to the program are randomly selected though groups are based on demographic factors such as mother tongue, sex and province of origin. Selected applicants must submit a completed doctor's examination and criminal record check. The programs run for six-month periods from January to June and from July to December.

A selected group of eleven participants might include, for example, one from [[British Columbia]]/[[Yukon]], two from the [[Prairie provinces]], [[Nunavut]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], four from [[Ontario]], three from [[Quebec]] and one from the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]]. These eleven youth will be between the ages of 17 and 21 (inclusive).

The Katimavik program receives financial support from the [[Citizen Participation Branch]] of the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]]. Because of this there is no cost for travel, food, or accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-373/Destinations--Dates--Costs |title=Important dates |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142241/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-373/Destinations--Dates--Costs |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, participants are paid an allowance of $3 a day to cover incidental living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-383/How-to-convince-your-parents |title=Convince your parents |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724142508/http://www.katimavik.org/subsection-383/How-to-convince-your-parents |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All activities planned by the group are arranged under various learning budgets. Since there is rarely time for any extracurricular activities outside of the program, any sort of group activity expenses are paid for out of the group budget and have to be agreed upon by the group and the Project Leader, i.e. hiking, visiting cultural centers, theater and media presentations, etc. There is a $300 non-refundable participation fee, payable once volunteers are officially accepted to Katimavik. This fee covers accident insurance and other administrative costs. There is also a $350 transportation deposit that is paid by volunteers upon departure and refunded upon completion of the program; if a volunteer leaves the program early this deposit is sacrificed in order to cover the increased costs associated with unplanned transportation home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katimavik.org/eligibility-and-costs |title=Eligibility and costs |publisher=Katimavik |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502115819/http://www.katimavik.org/eligibility-and-costs |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program life==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
Participants volunteer 35–40 hours a week and participate in workshops and activities with their fellow group members and Project Leader. Three groups in close communities form a "cluster" that may often meet up together for certain activities. Each cluster of four projects is monitored by a Project Coordinator.

During the program participants can expect to abide by certain standards of behaviour which fall into four main categories: participation, health and safety, and respect. Participants are monitored by their project leader, one who lives with them during each phase to lead the project. Project leaders can issue verbal warnings, commitments to improve, final warnings, and expulsions if the behavioural standards are not followed.

Katimavik builds participants' skills during the course of the program by implementing five learning programs, comprising various essential activities and workshops. Katimavik also implements a learning plan, which uses an [[AARR]] educational model (Anticipation, Action, Reflection, Recognition) and follows participants through each community. Participants receive six letters of appraisal (3 from the project leaders, and 3 from work supervisors), as well as a certificate of completion upon completion of the program.

While participants are in the program, they will spend a week of their time in each community living with a "host family". This is a family living in the community that has agreed to take on a participant (or two). This allows the participant to take some time off from group life, while living with members of the community, and learning what it's like to be a local.

Every group, every three months, is given budgets of varying amounts in each the following categories: Cultural Discovery, Environment, Healthy Life Style, Second Languages and Leadership. This money is spent in ways that correspond to program's learning objectives. The goal of the program's educational component is to build the capacities of participants in the following key areas:
* Interact with others in a variety of situations
* Adopt an open attitude towards the diversity of social and multicultural realities
* Communicate in both official languages
* Engage in diverse work experiences
* Apply habits that favor a healthy lifestyle
* Develop an integrated vision of environmental protection and sustainable development
* Engage as a citizen
* Prepare to integrate, as a citizen, into the job market, school or other life event

==Katimavik elimination, protests, and restoration attempts==
In the [[2012 Canadian federal budget]], Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the program will be eliminated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/03/29/federalbudget-flaherty-hilights.html |title=2012 Federal budget highlights |publisher=CBC.ca |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated reason was the comparatively high per-person cost of the program when compared to other government youth initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.budget.gc.ca/2012/plan/pdf/Plan2012-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A Nationwide day of protest was held on July 21, 2012. Prominent politicians such as [[Elizabeth May]], leader of the Green Party, and NDP MP [[Charmaine Borg]] supported the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metronews.ca/news/edmonton/301031/nationwide-day-of-protests-against-katimavik-cuts-set-for-saturday/|title=Nationwide day of protests against Katimavik cuts set for Saturday|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative party encountered protest from politicians and supporters of the program after the budget was announced. An Ontarian mother, Colleen Cleve attempted to lodge a [[Class-Action]] lawsuit on behalf of the 600 Canadian youths who were selected but retroactively denied, her own two children among them. She states that the Federal government prematurely revoked and reneged on the contract with the youths, as government funding was not scheduled to expire until a year later in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/05/05/katimavik-cuts-lawsuit-colleen-cleve_n_1483551.html?ref=canada|title=Katimavik Cuts: Lawsuit May Be Coming Against Feds For Scrapping Trudeau-Era Youth Program's Funding|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NDP MP [[Charmaine Borg]] embarked on a cross-country tour to raise awareness and rally support in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/News/Local/2012-08-30/article-3064530/Saving-Katimavik/1|title=Saving Katimavik|work=theguardian.pe.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also introduced Bill 352 to restore $15M [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] Federal funding to the program.&lt;ref&gt;http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/christophermajka/2012/09/charmaine-borg-versus-james-moore-irresistible-force-meets-i retrieved September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal party leader [[Justin Trudeau]] called for restoring funding to the program. His father Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] established the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/05/liberals-urge-govt-to-continue-funding-katimavik|title=Liberals urge gov't to continue funding Katimavik|work=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Katimavik online petition was one of the many launched by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] in 2012. Justin Trudeau claimed that the reasons the program was cancelled were ideological differences, comparing the $14M for the community-oriented Katimavik program with $207M for the military-oriented Cadet program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/katimavik-killed-for-ideological-reasons-trudeau-says-1.1277023 | date= April 5, 2012 |title= Katimavik killed for 'ideological' reasons, Trudeau says|work=CBC News| accessdate=2015-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a cross-country movement of Katimavik activists to relay packages to [[Stephen Harper]], including a journal signed by supporters along the way, a Katimavik T-shirt and signed petitions requesting reversal of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/2012/07/23/katimavik-relay-reaches-brantford-in-august|title=Katimavik relay reaches Brantford in August|work=Brantford Expositor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relay was routed through 50 communities served by Katimavik.&lt;ref&gt;http://explore-mag.com/6829/news/relay-to-save-katimavik&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympic gold medalist kayaker [[Adam van Koeverden]] claims that he owes his own existence to an encounter between his parents who worked as Katimavik team leaders upon university graduation and for five years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/katimavik-is-worth-saving/article4100797/?service=mobile retrieved September 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Van Koeverden describes Canadian youths as suffering from a crisis of identity as they try to define their relevance in life, and that Katimavik would be ideal to help them discover themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/katimavik-is-worth-saving/article4100797/?service=mobile|title=Katimavik is worth saving|work=theglobeandmail.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[University of Ottawa]] chapter of the [[Young Liberals of Canada]] devised a 'Pennies 4 Katimavik' penny drive inspired by the budget's announcement of the Canadian penny's obsolescence and of termination of government funding. The event was intended to raise $5K CAD and to inform the public of the merit of Katimavik and of the fate of its funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uranowski.wordpress.com/2012/04/28/pennies-4-katimavik-launches-today/|title="Pennies 4 Katimavik" Launches Today! |work=The Equivocator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar drives were conducted through the country and announced by the project's Facebook page.

===Katimavik-like programs===
A Katimavik-affiliated program, 'Volunteering to Independence Program', where youths from Ontario were dispatched to [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] began in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news-story/4035638-katimavik-pilot-project-starts-in-september/|title=Katimavik pilot project starts in September|work=mykawartha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program varies from the old Katimavik program in that the program has no rotations and participants are from Ontario rather than across Canada.

'''Lawrence Beesley''' (31 December 1877 – 14 February 1967) was an [[England|English]] science teacher, journalist and author who was a survivor of the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].

==Education==
Beesley was educated at [[Derby School]], where he was a scholar, and afterwards at [[Caius College, Cambridge]], again as a scholar. He took a First Class degree in the Natural Science tripos in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BSLY900L|name=Beesley, Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Beginning as a schoolmaster at Wirksworth Grammar School, he moved to [[Dulwich College]], where he was a science master. In 1957 he was still teaching as Principal of the Northwood School of Coaching, Northwood, Middlesex.

==RMS ''Titanic''==
{{further|Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic#Boat 13 (starboard)}}
One of the survivors of the sinking of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' in April 1912, Beesley wrote a successful book about his experience, ''The Loss of the SS Titanic'' (June 1912), published just nine weeks after the disaster. He saw two second class women who tried to get on a lifeboat being instructed to go back to their own deck, and that their lifeboats were waiting there.

As Lifeboat No. 13 was being launched on the Boat Deck, no women or children were in immediate sight, but it seemed there was room for more. As a result, Beesley was instructed to jump into the lifeboat just before it launched. He managed to survive a subsequent incident where Lifeboat No. 15 nearly landed on top of No. 13. The leading stoker of boiler room No.6, Fred Barrett, managed to cut the ropes connecting the boat to the falls at the last minute, and those in both boats emerged unharmed. Beesley and the rest of the survivors were picked up by the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] in the early morning of 15 April.

During the filming of ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'' in 1958, Beesley famously gatecrashed the set during the sinking scene, hoping to 'go down with the ship'. But he was spotted by the director, [[Roy Ward Baker]], who vetoed this unscheduled appearance due to actors' union rules. These events are parodied in [[Julian Barnes]]' novel ''A History of the World in 10.5 Chapters'', where Beesley makes a brief appearance as a fictional character.

Beesley was portrayed by actor [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] (who later played fictional character Lovejoy in James Cameron's 1997 Titanic film) in the 1979 dramatisation of the voyage and sinking, ''[[S.O.S. Titanic]]''. He is the grandfather of [[New York Times]] science editor [[Nicholas Wade]]. Beesley was also portrayed by Lawrence Bennett in 1999 musical stage adaptation ''Titanic''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18608">This is a list of [[books]] released for the [[UK World Book Day]]. In 1998 and 1999 a specially created WBD anthology priced at [[Pound sterling|£]]1 ([[Euro|€]]1.50 in [[Ireland]]) was published. In 2000, instead of a single £1 special anthology, four separate £1 books were published, covering a wider age-range. Since then, each year has seen a new set of special £1 books published.

From 2009 to 2011 flip books were published containing stories by two different [[author]]s one starting at each end of the book. 2012 saw the return of single story books and the first [[E-book]]s published simultaneously.&lt;ref name="revert-single-books"&gt;"[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/world-book-day-titles-revert-single-books.html World Book Day titles to revert to single books | The Bookseller]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''great libraries of the ancient world''' served as archives for empires, sanctuaries for sacred writings, and depositories of literature and chronicles.

==Algeria==
* [[Timgad]] (250 A.D.) (modern Algeria)&lt;p&gt;The library was a gift to the Roman people and province of Thamugadi or [[Timgad]] by  Julius Quintianus Flavius Rogatianus in the third century.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer, H. 1931"&gt;Pfeiffer, H. (1931). The Roman Library at Timgad. Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, 9, 157-165.&lt;/ref&gt; The library contained an expansive arched hall which consisted of a reading room, stack room, and a rotunda for lectures.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer, H. 1931"/&gt; The library was quite large measuring eighty one feet in length by seventy seven feet in width.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer, H. 1931"/&gt; Oblong alcoves held wooden cabinets along walls of which the manuscripts were maintained.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer, H. 1931"/&gt; In addition there is evidence for free-standing bookcases in the center as well as a reading desk.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer, H. 1931"/&gt; There is no evidence as to how many books the library harbored although it is estimated that it could have accommodated 3000 scrolls.&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer, H. 1931"/&gt;

==Anatolia==
* [[Hattusa]] (1900 B.C. - 1190 B.C.) (modern [[Bogazkoy]])&lt;p&gt;This archive constituted the largest collection of Hittite texts discovered with approximately thirty thousand inscribed cuneiform tablets.&lt;ref name="johnkinsella.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnkinsella.net/Herod_Hittites_page4.htm|title=The Evidence|first=John Francis|last=Kinsella|website=johnkinsella.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets had also been classified according to a precise system.&lt;ref name="johnkinsella.net"/&gt;
* Royal [[Library of Antioch]] (221 B.C. - 363 A.D.) (Modern [[Antakya]])&lt;p&gt;The library was commissioned in the third century B.C. by [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] by the Greek sovereign [[Antiochus III the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libaniusredux.blogspot.com/2013/05/lost-sources-besides-pausanias.html|title=Antiochepedia = Musings Upon Ancient Antioch: Lost Sources (besides Pausanias)|first=|last=Antiochian|date=26 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euphorion was an academic and was also the chief librarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduscapes.com/history/ancient/200bce.htm|title=History of Libraries|website=www.eduscapes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Library of Pergamum]] (197 B.C. - 159 B.C.) (modern [[Bergama]])&lt;p&gt;The [[Attalid]] kings formed the second best Hellenistic library after Alexandria, founded in emulation of the Ptolemies. [[Parchment]], a predecessor of [[vellum]] and [[paper]], was widely used in the library, and came to be known as pergamum after the city.  The library had collected over 200,000 volumes and the reason why the library was so successful was because of Pergamum's hegemony which was a purveyor of scholarship.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, S. (2009). The library: an illustrated history. New York, NY: [[Skyhorse Pub.]] p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Library of Celsus]] (135 A.D. - 262) (located within the city of [[Ephesus]])&lt;p&gt;This library was part of the triumvirate of libraries in the Mediterranean which included the aforementioned Library of Pergamum and the great Library of Alexandria listed below. The library was actually a tomb and a shrine for the deceased [[Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus]] for whom the library is named.&lt;ref name="ephesus"&gt;Celsus Library, Ephesus Turkey. (n.d.). Ephesus ancient city. Artemis temple, virgin mary house, saint john basilica. Ephesus Turkey. Retrieved March 31, 2013, from http://www.ephesus.us/ephesus/celsuslibrary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 12,000 volumes were collected at this library which were deposited in several cabinets along the wall.&lt;ref name="ephesus" /&gt;
*The [[Imperial Library of Constantinople]]  (337–361 A.D. – 29 May 1453) ([[Constantinople]], modern [[Istanbul]])&lt;p&gt;The library was established by Constantius II who was the son of the first Christian emperor Constantine. Constantius requested that the rolls of papyrus should be copied onto parchment or vellum in order that they would be preserved.&lt;ref name="historyofinformation"&gt;''Foundation of the Imperial Library of Constantinople (Circa 357 CE): From Cave Paintings to the Internet''.

== China ==

*Han Imperial Library. Catalogue preserved in the [[Yiwenzhi]] chapter of the [[Book of Han]]. At the time of inventory contained 596 works divided into six genres; scripture, philosophy, poetry, warfare, astrology, and medicine. 
*[[Qin dynasty|Qin]] reign (third century BCE): It was the practice of Chinese emperors to assemble and maintain their official written archive. The first Qin emperor was a determined opponent of [[Confucianism]], and worked to eradicate texts and teachings of that philosophy. &lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; 
*Tang dynasty (6th–10th century): The [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]] is known as the Golden Age of Imperial Chinese history. Academy libraries were places where young men came to study for civil service exams, and became an important part of the Chinese meritocracy. Private collection of books was also common during this time. [[Woodblock printing|Wood-block printing]] spread throughout the kingdom at this time, making books more affordable. Social status was determined, in part, by the cultural refinement acquired through personal book collections.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

== Egypt ==
*The [[Royal Library of Alexandria]], Egypt, fl. 3rd century BC (c. 295 BC).&lt;p&gt;Founded by Ptolemy, this library was said to have amassed an estimated 400,000 manuscripts and was considered the leading intellectual metropolis of the Hellenistic world.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; The [[Serapeum#Alexandria|Serapeum in Alexandria]] served as an extension of the library.
*[[Serapeum of Alexandria]], offshoot collection of the great Library of Alexandria
* [[Temple of Edfu]] Archive/Library (237–57 B.C.)&lt;p&gt;This library was an extension of the Temple itself. The walls of this chamber are bestrewn with engravings and captions depicting numerous receptacles filled with manuscripts of papyrus as well as scrolls bound in leather.&lt;ref name="historyofinformation.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=3626|title=The Archive or Library in the Temple of Edfu :  HistoryofInformation.com|website=www.historyofinformation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents chronicled the circadian workings of the temple, but also detailed construction drafts and directives on how the temple walls should be decorated.&lt;ref name="historyofinformation.com"/&gt;

== Ethiopia ==
* The Library of Aksum&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of [[Aksum]], by the first century CE, was a noted trading hub for Europe, Asia, and Africa.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; By the third century, it was the equal of the Roman, Persian, and Chinese empires.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Aksum had a unique written language, [[Ge'ez]], and their libraries held their own translation of the Christian Bible, and other important early Christian works. It is believed that Coptic monks translated many of these works.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Notably, the [[Book of Enoch]], a pre-Christian religious text, was originally written in Ge'ez.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; By the 7th century CE, the kingdom of Aksum fell due to [[Islam]]ic expansion, agricultural difficulties, and a trading shift away from the Red Sea in favor of the Persian Gulf, but it is remembered as a society that celebrated literacy, education, and libraries.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

==Greece==
*The Library of [[Aristotle]] ([[Athens]]) (384–321 B.C.)&lt;p&gt;The Library of Aristotle was a private library and the earliest one reported on by ancient chroniclers. It is not known what books nor the number of books that were included in the library. Accounts in antiquity state that the library formed part of the later Library of Alexandria in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;"The Library of Aristotle: Basis for the Royal Library of Alexandria? (384 BCE – 321 BCE)". (n.d.).: HistoryofInformation.com. Retrieved September 15, 2014, from http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=164&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kos]] Library (Kos) (100 A.D.)&lt;p&gt;The library was a local public library situated on the island of Kos and known as a crossroads for academia and philosophical faculties.&lt;ref name="eduscapes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduscapes.com/history/ancient/100.htm|title=History of Libraries|website=www.eduscapes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A record of individuals who were supposedly responsible for the establishment of the library are acknowledged in an inscription near the monument.&lt;ref name="eduscapes.com"/&gt;
*The Library of Pantainos (Athens) (100 A.D.)&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to both [[Athena]] Archegetis and the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], the library was connected to the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora in Athens]].&lt;ref name="agathe.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agathe.gr/guide/library_of_pantainos.html|title=AgoraPicBk 16 2003: Library of Pantainos|website=www.agathe.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titus Flavius Pantainos had it built, and he, along with his children, also devoted it to the citizens of Athens.&lt;ref name="desertfathers.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desertfathers.blogspot.com/2012/07/athens-greecelibrary-of-pantainos.html|title=The Desert Fathers: Athens (Greece)...Library of Pantainos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the precise date of its dedication is not clear, it is believed to have been dedicated between 98 AD and 102 AD.&lt;ref name="desertfathers.blogspot.com"/&gt; There is speculation that the library may have actually been built by the father of Pantainos.&lt;ref name="desertfathers.blogspot.com"/&gt; Being a Roman-period library, the design is quite unconventional. A spacious alcove with an adjoining courtyard enclosed by three galleries formed the arrangement of the structure.&lt;ref name="desertfathers.blogspot.com"/&gt; An inscription discovered dictates proper library etiquette: "No book is to be taken out because we have sworn an oath. The library is to be open first hour until the sixth."&lt;ref name="agathe.gr"/&gt; The library was ultimately consumed by the invading Germanic [[Heruli]] tribe in 267 AD.&lt;ref name="agathe.gr"/&gt;
*The Library of [[Rhodes]] (Rhodes) (100 A.D.)&lt;p&gt;The library on the island of Rhodes was a distinct component of the larger [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] structure. An enclosure that had been excavated revealed a section of a catalog analogous to modern library catalogs. The catalog, which classified titles by subject, displayed an inventory of authors in consecutive order together with their published efforts. It has also been determined that the library employed a qualified librarian.&lt;ref name="eduscapes.com"/&gt;

== India ==
The great seats of learning in the ancient [[Indian subcontinent]] include:
* [[Taxila|Takshasila]] (6th to 5th century BC in modern-day [[Pakistan]]), 
* [[Nalanda]] (founded in 427) was considered "one of the first great universities in recorded history".&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/opinion/09garten.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Nalanda&amp;st=cse "Really Old School"], Garten, Jeffrey E. New York Times, 9 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1193, the [[Nalanda]] [[University]] complex was invaded and sacked by the [[Slave Dynasty]] under the Turkic Muslim general [[Bakhtiyar Khilji]]; this event is seen as a milestone in the [[decline of Buddhism in India]].
* [[Vikramshila]] (8th century)
* [[Kanchipuram]] and other universities, also maintained vast libraries of [[palm leaf manuscript]]s on various subjects, ranging from theology to astronomy.

==Iran==
* The [[Academy of Gondishapur]] in western [[Iran]], established during the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] in the 3rd through 6th centuries in Amol city (Mzandaran province).&lt;p&gt;The breadth of this institution was enormous and included a university, teaching hospital, and a library filled with over 400,000 titles.&lt;ref name="iranreview"&gt;Mirrazavi, F. (2009). Academy of Gundishapur. Iran Review. Retrieved March 31, 2013, from http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/_Academy_of_Gundishapur.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The academy was the epitome of the Sassanid Empire with its faculty highly proficient in the conventions of [[Zoroastrianism]] and ancient Persian as well as classical Indian scholarship.&lt;ref name="iranreview" /&gt;

==Iraq==
*The [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] (established 668–627 BC) in [[Nineveh]] (near modern [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]])&lt;p&gt;Long considered to be the first systematically collected library, was rediscovered in the 19th century. While the library had been destroyed, many fragments of the ancient [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] tablets survived, and have been reconstructed. Large portions of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] were among the many finds.&lt;ref&gt;Polastron, Lucien X.: ''Books On Fire: the Tumultuous Story of the World's Great Libraries'' 2007, page 3, Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menant, Joachim: [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k104837f/f41.table "La bibliothèque du palais de Ninive"] 1880, page 33, Paris: E.

Some of the works collected by Ashurbanipal were 1,000 years old at the time. Included in the king's library were fragments from a copy of the Epic of Creation (7th century BC) as well as from The Epic of Gilgamesh (7th century BC), considered the most important work of Mesopotamian literature. In the 19th and 20th century, more than 20,000 cuneiform tablets were discovered by the British Museum. |work=[[Assyrian International News Agency]] |date= |accessdate=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Nuzi]] (Modern Yorgan Tepe) (1500 B.C.)&lt;p&gt;This archive consisted of over 6,000 tablets written primarily in Babylonian cuneiform, however a select few were composed in the indigenous [[Hurrian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Springer, I.

Her book ''Models and Analogies in Science'' (1963/66) is considered a seminal work in the field and among the most influential works of the 20th century in her field.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

== Biography ==
Born in [[Reigate]] in Surrey, England, Hesse studied at the [[Imperial College London]], where she received her doctorate in 1948. She further acquired a [[Master of Science]]  in 1949 from [[University College London]].

After graduation Hesse started her academic career as lecturer in Mathematics at the [[University of Leeds]]. From 1955 to 1959 she taught Philosophy of Science and History at the [[University of London]]. In 1960 she joined [[Wolfson College, Cambridge]], where from 1975 to her retirement in the 1990s she was Professor of Philosophy of Science. Among her PhD students was [[Paul Cilliers]] (PhD, 1994).

Over the years Hesse was Visiting Professor at several Universities in Europe and the United States. She was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] and in 1979 chosen as president of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]]. (SA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=7 Mary Brenda Hesse 1924 - Professor of Philosophy of Science, Cambridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307081429/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=7 |date=2013-03-07 }} at ''giffordlectures.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Hesse's work has focussed on the philosophical interpretation of logic and scientific methods, as well as to the principles of the natural and social sciences. She suggested a scientific methodology based on an analogical modelling approach. She distinguishes those models in formal and material, as well as positive, negative and neutral analog properties.

=== ''Models and Analogies in Science'' ===
Her publication ''Models and Analogies in Science'' is a widely cited and accessible introduction to the topic. Hesse argues, contra [[Pierre Duhem|Duhem]], that [[model (abstract)|models]] and [[analogy|analogies]] are integral to understanding [[scientific method|scientific practice]] in general and scientific advancement in particular, especially how the domain of a scientific theory is extended and how theories generate genuinely novel [[prediction]]s. Examples of such models include the famous [[Dynamical billiards|billiard ball model]] of the dynamical theory of gases and models of light based on analogies to sound and [[water waves]].

Hesse thought that, in order help us understand a new system or [[phenomenon]], we will often create an analogical model that compares this new system or phenomenon with a more familiar system or phenomenon. In her book, Hesse makes a distinction between three types of analogues in scientific models: 
* Positive analogies, 
* Negative analogies, and 
* Neutral analogies.  
Positive analogies are those features which are known or thought to be shared by both systems, negative analogies are those features which are known or thought to be present in one system but absent in the other, and neutral analogies are those features whose status as positive or negative analogies is uncertain at present.

Neutral analogies are by far the most interesting of the three types of analogies, for they suggest ways to test the limits of our models, guiding the way for scientific advancement. In the late 19th century, for example, the idea that light-waves have a physical medium called the [[luminiferous ether]] would have been best thought of as a neutral analogy with water and sound waves.  Eventually, due to a [[null result]] in the [[Michelson–Morley experiment|Michelson–Morley]] and [[Trouton–Noble experiment|Trouton–Noble]] experiments, as well as other similar experiments, this analogy came to be accepted as a negative analogy - we now accept that light has no physical medium, unlike sound and water waves.  The discovery of this negative analogy led to further advances, including the unification of electromagnetic theory with optics, and the eventual creation of new and more informative models of light.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5162">The '''Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program''' (PRISP) is a program which "links undergraduate and graduate students with US security and intelligence agencies" by providing funding to selected US students entering university, in return for a commitment to join the agency for at least 18 months on graduation.&lt;ref name=counterpunch&gt;''[[CounterPunch]]'', 23 June 2009, [http://www.counterpunch.org/price06232009.html Son of PRISP: Obama's Classroom Spies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129210246/http://www.counterpunch.org/price06232009.html |date=2010-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PRISP is a decentralized program which funds students through various intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=CPMar05/&gt; The program was established by the US Congress in 2004. In 2010 it became a permanent, authorized funded IC program. By 2011 most IC agencies participate in this program which is designated to recruit and train analysts and linguists. PRISP funding can be used to pay hiring incentives, such as a recruitment bonus or reimburse previous educational expenses for individuals who already possess the necessary skills (language, specialized scientific or geographical area expertise), or to provide additional education or training for those selected for the program. There is a service obligation of 18 months. IC agencies' websites should be consulted for specifics on any particular agency's PRISP program participation.

'''Peace Mala''' ('''The Peace Mala Project for World Peace'''), is an organisation based in [[Morriston]] in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]] dedicated to fostering inter-cultural and inter-faith tolerance through the manufacture, distribution and wearing of a symbolic [[Japa mala|mala]] (bracelet) whose beads represent various faiths.

The organisation's stated aims are "promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/ From the 'Main aims of Peace Mala']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Peace Mala bracelet==
A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent Christianity, [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Folk religion|Tribal and Native Religions]], [[Jainism]], [[Earth religion]]s, [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Bön#Yungdrung Bön|Yungdrung Bön]]. The central white bead represents the wearer and whatever path they follow, with two knots on the elastic thread: one  symbolising the wearer's uniqueness, the other a reminder of [[causality]] and the path of peace and friendship to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html Official description of the symbology and representations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831214813/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html |date=31 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peace Mala was founded in 2002 by Pam Evans, former Head of the Department of Religious Studies at Coedcae Comprehensive School in [[Llanelli]], Carmarthenshire, Wales. The idea arose from class discussions about the contribution of the "[[September 11 attacks|9/11]]" attacks in New York to [[Islamophobia]], racism, religious intolerance and [[fundamentalism]] worldwide, as well as local effects exemplified by the experience of the student Imran Sheikh: "''I suffered from racist taunts and our local mosque was attacked following September 11 and that is when the Peace Mala all started.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3162388.stm Word spreads of 'peace mala'], BBC Wales interview upon winning first prize in the ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Evans gave up her position as Head of Department at Coedcae School to focus on her work with Peace Mala.  On 16 November 2006, (25th Shawwal 1427 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]), Evans was awarded the ''Noble Soul'' Award 2006 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to challenging Islamophobia in schools.  The award was presented by RAHMA (Racial Attacks and Harassment Monitoring Association) on the ''International Day of Peace.''

===Launch===
Peace Mala was officially launched in the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff|UNA Temple of Peace]] in [[Cardiff]] on Wednesday 27 November 2002 by [[Archbishop of Wales]] [[Rowan Williams]] (later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]). He was joined by members of the fourteen faiths represented on the Peace Mala bracelet, whose procession opened the ceremony, along with NGOs, students and teachers of schools from across Wales, lecturers from the University of Wales, and pupils and staff of Coedcae Comprehensive School.

===Awards===
Through the promotion of peace, tolerance and respect, Peace Mala has received numerous awards for their work, notably [[The Prince's Trust]] Millennium Award in 2003, the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] Community Dividend Award in 2003, the [[ChildLine]] Cymru CHIPS Friendship and Respect Award in 2003 (1st Prize), and the Carmarthenshire Police Community Challenge Award in 2004.  In 2004 Peace Mala was also awarded First Prize in the [[CEWC-Cymru]] "Right-On" National Competition to promote Human Rights in Welsh schools. In 2006 Peace Mala was awarded a grant by Awards for All (Wales) in support of the Peace Mala Awards for Youth.

==Charitable status==
On 21 February 2007, Peace Mala, already a [[company limited by guarantee]] and not having a share capital, was entered in the [[Central Register of Charities]] as Registered Charity No. 1118053.

==Patrons==
[[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was patron of Peace Mala from 2003 until 2008, and was succeeded by Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of the ''Yundrung Bön Study Centre''.

===Rowan Williams===
Williams and Evans first met when he visited Coedcae School to give talks to the pupils about his work as Archbishop of Wales, a position now held by [[Barry Morgan]].  Williams was one of the first persons to be contacted by Evans when she came up with the idea of the Peace Mala. One of Williams's final acts as Archbishop of Wales was to join 14 other religious dignitaries in the launch of the Peace Mala in November 2002.

In 2003 Evans invited Williams to be a patron; he held the position until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Reverend Dr Rowan Williams  Archbishop Of Canterbury|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030815001700/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|archivedate=15 August 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lama Khemsar Rinpoche===
Lama Khemsar Rinpoche also visited Coedcae School prior to his involvement with Peace Mala.  Rinpoche left [[Tibet]] in 1959, and is the first resident Lama of the Yungdrung Bön tradition in Europe. He also teaches widely in the US.

Evans invited Lama Khemsar Rinpoche to be a patron of the organisation, and he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director  Of The Tibetan Yungdrung Bon Study Centre|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195024/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Lama Khemsar Rinpoche's students have made use of the main room in the Peace Mala Registered Office for their weekly Bön [[Ngöndro|Zogchen Ngöndro]] prayers and meditations. The Tibetan room at the centre is often used by Rinpoche when he visits Wales.

==Website==
The Peace Mala website was created in 2002 using money granted by the Princes Trust Millennium Award. It was designed and published using 100% [[solar power]] by the web publishing company Arcania. The website includes news articles relating to Peace Mala activities and endorsements from prominent religious leaders, political dignitaries and celebrities including the [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama|the 14th Dalai Lama]], [[Jillian Evans]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], Sir [[Mark Tully]] [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Bonnie Tyler]] and Barbara Dickson.

==Registered office==
On Wednesday 18 August 2004, the Peace Mala Registered Office was officially opened during a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor and Consort of the City of Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Of The Registered Office For Peace Mala|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192928/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registered office is used as a base for Peace Mala activities including workshops and public talks. Yungdrung Bön practitioners in Wales also use the centre for their weekly ''Bon Zogchen Ngon-Dro'' prayers and meditations. Yungdrung Bön (meaning ''Eternal Light'' or ''Enlightened Teaching'') is the pre-Buddhist [[Bön]] faith of [[Tibet]].

===Peace Garden===
Attached to the registered office is a peace garden with many features including a shrine to [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], [[Buddharupa|Buddhist statues]] and [[prayer flags]], a miniature [[Zen]]-style stone garden, water features, and a tree area which has been blessed in a ceremony led by [[Neopaganism|Witches]], and [[Druid]]s.  There is also a tranquil area facing [[Mecca]], which is dedicated to the [[Islam|Muslim faith]].

==Aims==
Peace Mala outlined its "Main Aims" as:
*Education for global citizenship through the promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths.
*Peace Mala supports human rights, confronts bullying and all forms of prejudice.
*Peace Mala raises awareness of issues of global interdependence and encourages active compassion by learners that will effect positive changes locally and globally.

==Educational work==
Peace Mala works to engages with schools to educate youths into becoming "''global citizens through the promotion of respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities and faiths''".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Alex, "Youngsters honoured for promoting peace", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Awards for Youth===
In 2006 Peace Mala launched the ''Peace Mala Awards for Youth''.  The awards and competition encourage young people "''...  to become aware of and involved with issues of peace, justice, tolerance and friendship.''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html Peace Mala, PEACE MALA NATIONAL AWARDS FOR YOUTH  Award Winners 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420011636/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html |date=20 April 2012 }}. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; The competition focuses in issues of equality, human rights and global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positivenews.org.uk/2007/archive/1144/peace-mala-international-youth-awards/ "Peace Mala International Youth Awards"], ''Positive News'', 17 October 2007. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Youth Awards allows entrants from educational institutions, youth groups and faith groups. Two prizes are awarded: one for juniors (5–11) and the other for seniors (12–18). The awards were accompanied by cash prizes, and occasionally donated gifts such as commemorative framed posters signed by Gary Marlon Suson from the Ground Zero Museum Workshop.

In 2007 the Peace Mala Awards for Youth became an international competition with youth groups in the USA taking part in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Kay, "Peace hopes win top prize", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 27 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Awards were superseded by the Peace Mala Accreditation.

===Accreditation for Schools, Youth Groups and Community Groups===
In September 2009 Peace Mala celebrated the last Youth Awards ceremony, where the Awards were replaced an accreditation for schools, youth groups and community groups.  As the Awards had focused on competitive engagement by schools and some youth groups, the accreditation would be more cooperative and inclusive.  Schools and groups are encouraged to include the vision and objectives of Peace Mala within their ethos via the seven criteria and accreditation is awarded when the seven criteria have been successfully fulfilled as outlined in the self-assessment form available to applicants. These seven areas are intended to fit into the school, youth group or community group's values system and are in line with the objectives and vision of Peace Mala.

Applicants for accreditation are judged against seven key criteria:

# Community cohesion and global citizenship
# Needs and human rights
# Interdependence
# Active compassion
# Celebrating diversity
# Environmental responsibilities and sustainable change
# Conflict resolution and peace education

==Interfaith engagement==
Along with education and youth engagement, with the religious nature of its founding, Peace Mala engages regularly with interfaith and diversity engagement and occasions. Awareness events and fundraisers are regular occurrences.

===Pilgrimages===
Pilgrimages have been used by Peace Mala as a means of promotion, but also as a means to engage communities in interfaith involvement and raise awareness of local areas of interest and community diversity.

====Santiago de Compostela====

====Gower====
In May 2011, volunteers discovered a route map which may have been a pilgrimage path linking the Celtic churches of the [[Gower Peninsula]], as well pre-Christian sites such as holy wells and [[Dolmen|cromlech]] stones. A pilgrimage was organised, therefore, the next year to celebrate Peace Mala's first decennial year. The pilgrimage included one pilgrim who was joined at different legs of the pilgrimage culminating in a ceremony at St. Rhidian's Church in [[Llanrhidian]]. For the pilgrimage, Pam Evans travelled to Kildare to receive the flame of Brigid of the [[Brigidine Sisters]] of the Solas Bhríde hermitage; she then received the [[World Peace Flame]] at the [[Dru yoga|Dru International]] Training Centre for Education and Wellbeing in [[Snowdonia National Park]]; finally, various faith representatives attended a ceremony where a flame was blessed at the shrine of St David at [[St David's Cathedral]] by The Very Revd [[Jonathan Lean]]. These three flames were used during the start of the pilgrimage, where the lights were blessed by The Rt Revd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]]; as well as at the end, where the flames were blessed by numerous faith representatives including Muslim, Druid and Buddhists, as well as [[ISKCON]] sannyasa who greeted the pilgrims with kirtan.

At each of the sites visited, the main pilgrim lit votive candles and recited a prayer composed for the pilgrimage. She was joined on various days by school children as well as fellow pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;"Pilgrims step out on peace walk", ''[[South Wales Evening Post]]'', 26 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Llangyfelach "Forgotten" Monastery====
On Thursday 9 May 2013, Ascension Day, Peace Mala led a one-day pilgrimage as means of a revival of a postulated pilgrimage route to a now-defunct early Celtic monastery founded by St David on the site of the current parish Church of St David and St Cyfelach in [[Llangyfelach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul, "Old tradition revived by pilgrimage", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants in the pilgrimage included pupil from St John Lloyd Catholic School in Llanelli, Hafod Primary School in Swansea and Catwg Primary School. Also in procession were dignitaries from numerous faith, including The Rt Rev'd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]], as well as representatives from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University]], the [[Catholic Church]], [[Anglican Communion]] and [[Kagyu]] Tibetan Buddhism among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Pam, "Peace Mala Pilgrimage to Saint David's Forgotten Monastery", ''Diocesan News: The Diocese of Swansea &amp; Brecon '', Issue № 18, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travelling Doves of Peace====
Peace Mala released 14 small symbolic doves made from wood painted in the Peace Mala colours and each carrying a Peace Mala bracelet (along with other items) during a ceremony that took place in the Peace Mala peace garden on 30th April 2015. The Deputy Lord Mayor of the City and County of Swansea, the Mayor and Mayoress of Neath Port Talbot, Regional Chief of Police, Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia, representatives of several faith communities and pupils and teachers from some of Peace Mala Accredited schools were all in attendance.

The founder aims that as the Doves of Peace (also known as 'Peace Doves') travel the UK and across the world, they will raise awareness of the work of Peace Mala with schools, youth groups and community groups. Within the first few months after the launch, three of the doves travelled to the USA, Ireland, Holland, Italy, Cyprus, Israel, Africa, Hong Kong and Japan. The journeys of the 14 doves are being tracked to provide a geography project for schools and youth groups. This information is published on Facebook, Twitter and our interactive world maps for people to follow online.

[[File:Dove 13 in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Dove 13 in Jerusalem]]

Each dove is being sponsored on its travels, thereby also bringing financial support and security for the future work of the Peace Mala educational charity. One doves in particular, number 13, is known as the Inter-Faith Dove of Peace. Information on how to sponsor the doves is available on the Peace Mala website.

===Festival of Interfaith and Culture for Education===
The Peace Mala Festival of Inter-Faith and Culture for Education was held at the award-winning, beautifully restored setting of The Monastery Manchester in Gorton on 4 October 2010.  The festival was organised by Laura Daniels, Head Teacher of Woodheys Primary School in Sale Greater Manchester, one of the first accredited schools in the UK.  Daniels came on board as an educational ambassador for Peace Mala in 2008.

The festival brought together Peace Mala with the Greater Manchester Authorities and representatives of local Faith and Peace groups to celebrate humanity, unity and diversity.  Messages of support came from the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Archbishop of Wales and the former Bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East.  Other support was shown by organisations including One World Week, The Interfaith Foundation, Spiritual England, Trafford CYPS and Redeeming Our Communities Manchester.

Many schools, cultural communities and representatives of faith communities took part. Guest of honour and main speaker was Terry Waite CBE.

===Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales===
On 10 June 2010 the founder of Peace Mala was honoured with the Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales.  This award was first introduced by the Welsh Assembly Government in 2009. The 2010 Award for Promoting Tolerance was carefully selected to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the death camps in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Evans received this honour from the First Minister Carwyn Jones AM in recognition of her work with Peace Mala and her positive stand against all forms of inequality and intolerance.

'''Peace Mala units at Primary and Secondary level included in the new Religious Education Agreed Syllabus for Trafford Education Authority UK'''

On Wednesday 9 February 2011, the founder was invited to take part in a full day of meetings with Trafford Education Authority to discuss the inclusion of Peace Mala units at primary and secondary level for the new RE Agreed Syllabus.  This proved highly successful with ideas being shared between teachers and RE advisors including Steve Illingworth (Independent Educational Consultant and Education Link Officer to Salford SACRE) and Erica Pounce, School Improvement Partner and Link Advisor for Primary Education. Pounce reported that they had worked as a Collaborative with other Greater Manchester SACREs but had also developed a distinctive local flavour, which is where the Peace Mala Units would sit as an optional unit and as an example of a compelling learning experience.
The New RE syllabus for Trafford Education Authority, including units on Peace Mala, was launched on 24 March 2011.

===International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace, Llandaff 2017===
In July 2017 the Peace Mala International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace took place at Llandaff Cathedral Wales. This major event took almost two years to organise and plan. The idea came to the founder after the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday 13 the November 2015. The founder felt urged to bring the Peace Mala community together and Llandaff Cathedral immediately sprang to mind as a venue for this. She also felt it was time to put the spotlight on the work being achieved by the children and young people in Peace Mala schools. The purpose would be to send out a message of love, friendship and peace to all people in our world. Representatives from sixteen religions, including three Christian Bishops, and supporters from across the UK and beyond attended and took part. These included dignitaries from Cardiff, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Greater Manchester and Peace Mala schools from across Wales, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The cathedral was filled to capacity and turned out to be the largest interfaith gathering for world peace that Wales had hosted.

===Apostolic Blessing for Peace Mala from Pope Francis, September 2017===
On September 21st 2017, Peace Mala celebrated the UN International Day of Peace at St Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral in Swansea Wales UK. This was thanks to the invitation of Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia and the support of the Dean, Rev. Fr. Benedict Koledoye. Seven schools attended and took part in the Peace Mala Youth Liturgy for World Peace. Peace Mala linked up with One Day one Choir, a global peace initiative which uses the harmonious power of singing together to unite people around the world on Peace Day.

Peace Mala schools that could not be present at the event sang the Peace Mala Anthem, ‘One Light’ in their school assemblies across the UK. Lee Michael Walton, composer of the anthem, drove from London and back to accompany the children’s singing on St Joseph’s Cathedral organ. When it came to the final prayer and blessing from Bishop Tom, he susprised the congregation with an Apostolic Blessing from Pope Francis,

''"His Holiness Pope Francis presents his good wishes to Pam Evans and to all those persons involved in Peace Mala and imparts to them the requested Apostolic Blessing upon their work for world peace and encourages them with his prayers."''

This message and blessing which has a seal signed by the Apostolic Nuncio, is now on the office wall of Peace Mala HQ in Swansea.

===Youth Liturgy for World Peace, St David's Church Neath 2018===
On September 21st 2018 Peace Mala will be working with St David's Church in Neath to host a Youth Liturgy for World Peace on the UN International Day of Peace. Peace Mala accredited schools and those working towards accreditation will be joined by local dignitaries and 21 representatives from eleven different faiths.

The '''Philosophical Gourmet Report''' (also known as the '''Leiter Report''' or '''PGR'''), founded by philosophy and law professor [[Brian Leiter]] and now edited by philosophy professors [[Berit Brogaard]] and Christopher Pynes, is a ranking of graduate programs in philosophy in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnpfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=%22brian+leiter%22+%22english+speaking+world%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=betnVafZB9WyyASrqIMI&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brian%20leiter%22%20%22english%20speaking%20world%22&amp;f=false|title=A Practical Guide to Electronic Resources in the Humanities|author=Ana Dubnjakovic, Patrick Tomlin|publisher=Elsevier|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/ "The Philosophical Gourmet Report 2014-15"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The "Gourmet" Report ranking was created in response to the [[Gourman Report]], and is based on a survey of philosophers who are nominated as evaluators by the Report's Advisory Board.  Its purpose is to provide guidance to prospective Ph.D students, particularly those students who intend to pursue a professional career in academic philosophy. The Report first appeared on the web in 1996; it has been distributed by [[Blackwell Publishing|Blackwell]] since 1997.

In 1989, while he was a graduate student, Leiter made a subjective list of what he believed to be the top 25 graduate philosophy programs in the United States, which came to be the PGR.&lt;ref name=chron1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Peter|title=The Man Who Ranks Philosophy Departments Now Rankles Them, Too|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=September 30, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926193400/http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|archivedate=September 26, 2014|deadurl=no|date=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The PGR was described by [[David L. Kirp]] in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' op-ed as "the bible for prospective [philosophy] graduate students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirp|first1=David|title=How Much for That Professor?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/opinion/27KIRP.html|accessdate=May 28, 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George Yancy, in ''Reframing the Practice of Philosophy: Bodies of Color, Bodies of Knowledge'' ([[SUNY Press]], 2012), opined that Philosophical Gourmet Report ranking: "is, of course, very controversial. However, as is often pointed out, there is no real alternative."&lt;ref name=reframe&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eu6BpIDzmkQC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Philosophy+gourmet+report+controversy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B3ZmVYrTIYursAX7pIDIDg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20gourmet%20report%20controversy&amp;f=false|title=Reframing the Practice of Philosophy: Bodies of Color, Bodies of Knowledge|author=George Yancy|publisher=SUNY Press|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlin Romano]], in ''America the Philosophical'' ([[Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]], 2013), referred to the PGR rankings as "often-criticized" and "biased towards mainstream analytic departments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUAc6z2uSnAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Philosophy+gourmet+report+controversy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B3ZmVYrTIYursAX7pIDIDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20gourmet%20report%20controversy&amp;f=false|title=America the Philosophical|author=[[Carlin Romano]]|publisher=
Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year= 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, 175 philosophers signed an open letter calling on Leiter to stop producing the PGR.&lt;ref name="Mangan 2002"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mangan | first=Katherine S. | title=175 Philosophy Professors Blast Ranking of Graduate Programs | website=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=2002-01-18 | url=http://chronicle.com/article/175-Philosophy-Professors/34484/ | accessdate=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2014, over 600 philosophers signed a petition to boycott the PGR. The petition was organized by some philosophers at [[University of British Columbia]] to protest what they called a "derogatory and intimidating" e-mail sent by Leiter to one of their colleagues. Leiter claimed the recipient had threatened him.&lt;ref name=chron1/&gt; 24 of the 56 members of the Advisory Board of the PGR recommended he relinquish control over the Report's management.&lt;ref name=chron1/&gt; In response, Leiter appointed [[Berit Brogaard]], a philosophy professor at the [[University of Miami]], as co-editor for the 2014 report and agreed to step down as editor of subsequent editions.&lt;ref name="chronicle.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/controversial-philosopher-will-step-down-as-editor-of-influential-rankings/87797|title=Controversial Philosopher Will Step Down as Editor of Influential Rankings|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=October 10, 2014|author=Andy Thomason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leiter subsequently appointed Christopher Pynes of [[Western Illinois University]] as co-editor of future editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5591">'''SAHANZ''' ("'''Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand'''") was founded in [[South Australia]] in 1984. It is a [[scholarly societies|scholarly society]] for the advancement of research into the [[history of architecture]], with a focus on New Zealand, Australia and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. It holds an annual conference and produces a journal, ''Fabrications''.

==Aims==
To provide standards of excellence in architectural history through the following means:
* creating communication and meeting between people active in architectural history in Australia and New Zealand;
* encouraging discussion, criticism and debate among all who are interested in the subject of architectural history;
* holding regular conventions at regional and national venues for the above purposes;
* issuing a scholarly journal;
* encouraging student participation in its activities;
* supporting the teaching of architectural history;
* supporting the processes of conservation in relation to such matters as significant structures and sites, documents and archives.

==History==
SAHANZ was established in 1984 by Professor David Saunders, at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. Throughout its history the society has promoted collegiality amongst its members, however, as Julia Gatley has written, this history has not been without its tensions, particularly between the ''empiricist historians and those with a commitment to theory.'' (Gatley, J. 'SAHANZ: the first 50 years', in ''Fabrications'' '''13''', 2, May 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;63–77.) The society is a partner organisation of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]] (USA).

==Publications==
'''SAHANZ''' produces two main publications: the ''Fabrications'' journal, and proceedings of the annual Society conference.

A listing of the conferences back to 1984 is available on the [http://www.sahanz.net/conferences/index.html society’s website].

''Fabrications'' is the refereed journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand and is available through [http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rfab20 Taylor &amp; Francis]. Established in 1989, it is devoted to scholarly publication in the field of architectural history. While one need not be a member of ''' SAHANZ ''' to publish in '' Fabrications, '' the Journal's contents reflect the wide interests of the Society's diverse membership. It particularly welcomes papers on the architectural, urban and landscape history of Australia, New Zealand, the South Pacific and South-East Asian regions, while casting its net much further afield. The journal thus publishes refereed, academic essays and book reviews (by invitation or application) that are both purely concerned with the region, and which take a wider view of international questions, or issues beyond the Society's obvious frame of reference.

Two issues are published each year: usually one is open and the other themed. The Books Received and Book Reviews sections account for new publications in architectural history concerned with [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] and [[South-East Asia]]n regions. ''Fabrications'' is indexed in the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library|Avery Index]] of Architecture Periodicals. [ISSN 1033-1867].  Listings of the contents of all back issues of ''Fabrications'' are available on the [http://www.sahanz.net/publications/backissues.html society’s website].

==Membership==
'''SAHANZ''' invites professional, academic and student members who have an interest in the field of architectural history and theory in [[Australasia]], [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific]]. Membership is renewed annually at the end of June. Members receive copies of ''Fabrications'', and discounted attendance at the annual conference of the Society. There is currently a membership of around 170, consisting primarily of academics from universities in Australia and New Zealand.

==Grants==
SAHANZ offers an annual grant in memory of the founder of the Society, David Saunders. ''The David Saunders Founders Grant'' is intended to support research by beginning researchers who are members of '''SAHANZ'''.

A '''sex columnist''' is a writer of a newspaper or magazine column about sex. Sex advice columns may take the form of essays or, more frequently, answers to questions posed by readers. Sex advice columns can usually be found in [[alt weekly]] newspapers, [[women's magazine]]s, health or [[Physical fitness|fitness]] magazines, and [[student newspapers]]. While some are written by trained sexologists, many are penned by people lacking credentials in human sexuality and relationships, yet willing to divulge their opinions or personal bedroom antics.

The television series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' protagonist [[Carrie Bradshaw]] was a sex columnist, which author [[Candace Bushnell]] modeled after herself in her original non-fiction book based on a column of the same name. The show, which first aired in 1998, is credited with the increase of sex columnists found in college campus newspapers and blogs,&lt;ref&gt;Some pertinent articles in the media:
* Patterson, Randall, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/magazine/30Chastity-t.html "Students of Virginity"], New York Times Magazine, March 30, 2008. Refers to Lena Chen's Harvard blog. "Perhaps no one at Harvard represents the hookup culture better than Lena Chen, a student sex blogger ... Chen's viewpoint, as she explained it to me, was not complicated. 'For me, being a strong woman means not being ashamed that I like to have sex,' she said. And 'to say that I have to care about every person I have sex with is an unreasonable expectation. It feels good! It feels good!'"

&lt;/ref&gt; One such columnist, Meghan Bainum,&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Ian, [http://www.kansan.com/stories/2006/sep/14/meganbainum/?print "Not a typical school girl: Former sex columnist for the University Daily Kansan talks about what she has done"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090912175319/http://www.kansan.com/stories/2006/sep/14/meganbainum/?print |date=September 12, 2009 }}, [[University Daily Kansan]], University of Kansas, Thursday, September 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Kansas]], Lawrence, placed in the 42nd annual William Randolph Hearst Foundation Journalism Awards Program (2001–2002) for her column.&lt;ref&gt;Eblen, Tom, [http://www.news.ku.edu/2001/01N/DecNews/Dec4/journalism.html "KU journalism students place in national writing competition"], KU School of Journalism News, University Relations Office, University of Kansas, December 4, 2001. "Bainum's article ''Different Strokes for Different Folks'' appeared in the Nov. 30, 2000, issue of the University Daily Kansan. She discussed the causes of sexual attraction and fetishes and society's conception of sex."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anka Radakovich]] was the first of a new breed of sex columnists for whom "every detail of the writer's psyche is splayed across the page ... confessional journalism at its most intimate". Radakovich had written for the old ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' magazine when it was a chronicle of downtown fashion and night life. After James Truman became editor-in-chief and transformed ''Details'' into a men's magazine, he offered Radakovich a column in September 1990. She became the first modern-day magazine sex columnist working for a mainstream men's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Nick, [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women-and-men-all-mouth-and-no-trousers-1575360.html "Women and Men: All mouth and no trousers"], ''The Independent'', October 1, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snopes.com''' {{IPAc-en|s|n|oʊ|p|s}}, formally known as the '''Urban Legends Reference Pages''', is one of the first online [[Fact checking|fact-checking]] websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4819108 |title=Snopes.com: Debunking Myths in Cyberspace] |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=August 27, 2005 |accessdate=August 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been termed a "well-regarded source for sorting out myths and rumors" on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/77880145/ Melissa Allison, McClatchy-Tribune News Service, “Companies Find Rumors Hard to Kill on Internet,” ‘’Herald and Review,’’ Decatur, Illinois, March 4, 2007, image 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Same article: [https://www.newspapers.com/image/359621651 "Corporations Combat Insistent Urban Legends on Internet," ''The Courier,'' Waterloo, Iowa, March 4, 2007, image 7]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been seen as a source for validating and [[Debunker|debunking]] [[urban legend]]s and similar stories in [[Culture of the United States|American popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Neil |title=American Carnival: Journalism Under Siege in an Age of New Media |publisher=University of California Press |year=2007 |p=285| quote="The most widely known resource for validating or debunking rumors, myths, hoaxes, and urban legends in popular American culture is the website run by Barbara and David P.

==History==
In 1994,&lt;ref name="tri"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/343|title=Triangulation 343 David Mikkelson, Snopes.com {{!}} TWiT.TV|website=TWiT.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; David and Barbara Mikkelson created an urban [[folklore]] web site that would become Snopes.com. Snopes was an early [[online encyclopedia]] focused on urban legends, that mainly presented search results of user discussions. The site grew to encompass a wide range of subjects and became a resource to which Internet users began submitting pictures and stories of questionable veracity. According to the Mikkelsons, Snopes antedated the [[search engine]] concept where people could go to check facts by searches.&lt;ref name="nyt100405"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/technology/05snopes.html|title=Debunkers of Fictions Sift the Net|author=[[Brian Stelter]]|date=April 4, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Mikkelson had originally adopted the username "Snopes" (the name of a family of often unpleasant people in the works of [[William Faulkner]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/info/faq.asp#snopes |title=Frequently Asked Questions |quote=What are 'snopes'? |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chron"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Bond |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |title=Web site separates fact from urban legend |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Web-site-separates-fact-from-urban-legend-2800717.php |date=September 7, 2002 |accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a username in the [[Usenet]] newsgroup alt.folklore.urban.&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQLaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48 |title=Internet Culture |chapter=Usenet Communities and the Cultural Politics of Information |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2013 |page=48 |isbn=978-1-135-20904-9 |accessdate=September 13, 2016 |quote=The two most notorious trollers in AFU, [[Ted Frank]] and snopes, are also two of the most consistent posters of serious research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seipp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seipp"&gt;{{cite news |first=Cathy |last=Seipp |authorlink=Catherine Seipp |work=[[National Review]] |title=Where Urban Legends Fall |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/seipp/seipp200407210830.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040812075515/http://www.nationalreview.com/seipp/seipp200407210830.asp |archivedate=August 12, 2004 |accessdate=February 7, 2014 |date=July 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the site had become well known enough that a [[television pilot]] called ''Snopes: Urban Legends'' was completed with American actor [[Jim Davidson (actor)|Jim Davidson]] as host. However, it did not air on major networks.&lt;ref name="Chron" /&gt; [[Chris Richmond (entrepreneur)|Christopher Richmond]] and Drew Schoentrup later became owners with Mikkelson through a partnership with the founders of a company called Proper Media.&lt;ref name="CNS_Bruno"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bruno |first1=Bianca |title=Fact-Checker Snopes’ Owners Accused of Corporate Subterfuge |url=https://www.courthousenews.com/fact-checker-snopes-owners-accused-corporate-subterfuge/ |agency=Courthouse News |publisher=CNS |date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-2014, Barbara had not written for the site "in several years"&lt;ref name="webby" /&gt; and David  hired employees to assist him from Snopes.com's message board. The Mikkelsons divorced around that time, and Barbara no longer has an ownership stake in Snopes.com.&lt;ref name="webby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madrigal_Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Madrigal |first1=Alexis C. |title=Snopes Faces an Ugly Legal Battle |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/the-ugly-dispute-threatening-snopes/534708/ |work=The Atlantic |agency=The Atlantic |date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2017, David Mikkelson terminated a brokering agreement with Proper Media, the company that provides Snopes with [[web development]], [[Web hosting service|hosting]], and [[Web advertising|advertising]] support.&lt;ref name="WaPoLegal2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farhi|first1=Paul|title=Is Snopes.com, the original Internet fact-checker, going out of business?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/is-snopescom-the-original-internet-fact-checker-going-out-of-business/2017/07/24/8a03d196-708d-11e7-8839-ec48ec4cae25_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted Proper Media to stop remitting advertising revenue and to file a lawsuit in May. In late June, Bardav—the company founded by David and Barbara Mikkelson in 2003 to own and operate snopes.com—started a [[GoFundMe]] campaign to raise money to continue operations.&lt;ref name="NYTLegal2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Victor|first1=Daniel|title=Snopes, in Heated Legal Battle, Asks Readers for Money to Survive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/business/media/snopes-crowdfunding-proper-media.html|work=The New York Times|date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They raised $500,000 in 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Snopes Meets $500K Crowdfunding Goal Amid Legal Battle |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-25/snopes-launches-online-fundraiser-amid-legal-battle |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2017-07-25 |accessdate=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in August, a judge ordered Proper Media to disburse advertising revenues to Bardav while the case was pending.&lt;ref name="WiredSnopes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dean|first1=Michelle|title=Snopes and the Search for Facts in a Post-Fact World|url=https://www.wired.com/story/snopes-and-the-search-for-facts-in-a-post-fact-world? |date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main site==
Snopes aims to debunk or confirm widely spread urban legends. The site has been referenced by news media and other sites, including [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nissen |first=Beth |url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/10/03/rec.false.rumors/index.html |title=Hear the rumor?

Out of an old Tacoma house, fact-checking site Snopes uncovers them |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/lies-lies-and-more-lies-out-of-an-old-tacoma-house-fact-checking-site-snopes-uncovers-them/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mikkelson has stressed the ''reference'' portion of the name ''Urban Legends Reference Pages'', indicating that their intention is not merely to dismiss or confirm misconceptions and rumors but to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/info/faq.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Snopes |quote=How do I know the information you've presented is accurate? |accessdate=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where appropriate, pages are generally marked "undetermined" or "unverifiable" when there is not enough evidence to either support or disprove a given claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/roundrock.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Round Rock Gangs |date=July 21, 2011 |publisher=Snopes |accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost legends==
In an attempt to demonstrate the perils of over-reliance on the internet as authority, Snopes assembled a series of fabricated urban folklore tales that it terms "The Repository of Lost Legends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/lost/lost.htm |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Lost Legends |publisher=Snopes |accessdate=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was chosen for its acronym, T.R.O.L.L., a reference to the early 1990s definition of the word ''[[internet troll|troll]]'', meaning an Internet prank, of which David Mikkelson was a prominent practitioner.&lt;ref name=Porter/&gt;

==Accuracy==
[[Jan Harold Brunvand]], a [[folklorist]] who has written a number of books on urban legends and modern folklore, considered the site so comprehensive in 2004 that he decided not to launch one of his own to similarly discuss the accuracy or various legends and rumors.&lt;ref name="Seipp"/&gt;

In 2012, [[FactCheck.org]] reviewed a sample of Snopes' responses to political rumors regarding [[George W. Bush]], [[Sarah Palin]], and [[Barack Obama]], and found them to be free from bias in all cases.&lt;ref name="FactCheck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2235277/data-center/fact-checking-the-fact-checkers--snopes-com-gets-an--a-.html |title=Fact-checking the fact-checkers: Snopes.com gets an 'A' |publisher=[[Network World]] |date=April 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]'' reported that [[About.com]]'s urban legends researcher found a "consistent effort to provide even-handed analyses" and that Snopes' cited sources and numerous reputable analyses of its content confirm its accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Carole |last=Fader |title=Fact Check: So who's checking the fact-finders? We are |url=http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2012-09-28/story/fact-check-so-whos-checking-fact-finders-we-are |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |date=September 28, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikkelson has said that the site receives more complaints of liberal bias than conservative bias, but added that the same debunking standards are applied to all political urban legends.&lt;ref name="FactCheck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2009/04/snopescom/ |title=Ask FactCheck: Snopes.com |publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] |date=April 10, 2009 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
Critics of the site have falsely asserted that it is funded by [[businessman]] and [[philanthropist]] [[George Soros]], or linked sites.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;  Snopes declared in 2016 that its revenue was derived from advertising. In 2016, it also received an award of $75,000 from the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]], an organization formed to debunk paranormal claims. In 2017, it raised approximately $700,000 from a crowd-sourced GoFundMe effort and received $100,000 from Facebook as a part of a fact-checking partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disclosures |url=https://www.snopes.com/disclosures/ |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traffic and users==
As of December 2017, Snopes.com's web traffic rank in the world stood at 3,798 with approximately 72% originating from the U.S. with web traffic declining from previous months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.similarweb.com/website/snopes.com|title=snopes.com Traffic Statistics|website=SimilarWeb|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|April 2017}}, Snopes.com's [[Alexa Internet|Alexa rating]] was 1,794. Approximately 80% of its visitors originate from within the [[United States]]. In 2017, the site attracted 20 million unique visitors in one month.&lt;ref name="Stelter_Brian"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stelter |first=Brian |title=Debunkers of Fictions Sift the Net |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/05/technology/05snopes.html |accessdate=March 19, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quantcast.com/snopes.com?country=US|title=Snopes.com Audience Insights - Quantcast|website=www.quantcast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Dunay''''' was a tall ship serving with the [[Soviet Navy]], first launched as the '''''Cristoforo Colombo''''', laid at the Castellammare yards on April 15, 1926. It was destroyed in a fire in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ac-support.europe.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/criscol.html|title=The Strange Fate of the Cristoforo Colombo|publisher=Around Naples Encyclopedia|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1925, the [[Regia Marina]] ordered two school ships to a design by General Lieutenant Francesco Rotundi of the Italian Navy Engineering Corps, inspired by the style of large late 18th century 74-cannon [[ship of the line|ships of the line]]. The first, the ''Cristoforo Colombo'', was put into service in 1928 and was used by the Italian Navy until 1943. After [[World War II]], the ship was handed over to the Soviet Union as part of the [[war reparation]]s demanded by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|1947 Paris Peace Treaty]], and was decommissioned in 1959.

The second ship was the ''[[Italian training ship Amerigo Vespucci|Amerigo Vespucci]]'', launched in 1931 and is still in service.

'''Sri M''' (born Mumtaz Ali Khan) is a living [[Yogi]] and disciple of Sri Maheshwarnath Babaji who in turn was the disciple of [[Mahavatar Babaji]]. Sri M is also known as Sri Madhukarnath ji. Sri M lives at [[Madanapalle]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;http://satsang-foundation.org/?page_id=80 Sri M&amp;nbsp;— Founder of Satsang Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; He should not be confused with M or [[Mahendranath Gupta]], a disciple of [[Ramakrishna]].

[[File:SRI M.jpg|thumb|Sri M during his "Walk of Hope" campaign in Bangalore in April,2015]]

==Childhood==
Sri M or Mumtaz Ali Khan was born on 6 November 1948 into an affluent and liberal Muslim family in [[Trivandrum]], Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;http://satsang-foundation.org/the-founder-sri-m/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sri M (2010). ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master''. Magenta Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Sri M's maternal grandmother had [[Sufi]] connections and told him many Sufi stories in his childhood. In chapter 2 of his autobiography ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master,'' Sri M describes meeting his Guru Sri Maheshwarnath Babaji, who appeared in the garden of M's home in Trivandrum. M saw a distinguished and youthful-looking stranger with matted hair standing near a jackfruit tree.  After a brief conversation, the stranger disappeared. This was a turning point in Sri M's life, who was nine years old at the time.  Sri M says of this meeting: "After the jackfruit tree incident, although outwardly I looked like any other boy of that age, my personality had undergone a profound change.  A secret life went on within, side by side with the ordinary activities of day to day existence.  The inner journey had begun and the first sign of this was that I began to meditate without even knowing the word meditation."&lt;ref&gt;Sri M (2010). ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master.'' Magenta Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this awakening, he made contact with a series of South Indian saints, including [[Bhagawan Nityananda]] of Ganeshpuri,&lt;ref&gt;Sri M (2017). ''The Journey Continues''. Magenta Press.  Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Yogi Gopala Saami, Kaladi Mastan, Swami Abhedananda, Chempazhanti Swami, Swami Tapasyananda and Mai Ma.&lt;ref&gt;http://satsang-foundation.org/the-founder-sri-m/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sri M (2010). ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master.'' Magenta Press. Chapters 4–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quest for self realisation==

According to his autobiography,&lt;ref name="SriMAutobiography"&gt;
Apprenticed to a Himalayan master: a yogi's autobiography, Sri M, 2010, Magenta Press, {{ISBN|81-910096-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri M left his home at the age of nineteen to find his master in Himalayas. After getting exhausted by the endless search, he finally met Sri Maheshwarnath Babaji—the same person he had met when he was nine—at the Vyasa Cave, beyond [[Badrinath]]. He lived with his master for three and a half years and learnt many things. According to the book, he got initiated into the [[Nath]] tradition and got awakening of his [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] fire.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140220082831/http://www.ourkarnataka.com/kannada/articles/srim.htm – Review of Sri M's autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; He, along with his master took arduous journey to Tholingmutt in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haindavakeralam.com/HKPage.aspx?PageID=13702 – Another review of Sri M's autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; His desire to meet the Grand Master&amp;nbsp;– Sri Guru ([[Mahavatar Babaji]]) was also fulfilled at NeelaKanth hill with the grace of his master.

The author claims that Mahavatar Babaji, referred as Sri Guru in this book, was his master in a previous life. Sri M's guru Maheshwarnath Babaji is said to have the power to materialize and dematerialize, and assume any form on earth and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldofindia.com/article.php?id=554 – Article about book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

After spending three years in the Himalayas as a wandering yogi with his master, Sri M was asked by his master to go back and prepare for his life mission. He returned from the Himalayas and travelled all over India, meeting many spiritual gurus such as [[Neem Karoli Baba]], [[Lakshman Joo]] and [[J. Krishnamurti]]. He also spent a considerable amount of time in the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] and the [[Krishnamurti Foundation]]. While he was associated with the Krishnamurti Foundation, he met his future wife Sunanda Sanadi, with whom he now has two grown-up children.&lt;ref&gt;''Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master'', Chapter 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He started his teaching phase some years after his Master died.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

He now heads the Satsang Foundation, which runs two schools in Andhra Pradesh: the Peepal Grove School and the Satsang Vidyalaya. The Peepal Grove School, which is a boarding school, was inaugurated by the former President of India A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in 2006. Satsang Vidyalaya is a free school meant for children in the [[Madanapalle]] area where Sri M himself lives.  He also writes in Speaking Tree, a spiritual forum run by The Times of India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speakingtree.in/srim Sri M profile in Speaking Tree&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film called ''The Modern Mystic: Sri M of Madnapalle''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultureunplugged.com/play/8173/The-Modern-Mystic--Sri-M-of-Madnapalle&amp;nbsp;– Documentary&amp;nbsp;– The Modern Mystic: Sri M of Madnapalle&lt;/ref&gt; was made by director Raja Choudhury in 2011.

In 2015, Sri M undertook a long journey on foot (padayatra) called "Walk of Hope" from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, covering 7500&amp;nbsp;kilometres. The walk began on 12 January 2015, marking the birth anniversary of the saint Swami Vivekananda, who had himself undertaken a similar journey more than a century ago.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda's travels in India (1888–1893)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} With a group of dedicated fellow travellers, Sri M walked through 11 Indian states. He considered the Walk of Hope an exercise to restore the innate spirituality of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://walkofhope.in/&lt;/ref&gt; The padayatra ended in Srinagar, Kashmir on 29 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Ajai Kumar Singh (Former DGP-IGP), former state police chief from Karnataka also walked the entire stretch from Kanyakumari to Kashmir with his wife Tara (An Ex-IAS officer). He has shared his experience here:http://www.bangaloremirror.com/bangalore/others/Age-no-bar-in-this-walk-for-a-cause/articleshow/52196286.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Sri M published the second part of his autobiography. ''The Journey Continues''&lt;ref&gt;Sri M (2017). ''The Journey Continues''. Magenta Press.&lt;/ref&gt; surpasses the earlier volume in apparently miraculous incidents (in the introduction Sri M speculates that his readers might believe he "had finally gone bonkers"); here Sri M recounts in detail many of his previous lives over a period that spans more than 2000 years, during which he (or she, since in several lives M apparently was a woman) was associated with numerous saints of India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/may/02/sri-m-travels-to-past-lives-in-search-of-human-consciousness-1600287.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''standing wheelchair''' (also known as a '''standing chair''') is [[assistive technology]], similar to a [[standing frame]], that allows a [[wheelchair]] user to raise the chair from a seated to a standing position. The standing wheelchair supports the person in a standing position and enables interaction with people and objects at eye level.

== Types and function ==
Standing wheelchairs can be either manually operated, have power-operated wheels but manual lifting mechanisms or be fully powered with, for example, hydraulic lifting mechanisms. They are used both to achieve regular mobility and to stand the person up using hydraulics or other power sources. Some standing wheelchairs may be driven from the standing position, however there is some medical concern of an increased risk of long bone fractures while driving due to the legs being under a heavy load.

== Diagnosis and users ==
Standing wheelchairs are used by people with mild to severe [[disabilities]] including: [[spinal cord injury]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[spina bifida]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[stroke]], [[rett syndrome]], [[post-polio syndrome]] and more.

'''Spinal cord injury'''&amp;nbsp;– Standing chairs are used by people with both [[paraplegia]] and [[quadriplegia]] since a variety of standing options are available to accommodate for mild to severe disabilities.

== Health benefits ==
Numerous studies have shown evidence that standing wheelchairs may provide specific health benefits. Some of these health benefits include improved circulation, urinary health, bowel function and bone density. Standing wheelchairs may also improve over all quality of life and independence among users.&lt;ref name="RSTCE-2007"/&gt;

== Documentation and funding ==
[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] may help fund some portion of a standing wheelchair, while [[Medicaid]] funding varies from state-to-state in the U.S. Many insurance companies, vocational rehabilitation organizations, and medical case managers are increasingly funding standing wheelchairs because of the long-term health and quality of life benefits that come from passive standing.

=== Effective documentation ===
Funding (government funding or insurance) for standing equipment is achievable, but usually requires medical justification and a letter of [[medical necessity]] (a detailed [[Medical prescription|prescription]]) written by a physical therapist or medical professional.

=== Funding sources ===
In the U.S. there are various funding options for purchasing [[durable medical equipment]] (DME) such as standing wheelchairs:
* Public insurance/government funding (i.e. [[Medicaid]], Waivers, etc.)
* Private insurance companies (i.e.[[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross]], [[health maintenance organization]]s (HMOs), PPOs, etc.)
* [[Worker's compensation]]
* Disability insurance
* Liability insurance (i.e. car, home, etc.)
* [[Out-of-pocket expenses|Out-of-pocket]] (cash or credit card)
* Possible payment plan through supplier
* Child’s school purchase for use at school (i.e. standing is part of child’s [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP))
* Purchase by workplace for use while on the job
* Purchase through [[VA Hospital]]
* Assistance from local groups such (i.e. Rotary clubs, Lions, etc.)
* Assistance from disability groups (i.e.  MDA, MS Society, etc.)
Most states have resources such as PAAT (Protection Advocacy for Assistive Technology) and State Technology Assistance Projects that are resources for consumers seeking funding or going through the appeals process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6585">'''Telesensory Systems, Inc. (TSI)''' (later'' TeleSensory Corporation'') was an American corporation that invented, designed, manufactured, and distributed [[Assistive technology|technological aids]] for [[blindness|blind]] and [[low vision]] persons. TSI's products helped [[visually impaired]] people work independently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9B0DE7DE1F3FF93AA15753C1A961948260|title=High-Tech Devices That Help in Seeing|date=October 29, 1987|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with computers and with ordinary printed materials.

== History ==
The [[Optacon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.G. Linvill and J.C. Bliss|title=A Direct Translation Reading Aid for the Blind|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|publisher=IEEE Press|volume=54|issue=1|pages=40–51|doi=10.1109/PROC.1966.4572|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSI's first product, was conceived by [[Electrical Engineering]] Professor [[John G. Linvill]] as a means for his blind daughter, Candy, to read ordinary print. The Optacon development, led by [[James C. Bliss]], involved dozens of engineers and scientists at [[Stanford University]] and at Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) starting in 1962. Following the successful demonstration of a functional prototype in 1969, TSI was founded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/Section.asp?SectionID=4&amp;DocumentID=4368|title=Assistive Technology Timeline|publisher=American Foundation for the Blind|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1970 in [[Palo Alto]], California, USA. TSI developed a line of products for blind people during the 1970s, and expanded into the low vision field in 1984.

TSI's products for blind people employed either tactile or auditory means of conveying information; its low vision products increased the size and contrast of [[video magnifier|printed material]] or [[screen magnifier|computer screen images]]. Some TSI products consisted of software only, but most also needed custom electronics hardware.

For thirty-five years TSI provided electronic assistive devices to visually impaired persons worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000422/042248eo.pdf|title=Library Services for the Visually Handicapped (Malaysia)|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpaindia.org/VIB%20Chapter-VII.pdf|title=Assistive Devices for the Visually Impaired|publisher=Blind Peoples Association of India|pages=208–209|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently computer technology improved and computer operating systems began to incorporate accessibility options such as speech [[screen readers]] or magnification for no cost. Having changed its name to "TeleSensory", the company shifted its focus to low visions products and stopped manufacturing blindness products in the early 1990s.

In March, 2005, TeleSensory, the former TSI, abruptly declared [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] and all its employees were escorted from the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/AFBPress/pub.asp?DocID=aw060403|title=From Optacon to Oblivion: The Telesensory Story|last=Kendrick|first=Deborah|date=July 2005|work=AFB Access World|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, 2005,  InSiPhil (S) Pte Ltd. of Singapore purchased TeleSensory's intellectual property and remaining assets and resumed production of some of the low vision products under the name and logo of TeleSensory. As of early 2010, these products are available in 50 countries.

The '''United Nations Convention against Corruption''' ('''UNCAC''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] negotiated by [[UN member states|member states]] of the {{no wrap|[[United Nations]] (UN)}} and promoted by the [[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC). It is one of several legally binding international [[anti-corruption]] agreements. UNCAC requires state parties to the treaty to implement several anti-corruption measures that focus on five main areas: prevention, law enforcement, [[international cooperation]], asset recovery, and [[technical assistance]] and information exchange.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;{{cite web|title=UNODC and Corruption|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/corruption/index.html|website=unodc.org|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNCAC's goal is to reduce various types of [[corruption]] that can occur across country borders, such as trading in influence and [[abuse of power]], as well as corruption in the [[private sector]], such as [[embezzlement]] and [[money laundering]]. Another goal of the UNCAC is to strengthen international law enforcement and judicial cooperation between countries by providing effective legal mechanisms for [[international asset recovery]]. The Conference of the States Parties to the UNCAC provides participating countries with resources and assistance to improve implementation of the obligations set forth by the Convention.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt;

==Signatures, ratifications and entry into force==

UNCAC was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 31 October 2003 by Resolution 58/4. It was opened for signature in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico, from 9–11 December 2003 and thereafter at UN headquarters in New York City. It was signed by 140 countries. As of August 2018, there are 186 parties, which includes 181 [[member states of the United Nations|UN member states]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], the [[Holy See]], the [[State of Palestine]], and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/signatories.html Signatories to the UNCAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2018, the 12 UN member states that have not [[ratification|ratified]] the convention are (asterisk indicates that the state has signed the convention):

UNCAC is the most recent of a long series of developments in which experts and politicians have recognized the far-reaching impact of corruption and economic crime that undermine the value of democracy, [[sustainable development]], and [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;The Preamble of the United Nations Convention against Corruption&lt;/ref&gt; They have also recognized the need to develop effective measures against corruption at both the domestic and international levels. International action against corruption has progressed from general consideration and declarative statements to legally binding agreements. While at the beginning of the discussion measures were focused relatively narrowly on specific crimes, above all bribery, the understanding of corruption has become broader and so have the measures against it. UNCAC's comprehensive approach and the mandatory character of many of its provisions give proof of this development. UNCAC deals with forms of corruption that had not been covered by many of the earlier international instruments, such as trading in influence, abuse of function, and various types of corruption in the private sector. A further significant development was the inclusion of a specific chapter dealing with the recovery of stolen assets, a major concern for countries that pursue the assets of former leaders and other officials accused or found to have engaged in corruption.

Other major anti-corruption conventions, such as the [[Inter-American Convention against Corruption]], the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]], and the [[African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption]], are restricted to either certain regions of the world or certain manifestations of corruption.!

==Conference of the States Parties==

Pursuant to article 63 of UNCAC, a Conference of the States Parties (CoSP) to UNCAC was established to improve the capacity of and cooperation between States Parties to achieve the objectives set forth in UNCAC, and to promote and review its implementation. UNODC acts as the secretariat to the CoSP.

At its different sessions, besides regularly calling States Parties and signatories to adapt their laws and regulations to bring them into conformity with the provisions of UNCAC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/convention_corruption/cosp/session1/V0659563e.pdf Resolutions 1/3 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session2/V0851339e.pdf 2/4 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; the CoSP has adopted resolutions and has mandated UNODC to implement them, including through the development of technical assistance projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/CAC-COSP.html Resolutions of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CoSP has established a number of subsidiary bodies to further the implementation of specific aspects of UNCAC. The Implementation Review Group,&lt;ref name="unodc.org"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/V1187058e.pdf Resolution 4/1 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the implementation review mechanism and technical assistance, the Working Group on Asset Recovery, the Working Group on Prevention,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/V1187058e.pdf Resolution 4/3 and 4/4 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as expert group meetings on international cooperation&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/V1187058e.pdf Resolution 4/2 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; meet regularly in the intersessional period.

The first session of the CoSP took place on 10–14 December 2006 at the [[Dead Sea]], Jordan. In its resolution 1/1, States Parties agreed that it was necessary to establish an appropriate and effective mechanism to assist in the review of the implementation of UNCAC. An inter-governmental working group was established to start working on the design of such a mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/V1187058e.pdf Resolution 1/1 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; Two other working groups were set up to promote coordination of activities related to technical assistance and asset recovery, respectively.

The second CoSP was held in [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]], from 28 January to 1 February 2008. As to the mechanism for the review of implementation, the States Parties decided to take into account a balanced geographical approach, to avoid any adversarial or punitive elements, to establish clear guidelines for every aspect of the mechanism and to promote universal adherence to UNCAC and the constructive collaboration in preventive measures, asset recovery, international cooperation and other areas. The CoSP also requested donors and receiving countries to strengthen coordination and enhance technical assistance for the implementation of UNCAC, and dealt with the issue of bribery of officials of public international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/CAC-COSP-session2-resolutions.html Second Session of the CoSP]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third session of the CoSP took place in Doha, Qatar, from 9 to 13 November 2009. The CoSP adopted the landmark Resolution 3/1 on the review of the implementation of UNCAC, containing the terms of reference of the Implementation Review Mechanism(IRM).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session3/V0988538e.pdf Resolution 3/1 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the establishment of the IRM, and considering that the identification of needs and the delivery of technical assistance to facilitate the successful and consistent implementation of UNCAC are at the core of the mechanism, the CoSP decided to abolish the Working Group on Technical Assistance and to fold its mandate into the work of the Implementation Review Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session3/V0988538e.pdf Resolution 3/4 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; At its third session, for the first time, the CoSP also adopted a resolution on preventive measures, in which it established the Open-Ended Intergovernmental Working Group on Prevention to further explore good practices in this field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session3/V0988538e.pdf Resolution 3/2 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; The CoSP was preceded and accompanied by numerous side events, such as the last Global Forum for Fighting Corruption and Safeguarding Integrity (in cooperation with businesses) and a Youth Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/CAC-COSP-session3.html Third Session of the CoSP]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth session of the CoSP took place in Marrakech, Morocco, from 24 to 28 October 2011. The Conference considered the progress made in the IRM and recognized the importance of addressing technical assistance needs in the Review Mechanism.&lt;ref name="unodc.org"/&gt; It also reiterated its support for the Working Groups on Asset Recovery&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/V1187058e.pdf Resolution 4/4 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; and Prevention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/V1187058e.pdf Resolution 4/3 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; and established Open-Ended Intergovernmental Expert Group Meetings on International Cooperation to advise and assist the CoSP with respect to extradition and mutual legal assistance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition to its main agenda, the CoSP hosted 19 side events, bringing together governments and different parts of society, such as the private sector, parliamentarians, anti-corruption authorities and civil society organizations.

The next sessions of the CoSP will take place in Panama in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session3/V0988538e.pdf Decision 3/1 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian Federation in 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/V1187058e.pdf Decision 4/1 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt; and Austria in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/COSP/session4/V1187058e.pdf Decision 4/2 of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures and provisions==
UNCAC covers five main areas: preventive measures, criminalization and law enforcement, international cooperation, [[asset recovery]], and technical assistance and information exchange. It includes both mandatory and non-mandatory provisions.

===General provisions (Chapter I, Articles 1–4)===
[[File:UNCAC 1.png|thumb|United Nations Convention against Corruption, 2003]]

The opening Articles of UNCAC include a statement of purpose (Article1), which covers both the promotion of integrity and accountability within each country and the support of international cooperation and technical assistance between States Parties.!
They also include definitions of critical terms used in the instrument. Some of these are similar to those used in other instruments, and in particular the [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime|United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (UNTOC), but those defining "public official", "foreign public official", and " official of a public international organization" are new and are important for determining the scope of application of UNCAC in these areas. UNCAC does not provide a definition of corruption.
In accordance with Article 2 of the [[UN Charter]], Article 4 of UNCAC provides for the protection of [[national sovereignty]] of the States Parties.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter UN Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/Publications/Convention/08-50026_E.pdf United Nations Convention against Corruption (Full text)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventive measures (Chapter II, Articles 5–14)===

UNCAC recognizes the importance of the prevention in both the public and private sectors. Chapter II includes preventive policies, such as the establishment of anti-corruption bodies and enhanced transparency in the financing of election campaigns and political parties. [[Political corruption|Anti-corruption]] bodies should implement anti-corruption policies, disseminate knowledge and must be independent, adequately resourced and have properly trained staff.

Countries that sign the convention must assure safeguards their public services are subject to safeguards that promote efficiency, transparency and recruitment based on merit. Once recruited, public servants should be bound by codes of conduct, requirements for [[financial disclosure of public servants|financial and other disclosures]], and appropriate disciplinary measures. Transparency and accountability in the management of public finances must also be promoted, and specific requirements are established for the prevention of corruption in the particularly critical areas of the public sector, such as the judiciary and public procurement. Preventing corruption also requires an effort from all members of society at large. For these reasons, UNCAC calls on countries to promote actively the involvement of civil society, and to raise public awareness of corruption and what can be done about it. The requirements made for the public sector also apply to the private sector – it too is expected to adopt transparent procedures and codes of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-gtz-highlights-of-the-uncac-2007.pdf GTZ document on highlights of the UNCAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminalization and law enforcement (Chapter III, Articles 15–44)===

Chapter III calls for parties to establish or maintain a series of specific criminal offences including not only long-established crimes such as bribery and embezzlement, but also conducts not previously criminalized in many states, such as trading in influence and other abuses of official functions. The broad range of ways in which corruption has manifested itself in different countries and the novelty of some of the offences pose serious legislative and constitutional challenges, a fact reflected in the decision of the Ad Hoc Committee to make some of the provisions either optional ("…shall consider adopting…") or subject to domestic constitutional or other fundamental requirements ("…subject to its constitution and the fundamental principles of its legal system…").&lt;ref name="UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/corruption/publications_toolkit_sep04.pdf UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718080026/http://www.unodc.org/documents/corruption/publications_toolkit_sep04.pdf |date=18 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific acts that parties must criminalize include 
*active bribery of a national, international or foreign public officials
*passive bribery of a national public official
*embezzlement of public funds
Other mandatory crimes include obstruction of justice, and the concealment, conversion or transfer of criminal proceeds (money laundering). Sanctions extend to those who participate in and may extend to those who attempt to commit corruption offences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u4.no/themes/uncac/introduction.cfm#what U4 The United Nations Convention against Corruption A Primer for Development Practitioners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719084024/http://www.u4.no/themes/uncac/introduction.cfm#what |date=19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UNCAC thus goes beyond previous instruments of this kind that request parties to criminalize only basic forms of corruption. Parties are encouraged – but not required – to criminalize, ''inter alia'', passive bribery of foreign and international public officials, trading in influence, abuse of function, illicit enrichment, private sector bribery and embezzlement, and the concealment of illicit assets.

Furthermore, parties are required to simplify rules pertaining to evidence of corrupt behavior by, inter alia, ensuring that obstacles that may arise from the application of [[bank secrecy]] laws are overcome. This is especially important, as corrupt acts are frequently very difficult to prove in court. Particularly important is also the introduction of the liability of legal persons. In the area of law enforcement, UNCAC calls for better cooperation between national and international bodies and with civil society. There is a provision for the protection of witnesses, victims, expert witnesses and whistle blowers to ensure that law enforcement is truly effective.

Russia ratified the convention in 2006, but failed to include article 20, which criminalizes "illicit enrichment." In March 2013, the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] submitted a petition with 115,000 signatures to the State Duma in favour of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/communists-get-115k-signatures-for-anti-graft-convention/477210.html Communists Get 115K Signatures for Anti-Graft Convention], ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 21 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, however, no such law was yet in effect in Russia.

===International cooperation (Chapter IV, Articles 43–49)===

Under Chapter IV of UNCAC, States Parties are obliged to assist one another in every aspect of the fight against corruption, including prevention, investigation, and the prosecution of offenders. Cooperation takes the form of extradition, mutual legal assistance, transfer of sentences persons and criminal proceedings, and law enforcement cooperation. Cooperation in civil and administrative matters is also encouraged. Based on Chapter IV, UNCAC itself can be used as a basis for extradition, mutual legal assistance and law enforcement with respect to corruption-related offences. "Dual criminality", which is a requirement that the relevant offence shall be criminalized in both the requesting and requested country, is considered fulfilled irrespective of whether the same terminology or category of offense is used in both jurisdictions. In case of a request for assistance involving non-coercive measures, States Parties are required to provide assistance even when dual criminality is absent subject only to the basic concepts of their legal systems. Chapter IV also contains other innovative provisions designed to facilitate international cooperation. For example, States Parties that use UNCAC as a basis for extradition shall not consider corruption-related offences as political ones; assistance can also be provided in relation to offences for which legal persons can be held responsible; and bank secrecy cannot be cited as a ground to refuse a request for assistance. In order to ensure speedy and efficient cooperation, each State Party is required to designate a central authority responsible for receiving MLA requests. Overall, Chapter IV provides a broad and flexible platform for international cooperation. However, its provisions do not exhaust all international cooperation issues covered by UNCAC, thus the purposes of UNCAC and provisions of other chapters also need to be taken into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/convention-highlights.html Highlights of the UN Convention against Corruption]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asset recovery (Chapter V, Articles 51–59)===
{{Main|International asset recovery}}

The agreement on asset recovery is considered a major breakthrough and many observers claim that it is one of the reasons why so many developing countries have signed UNCAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u4.no/themes/uncac/introduction.cfm#what/ U4 Introduction to the UN Convention against Corruption] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719084024/http://www.u4.no/themes/uncac/introduction.cfm#what/ |date=19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asset recovery is indeed a very important issue for many developing countries where high-level corruption has plundered the national wealth. Reaching an agreement on this Chapter involved intensive negotiations, as the legitimate interests of countries wishing to recover illicit assets had to be reconciled with the legal and procedural safeguards of the countries from which assistance will be sought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-gtz-asset-recovery-2007.pdf GTZ article on Asset Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, in the course of the negotiations, countries seeking to recover assets sought to establish presumptions that would make clear their ownership of the assets and give priority for return over other means of disposal. Countries from which the return was likely to be sought, on the other hand, had concerns about the language that might have compromised basic human rights and procedural protections associated with criminal liability and the freezing, seizure, forfeiture and return of such assets.

Chapter V of UNCAC establishes asset recovery as a "fundamental principle" of the Convention. The provisions on asset recovery lay a framework, in both civil and criminal law, for tracing, freezing, forfeiting and returning funds obtained through corrupt activities. The requesting state will in most cases receive the recovered funds as long as it can prove ownership. In some cases, the funds may be returned directly to individual victims.

If no other arrangement is in place, States Parties may use the Convention itself as a legal basis. Article 54(1)(a) of UNCAC provides that: "Each State Party (shall)... take such measures as may be necessary to permit its competent authorities to give effect to an order of confiscation issued by a court of another state party" Indeed, Article 54(2)(a) of UNCAC also provides for the provisional freezing or seizing of property where there are sufficient grounds for taking such actions in advance of a formal request being received.&lt;ref&gt;Asset recovery&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing that recovering assets once transferred and concealed is an exceedingly costly, complex and an all-too-often unsuccessful process, this Chapter also incorporates elements intended to prevent illicit transfers and generate records that can be used where illicit transfers eventually have to be traced, frozen, seized and confiscated (Article 52). The identification of experts who can assist developing countries in this process is also included as a form of technical assistance (Article 60(5)).

===Technical assistance and information exchange (Chapter VI, Articles 60–62)===

Chapter VI of UNCAC is dedicated to technical assistance, meaning support offered to developing and transition countries in the implementation of UNCAC. The provisions cover training, material and human resources, research, and information sharing. UNCAC also calls for cooperation through international and regional organizations (many of which already have established anti-corruption programmes), research efforts, and the contribution of financial resources both directly to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and to the UNODC.

===Mechanisms for implementation (Chapter VII, Articles 63–64)===

Chapter VII deals with international implementation through the CoSP and the UN Secretariat.

===Final provisions (Chapter VIII, Articles 65 – 71)===

The final provisions are similar to those found in other UN treaties. Key provisions ensure that UNCAC requirements are to be interpreted as minimum standards, which States Parties are free to exceed with measures "more strict or severe" than those set out in specific provisions; and the two Articles governing signature, ratification and the coming into force of the Convention.&lt;ref name="UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit"/&gt;

==Implementation of the UNCAC and monitoring mechanism==

In accordance with Article 63(7) of UNCAC, "the Conference shall establish, if it deems necessary, any appropriate mechanism or body to assist in the effective implementation of the Convention".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/CAC-COSP-session1-resolutions.html&lt;/ref&gt; At its first session, the CoSP established an open-ended intergovernmental expert group to make recommendations to the Conference on the appropriate mechanism. A voluntary "Pilot Review Programme", which was limited in scope, was initiated to offer adequate opportunity to test possible methods to review the implementation of UNCAC, with the overall objective to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of the tested mechanism(s) and to provide to the CoSP information on lessons learnt and experience acquired, thus enabling the CoSP to make informed decisions on the establishment of an appropriate mechanism for reviewing the implementation of UNCAC. 
The CoSP at its third session, held in Doha in November 2009, adopted Resolution 3/1 on the review of the implementation of the Convention, containing the terms of reference of  an Implementation Review Mechanism (IRM). It established a review mechanism aimed at assisting countries to meet the objectives of UNCAC through a peer review process. The IRM is intended to further enhance the potential of the UNCAC, by providing the means for countries to assess  their level of implementation through the use of a comprehensive self-assessment checklist, the identification of potential gaps and the development of action plans to strengthen the implementation of UNCAC domestically. UNODC serves as the secretariat to the review mechanism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The Terms of Reference of the IRM specify that each review phase is composed of two review cycles of five years. The first review cycle covers chapters III (criminalization and law enforcement) and IV (international cooperation) of UNCAC. The second review cycle, which will start in 2015, covers chapters II (preventive measures) and V (asset recovery). All States parties must undergo the review within each cycle. The selection of the reviewing States parties is carried out by drawing of lots. Each State party is reviewed by two other States parties, with the active involvement of the State Party under review. At least one of the reviewing States is from the regional group of the State party under review.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

An initial desk review is based on the responses of each State to the IT-based comprehensive self-assessment checklist. States parties under review are encouraged to conduct broad consultations including all relevant stakeholders when preparing their responses. Active dialogue between the country under review and the reviewers is a key component of the process. Country visits or joint meetings are held when agreed by the State party under review. A country review report is prepared and agreed to by the country under review and may be made public. The executive summary of this report is an official document of the United Nations.
  
As of 4 October 2012, 157 countries are involved in the Review Mechanism either as countries under review or as reviewing countries.

==UNCAC Coalition of Civil Society Organisations==

The [http://www.uncaccoalition.org UNCAC Coalition], established in 2006, is a network of some 310 civil society organizations (CSOs) in over 100 countries, committed to promoting the ratification, implementation and monitoring of UNCAC. It aims to mobilize broad civil society support for UNCAC and to facilitate strong civil society action at national, regional and international levels in support of UNCAC. The Coalition is open to all organizations and individuals committed to these goals. The breadth of UNCAC means that its framework is relevant for a wide range of CSOs, including groups working in the areas of human rights, labour rights, governance, economic development, environment and private sector accountability.

==Challenges==

Ratification of UNCAC, while essential, is only the first step. Fully implementing its provisions presents significant challenges for the international community as well as individual States parties, particularly in relation to the innovative areas of UNCAC. For this reason, countries have often needed policy guidance and technical assistance to ensure the effective implementation of UNCAC. The results of the first years of IRM have shown that many developing countries have identified technical assistance needs. The provision of technical assistance, as foreseen in UNCAC, is crucial to ensure the full and effective incorporation of the provisions of UNCAC into domestic legal systems and, above all, into the reality of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/country-profile/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea behind the series was to present a variety of lectures, across various topics to the people. In the later half of 19th century newspapers were primitive and live lectures were the most effective medium for knowledge transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Vasant Vyakhyanmala’ (Spring Lecture Series) – A Great 140 Year Tradition|url=https://aparanjape.wordpress.com/2014/04/20/vasant-vyakhyanmala-spring-lecture-series-a-great-140-year-tradition/|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects from diverse fields like cultural, social,science, health, literature, finance, law, education, youth and history are covered in the lecture series usually organized at [[Tilak Smarak Ranga Mandir|Tilak Smarak Mandir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vasant Vyakhyanmala to start from April 21|url=http://www.sakaaltimes.com/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=4714231410731082713&amp;SectionId=5171561142064258099&amp;SectionName=Pune&amp;NewsDate=20110419&amp;NewsTitle=Vasant%20Vyakhyanmala%20to%20start%20from%20April%2021|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=sakaltimes|issue=Tuesday, 19 April 2011|publisher=sakal news papers|date=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the Vasant Vyankhyanmala was held at Hirabag and Belbag.

A '''victory lap''' is a term used in American and Canadian [[academics]] to describe one or more extra years of study needed beyond the traditional four years of [[undergraduate]] studies. These added years are generally the result of switching midstream to a different major or program. In certain cases such as [[engineering]] and [[teaching]] and [[life science]] [[Bachelor's degree|degrees]], the victory lap is instead attributed to increased course load and stress.

Other slang terms used to represent this same idea include "jewel degree", "5th year senior", "5th year scum", "super senior", and "Van Wilder" (in reference to the 2002 film ''[[National Lampoon's Van Wilder]]'').

The term may also be used to refer to additional years in [[high school]], particularly in [[Ontario]] after the elimination of [[Ontario Academic Credit]] (Grade 13). Patrick Brady and Philip Allingham of [[Lakehead University]], has argued that the provincial government's attempt to bring Ontario in line with the rest of the continent's 12 grades system has only been partially successful. Both have noted that the fifth year in secondary schools is still a norm in Ontario, with students in Ontario still opting to take a fifth year in secondary school, colloquially known as the victory lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://umanitoba.ca/publications/cjeap/pdf_files/brady-allingham.pdf|title=Pathways to university: The "Victory Lap" Phenomenon in Ontario|journal=Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy|last1=Brady|first1=Patrick|last2=Allingham|first2=Philip|issue=113|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007-2008 year, students over the age of 19 made up 3.7 percent of all secondary day school enrolment in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/quickfacts/2007-08/quickFacts07_08.pdf|title=Adults in Secondary Day School|work=Quick Facts Ontario Schools 2007-08|publisher=Queen’s Printer for Ontario|year=2010|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
